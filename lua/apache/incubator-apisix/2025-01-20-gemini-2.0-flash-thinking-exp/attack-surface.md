# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/incubator-apisix

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated or Weakly Authenticated Admin API Access](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_or_weakly_authenticated_admin_api_access.md)

**Description:** The Admin API, responsible for configuring and managing APISIX, is accessible without proper authentication or with easily compromised credentials.
*   **How Incubator-APISIX Contributes:** APISIX's design includes an Admin API for dynamic configuration. The presence of this API, and the potential for weak default settings or misconfigurations in its authentication mechanisms, directly creates this attack surface.
*   **Example:** An attacker discovers the Admin API is exposed on a public IP with the default API key. They use this key to create a route that redirects all traffic to a malicious server.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the APISIX instance, allowing attackers to control routing, inject malicious code via plugins, access backend services, and potentially disrupt service availability.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Authentication:** Implement robust authentication mechanisms for the Admin API, such as mutual TLS (mTLS) or strong API keys that are regularly rotated.
    *   **Restrict Access:** Limit access to the Admin API to trusted networks or specific IP addresses. Avoid exposing it directly to the public internet.
    *   **Disable Default Credentials:** Immediately change or disable any default API keys or passwords.
    *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement RBAC to limit the actions different users or services can perform on the Admin API.

## Attack Surface: [Injection Vulnerabilities in Plugin Configurations](./attack_surfaces/injection_vulnerabilities_in_plugin_configurations.md)

**Description:** Attackers can inject malicious code (e.g., Lua code) into plugin configurations through the Admin API, which is then executed by APISIX.
*   **How Incubator-APISIX Contributes:** APISIX's core functionality of dynamic plugin configuration, particularly the ability to execute Lua code within plugins, introduces this attack surface if input validation is insufficient in the Admin API.
*   **Example:** An attacker injects malicious Lua code into the `body_filter` plugin configuration. When a request passes through this route, the injected code executes, potentially allowing the attacker to exfiltrate data or execute commands on the APISIX server.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the APISIX server, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or further lateral movement within the network.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization for all data accepted by the Admin API, especially for plugin configurations.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Plugins:** Design and configure plugins with the minimum necessary permissions.
    *   **Secure Coding Practices for Plugin Development:** If developing custom plugins, follow secure coding practices to prevent injection vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Community or Third-Party Plugins](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_community_or_third-party_plugins.md)

**Description:** Security flaws exist within plugins developed by the community or third-party vendors that are integrated into APISIX.
*   **How Incubator-APISIX Contributes:** APISIX's plugin architecture, while providing extensibility, inherently relies on the security of external components. The ease of integrating plugins directly contributes to this attack surface.
*   **Example:** A community-developed authentication plugin has a vulnerability that allows attackers to bypass the authentication mechanism and access protected backend services.
*   **Impact:**  Depends on the vulnerability, but can range from authentication bypass and data breaches to remote code execution if the plugin has sufficient privileges.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the plugin and vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Thorough Plugin Vetting:** Carefully evaluate the security of plugins before deploying them. Review the code, look for known vulnerabilities, and consider the plugin's maintainership and community support.
    *   **Keep Plugins Updated:** Regularly update plugins to the latest versions to patch known security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Plugin Security Policy:** Implement a policy for managing and approving plugin installations.
    *   **Restrict Plugin Installation:** Limit the ability to install plugins to authorized personnel.

## Attack Surface: [Request Smuggling/Splitting via Proxying](./attack_surfaces/request_smugglingsplitting_via_proxying.md)

**Description:** Attackers can manipulate HTTP requests in a way that APISIX interprets them differently than backend servers, allowing them to inject additional requests or bypass security controls.
*   **How Incubator-APISIX Contributes:** As a core function, APISIX proxies requests. The way APISIX parses and forwards these requests, and potential discrepancies with backend server parsing, directly creates the opportunity for smuggling/splitting attacks.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request that APISIX interprets as two separate requests, while the backend server sees only one. This can be used to bypass authentication or authorization checks on the second, smuggled request.
*   **Impact:** Bypassing security controls on backend servers, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or other malicious actions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict HTTP Compliance:** Ensure APISIX adheres strictly to HTTP specifications and avoids ambiguous parsing.
    *   **Normalize Requests:** Implement request normalization techniques to ensure consistent interpretation between APISIX and backend servers.
    *   **Use HTTP/2 Where Possible:** HTTP/2 has built-in mechanisms that make request smuggling more difficult.
