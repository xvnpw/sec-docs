# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for apache/incubator-apisix

## Mitigation Strategy: [Plugin Security Audits and Reviews](./mitigation_strategies/plugin_security_audits_and_reviews.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Inventory Plugins within APISIX:** Use APISIX Admin API or configuration files to list all plugins currently enabled in APISIX routes and services. Document their purpose and origin (official, third-party, custom).
    2.  **Regular Review Schedule for APISIX Plugins:** Establish a recurring schedule (e.g., monthly, quarterly) to review the plugin inventory *within APISIX*.
    3.  **Purpose Validation in APISIX Configuration:** For each plugin *configured in APISIX*, re-evaluate if it is still necessary for current API gateway functionality. Disable or remove plugins from APISIX configuration that are no longer required.
    4.  **Origin and Trust Assessment of APISIX Plugins:** For each plugin *used in APISIX*, especially third-party or custom ones, reassess its source and trustworthiness. Investigate for known vulnerabilities or security concerns related to these plugins within the APISIX ecosystem.
    5.  **Code Review (Custom APISIX Plugins):** If using custom-developed plugins *deployed in APISIX*, conduct thorough code reviews focusing on security best practices and potential vulnerabilities relevant to APISIX plugin development (e.g., access control bypass, insecure data handling within the plugin context).
    6.  **Documentation Review of APISIX Plugins:** Review the documentation for each plugin *used in APISIX* to understand its functionality, configuration options within APISIX, and any security considerations mentioned by the plugin authors specifically related to APISIX usage.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Plugin Injection into APISIX (High Severity):**  An attacker could potentially inject a malicious plugin into the APISIX configuration to gain unauthorized access, exfiltrate data, or disrupt services *via the API Gateway*.
    *   **Vulnerable Plugin Exploitation in APISIX (High Severity):**  Outdated or poorly written plugins *within APISIX* may contain vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit to compromise APISIX or backend services *through the gateway*.
    *   **Unnecessary Plugin Overhead in APISIX (Low Severity):**  Unnecessary plugins *in APISIX* can increase resource consumption of the gateway and potentially introduce unintended attack surface *on the gateway*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Malicious Plugin Injection: High Risk Reduction - Regular audits of APISIX plugins significantly reduce the chance of unnoticed malicious plugins *affecting the gateway*.
    *   Vulnerable Plugin Exploitation: High Risk Reduction - Proactive reviews and updates of APISIX plugins minimize the window of vulnerability for plugins *within the gateway*.
    *   Unnecessary Plugin Overhead: Low Risk Reduction - Primarily improves APISIX gateway performance and reduces minor attack surface *of the gateway*.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Plugin inventory list is maintained in a Confluence document.
    *   Initial plugin review was conducted during APISIX setup.
    *   Implemented in: `Confluence Documentation`, initial setup process.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No recurring schedule for plugin reviews *specifically for APISIX* is formally established.
    *   Automated tools for plugin vulnerability scanning *relevant to APISIX plugins* are not in place.
    *   Missing in: `Security Policy Documentation`, automated security pipeline.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Admin API Access Control with mTLS in APISIX](./mitigation_strategies/secure_admin_api_access_control_with_mtls_in_apisix.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Generate Certificates for APISIX Admin API:** Create a Certificate Authority (CA) and generate server and client certificates specifically for securing the APISIX Admin API. The server certificate will be used by APISIX Admin API, and client certificates will be issued to authorized administrators/systems needing to manage APISIX.
    2.  **Configure APISIX for mTLS on Admin API:**  Modify the APISIX configuration *of APISIX* to enable mutual TLS (mTLS) for the Admin API listener. Specify the path to the server certificate and private key, and the CA certificate to verify client certificates *within APISIX configuration*.
    3.  **Distribute Client Certificates Securely for APISIX Admin Access:**  Distribute client certificates only to authorized administrators or automated systems that require access to the APISIX Admin API. Use secure channels for distribution *for APISIX admin credentials*.
    4.  **Client-Side Configuration for APISIX Admin API:** Configure clients (e.g., `curl`, `apisix-cli`) to use the provided client certificate and key when accessing the APISIX Admin API.
    5.  **Regular Certificate Rotation for APISIX Admin API:** Implement a process for regular rotation of both server and client certificates used for APISIX Admin API access to limit the validity period of compromised certificates *related to APISIX admin access*.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized APISIX Admin API Access (High Severity):**  Without strong authentication, attackers could potentially gain access to the APISIX Admin API and reconfigure APISIX, leading to complete API Gateway compromise.
    *   **Credential Theft/Replay for APISIX Admin API (High Severity):**  If using only API keys or basic authentication for APISIX Admin API, stolen credentials could be replayed to gain unauthorized Admin API access *to APISIX*.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on APISIX Admin API (Medium Severity):**  Without encryption and mutual authentication, communication with the APISIX Admin API could be intercepted and manipulated.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized APISIX Admin API Access: High Risk Reduction - mTLS provides strong mutual authentication for APISIX Admin API, making unauthorized access extremely difficult.
    *   Credential Theft/Replay: High Risk Reduction - Client certificates for APISIX Admin API are harder to steal and replay compared to simple API keys.
    *   Man-in-the-Middle Attacks: High Risk Reduction - mTLS encrypts the communication channel to APISIX Admin API and verifies both server and client identities.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   API Key authentication is enabled for Admin API.
    *   Admin API is restricted to the internal management network via firewall rules.
    *   Implemented in: `apisix/conf/config.yaml`, `infrastructure/firewall.conf`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   mTLS for Admin API authentication *in APISIX* is not yet configured.
    *   Certificate generation and distribution process *for APISIX Admin API* is not yet automated.
    *   Missing in: `apisix/conf/config.yaml`, `infrastructure/certificate-management.sh` (example script).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation at the APISIX Gateway using `validate-request` Plugin](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_at_the_apisix_gateway_using__validate-request__plugin.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify API Input Points in APISIX Routes:** Analyze your API routes *configured in APISIX* and identify all input points (query parameters, headers, request body) that are passed to upstream services *through APISIX*.
    2.  **Define Validation Schemas for APISIX Routes:** For each input point *in APISIX routes*, define validation schemas (e.g., using JSON Schema or OpenAPI specifications) that specify the expected data type, format, allowed values, and constraints *to be enforced by APISIX*.
    3.  **Configure `validate-request` Plugin in APISIX:**  Enable the `validate-request` plugin on relevant routes *in APISIX configuration*. Configure the plugin with the defined validation schemas for each input point *within APISIX plugin configuration*.
    4.  **Error Handling in APISIX for Validation Failures:** Configure how APISIX should handle validation failures. Typically, this involves returning a 400 Bad Request error to the client with details about the validation errors *generated by APISIX*.
    5.  **Regular Schema Updates for APISIX Routes:**  Maintain and update validation schemas *used by APISIX* as your API evolves and input requirements change. Ensure schemas are consistent with upstream service expectations *and enforced by APISIX*.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Injection Attacks (SQL Injection, Command Injection, etc.) (High Severity):**  Improperly validated input *passing through APISIX* can be exploited to inject malicious code into backend systems.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Medium Severity):**  Input validation *at the APISIX gateway* can help prevent stored XSS by sanitizing or rejecting malicious input before it reaches backend storage.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):**  Malformed or excessively large input *reaching APISIX* can be used to overload backend systems. Input validation *in APISIX* can limit the size and complexity of requests.
    *   **Business Logic Bypass (Medium Severity):**  Input validation *at the APISIX gateway* can enforce business rules and prevent clients from sending invalid or unexpected data that could bypass intended logic.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Injection Attacks: High Risk Reduction -  Strong input validation at the APISIX gateway significantly reduces the attack surface for injection vulnerabilities *exploiting the gateway*.
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Moderate Risk Reduction - Reduces the risk of stored XSS *via the gateway*, but output encoding is still crucial in backend applications.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): Moderate Risk Reduction - Helps mitigate some DoS attacks related to malformed input *reaching the gateway*, but dedicated DoS protection is still needed.
    *   Business Logic Bypass: Moderate Risk Reduction - Enforces data integrity and helps prevent unintended application behavior *at the gateway level*.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic input validation is implemented in some upstream services.
    *   Rate limiting is configured on some routes in APISIX.
    *   Implemented in: `upstream application code`, `apisix/conf/routes.yaml` (rate limiting).
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `validate-request` plugin is not yet implemented in APISIX.
    *   Validation schemas are not defined for API routes *in APISIX*.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Detailed Logging in APISIX:** Configure APISIX to enable comprehensive logging, including access logs (request details, status codes), error logs (plugin errors, internal errors), and plugin-specific logs (e.g., authentication plugin logs) *generated by APISIX*.
    2.  **Choose Log Format in APISIX:** Select a structured log format (e.g., JSON) for easier parsing and analysis by SIEM systems *from APISIX logs*.
    3.  **Secure Log Forwarding from APISIX to SIEM:** Configure APISIX to send logs to a secure and centralized log management system or SIEM. Ensure secure transmission (e.g., TLS encryption) and storage of logs *from APISIX*.
    4.  **SIEM Rule Configuration for APISIX Logs:** Configure SIEM rules and alerts to detect suspicious patterns and security events in APISIX logs. Examples include:
        *   Excessive 4xx or 5xx errors from specific IPs *observed by APISIX*.
        *   Repeated authentication failures *logged by APISIX authentication plugins*.
        *   Unusual traffic patterns or request methods *detected by APISIX*.
        *   Configuration changes in APISIX Admin API logs.
    5.  **Regular Log Review and Analysis of APISIX Logs:** Establish a process for security teams to regularly review and analyze APISIX logs in the SIEM to identify and respond to security incidents *related to the API Gateway*.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Delayed Incident Detection (High Severity):** Without proper logging *from APISIX* and monitoring, security incidents *affecting the API Gateway* can go undetected for extended periods.
    *   **Insufficient Forensic Information (Medium Severity):**  Lack of detailed logs *from APISIX* hinders incident investigation and root cause analysis *related to the API Gateway*.
    *   **Compliance Violations (Medium Severity):**  Many compliance regulations require comprehensive logging and security monitoring *of API Gateways like APISIX*.
