## Attack Tree Path: [1. Physical Access Branch:](./attack_tree_paths/1__physical_access_branch.md)

   *   **JTAG/SWD Exploit [CN]:**
        *   **Description:** Exploiting the Joint Test Action Group (JTAG) or Serial Wire Debug (SWD) interface to gain low-level access to the device's hardware.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (If physically accessible and JTAG/SWD is not disabled)
        *   **Impact:** Very High (Complete device compromise)
        *   **Effort:** Low (Requires physical access and readily available tools)
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (Requires understanding of JTAG/SWD)
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (Unless physical tamper detection is in place)
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Disable JTAG/SWD in production builds.
            *   Use a secure bootloader (if available/feasible).
            *   Physically secure the device.

   *   **Direct Memory Access/Dump [HR]:**
        *   **Description:** Using JTAG/SWD or other physical methods to directly read the contents of flash memory or RAM.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Dependent on JTAG/SWD exploit or other physical access)
        *   **Impact:** High (Data exfiltration, potential for reverse engineering)
        *   **Effort:** Low (Once access is gained, dumping memory is relatively easy)
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (Requires understanding of memory organization)
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard (No real-time detection possible without specialized hardware)
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Encrypt sensitive data stored in flash.
            *   Minimize the amount of sensitive data stored on the device.
            *   Implement tamper detection mechanisms.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Network-Based Attack Branch:](./attack_tree_paths/2__network-based_attack_branch.md)

   *   **WiFi Attacks - Weak/Default Credentials [HR]:**
        *   **Description:** Exploiting weak or default Wi-Fi credentials (SSID and password) to gain access to the device's network.
        *   **Likelihood:** High (Very common in default configurations)
        *   **Impact:** High (Allows network access, potential for further attacks)
        *   **Effort:** Very Low (Simple password guessing or using default credentials)
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Failed login attempts might be logged, but not always)
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Enforce strong, unique passwords.
            *   Provide a secure and user-friendly way for users to configure Wi-Fi credentials.
            *   Consider WPA2/3 Enterprise with certificate-based authentication.

   *   **WiFi Attacks - Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) [CN]:**
        *   **Description:** Intercepting and potentially modifying network traffic between the NodeMCU device and its communication partner.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (Requires compromising the network or using ARP spoofing)
        *   **Impact:** Very High (Can intercept and modify all traffic)
        *   **Effort:** Medium (Requires more sophisticated network attack techniques)
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (Without proper certificate validation, it's very difficult to detect)
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Use HTTPS with proper certificate validation.
            *   Implement certificate pinning.

   *   **Over-the-Air (OTA) Update [CN]:**
        * **Description:** The mechanism for updating the firmware wirelessly. This is a critical node because it's the entry point for malicious firmware.
        * **Likelihood:** N/A (This is a feature, not an attack itself)
        * **Impact:** N/A
        * **Effort:** N/A
        * **Skill Level:** N/A
        * **Detection Difficulty:** N/A
        * **Mitigation:** (See below, under "Unsigned/Malicious Firmware Update")

   *   **Over-the-Air (OTA) Update - Unsigned/Malicious Firmware Update [HR]:**
        *   **Description:** Pushing a malicious firmware update to the device via the OTA mechanism.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (If OTA is enabled and not secured)
        *   **Impact:** Very High (Complete device compromise)
        *   **Effort:** Medium (Requires crafting a malicious firmware image and gaining access to the update mechanism)
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (Unless the device has integrity checks for firmware)
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Digitally sign firmware updates.
            *   Use a secure update server.
            *   Implement a rollback mechanism.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Firmware-Based Attack Branch:](./attack_tree_paths/3__firmware-based_attack_branch.md)

    *   **Lua Scripting Vulnerabilities - Injection [HR]:**
        *   **Description:** Injecting malicious Lua code into the device through vulnerable input fields or parameters.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (Depends on how user input is handled)
        *   **Impact:** High (Can lead to arbitrary code execution)
        *   **Effort:** Medium (Requires finding an injection point and crafting a payload)
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (Requires input validation and monitoring for unusual behavior)
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Sanitize all user inputs.
            *   Limit the capabilities of Lua scripts (sandboxing).
            *   Regularly update the NodeMCU firmware.
            *   Avoid `loadstring` or `dofile` with untrusted input.
