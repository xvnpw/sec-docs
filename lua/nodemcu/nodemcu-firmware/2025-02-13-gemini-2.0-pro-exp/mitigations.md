## Mitigation Strategy: [Careful Resource Management in Lua Scripts](./mitigation_strategies/careful_resource_management_in_lua_scripts.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Careful Resource Management in Lua Scripts

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Analyze Existing Code:** Review all Lua scripts for potential resource leaks. Look for global variables that are no longer needed, large data structures held in memory unnecessarily, and inefficient loops or recursive functions.
        2.  **Localize Variables:**  Declare variables using the `local` keyword whenever possible. This limits their scope and allows the garbage collector to reclaim memory when the variable is no longer in use.  Avoid using global variables unless absolutely necessary.
        3.  **Optimize Data Structures:**  Choose the most efficient data structures for your needs.  For example, if you only need to store a set of unique values, use a table with keys as the values and `true` as the corresponding value (a Lua set implementation). Avoid large, nested tables if a simpler structure will suffice.
        4.  **Optimize Loops:**  Avoid unnecessary calculations or function calls within loops.  Pre-calculate values outside the loop if possible.  Use `ipairs` for iterating over arrays and `pairs` for iterating over dictionaries, as these are generally more efficient than custom loop implementations.
        5.  **Manage String Concatenation:**  Repeated string concatenation using the `..` operator can be inefficient.  If you need to build a large string, consider using `table.concat` or building a table of string fragments and then joining them.
        6.  **Strategic Garbage Collection:**  Use `collectgarbage("count")` to monitor memory usage.  Call `collectgarbage("collect")` periodically to force garbage collection, but be mindful of the performance impact.  Experiment to find the right balance between memory usage and performance.  Don't call it excessively.
        7.  **Timeouts:** Implement timeouts for network operations (e.g., `socket:settimeout()`) and other potentially blocking functions. This prevents a single unresponsive operation from halting the entire system.
        8.  **Coroutines (Optional):** For complex, long-running tasks, consider using coroutines (`coroutine.create`, `coroutine.resume`, `coroutine.yield`) to avoid blocking the main thread. This allows you to perform tasks in a non-blocking manner.
        9. **Offload Processing (Optional):** If computationally intensive tasks are required, and you *can* structure the communication, consider sending data to a more powerful server and receiving results, reducing the NodeMCU's workload. This still involves NodeMCU code for communication.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) due to Resource Exhaustion:** (Severity: High) - Prevents the device from becoming unresponsive due to excessive memory or CPU usage.
        *   **Application Crashes:** (Severity: Medium) - Reduces the likelihood of crashes caused by memory leaks or inefficient code.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **DoS:** Significantly reduces the risk of DoS attacks by preventing resource exhaustion. (Risk Reduction: High)
        *   **Application Crashes:** Reduces the frequency of crashes, improving application stability. (Risk Reduction: Medium)

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Basic local variable usage is likely present in most scripts.
        *   Some timeout implementations might exist for network operations.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Comprehensive code review and optimization for resource usage are likely missing.
        *   Strategic garbage collection is often overlooked.
        *   Coroutine usage for non-blocking operations is probably not implemented.
        *   Offloading of heavy processing (even the communication part) is likely not considered.
        *   Consistent use of timeouts across all potentially blocking operations may be lacking.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Rate Limiting (within NodeMCU)](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_rate_limiting__within_nodemcu_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Input Validation and Rate Limiting (within NodeMCU)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Identify Input Sources:** Within your NodeMCU Lua scripts, determine all sources of external input.  This includes data received via `net.socket`, `http.request`, `mqtt.client`, serial input, or any custom modules.
        2.  **Define Input Schemas:** For each input source *within the Lua code*, define a schema or set of rules.  Specify expected data types, formats, lengths, and allowed values.
        3.  **Implement Validation (Lua):**  Before processing any input *within your Lua scripts*, validate it against the defined schema.  Reject non-conforming input immediately. Use whitelisting.
        4.  **Size Limits (Lua):** Enforce strict size limits on all input data *within the Lua code*. Reject oversized input.
        5.  **Rate Limiting (Lua):**  Implement rate limiting *within your Lua scripts*. Track the number of requests/messages from each source (IP address, if available, or other identifier). Limit requests within a time window. This is done *entirely within the NodeMCU firmware*.
        6.  **Watchdog Timer (NodeMCU):** Use the NodeMCU's `tmr.wdclr()` function within a timer to implement a watchdog.  This resets the device if the Lua code hangs, providing a last line of defense.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) due to Network Flooding:** (Severity: High) - Prevents the device from being overwhelmed by network traffic, *as handled by the Lua code*.
        *   **Injection Attacks (e.g., Command Injection):** (Severity: High) - Prevents injection of malicious code through input fields *processed by the Lua code*.
        *   **Buffer Overflow Attacks:** (Severity: High) - Prevents buffer overflows by limiting input size *within the Lua code*.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **DoS:** Reduces the risk of network-based DoS attacks, *as mitigated by the Lua code*. (Risk Reduction: High)
        *   **Injection Attacks:** Eliminates the risk of injection attacks *if implemented correctly within Lua*. (Risk Reduction: High)
        *   **Buffer Overflow:** Eliminates the risk of buffer overflows related to input handling *within the Lua code*. (Risk Reduction: High)

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Basic size checks might be present in some input handling.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Comprehensive input validation against schemas is likely missing *in the Lua code*.
        *   Lua-based rate limiting is probably not implemented.
        *   Consistent size limits across all input sources may be lacking *in the Lua code*.
        *   The watchdog timer (`tmr.wdclr()`) may not be used or configured correctly.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure File System Handling (within NodeMCU)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_file_system_handling__within_nodemcu_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Secure File System Handling (within NodeMCU)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Identify Sensitive Data:** Determine which data stored on the NodeMCU's file system (SPIFFS or LittleFS) needs protection.
        2.  **Encryption (Software):** Since ESP8266 doesn't have hardware encryption, use a lightweight, well-vetted *software* encryption library (e.g., a suitable AES implementation) within your Lua code to encrypt sensitive files *before* writing them to the file system.  For ESP32, use hardware encryption if possible, but configuration is still done via the firmware.
        3.  **Key Management (Lua):** Securely manage encryption keys *within your Lua code*.  Derive the key from a user-provided password (using a KDF like PBKDF2, implemented in Lua) or a unique device identifier.  *Never* hardcode keys directly in the Lua scripts. Consider storing a *hashed* version of the key for verification.
        4.  **File Integrity Checks (Lua):** Calculate checksums (e.g., SHA-256, implemented in Lua) of critical files and store them securely (potentially encrypted).  Periodically verify these checksums *within your Lua code* to detect tampering.
        5.  **Separate Storage (Logical):** Organize files into different directories within the NodeMCU file system.  Limit access to sensitive directories from only the necessary parts of your Lua code.
        6. **Avoid Plaintext:** Never store sensitive data in plaintext files on the NodeMCU file system.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Data Disclosure:** (Severity: High) - Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data on the file system.
        *   **Data Tampering:** (Severity: High) - Prevents modification of critical files.
        *   **Code Injection (via File Overwrite):** (Severity: High) - Prevents overwriting Lua scripts with malicious code.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Data Disclosure:** Reduces risk significantly if encryption is used (software or hardware). (Risk Reduction: High)
        *   **Data Tampering:** Reduces risk, especially with integrity checks. (Risk Reduction: Medium-High)
        *   **Code Injection:** Reduces risk. (Risk Reduction: Medium-High)

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Likely no encryption or file integrity checks.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Encryption of sensitive data is almost certainly missing.
        *   Lua-based file integrity checks are likely not implemented.
        *   Secure key management within Lua is probably not addressed.
        *   Logical separation of files may not be considered.

**Mitigation Strategy:** TLS/SSL for All Network Communication (within NodeMCU)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Identify Communication:** Determine all network communication *initiated by the NodeMCU* (HTTP, MQTT, etc.).
        2.  **Use HTTPS (Lua):** For web communication, use the `http.request` function with HTTPS URLs *within your Lua code*.
        3.  **Use MQTTS (Lua):** For MQTT, use the `mqtt.client` with MQTTS and appropriate port/settings *within your Lua code*.
        4.  **Certificate Validation (Lua):** *Crucially*, implement certificate validation *within your Lua code*. Use the NodeMCU's `tls` module (or equivalent) to load the CA certificate of the server and verify the server's certificate during the TLS handshake. This prevents MitM attacks.
        5.  **TLS Version/Ciphers (Lua):** Configure the NodeMCU (through Lua APIs, if available) to use the latest supported TLS version (ideally TLS 1.3) and strong cipher suites.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Eavesdropping:** (Severity: High) - Prevents capture of data transmitted by the NodeMCU.
