# Attack Surface Analysis for nodemcu/nodemcu-firmware

## Attack Surface: [Lua Code Injection](./attack_surfaces/lua_code_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious Lua code into the application, which is then executed by the NodeMCU Lua interpreter.
*   **NodeMCU Firmware Contribution:** NodeMCU's core functionality relies on executing Lua scripts. The firmware provides the Lua interpreter and the environment where Lua code runs.  Lack of input sanitization in Lua scripts directly leverages the firmware's execution engine to create vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** A web application running on NodeMCU takes user input for a filename and uses it directly in `dofile(user_input)`. An attacker could input `"; os.execute('rm -rf /'); --"` to execute a system command via the firmware's Lua interpreter.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the NodeMCU device, potentially leading to data theft, device takeover, denial of service, or further network compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize all user inputs and external data *within the Lua scripts* before using them in Lua scripts. Validate data types, lengths, and formats.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege in Lua:** Avoid using functions like `dofile` or `loadstring` with user-controlled input if possible *within Lua*. If necessary, restrict the execution environment and capabilities of the Lua scripts using Lua's sandboxing features (though be aware of potential limitations).
    *   **Code Review of Lua Scripts:** Regularly review Lua code for potential injection vulnerabilities. Use static analysis tools for Lua if available.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Firmware Update Process](./attack_surfaces/insecure_firmware_update_process.md)

*   **Description:** The process of updating the NodeMCU firmware itself is vulnerable, allowing attackers to inject malicious firmware.
*   **NodeMCU Firmware Contribution:** NodeMCU firmware *implements* the firmware update mechanism. Vulnerabilities in this implementation, or lack of security features within the firmware's update process, directly create this attack surface.
*   **Example:** The NodeMCU firmware update process downloads firmware over unencrypted HTTP without signature verification. An attacker performing a man-in-the-middle attack intercepts the update and replaces it with a malicious firmware image, which the NodeMCU device then accepts and flashes due to the firmware's lack of verification.
*   **Impact:** Complete device compromise. Malicious firmware can grant attackers persistent access, control all device functionalities *at the firmware level*, and potentially spread malware to connected networks.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **HTTPS for Firmware Download (Firmware Feature Request):**  Ideally, the NodeMCU firmware should be configured to use HTTPS for firmware downloads. If not currently supported, this should be a feature request to the NodeMCU project.
    *   **Firmware Signature Verification (Firmware Feature Implementation):** The NodeMCU firmware *must* implement cryptographic signature verification for firmware updates.  This is a critical firmware-level security feature. Developers should ensure this feature is enabled and properly configured if available, or advocate for its implementation in the NodeMCU project.
    *   **Secure Boot (Hardware & Firmware Dependent):** If the underlying ESP8266/ESP32 hardware and NodeMCU firmware support secure boot, enable it. This firmware-level feature ensures only signed and trusted firmware can be loaded during boot.
    *   **Avoid Downgrade Attacks (Firmware Logic):** The firmware update logic itself should prevent downgrading to older, potentially vulnerable firmware versions. This is a firmware implementation detail.

## Attack Surface: [Wi-Fi Stack Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/wi-fi_stack_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities within the Wi-Fi stack implementation *integrated into* NodeMCU firmware can be exploited to gain unauthorized network access or disrupt device operation.
*   **NodeMCU Firmware Contribution:** NodeMCU firmware *includes and utilizes* the Wi-Fi stack (often from the ESP8266/ESP32 SDK). Vulnerabilities in this integrated Wi-Fi stack are directly part of the NodeMCU firmware's attack surface.
*   **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Wi-Fi driver *within the NodeMCU firmware's Wi-Fi stack* when processing malformed Wi-Fi packets. An attacker sends crafted packets to the NodeMCU device, triggering the overflow and potentially achieving remote code execution or denial of service *due to a flaw in the firmware's Wi-Fi handling*.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized network access, man-in-the-middle attacks, denial of service, potentially remote code execution on the device *due to firmware vulnerabilities*.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the specific vulnerability within the firmware's Wi-Fi stack)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Firmware Updated:** Regularly update NodeMCU firmware to the latest stable version. Firmware updates often include security patches for known Wi-Fi stack vulnerabilities *within the firmware*.
    *   **Use Strong Wi-Fi Security:** Employ strong Wi-Fi security protocols like WPA2/WPA3-Personal or Enterprise with strong passwords/credentials. While not directly mitigating firmware vulnerabilities, this reduces the likelihood of network-level attacks that could then exploit firmware weaknesses.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate NodeMCU devices on a separate network segment (VLAN). This limits the impact of a potential Wi-Fi stack compromise *originating from the firmware* by containing it within a smaller network segment.
