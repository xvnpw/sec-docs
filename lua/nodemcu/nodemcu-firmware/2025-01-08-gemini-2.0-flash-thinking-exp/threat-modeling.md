# Threat Model Analysis for nodemcu/nodemcu-firmware

## Threat: [Known Firmware Vulnerability](./threats/known_firmware_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a publicly known vulnerability in the NodeMCU firmware itself. This could involve sending specially crafted network packets, exploiting memory corruption bugs, or leveraging flaws in specific modules within the firmware's codebase.

**Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, the attacker could achieve remote code execution *directly on the ESP8266 microcontroller*, denial of service by crashing the device, information disclosure (e.g., leaking sensitive data managed by the firmware), or gain complete control over the device's operation.

**Affected Component:** Various modules and core components of the firmware could be affected depending on the specific vulnerability (e.g., `net`, `wifi`, `crypto`, `espconn`, lwIP stack).

**Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the exploitability and impact of the specific vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Crucially, keep the NodeMCU firmware updated to the latest stable version.** This is the primary defense against known vulnerabilities.
* Monitor official NodeMCU firmware release notes and security advisories for reported issues.
* If possible, utilize stable releases rather than development branches in production environments.

## Threat: [Insecure Firmware Update Mechanism](./threats/insecure_firmware_update_mechanism.md)

**Description:** The firmware update process within the NodeMCU firmware lacks proper authentication and integrity checks. An attacker could potentially push malicious firmware updates to the device, replacing the legitimate firmware with a compromised version they control. This could be done through network attacks or by exploiting weaknesses in the update process itself.

**Impact:** Complete and persistent compromise of the device. The attacker can install backdoors, steal data, brick the device, or repurpose it for malicious activities. This is a critical vulnerability as it allows for long-term control.

**Affected Component:** The firmware update logic, potentially involving the `ota` (Over-The-Air update) module, the bootloader, and any related network communication functions within the firmware.

**Risk Severity:** Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Implement secure firmware signing and verification within the application's update process.** Ensure the device only accepts firmware signed by a trusted authority.
* **Utilize HTTPS for downloading firmware updates.** This helps prevent man-in-the-middle attacks during the update process.
* **Ensure the update process requires authentication** to prevent unauthorized updates.
* Consider implementing rollback protection to prevent downgrading to older, vulnerable firmware versions.

## Threat: [Physical Access and Firmware Extraction/Modification (Firmware Vulnerability Enabling)](./threats/physical_access_and_firmware_extractionmodification__firmware_vulnerability_enabling_.md)

**Description:** While physical access is a prerequisite, the *firmware's* lack of robust security features makes this a direct firmware-related threat. If the firmware doesn't implement secure boot or flash encryption, an attacker with physical access can easily extract the firmware image for reverse engineering or flash a malicious firmware onto the device using serial or JTAG interfaces.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the device. Attackers can analyze the firmware for vulnerabilities, steal sensitive data embedded within it, or replace it with malicious code. This allows for persistent and deep-level control.

**Affected Component:** The bootloader, the flash memory management within the firmware, and potentially the `esp_secure_boot` component if it's not properly implemented or enabled.

**Risk Severity:** High (if physical access is a plausible threat scenario).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Enable and properly configure secure boot features provided by the ESP8266 SDK.** This ensures only authenticated firmware can run.
* **Enable flash encryption to protect the firmware image from being read or modified without authorization.**
* Secure the physical environment to minimize the risk of unauthorized physical access.
* Disable or protect debug interfaces (serial, JTAG) in production firmware builds.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Serial/UART Interface (Firmware Vulnerability)](./threats/exploitation_of_serialuart_interface__firmware_vulnerability_.md)

**Description:** If the NodeMCU firmware doesn't properly secure or disable the serial/UART interface, an attacker with physical access can connect to it and potentially interact with a command-line interface (if enabled by the firmware) or exploit vulnerabilities in the serial communication handling within the firmware.

**Impact:** Gaining unauthorized access to the device's internal state, executing commands directly on the microcontroller, reading sensitive information, or potentially even flashing malicious firmware through the serial interface.

**Affected Component:** The `uart` module within the NodeMCU firmware and any command-line interface or debugging functionalities exposed through it.

**Risk Severity:** High (requires physical access but directly exploits firmware functionality).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Disable the serial interface in production firmware builds if it's not required.**
* If the serial interface is necessary, implement strong authentication or access control mechanisms within the firmware to restrict access.
* Avoid exposing sensitive information or privileged commands through the serial interface.

## Threat: [Insecure Storage of Credentials or Sensitive Data (Firmware Responsibility)](./threats/insecure_storage_of_credentials_or_sensitive_data__firmware_responsibility_.md)

**Description:** The NodeMCU firmware itself might be responsible for storing sensitive information (like Wi-Fi credentials for connecting to access points or API keys) in an insecure manner, such as plaintext or with weak encryption, within its configuration files or memory.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access to networks, external services, or other resources that the device interacts with.

**Affected Component:** File system access and storage mechanisms within the firmware, any modules responsible for managing configuration data (e.g., `wifi` configuration).

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Avoid storing sensitive information directly within the firmware's configuration or memory if possible.**
* If local storage is necessary, utilize secure storage mechanisms provided by the ESP8266 SDK or implement strong encryption methods.
* Securely manage any encryption keys used for local storage.
