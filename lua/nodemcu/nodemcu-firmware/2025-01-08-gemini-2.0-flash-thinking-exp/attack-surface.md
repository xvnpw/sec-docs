# Attack Surface Analysis for nodemcu/nodemcu-firmware

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Over-the-Air (OTA) Updates](./attack_surfaces/insecure_over-the-air__ota__updates.md)

**Description:** The firmware update process lacks proper authentication or integrity checks, allowing attackers to push malicious firmware to the device.

**NodeMCU-Firmware Contribution:** The firmware implements the OTA update mechanism. If this mechanism doesn't verify the authenticity and integrity of the new firmware image, it creates a significant vulnerability.

**Example:** An attacker intercepts an OTA update request and replaces the legitimate firmware image with a compromised one. The device installs the malicious firmware, granting the attacker full control.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the device, potentially leading to data theft, remote control, or the device becoming a bot in a botnet.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement cryptographic signing of firmware images to ensure authenticity.
*   Use HTTPS for downloading firmware updates to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   Verify the checksum or hash of the downloaded firmware image before installation.
*   Consider using secure boot mechanisms to verify the initial firmware integrity.

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected Lua Interpreter Exposure](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_lua_interpreter_exposure.md)

**Description:** Network services or interfaces directly expose the Lua interpreter without proper sandboxing or input validation.

**NodeMCU-Firmware Contribution:** The firmware provides the Lua scripting environment and allows developers to create network services that interact with this interpreter. If the firmware doesn't offer strong sandboxing options or developers don't implement proper input validation, it creates a vulnerability.

**Example:** A web endpoint on the device directly executes Lua code provided in the request parameters without sanitization. An attacker can inject malicious Lua code to execute arbitrary commands on the device.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, allowing attackers to fully control the device, access sensitive data, or use it for malicious purposes.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid directly exposing the Lua interpreter to untrusted network inputs.
*   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for any data used in Lua scripts.
*   Utilize any sandboxing features provided by the firmware to restrict the capabilities of Lua scripts.
*   Limit the use of functions like `loadstring` that can execute arbitrary code.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure File System Access](./attack_surfaces/insecure_file_system_access.md)

**Description:** Lack of proper access controls on the file system allows unauthorized reading or writing of sensitive files.

**NodeMCU-Firmware Contribution:** The firmware manages the file system. If the firmware doesn't provide mechanisms for granular access control or if default permissions are overly permissive, it contributes to this risk.

**Example:** Configuration files containing sensitive information (e.g., API keys, credentials) are stored with world-readable permissions. An attacker gaining limited access to the device can read these files.

**Impact:** Disclosure of sensitive information, potentially leading to further compromise of the device or connected systems.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement proper file system permissions to restrict access to sensitive files.
*   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in the file system if possible. Consider using secure storage mechanisms.
*   Regularly review file permissions and ensure they are appropriately configured.

## Attack Surface: [Open or Unsecured Network Services](./attack_surfaces/open_or_unsecured_network_services.md)

**Description:** The firmware may enable default network services (e.g., Telnet, FTP) that have known vulnerabilities or lack proper authentication.

**NodeMCU-Firmware Contribution:** The firmware initializes and manages these network services. If these services are enabled by default without strong security measures, they become attack vectors.

**Example:** The Telnet service is enabled by default with a weak or default password. An attacker can connect to the Telnet service and gain command-line access to the device.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to the device, potentially leading to remote control, data manipulation, or denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Disable any unnecessary network services.
*   Ensure that all enabled network services have strong authentication mechanisms.
*   Use secure alternatives to insecure protocols (e.g., SSH instead of Telnet, SFTP instead of FTP).
