# Attack Surface Analysis for nodemcu/nodemcu-firmware

## Attack Surface: [Lua Interpreter Sandbox Escapes](./attack_surfaces/lua_interpreter_sandbox_escapes.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities that allow attackers to break out of the intended limitations of the Lua sandbox environment, gaining access to the underlying operating system or hardware.
    *   **How NodeMCU-Firmware Contributes:** NodeMCU firmware provides the Lua interpreter and defines the boundaries of the sandbox. Weaknesses in the implementation of this sandbox can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** A crafted Lua script exploits a bug in a built-in function to execute arbitrary C code on the ESP8266 chip.
    *   **Impact:** Full control over the device, including access to sensitive data, modification of firmware, and potential use in botnets.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep NodeMCU firmware updated to the latest stable version with security patches.
        *   Avoid using untrusted or third-party Lua modules.
        *   Carefully review and sanitize any external input used in Lua scripts.
        *   Implement additional security checks within Lua scripts to limit access to sensitive functions or resources.

## Attack Surface: [Networking Stack Buffer Overflows](./attack_surfaces/networking_stack_buffer_overflows.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in the underlying TCP/IP stack (lwIP) used by NodeMCU that can be triggered by sending specially crafted network packets, leading to memory corruption and potentially remote code execution.
    *   **How NodeMCU-Firmware Contributes:** NodeMCU firmware integrates and configures the lwIP stack. Vulnerabilities within this integrated stack are part of the firmware's attack surface.
    *   **Example:** Sending an oversized TCP packet with specific flags triggers a buffer overflow in the lwIP stack, allowing an attacker to overwrite memory and execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, device crashes.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep NodeMCU firmware updated to the latest stable version with security patches for the networking stack.
        *   Implement firewall rules to restrict incoming network traffic to necessary ports and protocols.
        *   Avoid exposing the device directly to the public internet without proper network security measures.
        *   Consider using secure communication protocols (e.g., TLS/SSL) for network interactions.

## Attack Surface: [Weak or Default Wi-Fi Credentials](./attack_surfaces/weak_or_default_wi-fi_credentials.md)

*   **Description:**  Using easily guessable or hardcoded Wi-Fi credentials within the application's Lua code or configuration.
    *   **How NodeMCU-Firmware Contributes:** NodeMCU firmware provides the Wi-Fi management capabilities, and the application code running on it configures and uses these features. Poor credential management in the application exposes this.
    *   **Example:** The Lua code contains `wifi.sta.config("MySSID", "password123")`, making the device vulnerable if the SSID is known.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the Wi-Fi network, allowing attackers to potentially control other devices on the network and the NodeMCU device itself.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid hardcoding Wi-Fi credentials in the application code.
        *   Implement a secure method for configuring Wi-Fi credentials, such as a web interface with strong password requirements or a configuration portal.
        *   Use strong and unique passwords for Wi-Fi networks.
        *   Consider using Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) with caution, as it has known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Over-the-Air (OTA) Update Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks](./attack_surfaces/over-the-air__ota__update_man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers intercepting and potentially modifying the firmware update process if it's not properly secured with encryption and authentication.
    *   **How NodeMCU-Firmware Contributes:** NodeMCU firmware provides OTA update functionality. If this functionality doesn't enforce secure communication, it creates an attack vector.
    *   **Example:** An attacker intercepts the communication between the device and the update server, replacing the legitimate firmware image with a malicious one.
    *   **Impact:**  Installation of malicious firmware, leading to complete compromise of the device.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure OTA updates are performed over HTTPS (TLS/SSL) to encrypt the communication.
        *   Implement firmware signature verification to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the update image.
        *   Use a trusted and secure update server.
        *   Consider using secure boot mechanisms to verify the initial bootloader and firmware.
