# Threat Model Analysis for nodemcu/nodemcu-firmware

## Threat: [Firmware Memory Corruption Vulnerability](./threats/firmware_memory_corruption_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit a buffer overflow or other memory corruption bug *within the NodeMCU firmware code itself* (e.g., in the Wi-Fi stack, network handling, or Lua interpreter). This could be achieved by sending specially crafted network packets or providing malicious input that triggers the vulnerability in the firmware's processing logic.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution *on the NodeMCU device*. This allows the attacker to gain full control, install malware, exfiltrate data stored on the device or accessible through it, or cause a denial of service by crashing the firmware.
*   **Affected Component:** Core firmware, potentially affecting modules like `net`, `wifi`, `espconn`, `uart`, or the Lua interpreter core.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the NodeMCU firmware updated to the latest stable version, which includes critical security patches.
    *   Avoid using development or nightly builds of the firmware in production environments.
    *   If developing custom firmware modules, adhere to secure coding practices to prevent memory corruption vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Insecure Firmware Update Mechanism](./threats/insecure_firmware_update_mechanism.md)

*   **Description:** The NodeMCU firmware's Over-The-Air (OTA) update mechanism might lack sufficient security measures. An attacker could intercept the firmware update process if it's not using HTTPS and proper signature verification. They could then inject a malicious firmware image that replaces the legitimate one.
*   **Impact:**  The attacker gains persistent and complete control over the device by flashing a compromised firmware. This allows them to execute arbitrary code, steal data, or use the device for malicious purposes within the network. The device could also be bricked.
*   **Affected Component:** `ota` module, the underlying ESP8266/ESP32 bootloader and flash routines.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always use HTTPS (TLS/SSL) for firmware updates to ensure confidentiality and integrity during transmission.
    *   Implement firmware signature verification to ensure that only firmware images signed by a trusted authority can be flashed.
    *   Secure the private key used for signing firmware updates.
    *   Consider using secure boot features offered by the underlying ESP8266/ESP32 chip if available and properly configured.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Default Credentials](./threats/exploitation_of_default_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** The NodeMCU firmware, in its default configuration or through certain modules, might expose services (like a web interface in access point mode) with default, well-known credentials. An attacker can easily guess or find these credentials and gain unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:** The attacker can gain administrative access to the NodeMCU device. This allows them to reconfigure the device, potentially joining it to a malicious network, installing malicious Lua scripts, or accessing any data or functionalities exposed by the firmware.
*   **Affected Component:** `wifi` module (when in access point mode with a web interface), any modules implementing web servers or other network services with default credentials.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Force users to change default passwords upon initial setup.
    *   Avoid using default credentials in any firmware configurations or example code.
    *   Disable any unnecessary services or interfaces that might expose default credentials.

## Threat: [Lua Sandbox Escape](./threats/lua_sandbox_escape.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities within the NodeMCU firmware's Lua interpreter or its bindings to underlying hardware and software components could allow a malicious Lua script to escape the intended sandbox environment. This enables the execution of arbitrary code with elevated privileges, bypassing the security restrictions of the Lua environment.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can gain control over the NodeMCU device by exploiting a sandbox escape. This allows them to execute arbitrary system commands, access sensitive data, manipulate hardware through GPIO, or perform other actions beyond the intended scope of Lua scripting.
*   **Affected Component:** The `lua` interpreter integrated into the firmware, the C bindings that expose firmware functionalities to Lua.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the NodeMCU firmware updated, as updates often include security patches for the Lua interpreter.
    *   Carefully review and sanitize any external Lua scripts or user-provided Lua code before execution.
    *   Limit the permissions and capabilities granted to Lua scripts as much as possible.
    *   Consider using alternative, more secure scripting environments if the security of the Lua sandbox is a critical concern.
