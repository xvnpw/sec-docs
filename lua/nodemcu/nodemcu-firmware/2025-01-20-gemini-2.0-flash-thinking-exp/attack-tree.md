## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Network Communication Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_network_communication_vulnerabilities.md)

This path encompasses attacks that leverage weaknesses in how the NodeMCU communicates over the network. Successful exploitation can lead to information disclosure, data manipulation, or even remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Intercept Network Traffic](./attack_tree_paths/intercept_network_traffic.md)

This is a fundamental step in many network-based attacks. By intercepting network traffic, an attacker can eavesdrop on communication, potentially revealing sensitive information or capturing credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weak Wi-Fi Security (e.g., WEP, WPS flaws)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weak_wi-fi_security__e_g___wep__wps_flaws_.md)

Weak Wi-Fi security protocols like WEP and WPS have known vulnerabilities that allow attackers to easily gain access to the Wi-Fi network. This provides a foothold for further attacks against devices on the network, including the NodeMCU.

## Attack Tree Path: [Perform Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack](./attack_tree_paths/perform_man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack.md)

In a MITM attack, the attacker positions themselves between the NodeMCU and another communicating party (e.g., a server). This allows them to intercept, inspect, and potentially modify the communication in real-time.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Network Traffic](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_network_traffic.md)

After intercepting network traffic, attackers can attempt to manipulate it by injecting malicious packets or replaying legitimate ones. This can be used to exploit vulnerabilities in the network stack or application logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Packets](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_packets.md)

By crafting and injecting malicious network packets, an attacker can attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in the NodeMCU's network stack or the application logic that processes network data. This can potentially lead to buffer overflows, code injection, or other forms of compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Firmware Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_firmware_vulnerabilities.md)

This path targets weaknesses within the NodeMCU firmware itself. Successful exploitation can grant the attacker complete control over the device.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in NodeMCU Firmware](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_nodemcu_firmware.md)

NodeMCU firmware, like any software, may contain known vulnerabilities (often documented as CVEs). Attackers can leverage publicly available exploits for these vulnerabilities to compromise devices running vulnerable firmware versions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Lua Interpreter Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_lua_interpreter_vulnerabilities.md)

NodeMCU uses the Lua scripting language. Vulnerabilities in the Lua interpreter or its interaction with the application can be exploited to gain unauthorized access or execute code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Code Injection through `loadstring` or similar functions](./attack_tree_paths/code_injection_through__loadstring__or_similar_functions.md)

Lua functions like `loadstring` allow for the execution of dynamically generated code. If an application uses these functions with untrusted input, an attacker can inject malicious Lua code that will be executed by the interpreter.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Update Mechanism Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_update_mechanism_vulnerabilities.md)

If the firmware update process is not properly secured, attackers can exploit it to install malicious firmware on the device, gaining persistent control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Firmware Update Server](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_firmware_update_server.md)

If the server responsible for distributing firmware updates is compromised, an attacker can replace legitimate firmware with malicious versions. This can lead to a widespread compromise of devices.

## Attack Tree Path: [Perform Man-in-the-Middle Attack During Update](./attack_tree_paths/perform_man-in-the-middle_attack_during_update.md)

During the firmware update process, if the communication between the NodeMCU and the update server is not properly secured (e.g., using HTTPS with certificate verification), an attacker can perform a MITM attack to intercept the update and serve malicious firmware.

## Attack Tree Path: [Serve Malicious Firmware](./attack_tree_paths/serve_malicious_firmware.md)

This is the point in the update process where the attacker successfully delivers and installs malicious firmware on the NodeMCU device.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Lack of Secure Boot or Firmware Verification](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_lack_of_secure_boot_or_firmware_verification.md)

Secure boot and firmware verification mechanisms ensure that only trusted and authorized firmware can be executed on the device. If these mechanisms are absent or improperly implemented, an attacker can more easily flash malicious firmware, either through physical interfaces or vulnerable OTA update processes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Storage of Sensitive Data](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_storage_of_sensitive_data.md)

If sensitive information (like credentials or API keys) is stored insecurely on the NodeMCU (e.g., without encryption or with weak encryption), attackers can access this data after gaining access to the device's file system or memory.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Stored Credentials or API Keys](./attack_tree_paths/access_stored_credentials_or_api_keys.md)

Gaining access to stored credentials or API keys can allow an attacker to impersonate the NodeMCU or the application it's running, potentially gaining access to connected services and escalating their privileges.
