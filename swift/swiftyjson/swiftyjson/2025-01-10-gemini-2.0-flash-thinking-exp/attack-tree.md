## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Trigger Application Errors/Crashes](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_trigger_application_errorscrashes.md)

- This critical node represents the goal of causing the application to malfunction or crash due to vulnerabilities in how it handles JSON data. Success here can lead to service disruption and potentially open doors for further exploitation.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH: Send Malformed JSON](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_send_malformed_json.md)

Attack Vector: Sending JSON with syntax errors.
            - Likelihood: High
            - Impact: Moderate (Application crash, service disruption)
            - Effort: Minimal
            - Skill Level: Novice
            - Detection Difficulty: Easy (Parsing errors in logs)
        - Attack Vector: Sending JSON with unexpected data types.
            - Likelihood: Medium
            - Impact: Moderate (Application crash, unexpected behavior)
            - Effort: Low
            - Skill Level: Beginner
            - Detection Difficulty: Moderate (Requires monitoring error logs for type casting issues)
        - Attack Vector: Sending JSON with missing required fields.
            - Likelihood: Medium
            - Impact: Moderate (Application crash, unexpected behavior)
            - Effort: Low
            - Skill Level: Beginner
            - Detection Difficulty: Moderate (Depends on logging of missing field errors)

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH: Send Excessively Large JSON Payload](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_send_excessively_large_json_payload.md)

Attack Vector: Causing resource exhaustion (memory, CPU).
            - Likelihood: Medium
            - Impact: Significant (Denial of Service, application instability)
            - Effort: Low
            - Skill Level: Novice
            - Detection Difficulty: Easy (High resource consumption, slow response times)

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH: Exploit Type Mismatches](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_type_mismatches.md)

Attack Vector: Sending JSON with values of incorrect types leading to type casting errors in application logic.
            - Likelihood: Medium
            - Impact: Moderate (Application crash, unexpected behavior)
            - Effort: Low
            - Skill Level: Beginner
            - Detection Difficulty: Moderate (Requires monitoring error logs for type casting issues)

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Manipulate Application Logic](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_manipulate_application_logic.md)

- This critical node represents the goal of altering the intended behavior of the application by exploiting how it processes JSON data. Success here can lead to data corruption, financial loss, or unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH: Inject Unexpected Data Values](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_inject_unexpected_data_values.md)

Attack Vector: Sending JSON with values that, when processed, cause unintended behavior in the application logic (e.g., negative quantities, out-of-bounds indices).
            - Likelihood: Medium
            - Impact: Moderate to Significant (Data corruption, business logic flaws exploited)
            - Effort: Moderate
            - Skill Level: Intermediate
            - Detection Difficulty: Difficult (Requires understanding of application logic and monitoring for anomalous behavior)

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH: Bypass Input Validation (Indirectly)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_bypass_input_validation__indirectly_.md)

Attack Vector: Sending JSON that passes SwiftyJSON parsing but bypasses application-level validation due to assumptions about data structure or content.
            - Likelihood: Medium
            - Impact: Moderate to Significant (Data injection, bypassing security controls)
            - Effort: Moderate
            - Skill Level: Intermediate
            - Detection Difficulty: Difficult (Requires understanding of validation logic and monitoring for unexpected data)

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Cause Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_cause_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

- This critical node represents the goal of making the application unavailable to legitimate users. Success here can severely disrupt business operations and damage reputation.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH: Send Excessively Large JSON Payload (Repeatedly)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_send_excessively_large_json_payload__repeatedly_.md)

Attack Vector: Overwhelming server resources.
            - Likelihood: Medium
            - Impact: Critical (Service unavailability)
            - Effort: Low
            - Skill Level: Novice
            - Detection Difficulty: Easy (High resource consumption, network traffic spikes)
