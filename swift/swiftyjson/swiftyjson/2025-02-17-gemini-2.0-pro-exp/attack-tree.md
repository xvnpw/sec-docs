## Attack Tree Path: [1. Deeply Nested JSON (Stack Overflow/Memory Exhaustion) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__deeply_nested_json__stack_overflowmemory_exhaustion___high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker sends a maliciously crafted JSON payload with an extremely large number of nested objects or arrays (e.g., `[[[[[[[[...]]]]]]]]]`). This exploits the recursive nature of JSON parsing, potentially leading to a stack overflow or exhausting available memory.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High (DoS - Application Crash)
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Crash is obvious, identifying the cause requires analysis)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Implement strict limits on the maximum nesting depth of JSON payloads *before* parsing with SwiftyJSON.
    *   Reject any JSON exceeding this limit at the application's input validation layer.
    *   Consider a reasonable limit of 10-20 levels, depending on application needs.
    *   Fuzz testing with deeply nested JSON.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Large JSON Arrays (Memory Exhaustion) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2__large_json_arrays__memory_exhaustion___high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker sends a JSON payload containing an extremely large array (e.g., `[1, 2, 3, ..., 1000000000]`).  Even with simple elements, the sheer number of array entries can consume significant memory, leading to a denial-of-service.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High (DoS - Application Crash or Severe Performance Degradation)
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Performance degradation/crash is obvious, identifying the cause requires analysis)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Implement limits on the maximum size (number of elements) of JSON arrays *before* parsing with SwiftyJSON.
    *   Reject payloads exceeding this limit at the input validation layer.
    *   The limit should be based on the application's expected data and available resources.
    *   Consider streaming JSON parsing if very large arrays are expected (but this is outside the scope of SwiftyJSON itself).
    *   Fuzz testing with large JSON arrays.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Exploiting a known, but unpatched, CVE (if any exist) [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/6__exploiting_a_known__but_unpatched__cve__if_any_exist___high_risk___critical_.md)

*   **Description:** If a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) is published for SwiftyJSON, an attacker can exploit it if the application is using an unpatched version. The specific attack vector depends on the details of the CVE.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on the existence and publicity of a CVE, and the speed of patching)
*   **Impact:** Variable (Depends on the CVE - could range from Low to Very High)
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Often, exploits for known CVEs are publicly available)
*   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate (Using a public exploit is easy; developing a new one is harder)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (IDS and vulnerability scanners can often detect known CVE exploits, but zero-days are harder)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Implement a robust vulnerability management process.
    *   Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
    *   Apply patches promptly.
    *   Use dependency management tools that provide vulnerability alerts.
    *   Regular vulnerability scanning.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Excessive Memory Consumption](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_excessive_memory_consumption.md)

* **Description:** This node represents the overarching vulnerability that both deeply nested JSON and large JSON arrays exploit. By controlling the size and structure of the input JSON, an attacker can force the application to allocate excessive amounts of memory.
* **Mitigation:** The primary mitigation is comprehensive input validation, as described for attack vectors 1 and 2. This includes limiting both nesting depth and array size.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Resource Exhaustion](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_resource_exhaustion.md)

* **Description:** This node is a broader category than just memory exhaustion. It includes the possibility of exhausting other resources, such as CPU cycles, during the parsing of very large or complex JSON structures.
* **Mitigation:** While input validation (limiting size and complexity) is the primary defense, consider also:
    * Timeouts for processing requests.
    * Resource quotas for individual users or processes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploiting a known, but unpatched, CVE](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploiting_a_known__but_unpatched__cve.md)

* **Description:** This node represents the vulnerability introduced by not applying security patches for known vulnerabilities in SwiftyJSON.
* **Mitigation:** The *only* effective mitigation is to keep SwiftyJSON (and all dependencies) up-to-date with the latest security patches. This requires a robust vulnerability management process.
