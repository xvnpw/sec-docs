# Threat Model Analysis for swiftyjson/swiftyjson

## Threat: [Unexpected Type Coercion Leading to Logic Errors](./threats/unexpected_type_coercion_leading_to_logic_errors.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a JSON payload where a field's value has an unexpected type, but SwiftyJSON's automatic type coercion converts it to a seemingly valid value.  For example, the attacker sends `"isAdmin": "1"` (string) instead of `"isAdmin": true` (boolean). The application, expecting a boolean, might use `.boolValue` which would coerce the string "1" to `true`, leading to incorrect authorization logic. This is a *direct* threat because SwiftyJSON's type coercion is the mechanism enabling the attack.
*   **Impact:** Incorrect application behavior, potentially bypassing security checks, leading to unauthorized access, data modification, or other unintended actions.
*   **Affected SwiftyJSON Component:**
    *   Type Accessor Methods (e.g., `.boolValue`, `.intValue`, `.stringValue`, `.doubleValue`, etc.)
    *   Implicit type coercion within optional chaining (e.g., `json["user"]["isAdmin"].bool ?? false`)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use the most specific type accessor (e.g., `.bool` instead of `.boolValue`) and *always* check for `nil` after accessing the value.  This forces developers to handle the case where the value is not of the expected type.
    *   Explicitly validate the type using `.type` before accessing the value: `if json["isAdmin"].type == .bool { ... }`.
    *   Define data models (structs/classes) and map the JSON data to these models, performing type validation during the mapping.

## Threat: [Malformed JSON Structure Bypassing Initial Validation](./threats/malformed_json_structure_bypassing_initial_validation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a JSON payload that is superficially valid (e.g., has the expected top-level keys) but contains a deeply nested structure or unexpected data types within nested objects or arrays. The application might only validate the top-level structure, relying on SwiftyJSON to handle the nested parts. SwiftyJSON's lenient parsing might allow access to this unexpected data, leading to issues *because* the library doesn't enforce a strict schema.
*   **Impact:** Incorrect data processing, potentially leading to crashes, logic errors, or exploitation of vulnerabilities in downstream components that consume the processed data.
*   **Affected SwiftyJSON Component:**
    *   Subscript access (e.g., `json["user"]["profile"]["address"]`)
    *   Iteration over arrays and dictionaries (`for (key, subJson):(String, JSON) in json["users"]`)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement comprehensive schema validation *after* parsing with SwiftyJSON, using a dedicated JSON Schema validator.
    *   Define strict data models and map the JSON data to these models, validating the structure and types during the mapping process.
    *   Avoid deeply nested JSON structures if possible. Favor flatter structures that are easier to validate.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Large JSON Payload](./threats/denial_of_service_via_large_json_payload.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends an extremely large JSON payload (e.g., a multi-gigabyte file). SwiftyJSON, which loads the *entire* JSON into memory, consumes excessive memory, leading to application crashes or unresponsiveness. This is a direct threat because of SwiftyJSON's in-memory parsing approach.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, making the application unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **Affected SwiftyJSON Component:**
    *   `JSON(data: data)` initializer
    *   `JSON(parseJSON: string)` initializer
    *   Entire library, as it's not a streaming parser.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict limits on the maximum size of accepted JSON payloads *before* passing the data to SwiftyJSON.
    *   Consider using a streaming JSON parser for very large documents, if the application's requirements allow it.
    *   Implement resource monitoring and alerting to detect and respond to potential DoS attacks.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Deeply Nested JSON](./threats/denial_of_service_via_deeply_nested_json.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a JSON payload with excessive nesting depth (e.g., thousands of nested objects or arrays). Even if the overall payload size is not enormous, the deep nesting can consume significant stack space during SwiftyJSON's recursive parsing, potentially leading to a stack overflow and application crash. This is a direct threat due to the recursive nature of SwiftyJSON's parsing.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, causing the application to crash.
*   **Affected SwiftyJSON Component:**
    *   `JSON(data: data)` initializer
    *   `JSON(parseJSON: string)` initializer
    *   Recursive parsing logic within SwiftyJSON.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement limits on the maximum nesting depth of accepted JSON payloads *before* parsing with SwiftyJSON.
    *   Consider using a streaming JSON parser if deep nesting is unavoidable.
    *   Monitor stack usage to detect potential stack overflow attacks.

## Threat: [Injection via Unvalidated `.rawValue` Usage](./threats/injection_via_unvalidated___rawvalue__usage.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a JSON payload where a field contains malicious code (e.g., SQL injection, XSS payload). The application extracts this value using SwiftyJSON's `.rawValue` property and then uses it directly in a sensitive context (e.g., database query, HTML output) without proper sanitization or escaping. This is a *direct* threat because the `.rawValue` property provides a way to bypass SwiftyJSON's type-safe accessors.
*   **Impact:**  Injection vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), command injection, depending on where the raw value is used.
*   **Affected SwiftyJSON Component:**
    *   `.rawValue` property
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strongly avoid using `.rawValue`**. Use the specific type accessors instead.
    *   If `.rawValue` *must* be used, treat the extracted data as completely untrusted.  *Always* sanitize and validate the data according to the context in which it will be used.  Use parameterized queries for SQL, proper encoding for HTML, etc.
