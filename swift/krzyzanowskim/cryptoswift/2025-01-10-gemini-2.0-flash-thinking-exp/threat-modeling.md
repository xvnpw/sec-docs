# Threat Model Analysis for krzyzanowskim/cryptoswift

## Threat: [Use of Deprecated or Weak Cryptographic Algorithm](./threats/use_of_deprecated_or_weak_cryptographic_algorithm.md)

* Description: An attacker could exploit known vulnerabilities in a weak or deprecated algorithm (e.g., older versions of MD5 or SHA-1 for hashing where collision resistance is critical) that is still supported by `CryptoSwift`. They might be able to generate collisions, forge signatures, or decrypt encrypted data more easily.
* Impact: Compromised data integrity, loss of confidentiality, potential forgeries and impersonation.
* Affected Component: Algorithm selection within `CryptoSwift` (e.g., when initializing a `Digest` or `Cipher` object with a weak algorithm).
* Risk Severity: High
* Mitigation Strategies:
    *  Use strong, up-to-date, and recommended cryptographic algorithms provided by `CryptoSwift`.
    *  Regularly review and update the cryptographic algorithms used in the application, ensuring they align with current best practices and avoid deprecated options within `CryptoSwift`.

## Threat: [Incorrect Algorithm Parameters or Modes of Operation](./threats/incorrect_algorithm_parameters_or_modes_of_operation.md)

* Description: An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities arising from the misuse of algorithm parameters or modes of operation when using `CryptoSwift`. For example, using Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode for block ciphers can lead to pattern exposure, or incorrect padding can lead to padding oracle attacks where the attacker can decrypt data by observing error messages related to `CryptoSwift`'s padding implementation.
* Impact: Loss of confidentiality, potential for data manipulation, information leakage.
* Affected Component: Initialization of cipher objects within `CryptoSwift` (e.g., `AES(key: iv: .ecb)`, `AES(key: blockMode: Padding.noPadding)`).
* Risk Severity: Critical
* Mitigation Strategies:
    *  Use appropriate and secure modes of operation for block ciphers offered by `CryptoSwift` (e.g., CBC, GCM, CTR).
    *  Implement proper padding schemes (e.g., PKCS#7) using `CryptoSwift`'s padding options and ensure they are handled correctly.
    *  Carefully review the documentation for each algorithm and mode of operation used in `CryptoSwift` to ensure correct implementation.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities within the CryptoSwift Library Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_within_the_cryptoswift_library_itself.md)

* Description: An attacker could exploit undiscovered or unpatched vulnerabilities within the `CryptoSwift` library code. This could allow them to bypass security measures implemented by `CryptoSwift`, cause crashes within cryptographic operations, or potentially gain more significant control depending on the nature of the flaw.
* Impact: Wide range of potential impacts depending on the nature of the vulnerability, including data breach, denial of service, and potentially remote code execution if the vulnerability is severe enough.
* Affected Component: Any module or function within the `CryptoSwift` library.
* Risk Severity: Varies from Medium to Critical depending on the vulnerability.
* Mitigation Strategies:
    *  Regularly update the `CryptoSwift` library to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches released by the maintainers.
    *  Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases related to `CryptoSwift` to be aware of any reported issues.

## Threat: [Incorrect Usage Leading to Data Integrity Issues](./threats/incorrect_usage_leading_to_data_integrity_issues.md)

* Description: Developers might misuse `CryptoSwift` functions for message authentication codes (MACs) or digital signatures, leading to a failure in verifying data integrity and authenticity. For example, not properly verifying a MAC generated by `CryptoSwift` after decryption could allow an attacker to tamper with the data without detection.
* Impact:  Compromised data integrity, leading to the processing of tampered or unauthorized data.
* Affected Component: Usage of MAC functions (e.g., `HMAC`) or signature functions within `CryptoSwift`.
* Risk Severity: High
* Mitigation Strategies:
    *  Always verify MACs or signatures generated by `CryptoSwift` after decryption or upon receiving data.
    *  Follow established best practices for using MACs and digital signatures as intended by the `CryptoSwift` API.
    *  Ensure the correct keys are used for MAC verification using `CryptoSwift`'s functions.
