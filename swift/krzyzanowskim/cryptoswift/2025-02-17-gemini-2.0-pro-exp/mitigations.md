## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Algorithm and Mode Selection (CryptoSwift-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_algorithm_and_mode_selection__cryptoswift-specific_.md)

1.  **Whitelist Approach (CryptoSwift Focus):**  Define a whitelist of *CryptoSwift* `Cipher` and `BlockMode` instances (or their corresponding enum values, if applicable).  This is *not* just a list of strings; it's a list of the actual types or enums used by CryptoSwift.  Example (conceptual):
    ```swift
    // SecurityConstants.swift
    import CryptoSwift

    let allowedCiphers: [Cipher] = [
        AES(keySize: .aes256, blockMode: .gcm), // Example: AES-256-GCM
        ChaCha20(keySize: .keySize256, ivSize: .ivSize128) // Example: ChaCha20
    ]
    ```
2.  **Configuration Validation (CryptoSwift Focus):**  When initializing CryptoSwift objects, validate against the whitelist.  This is *not* just checking strings; it's checking the *type* or *instance* of the `Cipher` and `BlockMode`.
    ```swift
    // CryptoManager.swift
    import CryptoSwift

    func createCipher(algorithm: String, mode: String, key: [UInt8], iv: [UInt8]) throws -> Cipher {
        // ... (Get Cipher and BlockMode instances based on 'algorithm' and 'mode' strings) ...
        // Example (Conceptual - adapt to your actual configuration method):
        let selectedCipher = try AES(key: key, blockMode: .gcm(iv: iv)) // Example

        guard allowedCiphers.contains(where: { $0.blockSize == selectedCipher.blockSize && type(of: $0) == type(of: selectedCipher) }) else {
            throw CryptoError.invalidAlgorithmOrMode
        }

        return selectedCipher
    }
    ```
3.  **Key and IV Size Validation:**  Within the `createCipher` (or similar) function, explicitly validate the key and IV sizes against the requirements of the chosen algorithm and mode.  Use CryptoSwift's properties (e.g., `keySize`, `blockSize`, `ivSize`) to perform these checks.
    ```swift
     guard key.count == selectedCipher.keySize else {
        throw CryptoError.invalidKeySize
    }
    if let gcmMode = selectedCipher.blockMode as? GCM { // Example for GCM
        guard iv.count == gcmMode.ivSize else {
            throw CryptoError.invalidIVSize
        }
    }
    ```
4. **Documentation (CryptoSwift Focus):** Document *precisely* how to use the approved CryptoSwift configurations, including code examples.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Incorrect Algorithm/Mode Selection (Severity: High):** Prevents direct instantiation of vulnerable CryptoSwift configurations (e.g., `AES(key: key, blockMode: .ecb)`).
        *   **Configuration Errors (Severity: High):**  Reduces the risk of passing incorrect parameters to CryptoSwift's constructors.
        *   **Key/IV Size Mismatches (Severity: High):** Prevents using keys or IVs of incorrect lengths with specific CryptoSwift algorithms and modes.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Incorrect Algorithm/Mode Selection:** Risk reduced significantly (from High to Low/Negligible).
        *   **Configuration Errors:** Risk reduced significantly (from High to Low).
        *   **Key/IV Size Mismatches:** Risk reduced from High to Negligible.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Basic key and IV size validation in `CryptoManager.swift`.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Strict whitelist enforcement using CryptoSwift types/instances (as described above) is not yet fully implemented.  Current validation relies on string comparisons, which is less robust.
        *   Comprehensive documentation with CryptoSwift-specific code examples is needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure IV/Nonce Generation and Management (CryptoSwift-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_ivnonce_generation_and_management__cryptoswift-specific_.md)

1.  **CSPRNG for IVs (CryptoSwift Focus):**  *Always* use `SecRandomCopyBytes` to generate IVs that are passed to CryptoSwift.  *Never* use `random()` or derive IVs in any other way.
    ```swift
    // SecureRandomGenerator.swift
    import CryptoSwift
    import Security

    func generateSecureIV(size: Int) -> [UInt8] {
        var iv = [UInt8](repeating: 0, count: size)
        let result = SecRandomCopyBytes(kSecRandomDefault, size, &iv)
        guard result == errSecSuccess else {
            fatalError("Failed to generate secure IV")
        }
        return iv
    }
    ```
2.  **Nonce Management (CryptoSwift Focus):**  When using CryptoSwift's authenticated encryption modes (GCM, CCM), ensure that nonces are *never* reused with the same key.  This is *critical*.
    *   **Random Nonces:**  For GCM, a 96-bit (12-byte) random nonce is generally recommended.  Generate this using `SecureRandomGenerator`.
    *   **Counter-Based Nonces (If Required):** If a counter-based approach is *absolutely necessary*, ensure the counter is:
        *   Persisted securely (e.g., Keychain).
        *   Incremented *before* each encryption operation.
        *   Combined with a key-specific prefix (if needed for multi-device scenarios).
3. **Direct CryptoSwift API Usage:** Use the generated IVs *directly* with CryptoSwift's APIs. For example:
    ```swift
    let iv = SecureRandomGenerator.generateSecureIV(size: 12) // For AES-GCM
    let aes = try AES(key: key, blockMode: GCM(iv: iv)) // Pass IV directly to GCM
    let ciphertext = try aes.encrypt(plaintext)
    ```
4. **Documentation:** Clearly document the nonce management strategy and how it interacts with CryptoSwift.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Weak/Predictable IVs/Nonces (Severity: Critical):**  Ensures that IVs passed to CryptoSwift are cryptographically secure and non-repeating.
        *   **Replay Attacks (Severity: High):**  Proper nonce management with CryptoSwift's authenticated modes prevents replay attacks.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Weak/Predictable IVs/Nonces:** Risk reduced from Critical to Negligible.
        *   **Replay Attacks:** Risk reduced from High to Negligible.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   `SecureRandomGenerator` class uses `SecRandomCopyBytes`.
        *   Random nonces are generated and passed to CryptoSwift's `GCM` initializer.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   No counter-based nonce implementation (not currently needed).
        *   Documentation could be improved to explicitly highlight the importance of nonce uniqueness with CryptoSwift.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Safe Data Handling (CryptoSwift-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/safe_data_handling__cryptoswift-specific_.md)

1.  **Use CryptoSwift's Conversion Methods:**  *Always* use CryptoSwift's provided methods for converting between `String`, `Data`, and `[UInt8]`.  Examples:
    *   `string.bytes` (to get a `[UInt8]` from a `String`)
    *   `Data(bytes)` (to create a `Data` object from a `[UInt8]`)
    *   `String(data:encoding:)` (to create a `String` from a `Data` object)
2.  **Explicit Encoding (CryptoSwift Focus):**  When converting between strings and byte arrays *for use with CryptoSwift*, *always* specify the encoding explicitly.  UTF-8 is generally recommended.
    ```swift
    let plaintextString = "Hello, world!"
    let plaintextBytes = plaintextString.bytes(using: .utf8) // Explicit UTF-8 encoding

    // ... (Use plaintextBytes with CryptoSwift) ...

    let decryptedBytes = try aes.decrypt(ciphertext)
    let decryptedString = String(bytes: decryptedBytes, encoding: .utf8) // Explicit UTF-8 decoding
    ```
3. **Avoid Manual Byte Manipulation:** Minimize manual manipulation of byte arrays. If necessary, ensure it's thoroughly reviewed and tested.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Incorrect Data Conversions (Severity: Medium):**  Reduces the risk of errors when converting data for use with CryptoSwift.
        *   **Encoding-Related Issues (Severity: Medium):**  Ensures consistent and correct encoding when working with strings and CryptoSwift.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Incorrect Data Conversions:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
        *   **Encoding-Related Issues:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   CryptoSwift's conversion methods are generally used.
        *   UTF-8 encoding is explicitly specified in most cases.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   A review of all string/byte conversions to ensure consistent use of explicit encoding is needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Comprehensive Cryptographic Testing (CryptoSwift Focus)](./mitigation_strategies/comprehensive_cryptographic_testing__cryptoswift_focus_.md)

1.  **Unit Tests (CryptoSwift Focus):** Create unit tests that *specifically* exercise CryptoSwift's functionality.
2.  **Known Answer Tests (KATs) (CryptoSwift Focus):** Use known input/output pairs (test vectors) to verify that CryptoSwift's encryption and decryption are working correctly *for the specific algorithms and modes used*. Find KATs from reliable sources (NIST, RFCs, etc.).
3.  **Edge Case Testing (CryptoSwift Focus):** Test CryptoSwift with:
    *   Empty inputs (`[]` for byte arrays).
    *   Very large inputs.
    *   Inputs with special characters.
    *   Inputs near the boundaries of allowed key and IV sizes.
4.  **Error Handling Tests (CryptoSwift Focus):** Test how CryptoSwift and your wrapper code handle:
    *   Invalid keys (wrong size, incorrect format).
    *   Invalid IVs/nonces (wrong size, reuse).
    *   Invalid ciphertexts (tampered data).
    *   Incorrect padding (if CBC is used â€“ but avoid CBC). Use `CryptoSwift.CryptoError`.
5. **Algorithm/Mode Coverage:** Ensure tests cover *all* CryptoSwift algorithms and modes used in the application.

    * **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Implementation Errors (Severity: Variable, potentially High):** Catches bugs in *how* CryptoSwift is being used.
        *   **Incorrect Usage (Severity: Medium):** Identifies cases where CryptoSwift's APIs are called with incorrect parameters.

    * **Impact:**
        *   **Implementation Errors:** Risk reduced significantly.
        *   **Incorrect Usage:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.

    * **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Basic unit tests for AES-GCM encryption/decryption using CryptoSwift.
        *   Some KATs are included.

    * **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Comprehensive edge case and error handling tests are incomplete.
        *   Full coverage of all used CryptoSwift algorithms and modes is lacking.
