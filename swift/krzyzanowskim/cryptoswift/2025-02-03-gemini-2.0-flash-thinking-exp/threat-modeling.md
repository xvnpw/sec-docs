# Threat Model Analysis for krzyzanowskim/cryptoswift

## Threat: [Buffer Overflow in Algorithm Implementation](./threats/buffer_overflow_in_algorithm_implementation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability within CryptoSwift's implementation of a cryptographic algorithm. By providing specially crafted input data, the attacker could overwrite memory beyond the intended buffer boundaries. This could lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.
*   **Impact:** Critical. Arbitrary code execution allows complete system compromise. Denial of service disrupts application availability. Information disclosure exposes sensitive data.
*   **CryptoSwift Component Affected:** Core algorithm implementations (e.g., `AES`, `SHA2`, `ChaChaPoly`). Functions handling data processing within these algorithms.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep CryptoSwift Updated:** Regularly update to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes.
    *   **Code Audits of CryptoSwift (Library Maintainers):**  Thorough code audits by maintainers and security researchers.
    *   **Memory Safety Checks (Development/Testing):** Utilize memory safety tools during CryptoSwift development.

## Threat: [Integer Overflow/Underflow in Algorithm Logic](./threats/integer_overflowunderflow_in_algorithm_logic.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could trigger an integer overflow or underflow in CryptoSwift's algorithm logic, leading to incorrect calculations, unexpected program behavior, or memory corruption. This could be exploited to bypass security checks, cause incorrect encryption/decryption, or lead to denial of service.
*   **Impact:** High to Critical. Can lead to security bypasses, data corruption, or denial of service.
*   **CryptoSwift Component Affected:** Core algorithm implementations. Functions involving length calculations, loop counters, or memory indexing within algorithms.
*   **Risk Severity:** Medium to High (Elevated to High for this filtered list due to potential critical impact).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep CryptoSwift Updated:** Updates may address integer overflow vulnerabilities.
    *   **Code Audits of CryptoSwift:** Code audits should specifically look for integer overflow issues.
    *   **Use Safe Integer Operations (Development/Testing):** Employ compiler flags or coding practices to detect/prevent overflows during CryptoSwift development.

## Threat: [Incorrect Algorithm Implementation (Cryptographic Flaws)](./threats/incorrect_algorithm_implementation__cryptographic_flaws_.md)

*   **Description:** CryptoSwift's implementation of a cryptographic algorithm might contain subtle flaws or deviations from the standard specification, weakening the algorithm and making it vulnerable to attacks.
*   **Impact:** High. Compromises confidentiality, integrity, or authenticity. Data protected by the flawed algorithm could be exposed or manipulated.
*   **CryptoSwift Component Affected:** Specific algorithm modules (e.g., `AES`, `ChaCha20`, `SHA3`). Core logic within these modules.
*   **Risk Severity:** Medium to High (Elevated to High for this filtered list due to potential critical impact).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rely on Reputable and Widely Used Libraries:** CryptoSwift's popularity aids community scrutiny.
    *   **Code Audits by Cryptography Experts (Library Maintainers):** Expert audits to verify algorithm correctness.
    *   **Test Vectors and Validation Suites (Development/Testing):** Test CryptoSwift against standard test vectors.
    *   **Keep CryptoSwift Updated:** Updates might include fixes for implementation flaws.

## Threat: [Failure to Update CryptoSwift (Using Outdated Version)](./threats/failure_to_update_cryptoswift__using_outdated_version_.md)

*   **Description:** Developers might fail to update CryptoSwift, using outdated versions with known security vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.
*   **Impact:** Medium to High (Elevated to High for this filtered list due to potential critical impact if vulnerabilities are severe). Depends on the severity of vulnerabilities in the outdated version.
*   **CryptoSwift Component Affected:** The entire CryptoSwift library. The vulnerability is in using an outdated version.
*   **Risk Severity:** Medium (Elevated to High for this filtered list due to potential critical impact).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Management and Updates:** Implement a robust dependency update process.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use tools to identify outdated dependencies with known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Monitoring CryptoSwift Security Advisories:** Monitor release notes and security advisories.
