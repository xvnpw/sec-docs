# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, CryptoSwift, provides a collection of cryptographic algorithms implemented in Swift. It aims to offer developers a readily available and easy-to-use library for incorporating cryptography into their Swift applications across various platforms, including iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and Linux.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Provide a robust and reliable cryptographic library for Swift developers.
- Enable secure data handling and communication in Swift applications.
- Support a wide range of cryptographic algorithms and primitives.
- Maintain a high level of code quality and security.
- Foster community contribution and maintain active development.

Business Risks:
- Vulnerabilities in cryptographic implementations leading to data breaches or security compromises in applications using the library.
- Incorrect usage of the library by developers resulting in insecure applications.
- Lack of maintenance and updates, causing the library to become outdated and insecure over time.
- Supply chain attacks targeting the library's dependencies or build process.
- Compatibility issues with different Swift versions and platforms.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Code review process for contributions (described in contribution guidelines).
- security control: Unit tests to ensure the correctness of cryptographic implementations (present in the repository).
- accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions, which may introduce vulnerabilities if not properly vetted.
- accepted risk: Open-source nature, making the codebase publicly accessible to both security researchers and malicious actors.

Recommended Security Controls:
- recommended security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to detect potential code-level vulnerabilities.
- recommended security control: Integrate Dependency Scanning to identify and manage vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
- recommended security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing by external security experts.
- recommended security control: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure and response process.
- recommended security control: Implement code signing for releases to ensure integrity and authenticity.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication: Not directly applicable to a cryptographic library itself. Authentication is the responsibility of applications using CryptoSwift.
- Authorization: Not directly applicable to a cryptographic library itself. Authorization is the responsibility of applications using CryptoSwift.
- Input Validation: Critical for all cryptographic functions to prevent vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, format string bugs, and injection attacks. The library must handle invalid or malformed inputs gracefully and securely.
- Cryptography:
    - Implement cryptographic algorithms correctly and according to established standards.
    - Provide secure defaults and guidance on choosing appropriate algorithms and parameters.
    - Protect cryptographic keys and sensitive data within the library's operations (though key management is primarily the responsibility of the application using the library).
    - Ensure resistance against known cryptographic attacks for implemented algorithms.

## DEPLOYMENT

CryptoSwift itself is not deployed as a standalone application. It is deployed as a library that is integrated into other Swift applications. The deployment architecture for CryptoSwift is therefore dependent on the deployment architecture of the Swift applications that use it.

Possible Deployment Scenarios for Swift Applications using CryptoSwift:

1. Mobile Applications (iOS, watchOS, tvOS): Deployed to user devices via app stores (Apple App Store).
2. macOS Applications: Distributed directly to users or via the Mac App Store.
3. Server-Side Applications (Linux): Deployed to cloud environments (AWS, Azure, GCP), on-premise servers, or containerized environments (Docker, Kubernetes).
4. Embedded Systems: Deployed to resource-constrained devices running Swift.
