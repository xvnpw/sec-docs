*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define CryptoSwift Abstraction Interface:** Design an interface that abstracts away the direct use of CryptoSwift APIs. This interface should represent the cryptographic operations your application needs, without exposing CryptoSwift directly.
    2.  **Implement CryptoSwift Abstraction Layer:** Create a module or class that implements the defined interface, using CryptoSwift internally to perform the actual cryptographic operations. This layer wraps CryptoSwift.
    3.  **Enforce Secure Defaults in Abstraction (CryptoSwift Context):** Within this abstraction layer, set secure default algorithms and modes of operation *that are supported by CryptoSwift*. For example, default to using AES-256-GCM as implemented in CryptoSwift.
