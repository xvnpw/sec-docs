## Attack Tree Path: [Connection Establishment Attacks - Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack during Handshake - Downgrade to Unencrypted WebSocket (WS) - Force Client to Accept WS instead of WSS](./attack_tree_paths/connection_establishment_attacks_-_man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_during_handshake_-_downgrade_to_u_ebacc9fc.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attacker intercepts the WebSocket handshake and manipulates it to force the client to establish an unencrypted WebSocket (WS) connection instead of the secure WebSocket over TLS (WSS).
*   **Likelihood:** Medium - Depends on network environment, attacker positioning, and client/server configuration. Less likely if WSS is strictly enforced and HSTS is in place.
*   **Impact:** High - All WebSocket traffic becomes plaintext, allowing interception, eavesdropping, and manipulation of sensitive data.
*   **Effort:** Medium - Requires network interception tools and positioning within the network path.
*   **Skill Level:** Medium - Requires understanding of network protocols and MITM techniques.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Can be detected by monitoring for downgrade attempts, TLS alerts, and network anomalies, but may be subtle if done correctly.

## Attack Tree Path: [Connection Establishment Attacks - Server Impersonation - Compromise DNS/Routing to Redirect to Malicious Server](./attack_tree_paths/connection_establishment_attacks_-_server_impersonation_-_compromise_dnsrouting_to_redirect_to_malic_34626c5c.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attacker compromises DNS servers or network routing infrastructure to redirect the client's WebSocket connection requests to a malicious server under their control.
*   **Likelihood:** Low - DNS infrastructure is generally hardened, but DNS poisoning and routing attacks are still possible in certain environments.
*   **Impact:** High - Client connects to attacker's server, allowing full control over communication, data theft, and potential malicious actions executed on behalf of the legitimate server.
*   **Effort:** Medium to High - DNS poisoning is complex, routing attacks depend on network access.
*   **Skill Level:** Medium to High - Requires networking expertise and knowledge of DNS/routing protocols.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - DNS monitoring, certificate pinning on the client-side can help, but successful redirection might be hard to detect without these measures.

## Attack Tree Path: [Connection Establishment Attacks - Server Impersonation - Rogue Access Point (if mobile app context)](./attack_tree_paths/connection_establishment_attacks_-_server_impersonation_-_rogue_access_point__if_mobile_app_context_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attacker sets up a rogue Wi-Fi access point that intercepts and redirects network traffic from unsuspecting users, including WebSocket connections from mobile applications.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium - Relatively easy to set up a rogue AP, especially in public places. Targets users on public or untrusted Wi-Fi networks.
*   **Impact:** High - MITM position, allowing interception and manipulation of all traffic, including WebSocket communication.
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium - Rogue AP tools are readily available.
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium - Basic networking knowledge and tool usage.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium - Users might notice unusual network behavior, but often difficult for average users to detect. Network monitoring can detect rogue APs.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Transmission/Reception Attacks - Message Injection/Manipulation - Inject Malicious WebSocket Frames - Exploit Vulnerabilities in Application's Message Handling Logic](./attack_tree_paths/data_transmissionreception_attacks_-_message_injectionmanipulation_-_inject_malicious_websocket_fram_dfb7208d.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attacker crafts and injects malicious WebSocket frames into the communication stream, exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application processes and handles incoming messages.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium - Depends heavily on the application's input validation and message processing logic. Common vulnerability if not handled properly.
*   **Impact:** High - Can lead to command injection, data manipulation, unauthorized actions, cross-site scripting (if messages are displayed in a web view), and other application-specific vulnerabilities.
*   **Effort:** Medium - Requires understanding of application's WebSocket protocol and message format. Crafting malicious payloads tailored to application logic.
*   **Skill Level:** Medium - Requires understanding of application logic and common injection techniques.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Application-level monitoring of message content, anomaly detection, and input validation logs can help, but successful injection can be subtle.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Transmission/Reception Attacks - Message Injection/Manipulation - Modify WebSocket Frames in Transit (after MITM)](./attack_tree_paths/data_transmissionreception_attacks_-_message_injectionmanipulation_-_modify_websocket_frames_in_tran_7eb6a953.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** After successfully performing a MITM attack (e.g., via WS downgrade or rogue AP), the attacker intercepts and modifies WebSocket frames as they are transmitted between the client and server.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium - Requires successful MITM attack first. Then, frame modification is relatively straightforward.
*   **Impact:** High - Can alter application behavior, manipulate data exchanged between client and server, or inject malicious commands by modifying message content.
*   **Effort:** Medium - Requires MITM setup and tools to intercept and modify WebSocket frames in real-time.
*   **Skill Level:** Medium - Requires MITM skills and understanding of WebSocket protocol to effectively modify frames.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - TLS alerts if WSS downgrade occurred, network anomaly detection might help, but frame modification itself might be hard to detect without application-level integrity checks and message signing.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Transmission/Reception Attacks - Message Injection/Manipulation - Replay Attacks (if no proper nonce/anti-replay mechanisms in application protocol)](./attack_tree_paths/data_transmissionreception_attacks_-_message_injectionmanipulation_-_replay_attacks__if_no_proper_no_de0ec1e9.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attacker captures legitimate WebSocket messages and re-sends (replays) them later to perform unauthorized actions, especially if the application protocol lacks proper nonce or anti-replay mechanisms.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium - Depends on application protocol design. If no anti-replay measures are implemented, it's easily exploitable.
*   **Impact:** Medium to High - Replay legitimate actions, potentially leading to unauthorized transactions, state changes, or privilege escalation, depending on the application's functionality.
*   **Effort:** Low - Requires capturing legitimate WebSocket messages and re-sending them using readily available network tools.
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium - Basic network capture and replay tools knowledge. Understanding of application workflow to identify valuable messages to replay.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Requires application-level logging and sequence number/nonce tracking to detect replays. Without these, it's hard to detect replay attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Starscream Library Specific Vulnerabilities - Known CVEs in Starscream - Exploit Publicly Disclosed Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/starscream_library_specific_vulnerabilities_-_known_cves_in_starscream_-_exploit_publicly_disclosed__e6c47b2e.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attacker exploits publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities (CVEs) in specific versions of the Starscream library.
*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium - Depends on whether CVEs exist for the Starscream version in use and if patches are diligently applied. Likelihood is high if using outdated and vulnerable versions.
*   **Impact:** High - Depends on the specific CVE, could range from code execution on the client device, denial of service, to information disclosure.
*   **Effort:** Low - Public exploits are often readily available for known CVEs, making exploitation relatively easy.
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium - Using existing exploits is generally low skill, understanding the CVE details and adapting exploits might require more skill.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low - Vulnerability scanners easily detect known CVEs. Patch management and version control are key to prevent this.

## Attack Tree Path: [Starscream Library Specific Vulnerabilities - Outdated Starscream Version - Exploit Fixed Vulnerabilities in Older Versions](./attack_tree_paths/starscream_library_specific_vulnerabilities_-_outdated_starscream_version_-_exploit_fixed_vulnerabil_9b217864.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attacker targets applications using outdated Starscream versions that are known to have vulnerabilities that have been fixed in newer releases.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium - Developers sometimes neglect to update dependencies. Likelihood is high if the application is not actively maintained or dependency updates are not prioritized.
*   **Impact:** High - Exploiting known, fixed vulnerabilities can lead to various impacts depending on the specific CVEs that are present in the outdated version.
*   **Effort:** Low - Public exploits or vulnerability information is often available for known CVEs in older versions, making exploitation relatively easy.
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium - Using existing exploits is generally low skill.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low - Version checks and vulnerability scanners easily detect outdated versions of libraries. Patch management and version control are crucial.

## Attack Tree Path: [Misuse of Starscream by Application Developers - Improper Input Validation on Received WebSocket Messages - Application-Level Injection Vulnerabilities (e.g., Command Injection, SQL Injection if data used in backend)](./attack_tree_paths/misuse_of_starscream_by_application_developers_-_improper_input_validation_on_received_websocket_mes_ca53d082.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Application developers fail to properly validate and sanitize data received via WebSocket messages before using it in application logic, leading to application-level injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Likelihood:** High - Common developer mistake. Input validation is often overlooked, especially for data received through less traditional channels like WebSockets.
*   **Impact:** High - Command injection, SQL injection (if WebSocket data is used in backend database queries), or other application-level injection vulnerabilities can lead to full application compromise, data breaches, and unauthorized access to backend systems.
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium - Standard injection attack techniques are applicable.
*   **Skill Level:** Medium - Understanding of injection vulnerabilities and application logic to identify vulnerable injection points.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Application-level monitoring of message processing, input validation testing, and security code review are needed to detect and prevent these vulnerabilities. Standard web application firewalls might not be effective for WebSocket traffic without specific configuration and awareness of the application protocol.
