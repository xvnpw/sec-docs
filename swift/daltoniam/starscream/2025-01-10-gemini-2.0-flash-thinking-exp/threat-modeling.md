# Threat Model Analysis for daltoniam/starscream

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle Attack due to Insecure TLS/SSL Configuration](./threats/man-in-the-middle_attack_due_to_insecure_tlsssl_configuration.md)

*   **Threat:** Man-in-the-Middle Attack due to Insecure TLS/SSL Configuration
    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts communication between the client application and the WebSocket server. They can eavesdrop on the data being exchanged and potentially modify it before forwarding it to either party. This is possible if **Starscream** is configured to allow weak or outdated TLS/SSL protocols or cipher suites.
    *   **Impact:** Confidential data transmitted over the WebSocket connection could be exposed to the attacker. The attacker could also tamper with the data, leading to data corruption or unexpected application behavior.
    *   **Affected Starscream Component:** **Starscream's** TLS/SSL Handling during connection establishment. Specifically, the configuration options related to `Security` and `Socket` settings.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong TLS/SSL versions (TLS 1.2 or higher) and secure cipher suites in **Starscream's** configuration.
        *   Disable support for older, vulnerable protocols like SSLv3 and TLS 1.0 within **Starscream's** settings.
        *   Regularly update **Starscream** to benefit from security patches related to TLS/SSL.

## Threat: [Server Impersonation due to Missing or Improper Certificate Validation](./threats/server_impersonation_due_to_missing_or_improper_certificate_validation.md)

*   **Threat:** Server Impersonation due to Missing or Improper Certificate Validation
    *   **Description:** An attacker sets up a rogue WebSocket server that presents a fraudulent or self-signed SSL/TLS certificate. If the client application using **Starscream** doesn't properly validate the server's certificate, it might unknowingly connect to the malicious server.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker can intercept and potentially modify all communication. They could also trick the application into sending sensitive information to the fake server.
    *   **Affected Starscream Component:** **Starscream's** `Security` configuration related to certificate pinning or trust evaluation. The `Socket` component within **Starscream** responsible for establishing the secure connection.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure the application is configured to validate the server's SSL/TLS certificate against a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) using **Starscream's** provided mechanisms.
        *   Consider implementing certificate pinning within **Starscream's** configuration to explicitly trust only specific certificates.
        *   Avoid disabling certificate validation within **Starscream's** settings in production environments.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in WebSocket Frame Parsing Logic](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_websocket_frame_parsing_logic.md)

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in WebSocket Frame Parsing Logic
    *   **Description:** A malicious WebSocket server sends specially crafted or malformed WebSocket frames that exploit vulnerabilities in **Starscream's** frame parsing logic. This could lead to crashes, denial of service, or potentially even remote code execution on the client device.
    *   **Impact:** The client application could become unstable or unresponsive. In severe cases, an attacker might gain control of the client device.
    *   **Affected Starscream Component:** **Starscream's** internal components responsible for parsing incoming WebSocket frames, specifically the logic within the `WebSocketFrame` and related classes.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep **Starscream** updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches that address known vulnerabilities in frame parsing.
        *   While the primary responsibility lies within **Starscream**, implement robust error handling around WebSocket message processing in the application to potentially mitigate some consequences of malformed frames.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion due to Malicious Server Messages](./threats/resource_exhaustion_due_to_malicious_server_messages.md)

*   **Threat:** Resource Exhaustion due to Malicious Server Messages
    *   **Description:** A malicious server sends an excessive number of messages or extremely large messages to the client application, overwhelming its resources (CPU, memory, network). This threat is amplified if **Starscream** doesn't have adequate internal safeguards against such attacks.
    *   **Impact:** The client application becomes slow, unresponsive, or crashes, leading to a denial of service.
    *   **Affected Starscream Component:** **Starscream's** `WebSocket` class responsible for receiving and processing incoming messages. The underlying `Socket` within **Starscream** for handling network traffic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   While application-level rate limiting is crucial, investigate if **Starscream** provides any configuration options for internal message buffering or handling limits that can be tuned.
        *   Set maximum message size limits in the application's handling of data received through **Starscream**.
        *   Implement appropriate timeouts for WebSocket operations managed by **Starscream**.
