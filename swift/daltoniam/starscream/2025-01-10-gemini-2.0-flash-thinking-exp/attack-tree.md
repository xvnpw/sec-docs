## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Connection Establishment Weaknesses (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_connection_establishment_weaknesses__critical_node_.md)

This critical node represents a fundamental weakness in how the WebSocket connection is established and secured. Successful exploitation here can undermine the entire communication channel.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Bypass TLS/SSL Verification (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
        *   **Supplying Invalid or Self-Signed Certificates:** An attacker could intercept the initial TLS handshake and present a fraudulent certificate. If the application doesn't perform proper certificate validation (e.g., checking against trusted CAs, certificate pinning), it might establish a connection with the attacker's server, believing it's the legitimate server. This allows the attacker to perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack.
        *   **Downgrade Attack to Unencrypted Connection:** An attacker could manipulate the TLS negotiation process to force the client and server to communicate over an unencrypted WebSocket connection (ws:// instead of wss://). This exposes all transmitted data to eavesdropping. This requires the server to be misconfigured to allow unencrypted connections.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Payloads (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_payloads__high-risk_path_.md)

This high-risk path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's handling of data received through the WebSocket connection.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Sending Crafted Messages Exploiting Server-Side Vulnerabilities:** An attacker can craft specific WebSocket messages containing malicious data designed to exploit vulnerabilities on the server-side. This could include:
        *   **Command Injection:** Injecting commands into data that the server executes.
        *   **SQL Injection:** Injecting malicious SQL code into database queries.
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Injecting malicious scripts that are executed by other users.
        *   **Business Logic Exploitation:** Sending messages that manipulate the application's intended behavior in a harmful way.
        This attack relies on the application failing to properly sanitize or validate the input received via the WebSocket connection.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Starscream Library Specific Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_starscream_library_specific_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

This critical node targets vulnerabilities directly within the Starscream library itself. Exploiting these vulnerabilities can have a significant impact as it compromises the client's ability to securely communicate.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Trigger Known Bugs or CVEs (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
        *   **Utilizing Publicly Disclosed Vulnerabilities in Specific Starscream Versions:** If the application uses an outdated version of Starscream with known security vulnerabilities (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures - CVEs), an attacker can leverage publicly available exploits to compromise the application. These vulnerabilities could range from memory corruption issues leading to remote code execution to logic flaws that allow for bypassing security checks or causing denial of service. The ease of exploitation depends on the availability and maturity of the exploits. Regular updates to the Starscream library are crucial to mitigate this risk.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Known Bugs or CVEs (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_known_bugs_or_cves__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Utilizing Publicly Disclosed Vulnerabilities in Specific Starscream Versions:** If the application uses an outdated version of Starscream with known security vulnerabilities (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures - CVEs), an attacker can leverage publicly available exploits to compromise the application.
