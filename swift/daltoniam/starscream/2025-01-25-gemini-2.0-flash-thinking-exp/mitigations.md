## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Starscream](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_starscream.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Regularly Update Starscream

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor Starscream releases:** Regularly check the Starscream GitHub repository or release notes for new versions.
    2.  **Update dependency in project:**  When a new version is available, update the Starscream dependency in your project's dependency management file (e.g., `Podfile` for iOS, `build.gradle` for Android, `Package.swift` for Swift Package Manager).
    3.  **Test after update:** After updating, thoroughly test your application's websocket functionality to ensure compatibility and no regressions were introduced by the update.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Outdated Starscream versions may contain publicly known security vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities:** Significantly reduces the risk by patching known vulnerabilities within the Starscream library itself.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Yes, we are using a dependency management system (Cocoapods for iOS) and generally try to keep dependencies updated, including Starscream.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   We don't have an automated system to alert us to new Starscream releases or automatically create pull requests for updates. This process is currently manual.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce TLS/SSL (wss://) via Starscream Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_tlsssl__wss__via_starscream_configuration.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Enforce TLS/SSL (wss://) via Starscream Configuration

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use `wss://` with Starscream:** When initializing a Starscream `WebSocket` object, ensure the connection URL starts with `wss://` instead of `ws://`. Starscream will automatically handle TLS/SSL handshake when `wss://` is used.
    2.  **Avoid Disabling TLS in Starscream:**  Review your Starscream client code and ensure you are not explicitly disabling TLS/SSL settings within Starscream's configuration options.  Starscream defaults to TLS when `wss://` is used, so explicit disabling should be avoided unless absolutely necessary and with full security understanding.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Eavesdropping (High Severity):**  Without TLS, websocket communication via Starscream is in plain text.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (High Severity):** Without TLS, attackers can intercept and modify websocket communication facilitated by Starscream.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Eavesdropping:**  Completely eliminates the risk of eavesdropping on Starscream websocket communication by encrypting the channel.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:**  Significantly reduces the risk for Starscream websocket connections by providing authentication and integrity checks.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Yes, all our Starscream websocket connections are currently initiated using `wss://`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   We don't have automated checks to strictly enforce the use of `wss://` with Starscream and prevent accidental use of `ws://` in Starscream initialization.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Verify Server Certificate using Starscream's SSL Settings](./mitigation_strategies/verify_server_certificate_using_starscream's_ssl_settings.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Verify Server Certificate using Starscream's SSL Settings

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Rely on Starscream's Default Verification:** Starscream, by default, performs server certificate verification when using `wss://`. Ensure you are leveraging this default behavior and not overriding it to disable verification.
    2.  **Custom Certificate Pinning via Starscream's SSL Configuration (Advanced):** For enhanced security, utilize Starscream's SSL settings to implement certificate pinning. This involves providing Starscream with the expected server certificate or public key to validate against during the TLS handshake.  Starscream's API allows customization of SSL settings for this purpose.
    3.  **Handle Starscream Connection Errors:** Implement error handling in your Starscream delegate methods to catch connection errors, including those related to certificate verification failures reported by Starscream. Log these errors for investigation.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (High Severity):**  Without certificate verification in Starscream, a client might connect to a fraudulent server when using Starscream.
    *   **Compromised Server (Medium Severity):** Certificate pinning via Starscream can mitigate risks even if a Certificate Authority is compromised, by limiting trust to pre-approved certificates configured within Starscream.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:**  Significantly reduces the risk for Starscream connections by ensuring connections only to servers with valid certificates as verified by Starscream.
    *   **Compromised Server (with pinning):** Further reduces the risk for Starscream connections by limiting trust to specific certificates configured within Starscream.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially. We rely on Starscream's default certificate verification.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   We are not currently implementing certificate pinning using Starscream's SSL configuration.  We also lack specific error handling and logging for certificate verification failures reported by Starscream, relying on general Starscream connection error handling.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Error Handling for Starscream Events](./mitigation_strategies/implement_error_handling_for_starscream_events.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Implement Error Handling for Starscream Events

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement Starscream Delegate Methods:**  Thoroughly implement all relevant delegate methods provided by Starscream (e.g., `websocketDidReceiveError`, `websocketDidDisconnect`, `websocketDidReceiveMessage`).
    2.  **Handle Errors Gracefully in Starscream Delegates:** Within these delegate methods, implement robust error handling logic. Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages or logs triggered by Starscream events.
    3.  **Log Starscream Errors Securely:** Log errors reported by Starscream in a secure manner, avoiding logging sensitive data from error details. Use logging for debugging and monitoring websocket connection health.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Low to Medium Severity):** Poor error handling in Starscream delegate methods could unintentionally expose sensitive information in error messages or logs.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Low Severity):**  While less direct, unhandled errors in Starscream event handling could potentially contribute to application instability or unexpected behavior under stress.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Reduces the risk by preventing sensitive information leaks through Starscream error handling.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Minimally reduces DoS risk by improving application robustness in handling Starscream related errors.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially. We have implemented some Starscream delegate methods, but error handling within them could be more robust and security-focused.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   We need to review and enhance error handling in all Starscream delegate methods to ensure graceful error handling, prevent information disclosure in error messages, and implement secure logging of Starscream related errors.
