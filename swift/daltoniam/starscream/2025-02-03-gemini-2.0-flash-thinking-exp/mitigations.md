## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce TLS/SSL (WSS) with Starscream](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_tlsssl__wss__with_starscream.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use `wss://` Scheme with Starscream:** When initializing a `WebSocket` object in Starscream, always use the `wss://` scheme in the WebSocket URL string instead of `ws://` for production connections.
    2.  **Verify `wss://` Configuration:** Double-check your code where you create Starscream `WebSocket` instances to ensure `wss://` is consistently used for secure connections.
    3.  **Rely on Starscream's Default TLS:** Starscream defaults to using TLS when `wss://` is specified. Ensure you are not inadvertently disabling TLS configuration options provided by Starscream unless for specific, controlled testing.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (High Severity):** Using `ws://` with Starscream (unencrypted WebSocket) makes communication vulnerable to MitM attacks.

    *   **Data Tampering (Medium Severity):** In `ws://` connections with Starscream, attackers can tamper with messages.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (High Impact):** Enforcing `wss://` with Starscream and TLS/SSL effectively mitigates MitM attacks for WebSocket communication handled by Starscream.
    *   **Data Eavesdropping (High Impact):** TLS/SSL encryption within Starscream renders WebSocket traffic unreadable to eavesdroppers.
    *   **Data Tampering (Medium Impact):** TLS/SSL provides integrity checks, making tampering difficult when using Starscream with `wss://`.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Use `wss://` Scheme with Starscream:** Yes, `wss://` is used for WebSocket connections in production code using Starscream.
    *   **Verify `wss://` Configuration:** Yes, code review process includes verification of `wss://` usage with Starscream.
    *   **Rely on Starscream's Default TLS:** Yes, default TLS configuration of Starscream is used.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Proper Handshake Validation using Starscream Delegates](./mitigation_strategies/implement_proper_handshake_validation_using_starscream_delegates.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize Starscream Delegate for Handshake Access:** Use Starscream's delegate methods, specifically `websocketDidConnect(_:headers:)`, to access the handshake headers received from the server after a successful WebSocket connection is established.
    2.  **Validate Handshake Headers in Delegate:** Within the `websocketDidConnect` delegate method, implement validation logic to check relevant handshake headers (e.g., `Sec-WebSocket-Accept`, `Upgrade`, `Connection`, custom headers) provided by Starscream.
    3.  **Validate Subprotocol in Delegate (If Applicable):** If using subprotocols, validate the negotiated subprotocol from the handshake within the Starscream delegate method to ensure it's the expected one.
    4.  **Handle Validation Failures in Delegate:** If handshake validation fails within the delegate method, trigger connection closure using Starscream's API and log the failure.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Connection to Unauthorized or Malicious WebSocket Servers (Medium Severity):** Handshake validation using Starscream delegates can help prevent connections to unintended servers.
