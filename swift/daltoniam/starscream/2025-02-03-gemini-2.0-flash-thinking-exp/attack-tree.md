## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Starscream Vulnerabilities/Weaknesses (High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_starscream_vulnerabilitiesweaknesses__high-risk_path_.md)

*   This is the top-level path focusing on directly exploiting issues related to Starscream or its usage. It branches into connection establishment, data transmission, library-specific flaws, and developer misuse.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Connection Establishment Attacks (High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/2__connection_establishment_attacks__high-risk_path_.md)

*   Attackers target the initial handshake process to compromise the connection's security.
    *   **1.1. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack during Handshake (High-Risk Path):**
        *   An attacker intercepts the handshake to manipulate the connection.
            *   **1.1.1. Downgrade to Unencrypted WebSocket (WS) (High-Risk Path):**
                *   The attacker forces the client to use an insecure WS connection instead of WSS.
                    *   **1.1.1.1. Force Client to Accept WS instead of WSS (Critical Node):**
                        *   If the application or Starscream is not strictly enforcing WSS, an attacker can manipulate the handshake to negotiate a WS connection, exposing all traffic in plaintext.
    *   **1.2. Server Impersonation (High-Risk Path):**
        *   The attacker tricks the client into connecting to a malicious server.
            *   **1.2.1. Compromise DNS/Routing to Redirect to Malicious Server (Critical Node):**
                *   By compromising DNS or routing, the attacker redirects the client's WebSocket requests to their own server, gaining full control over communication.
            *   **1.2.2. Rogue Access Point (if mobile app context) (Critical Node):**
                *   In mobile environments, a rogue Wi-Fi access point can intercept and redirect network traffic, including WebSocket connections, enabling server impersonation.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Data Transmission/Reception Attacks (High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/3__data_transmissionreception_attacks__high-risk_path_.md)

*   Attackers target the data exchange after a connection is established to inject, modify, or replay messages.
    *   **2.1. Message Injection/Manipulation (High-Risk Path):**
        *   Attackers attempt to insert malicious messages or alter legitimate ones.
            *   **2.1.1. Inject Malicious WebSocket Frames (High-Risk Path):**
                *   Attackers send crafted WebSocket frames to the client application.
                    *   **2.1.1.1. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Application's Message Handling Logic (Critical Node):**
                        *   If the application lacks proper input validation, injected malicious frames can exploit vulnerabilities like command injection or cross-site scripting.
            *   **2.1.2. Modify WebSocket Frames in Transit (after MITM) (Critical Node):**
                *   If a MITM attack is successful, attackers can intercept and modify WebSocket frames as they are transmitted, altering application behavior or data.
            *   **2.1.3. Replay Attacks (if no proper nonce/anti-replay mechanisms in application protocol) (Critical Node):**
                *   If the application protocol lacks anti-replay measures, attackers can capture and resend legitimate messages to perform unauthorized actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Starscream Library Specific Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/4__starscream_library_specific_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

*   Attackers exploit known weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the Starscream library itself.
    *   **3.1. Known CVEs in Starscream (Check for published vulnerabilities) (High-Risk Path):**
        *   Attackers target publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities in specific Starscream versions.
            *   **3.1.1. Exploit Publicly Disclosed Vulnerabilities (Critical Node):**
                *   Attackers leverage known CVEs to directly exploit vulnerable Starscream versions. Using outdated versions makes this attack highly likely if CVEs exist.
    *   **3.4. Outdated Starscream Version (High-Risk Path):**
        *   Using an old, unpatched version of Starscream exposes the application to known vulnerabilities.
            *   **3.4.1. Exploit Fixed Vulnerabilities in Older Versions (Critical Node):**
                *   Attackers target applications using outdated Starscream versions that are known to have vulnerabilities fixed in newer releases.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Misuse of Starscream by Application Developers (High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/5__misuse_of_starscream_by_application_developers__high-risk_path_.md)

*   Vulnerabilities arise from how developers use Starscream, rather than flaws in Starscream itself.
    *   **4.2. Improper Input Validation on Received WebSocket Messages (High-Risk Path):**
        *   The application's code processing WebSocket messages lacks proper input validation.
            *   **4.2.1. Application-Level Injection Vulnerabilities (e.g., Command Injection, SQL Injection if data used in backend) (Critical Node):**
                *   If the application doesn't sanitize or validate data received via WebSocket before using it in backend operations or displaying it, it becomes vulnerable to injection attacks like command injection or SQL injection. This is a very common and high-impact vulnerability.
