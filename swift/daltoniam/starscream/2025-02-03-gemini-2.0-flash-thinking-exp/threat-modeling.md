# Threat Model Analysis for daltoniam/starscream

## Threat: [Known Vulnerabilities in Starscream (CVEs)](./threats/known_vulnerabilities_in_starscream__cves_.md)

*   **Description:** Starscream itself might contain publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) that attackers can exploit if the application uses a vulnerable version. Attackers could leverage these vulnerabilities to compromise the client application.
*   **Impact:** Application compromise, potentially leading to code execution, data breaches, or denial of service, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
*   **Starscream Component Affected:**  Potentially any component of Starscream, depending on the specific vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the severity of the CVE)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regularly monitor security advisories and CVE databases for Starscream.**
    *   **Subscribe to Starscream's GitHub repository releases and security announcements.**
    *   **Promptly update Starscream to the latest version to patch any identified vulnerabilities.**
    *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in Starscream and its dependencies.

## Threat: [Insecure WebSocket Connection (ws://)](./threats/insecure_websocket_connection__ws_.md)

*   **Description:** Configuring the application to use `ws://` instead of `wss://` for WebSocket connections results in unencrypted communication. An attacker performing a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack can eavesdrop on the communication, intercept messages, and potentially inject malicious messages. This directly involves Starscream's connection establishment as it's configured to use `ws://`.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, data interception, potential for message manipulation and injection, compromising data integrity and potentially application security.
*   **Starscream Component Affected:** Connection establishment and networking layer within Starscream.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always use `wss://` for WebSocket connections in production environments.**
    *   **Enforce TLS for WebSocket connections and disable fallback to `ws://` if possible.**
    *   Educate developers about the importance of using `wss://`.
