# BUSINESS POSTURE

The Starscream project is a Swift WebSocket client library. Its primary business priority is to provide a robust, efficient, and easy-to-use WebSocket client for Swift developers. This enables developers to build real-time communication features into their applications for various use cases, such as chat applications, live data streaming, and interactive games. The success of Starscream is tied to its adoption by the Swift developer community, which in turn depends on its reliability, performance, and security.

Key business goals for Starscream include:

*   Providing a stable and reliable WebSocket client library.
*   Maintaining compatibility with the latest Swift versions and platforms.
*   Ensuring good performance and low resource consumption.
*   Offering a simple and intuitive API for developers.
*   Building a strong community around the library.

The most important business risks that need to be addressed are:

*   Security vulnerabilities in the library that could be exploited by malicious actors, leading to data breaches or application compromise in applications using Starscream.
*   Instability or bugs in the library that could cause application crashes or unreliable communication, damaging the reputation and adoption of Starscream.
*   Lack of maintenance or updates, leading to incompatibility with newer Swift versions or security vulnerabilities remaining unpatched, which would discourage developers from using Starscream.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls for the Starscream project are primarily those inherent in open-source software development and the Swift ecosystem:

*   security control: Code is publicly available on GitHub, allowing for community review and scrutiny. Implemented: GitHub repository.
*   security control: Issue tracking on GitHub allows users to report bugs and potential security vulnerabilities. Implemented: GitHub issue tracker.
*   security control: Dependency management is handled by Swift Package Manager, which helps in managing and updating dependencies. Implemented: Swift Package Manager manifest (Package.swift).
*   accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability identification and patching.
*   accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in dependencies that Starscream uses.
*   accepted risk: Security vulnerabilities might exist in the code that are not yet discovered.

Recommended security controls to implement:

*   recommended security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to detect potential vulnerabilities in the code.
*   recommended security control: Regularly update dependencies and perform dependency vulnerability scanning to identify and address vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
*   recommended security control: Establish a clear process for handling security vulnerability reports, including a security policy and dedicated communication channel.
*   recommended security control: Conduct periodic security focused code reviews, potentially involving external security experts.

Security requirements for Starscream:

*   Authentication:
    *   Requirement: Starscream should support WebSocket authentication mechanisms, such as HTTP Authentication or custom authentication schemes, to allow applications to establish secure WebSocket connections with authenticated servers.
    *   Existing security control: TLS/SSL encryption for WebSocket connections (wss://) provides transport layer security and server authentication. Implemented: Within the networking layer of the library, leveraging platform capabilities.
*   Authorization:
    *   Requirement: Starscream itself does not handle authorization, as it is a client-side library. Authorization logic resides in the application using Starscream and the WebSocket server. Starscream should provide mechanisms to pass authorization tokens or credentials to the server during connection establishment.
    *   Existing security control:  Applications using Starscream are responsible for implementing authorization logic based on their specific needs. Implemented: Application code using Starscream.
*   Input Validation:
    *   Requirement: Starscream must perform robust input validation on data received from the WebSocket server to prevent vulnerabilities such as injection attacks or denial-of-service. This includes validating message formats, data types, and sizes.
    *   Existing security control: Basic input validation is likely present within the library to handle WebSocket protocol messages correctly. Implemented: Within the WebSocket message processing logic of the library.
*   Cryptography:
    *   Requirement: Starscream must use strong cryptography for secure WebSocket connections (wss://) using TLS/SSL. It should support modern TLS versions and cipher suites and avoid deprecated or weak cryptographic algorithms.
    *   Existing security control: TLS/SSL encryption is supported for secure WebSocket connections. Implemented:  Leveraging platform provided TLS/SSL libraries.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process we are trying to protect:

*   Reliable and secure real-time communication in applications using Starscream. Disruption or compromise of this process can lead to application malfunction, data breaches, and reputational damage.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:

*   Data transmitted over WebSocket connections using Starscream. The sensitivity of this data depends entirely on the application using the library. It could range from public information to highly sensitive personal or financial data.
*   Source code of the Starscream library itself. While publicly available, unauthorized modification or injection of malicious code could compromise the library and applications using it.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   What are the typical use cases for Starscream in applications? Understanding the common use cases will help to better tailor security recommendations and threat modeling.
*   Are there any specific compliance requirements that applications using Starscream need to adhere to (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)? This would influence the required security controls.
*   What is the expected level of security expertise of developers who will be using Starscream? This will help determine the level of detail and guidance needed in security documentation and recommendations.

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: It is assumed that the primary business goal is to provide a secure and reliable WebSocket client library for the Swift community.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: It is assumed that while basic security practices are in place (open source review, issue reporting), there is room for improvement in automated security checks and formalized security processes.
*   DESIGN: It is assumed that the current design of Starscream is modular and allows for the implementation of security controls at different levels (connection handling, message parsing, API). It is also assumed that developers using Starscream are responsible for implementing application-level security measures.
