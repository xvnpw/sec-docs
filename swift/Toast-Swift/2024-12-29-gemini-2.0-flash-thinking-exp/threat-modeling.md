Here's the updated threat list focusing on high and critical threats directly involving the `Toast-Swift` library:

*   **Threat:** Content Injection / Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Toast Messages
    *   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code into the data that is displayed within a toast message. This occurs if the application passes unsanitized or unencoded data to `Toast-Swift`'s rendering mechanisms. When the toast is displayed, the injected code is executed within the context of the application's web page.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Stealing user credentials or session tokens.
        *   Performing actions on behalf of the user without their knowledge.
        *   Displaying misleading or harmful content.
        *   Redirecting the user to malicious websites.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `ToastView.swift`: Specifically the methods responsible for rendering the toast message content (e.g., setting the `text` property of a `UILabel`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and output encoding *before* passing data to the `Toast.show()` method or any function that sets the toast message content.
        *   Ensure the application does not directly pass user-controlled HTML or JavaScript to `Toast-Swift` for rendering.

*   **Threat:** UI Redressing / Clickjacking via Toast Overlays
    *   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate the timing or positioning of toast messages, potentially by exploiting vulnerabilities in how `Toast-Swift` manages the display, to overlay critical UI elements. This could trick users into clicking on unintended buttons or links hidden beneath the toast.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Users could unknowingly perform actions they didn't intend, such as confirming malicious transactions.
        *   Sensitive information could be revealed if a toast overlays an input field.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `ToastManager.swift`: The component responsible for managing the display and timing of toast messages.
        *   Potentially the `ToastView.swift` if custom positioning or animation logic within the library is exploitable.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully design the application's UI and the timing of toast messages to avoid any possibility of overlap with interactive elements.
        *   Review and potentially customize `Toast-Swift`'s positioning and animation logic to prevent malicious manipulation.

*   **Threat:** Dependency Confusion / Supply Chain Attacks
    *   **Description:** An attacker could substitute the legitimate `Toast-Swift` library with a malicious one if the application's dependency management is not secure. This malicious library, when used by the application, could perform arbitrary actions.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Complete compromise of the application, including data theft, malware installation, and unauthorized access.
        *   Introduction of vulnerabilities or backdoors into the application through the malicious `Toast-Swift` replacement.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   The application's dependency management system (e.g., Swift Package Manager) and the process of fetching and integrating external libraries like `Toast-Swift`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use dependency pinning to ensure that the application always uses the intended version of `Toast-Swift`.
        *   Verify the integrity of the downloaded library using checksums or other verification methods.
        *   Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using security scanning tools.
        *   Be cautious about adding dependencies from untrusted sources.
        *   Consider using a private or internal repository for managing dependencies.
