Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving Toast-Swift with high or critical severity:

**Key Attack Surfaces Directly Involving Toast-Swift (High & Critical Severity):**

* **Description:** Information Disclosure via Toast Messages
    * **How Toast-Swift Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Toast-Swift is the mechanism through which the message is displayed to the user. If developers inadvertently display sensitive information in toast messages, Toast-Swift facilitates this exposure.
    * **Example:** A developer might mistakenly display an API key, a user's private information, or an internal system status message in a toast.
    * **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data to the user or potentially through screen recordings or screenshots.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Carefully review all instances where toast messages are used and ensure no sensitive information is displayed. Treat toast messages as potentially visible to anyone using the device.
