```

**Detailed Breakdown of High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**High-Risk Paths:**

* **Path 1: Content Injection leading to Malicious Actions:**
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **Exploit Content Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate input before displaying it in a toast.
        * **Inject Malicious Deep Links/URLs:** An attacker crafts a toast message containing a malicious URL.
        * **Display Toast with Malicious URL:** The application displays the toast with the attacker's malicious URL.
        * **User Clicks Malicious Link:** An unsuspecting user clicks on the malicious link within the toast.
        * **Trigger Unintended Action in Application:** The malicious link, through a deep link or other mechanism, triggers an unintended action within the application.
        * **Open External Malicious Website:** The link redirects the user to a phishing site, malware distribution site, or other malicious website.
        * **Initiate Malicious In-App Functionality:** The deep link exploits a vulnerability in the application's deep link handling to perform a harmful action within the app itself (e.g., unauthorized data modification, privilege escalation).

* **Path 2: Content Injection leading to Phishing:**
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **Exploit Content Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate input before displaying it in a toast.
        * **Inject Phishing/Social Engineering Content:** An attacker crafts a toast message that mimics a legitimate system notification or login prompt.
        * **Display Toast Mimicking Legitimate System Messages:** The application displays the deceptive toast message.
        * **Trick User into Providing Credentials or Sensitive Information:** The user, believing the toast is legitimate, enters their credentials or other sensitive information into a fake form or provides it through other means.

* **Path 3: Information Disclosure:**
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **Exploit Potential for Information Disclosure:** Vulnerable code within the application inadvertently or intentionally includes sensitive information in the data passed to Toast-Swift.
        * **Display Sensitive Information in Toasts:** The application displays a toast message containing sensitive data.
        * **Leak User Data, API Keys, or Internal Application Details:** The sensitive information displayed in the toast is exposed to the user or potentially captured through screenshots or other means.
        * **Attacker Gains Unauthorized Access or Insights:** The leaked information (e.g., API keys, user credentials) allows the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the application's resources or user accounts.

* **Path 4: Content Injection leading to Format String Vulnerability:**
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **Exploit Content Injection:** The application allows user-controlled input to be passed into Toast-Swift without proper sanitization.
        * **Inject Format String Vulnerabilities:** An attacker crafts a specific string containing format specifiers (e.g., `%x`, `%n`).
        * **Control Format Specifiers:** If Toast-Swift internally uses insecure string formatting functions with this unsanitized input, the attacker's format specifiers are processed.
        * **Potentially Read Memory or Cause Application Crash:** By controlling the format specifiers, the attacker can potentially read arbitrary memory locations or cause the application to crash.

* **Path 5: Potential Interaction Vulnerabilities (If Toast-Swift is extended):**
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **Exploit Potential Interaction Vulnerabilities:** The application or a custom extension of Toast-Swift allows for interactive elements within the toast.
        * **Inject Malicious Actions into Interactive Toasts:** An attacker crafts a toast with interactive elements (e.g., buttons) that perform malicious actions.
        * **Trigger Unintended Functionality Upon User Interaction:** When the user interacts with the malicious element in the toast, unintended and harmful functionality is executed within the application.

**Critical Nodes:**

* **Exploit Content Injection:** This is the initial point of entry for several high-risk paths. If an attacker can control the content of the toast, they can launch various attacks.
* **Inject Malicious Deep Links/URLs:** This node represents the specific action of inserting a harmful link into a toast, leading to potential phishing or exploitation of application vulnerabilities.
* **Display Toast with Malicious URL:** This is the point where the malicious link is presented to the user, making it a critical point for detection and prevention.
* **Inject Phishing/Social Engineering Content:** This node represents the action of crafting a deceptive toast message to trick the user.
* **Display Toast Mimicking Legitimate System Messages:** This is the specific action that enables the phishing attack by making the malicious toast appear legitimate.
* **Exploit Potential for Information Disclosure:** This node represents the underlying vulnerability that allows sensitive information to be included in toast messages.
* **Display Sensitive Information in Toasts:** This is the direct action that leads to the leakage of sensitive data.

This focused view highlights the most critical areas of concern and allows the development team to concentrate their security efforts on preventing these high-risk scenarios.
