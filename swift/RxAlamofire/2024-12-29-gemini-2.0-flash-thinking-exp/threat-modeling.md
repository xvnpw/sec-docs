### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving RxAlamofire

This document outlines high and critical security threats that directly involve the use of the RxAlamofire library in Swift applications.

*   **Threat:** Dependency Vulnerability in Alamofire
    *   **Description:** An attacker could exploit a known security vulnerability present in the underlying Alamofire library. This could involve sending specially crafted requests or manipulating responses to trigger the vulnerability, as RxAlamofire relies on Alamofire for network operations.
    *   **Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in Alamofire. It could range from denial of service, information disclosure, to remote code execution on the application's server or the user's device.
    *   **Affected RxAlamofire Component:**  The underlying network request execution handled by Alamofire, which is used by all RxAlamofire functions that perform network requests (e.g., `requestData`, `requestJSON`, `upload`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the specific Alamofire vulnerability).

*   **Threat:** Resource Exhaustion due to Unmanaged Subscriptions
    *   **Description:** An attacker could trigger actions that cause the application to create numerous RxAlamofire subscriptions that are not properly disposed of. The reactive nature of RxAlamofire means that these unmanaged subscriptions can lead to memory leaks and excessive resource consumption if not handled correctly by the application developer.
    *   **Impact:** Application instability, performance degradation, and potential denial of service for legitimate users.
    *   **Affected RxAlamofire Component:** The reactive streams created by RxAlamofire functions (Observables). The responsibility for managing these subscriptions lies with the application code using RxAlamofire.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (if the application is prone to creating many long-lived or frequently created/destroyed subscriptions).

*   **Threat:** Information Disclosure through Error Streams
    *   **Description:** An attacker could trigger network errors or manipulate the backend to return error responses that contain sensitive information. If the application doesn't properly handle and sanitize these error streams *emitted by RxAlamofire*, this information could be logged, displayed to the user, or transmitted elsewhere, leading to information disclosure. The reactive nature means these errors are propagated through the observable stream.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data such as API keys, internal server details, user credentials, or other confidential information.
    *   **Affected RxAlamofire Component:** The error events emitted by RxAlamofire Observables when network requests fail.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the sensitivity of the information potentially exposed).

*   **Threat:** Ignoring Certificate Pinning leading to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)
    *   **Description:** If the application uses RxAlamofire over HTTPS but doesn't implement certificate pinning, an attacker performing a MitM attack could intercept and potentially modify communication between the application and the server. While the pinning mechanism is in Alamofire, the *lack* of its implementation when using RxAlamofire exposes the application.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, manipulation of data in transit, potential injection of malicious content.
    *   **Affected RxAlamofire Component:** The application's configuration (or lack thereof) of `ServerTrustManager` or similar within the Alamofire configuration used by RxAlamofire.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (if sensitive data is transmitted).
