# Threat Model Analysis for snapkit/masonry

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Data Passed to Masonry](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_data_passed_to_masonry.md)

- Description: An attacker injects malicious scripts into data (e.g., image captions, alt text) that is then used by the application and subsequently rendered by Masonry. When a user views the page, the malicious script executes in their browser. This could allow the attacker to steal cookies, redirect the user, or perform actions on their behalf.
- Impact: Account compromise, data theft, malware distribution, website defacement.
- Affected Component: Rendering process, specifically how Masonry handles and displays data provided to it.
- Risk Severity: Critical
- Mitigation Strategies:
    - Implement strict input sanitization for all user-provided data before it is used to generate content for Masonry.
    - Utilize output encoding when rendering data within the HTML elements managed by Masonry.
    - Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded and prevent inline script execution.

## Threat: [Bugs or Vulnerabilities within Masonry Itself](./threats/bugs_or_vulnerabilities_within_masonry_itself.md)

- Description: Like any software, Masonry might contain undiscovered bugs or security vulnerabilities in its own code. An attacker could potentially discover and exploit these vulnerabilities to cause unintended behavior or compromise the application.
- Impact: Depends on the nature of the vulnerability, potentially leading to XSS, DoS, or other client-side issues.
- Affected Component: Specific modules or functions within the Masonry library containing the vulnerability.
- Risk Severity: Can be Critical or High depending on the nature and exploitability of the vulnerability.
- Mitigation Strategies:
    - Stay informed about reported vulnerabilities in Masonry by monitoring the project's issue tracker and security advisories.
    - Consider using static analysis tools to identify potential code flaws in the application's usage of Masonry.
    - Keep Masonry updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
