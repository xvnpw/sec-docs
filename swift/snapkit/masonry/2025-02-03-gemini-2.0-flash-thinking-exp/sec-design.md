# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, represented by the Masonry Github repository, aims to provide a robust and flexible layout framework for iOS and macOS developers. The primary business priority is to offer a high-quality, easy-to-use library that simplifies the process of creating complex and responsive user interfaces. The goal is to empower developers to build better applications more efficiently, ultimately contributing to improved user experiences on Apple platforms.

Key business risks associated with this project include:

- Risk of introducing defects or bugs into the library that could lead to application crashes or incorrect UI rendering in applications that depend on Masonry. This could negatively impact the reputation of both the library and applications using it.
- Risk of performance issues within the library that could degrade the performance of applications using Masonry. Performance is critical for user experience, especially in mobile applications.
- Risk of security vulnerabilities being discovered in the library. While a layout library is less likely to directly handle sensitive data, vulnerabilities could potentially be exploited in unforeseen ways within applications that integrate Masonry.
- Risk of developer dissatisfaction if the library is difficult to use, poorly documented, or lacks necessary features. This could lead to decreased adoption and impact the project's goals.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls for the Masonry project are primarily focused on standard software development practices:

- security control: Code review process is likely in place for pull requests to ensure code quality and catch potential issues before merging. (Implemented in: Github Pull Request workflow)
- security control: Unit tests are present in the repository, indicating a focus on code correctness and preventing regressions. (Implemented in: Repository's test suite)

Accepted risks for the project, based on the nature of a library and typical open-source development practices, might include:

- accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions, which may introduce unforeseen vulnerabilities or code quality issues if not properly vetted.
- accepted risk: Potential for undiscovered vulnerabilities in dependencies (if any), although a layout library is expected to have minimal external dependencies.
- accepted risk: Bugs in the code that might not be caught by existing testing and review processes.

Recommended security controls to enhance the security posture of the Masonry project:

- recommended security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential code-level vulnerabilities early in the development process.
- recommended security control: Introduce dependency scanning to monitor for known vulnerabilities in any external libraries or components used by Masonry (though dependencies are expected to be minimal).
- recommended security control: Consider periodic security audits or penetration testing, especially if the library evolves to handle more complex or potentially sensitive operations.

Security requirements relevant to the Masonry project:

- Authentication: Not directly applicable as Masonry is a library and does not handle user authentication. Applications using Masonry will manage their own authentication mechanisms.
- Authorization: Not directly applicable as Masonry is a layout library and does not manage access control. Authorization is the responsibility of applications using Masonry.
- Input Validation: Important for Masonry's API. The library should validate inputs from developers to prevent unexpected behavior or crashes due to incorrect or malicious input. This includes validating constraints, layout parameters, and other configuration options provided by developers.
- Cryptography: Not directly applicable as Masonry is a layout library and is not expected to handle cryptographic operations. Applications using Masonry will manage their own cryptographic needs.

Build Process Description:

1. Developer writes and modifies the Masonry library source code using a code editor, typically Xcode.
2. Source code is managed in a version control system (like Git on Github).
3. The build process is initiated using Xcode's build system.
4. Xcode compiles the Objective-C/Swift code and links necessary components to create a framework.
5. Unit tests are executed to ensure code correctness and prevent regressions. If tests fail, developers need to fix the code and repeat the build process.
6. Recommended security checks are integrated into the build process:
    - Static Application Security Testing (SAST) is performed to identify potential code-level vulnerabilities. If issues are found, developers need to address them.
    - Dependency scanning is performed to check for known vulnerabilities in external dependencies (if any). If issues are found, dependencies might need to be updated or replaced.
7. If unit tests and security checks pass, a build artifact (Masonry framework) is created.
8. The build artifact (framework) is then distributed, typically through dependency managers like CocoaPods, Carthage, or Swift Package Manager, making it available for application developers to integrate into their projects.

Security controls in the build process:

- security control: Code review during pull requests before merging code changes. (Implemented in: Github Pull Request workflow)
- security control: Unit testing to ensure code quality and prevent regressions. (Implemented in: Xcode build process)
- security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) (Recommended) to identify potential code vulnerabilities. (To be implemented in: CI/CD pipeline)
- security control: Dependency scanning (Recommended) to check for vulnerabilities in dependencies. (To be implemented in: CI/CD pipeline)

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process being protected: Providing a reliable and efficient layout framework for iOS and macOS developers. The core process is the development, build, and distribution of the Masonry library.

Data being protected and sensitivity:

- Source code of the Masonry library: Low sensitivity. Source code is publicly available on Github. However, maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of the development process is important to prevent malicious code injection.
- Compiled Masonry framework: Low sensitivity. The compiled library is distributed publicly.
- Developer credentials and build environment secrets: Moderate to High sensitivity. These need to be protected to prevent unauthorized access to the build and distribution pipeline.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

- What is the process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities in Masonry? Is there a security policy or contact information available?
- Are there any plans to implement automated SAST and dependency scanning in the build process?
- Are there any regular security audits or penetration testing performed on the Masonry library?
- What is the process for managing and updating dependencies of Masonry (if any)?

Assumptions:

- The primary business goal is to provide a functional, reliable, and performant layout library for iOS and macOS developers. Security is important but is considered secondary to functionality and ease of use for a library of this type.
- The development team follows standard software development practices, including code review and unit testing.
- The library is intended to be used in a wide range of iOS and macOS applications, and its security posture indirectly impacts the security of those applications.
- Developers using Masonry are ultimately responsible for the overall security of their applications, including how they utilize and integrate third-party libraries.
