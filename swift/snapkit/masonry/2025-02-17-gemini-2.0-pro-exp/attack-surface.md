# Attack Surface Analysis for snapkit/masonry

## Attack Surface: [Untrusted Item Dimensions](./attack_surfaces/untrusted_item_dimensions.md)

*   **Description:** User-provided data influences the size (width, height) of elements arranged by Masonry.
    *   **Masonry's Contribution:** Masonry *directly* uses these dimensions for its core layout calculations.  Incorrect or malicious values directly impact Masonry's processing.
    *   **Example:** An attacker submits a form field that sets an item's height to `9999999px`.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Client-side Denial of Service (DoS) due to excessive browser resource consumption caused by Masonry's calculations.
        *   Layout manipulation and visual spoofing directly resulting from Masonry's handling of the malicious dimensions.
        *   Indirect Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - *if and only if* dimensions are used in inline styles without sanitization *before* Masonry processes them. This is a borderline case, as the XSS itself isn't *directly* in Masonry, but Masonry's handling of the unsanitized dimensions is a necessary step.  I'm including it because of the direct interaction with dimension data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   Strictly validate and sanitize all user-supplied data affecting element dimensions. Use a whitelist approach.
            *   Implement server-side validation of dimensions.
            *   Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict inline styles (mitigates the indirect XSS).
            *   Use `getBoundingClientRect()` after sanitization (or server-side) to get actual dimensions, rather than relying on potentially manipulated input.
        *   **User:** (Limited direct mitigation, relies on developer implementation)
            *   Be cautious about entering unusually large values in forms that might affect layout.

## Attack Surface: [Untrusted Item Content (Indirect XSS) - *Borderline, included for completeness, but with caveats*](./attack_surfaces/untrusted_item_content__indirect_xss__-_borderline__included_for_completeness__but_with_caveats.md)

*   **Description:** User-generated content is displayed within Masonry grid items without proper sanitization.
    *   **Masonry's Contribution:** Masonry *arranges* the content, but does *not* directly execute or interpret it.  The XSS vulnerability is in the application's handling of the content, *not* Masonry itself.  Masonry's role is purely presentational.  This is why it's borderline.  It's included because Masonry is *displaying* the malicious content, but it's not the *source* of the vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** An attacker posts a comment containing a malicious `<script>` tag within a Masonry grid item.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) â€“ execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the victim's browser.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding for *all* user-supplied content. Use a well-vetted HTML sanitization library (e.g., DOMPurify). This is the *primary* mitigation, and it's *not* Masonry-specific.
            *   Employ a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to limit script execution.
        *   **User:** (Limited direct mitigation, relies on developer implementation)
            *   Be cautious about clicking links or interacting with content from untrusted sources within the grid.
