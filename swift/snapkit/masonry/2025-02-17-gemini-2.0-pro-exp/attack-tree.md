## Attack Tree Path: [1. Client-Side Manipulation of Masonry](./attack_tree_paths/1__client-side_manipulation_of_masonry.md)

*   **1.1 Item Manipulation**
    *   **[1.1.1 INJECT ITEMS] (Critical Node)**
        *   **Description:** The attacker adds new, malicious HTML elements (items) to the Masonry layout.
        *   **1.1.1.a XSS VIA ITEM CONTENT (Critical Node)**
            *   **Description:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the content of a new Masonry item. This code executes when the item is rendered by the browser. This leverages an existing XSS vulnerability in the application, using Masonry as the delivery mechanism.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Depends on the application's input validation.
            *   **Impact:** High - Can lead to account takeover, data theft, session hijacking, and defacement.
            *   **Effort:** Medium - Requires finding an XSS vulnerability and crafting a payload.
            *   **Skill Level:** Medium - Requires knowledge of XSS and JavaScript.
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Standard security tools can detect some XSS, but sophisticated attacks can be harder to find.

*   **1.2 Layout Disruption**
    *   **[1.2.3 INFINITE RESIZE] (Critical Node)**
        *    **Description:** The attacker triggers a condition where Masonry continuously attempts to recalculate and reposition items, leading to excessive CPU usage and potentially a browser crash or freeze.
        *   **1.2.3.a TRIGGER Infinite Resize**
            *   **Description:** The attacker manipulates the application or its interaction with Masonry (e.g., through DOM manipulation or triggering resize events) to cause a continuous loop of layout recalculations. This might involve rapidly changing item sizes or positions.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low - Requires a specific, exploitable interaction pattern.
            *   **Impact:** High - Denial of Service (DoS), making the application unusable.
            *   **Effort:** Medium - Requires understanding of Masonry's resize handling and the application's logic.
            *   **Skill Level:** Medium - Requires knowledge of JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and event handling.
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Manifests as performance issues; requires monitoring and analysis to pinpoint the cause.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Server-Side Exploitation (Indirect via Masonry)](./attack_tree_paths/2__server-side_exploitation__indirect_via_masonry_.md)

*   **[2.1 INPUT TO MASONRY OPTIONS/METHODS] (Critical Node)**
    *   **Description:** The attacker exploits vulnerabilities in how the server generates data or configuration that is then passed to the Masonry library on the client-side.
    *   **2.1.1 CRAFTED ITEM DATA (Critical Node)**
        *   **Description:** The server sends malicious data (e.g., user-generated content) to the client, which is then used to create Masonry items.
        *   **2.1.1.a REFLECTED/STORED XSS VIA ITEM DATA (Critical Node)**
            *   **Description:** The server reflects unsanitized user input (reflected XSS) or stores unsanitized user input (stored XSS) that is then used as content for Masonry items. This allows the attacker to inject malicious JavaScript, similar to 1.1.1.a, but the source of the vulnerability is on the server.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Depends on the server's input validation and data handling practices.
            *   **Impact:** High - Same as 1.1.1.a (account takeover, data theft, etc.).
            *   **Effort:** Medium - Requires finding an XSS vulnerability on the server.
            *   **Skill Level:** Medium - Requires knowledge of XSS and server-side vulnerabilities.
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Similar to 1.1.1.a; server-side vulnerability scanning is also crucial.

    *   **2.1.2 MALICIOUS CONFIG (Critical Node)**
        *   **Description:** The server provides a malicious configuration for Masonry, potentially based on attacker-controlled input.
        *   **2.1.2.a INJECT MALICIOUS MASONRY OPTIONS (e.g., itemSelector, gutter) (Critical Node)**
            *   **Description:** The server dynamically generates Masonry options based on user input without proper validation. An attacker can inject malicious values for options like `itemSelector` (to select unintended elements) or `gutter` (to cause layout issues).
            *   **Likelihood:** Low - Requires the server to dynamically generate options from user input and lack proper validation.
            *   **Impact:** High - Can lead to data exposure (if `itemSelector` is manipulated) or layout disruption.
            *   **Effort:** Medium - Requires understanding of Masonry options and finding a way to inject them.
            *   **Skill Level:** Medium - Requires knowledge of server-side scripting and Masonry configuration.
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** High - Requires careful code review and security testing of the server-side logic that generates Masonry options.
