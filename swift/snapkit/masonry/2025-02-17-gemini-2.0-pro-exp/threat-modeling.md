# Threat Model Analysis for snapkit/masonry

## Threat: [Malicious Content Injection via `appended` Event](./threats/malicious_content_injection_via__appended__event.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious HTML or JavaScript into elements that are dynamically added to the `masonry` grid *after* the initial layout, leveraging the `appended` event handler. The attacker crafts input that bypasses initial sanitization but is then executed when `masonry` processes the new elements. This is a *direct* threat because it exploits a specific `masonry` event and its handling of newly added DOM elements.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser.
        *   Data Exfiltration: Stealing user data, cookies, or session tokens.
        *   Defacement: Altering the appearance of the website.
        *   Phishing: Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   **Masonry Component Affected:** `appended` event handler, `Masonry.prototype.appended`, and potentially the internal element appending logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Sanitization (Double Sanitization):** Sanitize the content of new elements *before* passing them to `masonry` *and* again within the `appended` event handler, *before* they are inserted into the DOM. Use a robust HTML sanitizer library (e.g., DOMPurify). Don't rely solely on server-side sanitization.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP.
        *   **Avoid `innerHTML`:** Prefer DOM manipulation methods like `createElement`, `appendChild`, and `textContent`.
        *   **Event Handler Review:** Carefully review and audit any custom code within the `appended` event handler.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Excessive Elements](./threats/denial_of_service_via_excessive_elements.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a massive number of elements to `masonry`, either initially or through repeated additions, overwhelming the browser's rendering engine and causing the application to become unresponsive or crash. This directly targets `masonry`'s core layout functionality.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Application Unavailability: Users cannot access or interact with the website.
        *   Resource Exhaustion: High CPU and memory usage on the client-side.
        *   Potential Browser Crash: The user's browser may become unresponsive or crash.
    *   **Masonry Component Affected:** Core layout engine (`Masonry.prototype._itemize`, `Masonry.prototype.layout`, `Masonry.prototype._getMeasurement`), event handling (if frequent re-layouts are triggered).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Pagination/Infinite Scrolling:** Load elements in batches.
        *   **Input Validation (Element Count):** Enforce a strict limit on the number of elements.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Limit the frequency with which new elements can be added.
        *   **Server-Side Limits:** Enforce limits on the amount of data retrieved from the server.

## Threat: [Tampering with `masonry.js` File](./threats/tampering_with__masonry_js__file.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the web server and modifies the `masonry.js` file itself, injecting malicious code that will be executed by all users. This is a *direct* threat to the `masonry` library itself.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Complete Site Compromise: The attacker can execute arbitrary code in every user's browser.
        *   Data Theft: Stealing user data, credentials, and sensitive information.
        *   Malware Distribution: Infecting users' computers.
    *   **Masonry Component Affected:** The entire `masonry.js` library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Subresource Integrity (SRI):** Use SRI when loading `masonry` from a CDN.
        *   **File Integrity Monitoring:** Implement monitoring on the web server.
        *   **Secure Server Configuration:** Ensure the web server is properly secured.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Limit write access to the directory.

## Threat: [Overriding Masonry methods](./threats/overriding_masonry_methods.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uses JavaScript to override built-in `Masonry` methods (e.g., `layout`, `appended`, `remove`) with malicious code. This directly targets and modifies Masonry's internal functions.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Arbitrary Code Execution: The attacker's code runs whenever the overridden method is called.
        *   Layout Manipulation: The attacker can completely control the layout.
        *   Denial of Service: The attacker can prevent the layout from functioning.
    *   **Masonry Component Affected:** Any `Masonry.prototype` method.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Object Freezing:** After initializing `Masonry`, freeze the `Masonry` object and its prototype: `Object.freeze(Masonry.prototype); Object.freeze(Masonry);`.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** A strict CSP can help prevent unauthorized scripts.
        *   **Code Review:** Carefully review all JavaScript code on the page.
