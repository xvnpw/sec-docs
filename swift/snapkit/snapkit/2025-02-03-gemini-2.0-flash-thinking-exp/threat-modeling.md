# Threat Model Analysis for snapkit/snapkit

## Threat: [Compromised SnapKit Library (Supply Chain)](./threats/compromised_snapkit_library__supply_chain_.md)

**Description:** An attacker compromises the official SnapKit repository or distribution channels (like CocoaPods or Swift Package Manager). They inject malicious code into the SnapKit library and distribute this compromised version to developers. When developers include this malicious SnapKit version in their applications, the attacker's code gets executed within the application.

**Impact:**  Full application compromise. Attackers could steal user data, inject malware, gain unauthorized access to device resources, manipulate application behavior, or perform denial-of-service attacks.

**SnapKit Component Affected:** Distribution mechanism (CocoaPods, SPM, GitHub releases), Core library code.

**Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Verify the integrity of SnapKit source and packages using checksums provided by official sources.
* Use dependency management tools that support checksum verification and dependency locking.
* Monitor official SnapKit channels (GitHub repository, release notes) for any unusual activity or security advisories.
* Consider using reputable package managers and sources.
* Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities and anomalies.
