# Threat Model Analysis for snapkit/snapkit

## Threat: [Malicious Constraint Injection](./threats/malicious_constraint_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could inject or manipulate constraint definitions, either through compromised data sources or by exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application handles dynamic constraint creation. This allows the attacker to define arbitrary relationships between UI elements *using SnapKit's API*.
    *   **Impact:** UI elements could be moved off-screen, made invisible, overlap sensitive information, or cause the application layout to become unusable, leading to a denial-of-service condition. In some scenarios, manipulated layouts could be used for phishing attacks by mimicking legitimate UI elements.
    *   **Affected SnapKit Component:** `Constraint`, `UIView+makeConstraints`, `LayoutConstraint`
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize and validate all data used to create or modify SnapKit constraints.
        *   Avoid creating constraints based on untrusted user input without thorough validation.
        *   Implement server-side validation for any data influencing client-side layout.
        *   Use parameterized constraint creation where possible to avoid direct string manipulation.
        *   Regularly review and audit the code responsible for dynamic constraint creation.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Complex Layouts](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_complex_layouts.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could trigger the creation of extremely complex or deeply nested layouts by providing specific data or interacting with the application in a particular way. This forces the device to perform excessive layout calculations *initiated through SnapKit's layout mechanisms*.
    *   **Impact:** The application could become unresponsive, freeze, consume excessive CPU and memory resources, leading to battery drain and potentially crashing the application. This constitutes a denial-of-service attack on the client device.
    *   **Affected SnapKit Component:** `UIView+makeConstraints`, `Constraint` (indirectly through the number and complexity of constraints)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement limits on the number of views and constraints that can be created in a given context.
        *   Perform thorough performance testing and profiling of UI layouts, especially under stress conditions.
        *   Optimize layout hierarchies to reduce nesting and complexity.
        *   Consider using techniques like view recycling for dynamic content to minimize the number of active views and constraints.
        *   Implement timeouts or resource monitoring to detect and mitigate excessive layout calculations.
