## Attack Tree Path: [Improper OAuth Flow Handling  ===> Using/Leaking Refresh Tokens Client-Side (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/improper_oauth_flow_handling__===_usingleaking_refresh_tokens_client-side__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This path represents a severe flaw where the application mishandles refresh tokens, which are long-lived credentials used to obtain new access tokens. Exposing refresh tokens on the client-side (e.g., in JavaScript, local storage, cookies) allows an attacker to gain persistent unauthorized access.
*   **Attack Steps:**
    *   **Initial Compromise:** The attacker might gain initial access through various means, such as XSS, exploiting a browser vulnerability, or even through a compromised third-party library.
    *   **Token Discovery:** Once the attacker has a foothold on the client-side, they can inspect the application's code, local storage, or network traffic to locate the exposed refresh token.
    *   **Persistent Access:** With the refresh token, the attacker can continuously request new access tokens from the Snap Kit API, maintaining unauthorized access to the user's account and data even if the user changes their password.
*   **Estimations:**
    *   Likelihood: Low
    *   Impact: Very High
    *   Effort: Low
    *   Skill Level: Low
    *   Detection Difficulty: High
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Server-Side Storage:** Store refresh tokens *exclusively* on the server-side, in a secure location (e.g., encrypted database, hardware security module).
    *   **Secure Transmission:** Use HTTPS for all communication involving refresh tokens.
    *   **Token Rotation:** Implement refresh token rotation, where a new refresh token is issued with each access token request, invalidating the previous one.
    *   **Short Lifespans:** Configure refresh tokens to have relatively short lifespans, limiting the window of opportunity for an attacker.
    *   **Monitoring:** Implement robust logging and monitoring to detect any suspicious activity related to refresh token usage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerable Dependencies ===> Outdated Snap Kit Version (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerable_dependencies_===_outdated_snap_kit_version__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** This path represents the risk of using an outdated version of the Snap Kit SDK that contains known, publicly disclosed vulnerabilities. Attackers often scan for applications using vulnerable software versions.
*   **Attack Steps:**
    *   **Vulnerability Identification:** The attacker identifies the application's use of Snap Kit and determines the specific version being used (e.g., through HTTP headers, JavaScript files, or error messages).
    *   **Exploit Research:** The attacker researches publicly available exploits for the identified Snap Kit version.
    *   **Exploitation:** The attacker uses the known exploit to compromise the application, potentially gaining access to user data, executing arbitrary code, or disrupting service.
*   **Estimations (assuming a known, easily exploitable vulnerability):**
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: Medium (depends on the vulnerability)
    *   Effort: Very Low
    *   Skill Level: Low
    *   Detection Difficulty: Low (if vulnerability is public)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep the Snap Kit SDK updated to the latest version.
    *   **Automated Scanning:** Use dependency management tools (e.g., `npm audit`, Dependabot) to automatically scan for outdated dependencies and known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Vulnerability Monitoring:** Subscribe to security advisories and mailing lists related to Snap Kit and its dependencies.
    *   **Rapid Patching:** Establish a process for rapidly patching the application when new vulnerabilities are discovered.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerable Dependencies ===> Lack of Input Validation (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerable_dependencies_===_lack_of_input_validation__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** This path highlights the risk of insufficient input validation on data received from the Snap Kit API. Even if Snap Kit performs some validation, the application should *always* treat external data as untrusted and perform its own validation.
*   **Attack Steps:**
    *   **Identify Input Points:** The attacker identifies all points where the application receives data from Snap Kit (e.g., API responses, redirect parameters).
    *   **Craft Malicious Input:** The attacker crafts malicious input designed to exploit potential vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, command injection).
    *   **Bypass Security Controls:** If input validation is weak or absent, the malicious input may bypass security controls and be processed by the application, leading to unintended consequences.
    *   **Exploitation:** The attacker leverages the vulnerability to achieve their goal (e.g., steal data, execute code, modify data).
*   **Estimations:**
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: Medium to High
    *   Effort: Medium
    *   Skill Level: Medium
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Comprehensive Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation for *all* data received from Snap Kit. Use whitelisting (allowing only known-good values) whenever possible.
    *   **Output Encoding:** Encode all output data to prevent XSS attacks.
    *   **Parameterized Queries:** Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the application operates with the minimum necessary privileges.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Consider using a WAF to filter malicious requests.
