# Threat Model Analysis for snapkit/snapkit

## Threat: [Client Secret Compromise](./threats/client_secret_compromise.md)

*   **Threat:** Client Secret Compromise
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the application's Snap Kit Client Secret, typically stored on the server-side. This could occur through server compromise, code injection, or accidental exposure (e.g., committed to a public repository).  This is the most critical threat because the secret allows full impersonation of the application.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Complete Application Impersonation:** The attacker can make any API call on behalf of the application, including accessing user data, posting content, and potentially deleting user accounts (depending on granted scopes).
        *   **Mass Data Breach:**  The attacker can potentially retrieve data for all users who have authorized the application.
        *   **Reputational Damage:**  Severe damage to the application's reputation and user trust.
    *   **Affected Snap Kit Component:** All Kits (Login Kit, Creative Kit, Story Kit, Bitmoji Kit, etc.) â€“ any API call requiring authentication.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Secret Storage:**  *Never* store the client secret in client-side code or version control. Use a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault, environment variables with restricted access).
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure the server-side process accessing the secret has only the necessary permissions.
        *   **Regular Secret Rotation:**  Change the client secret periodically and immediately after any suspected compromise.
        *   **Intrusion Detection:**  Implement server-side intrusion detection systems to identify and respond to potential breaches.
        *   **Code Reviews:**  Thoroughly review code that handles the client secret to prevent accidental exposure.

## Threat: [Redirect URI Manipulation / Open Redirect](./threats/redirect_uri_manipulation__open_redirect.md)

*   **Threat:** Redirect URI Manipulation / Open Redirect
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL that includes a valid Snap Kit Client ID but manipulates the `redirect_uri` parameter to point to an attacker-controlled website. The attacker then tricks a user into clicking this link.  This is high severity because it directly impacts the authentication flow and can lead to token theft.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Authorization Code Theft:**  The attacker can intercept the authorization code returned by Snapchat, allowing them to obtain an access token.
        *   **Phishing:**  The attacker can redirect the user to a fake login page to steal their Snapchat credentials.
        *   **Session Fixation:**  The attacker might be able to hijack the user's session.
    *   **Affected Snap Kit Component:** Login Kit (specifically the authorization endpoint and redirect handling).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Whitelist Validation:**  The server *must* validate the `redirect_uri` against a pre-approved whitelist of allowed URIs.  *Never* trust user-supplied input for the redirect URI without strict validation.
        *   **Avoid Dynamic Redirects:**  If possible, avoid using dynamic redirect URIs based on user input.
        *   **Use `state` Parameter:** Include a cryptographically secure random `state` parameter in the authorization request and verify it upon return.

## Threat: [Access Token Leakage](./threats/access_token_leakage.md)

*   **Threat:** Access Token Leakage
    *   **Description:** An attacker obtains a user's access token. While this could happen through general web vulnerabilities (like XSS), the *direct* Snap Kit involvement is that the token grants access to Snapchat APIs.  This is high severity because it allows direct impersonation of the user within the granted scopes.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **User Impersonation:**  The attacker can use the stolen token to make API calls on behalf of the user, accessing their data and performing actions.
        *   **Data Breach:**  The attacker can access the user's Snapchat data within the granted scopes.
    *   **Affected Snap Kit Component:** All Kits (any API call requiring an access token).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **HTTPS Enforcement:**  Always use HTTPS for all communication with Snapchat APIs and for all application pages that handle tokens.
        *   **Secure Token Storage:**  Store access tokens securely on the server-side (e.g., encrypted database, secure session storage).  Avoid storing them in client-side storage unless absolutely necessary and with appropriate security measures (e.g., HttpOnly cookies).
        *   **XSS Prevention:** Implement robust XSS prevention. While XSS is a general web vulnerability, it's *critical* to prevent it here because it can be used to steal Snap Kit tokens.
        *   **Avoid Logging Tokens:**  Never log access tokens.
        *   **Short-Lived Tokens:**  Use short-lived access tokens and rely on refresh tokens (if applicable).

## Threat: [Refresh Token Compromise](./threats/refresh_token_compromise.md)

*   **Threat:** Refresh Token Compromise
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to a user's refresh token. This is *critical* because refresh tokens are long-lived and allow the attacker to obtain new access tokens indefinitely.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Persistent User Impersonation:**  The attacker can continuously obtain new access tokens, granting them long-term access to the user's account.
        *   **Data Breach:**  Prolonged access to the user's Snapchat data.
    *   **Affected Snap Kit Component:** Login Kit (specifically the token exchange endpoint).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Highly Secure Storage:**  Store refresh tokens with *extreme* care, using the most secure storage mechanisms available (e.g., encrypted database with strict access controls, hardware security modules).
        *   **Never Expose to Client:**  Refresh tokens should *never* be accessible to the client-side.
        *   **Refresh Token Rotation:**  Implement refresh token rotation.
        *   **Token Revocation:**  Provide a mechanism for users to revoke access tokens and refresh tokens.

## Threat: [Lack of User Consent Revocation Mechanism](./threats/lack_of_user_consent_revocation_mechanism.md)

* **Threat:** Lack of User Consent Revocation Mechanism
    * **Description:** The application does not provide a clear and easy way for users to revoke the permissions they granted to the application via Snap Kit. This is a *direct* Snap Kit issue because it relates to the management of the connection established through Snap Kit.
    * **Impact:**
        *   **User Privacy Violation:** Users cannot easily control their data and privacy.
        *   **Legal and Compliance Issues:** May violate privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
        *   **Reputational Damage:** Loss of user trust.
    * **Affected Snap Kit Component:** Login Kit (and potentially other kits depending on the granted permissions).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Implement Revocation Endpoint:** Provide a dedicated endpoint or UI element within the application that allows users to revoke access.
        *   **Clear Instructions:** Provide clear instructions on how users can manage their connected apps within Snapchat itself.
        *   **Regularly Test Revocation:** Ensure the revocation mechanism works correctly.
