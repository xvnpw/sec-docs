*   **Threat:** Malicious Data Injection via Data Sources
    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises the underlying data source and injects malicious data that, when processed by RxDataSources, leads to unexpected behavior or crashes. This could involve data that violates expected data structures or triggers bugs within RxDataSources' processing logic.
    *   **Impact:** Application crashes, unexpected UI behavior (displaying incorrect or misleading information), potential for client-side denial of service by overwhelming the UI with excessive data that RxDataSources attempts to render.
    *   **Affected Component:** Data Source Adapters (e.g., `RxTableViewSectionedReloadDataSource`, `RxCollectionViewSectionedReloadDataSource`), potentially the internal logic for processing and diffing data within these adapters.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the data received from the data source *before* it is passed to RxDataSources.
        *   Secure the underlying data sources to prevent unauthorized modification.
        *   Implement error handling within the application's data processing pipeline to gracefully handle unexpected data formats before they reach RxDataSources.

*   **Threat:** Information Disclosure through Data Binding
    *   **Description:** Sensitive information is included in the data models that RxDataSources uses to populate the UI. If the application's UI rendering logic doesn't properly sanitize or filter this data, it could be exposed in the UI. RxDataSources facilitates this binding, making it a direct component in this potential vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive user data or application secrets directly through the application's UI.
    *   **Affected Component:** Data Source Adapters, specifically the logic that binds data from the `SectionModel` and `ItemModel` to the UI elements (e.g., within the `cellForRowAt` delegate method).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid including sensitive information directly in the data models used for UI presentation. Create separate, sanitized view models if necessary.
        *   Ensure that the UI rendering logic properly sanitizes and filters data before displaying it.
        *   Use appropriate UI controls and configurations to prevent the display of sensitive data (e.g., using secure text entry for passwords).
