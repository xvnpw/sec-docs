## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit FengNiao Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - PATH START]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_fengniao_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path___critical_node_-_path_start_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Targeting weaknesses or vulnerabilities directly within the FengNiao framework code itself.
    *   Exploiting how FengNiao handles requests, routing, sessions (if any), error handling, or dependencies.
    *   This path is critical as it aims to bypass application-level security by attacking the underlying framework.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Request Handling Weaknesses [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - CATEGORY]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_request_handling_weaknesses__high-risk_path___critical_node_-_category_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in how FengNiao processes incoming HTTP requests.
    *   Focuses on weaknesses in input validation, header parsing, and body parsing.

                *   **Exceed Expected Length Limits [CRITICAL NODE - HIGH LIKELIHOOD]:** Sending request parameters that are longer than the application expects, potentially causing buffer overflows or unexpected behavior if not properly handled.
                *   **Inject Unexpected Data Types [CRITICAL NODE - HIGH LIKELIHOOD]:** Providing parameters with data types different from what the application anticipates (e.g., string instead of integer), leading to errors or logic bypasses if type checking is insufficient.
            *   **Insufficient Sanitization in FengNiao [CRITICAL NODE - CONDITION ENABLER]:**
                *   **No Built-in Sanitization Functions [CRITICAL NODE - CONDITION]:** FengNiao, being lightweight, might lack built-in input sanitization, requiring developers to implement it manually, increasing the risk of oversight.
                *   **Developer Neglect in Application Code (Using FengNiao) [CRITICAL NODE - CONDITION]:** Developers using FengNiao might neglect to implement proper input sanitization in their application code, assuming the framework handles it or simply overlooking this crucial step.

    *   **2.2. Body Parsing Exploits [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vectors:**

                *   **Exceed Body Size Limits (DoS) [CRITICAL NODE - HIGH LIKELIHOOD, MEDIUM IMPACT]:** Sending excessively large request bodies to exhaust server resources (memory, bandwidth), leading to a Denial of Service.
                *   **Inject Malicious Payloads (If Body Parsed and Processed Unsafely) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - MEDIUM-HIGH IMPACT]:** Embedding malicious code or data within the request body (e.g., in JSON or XML payloads) that, if parsed and processed without proper validation by the application, could lead to data manipulation, code execution, or other vulnerabilities.
            *   **Vulnerabilities in Body Parsing Logic (If Any in FengNiao):**
                *   **Buffer Overflow (Less likely in Swift, but possible in underlying C libraries) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - HIGH IMPACT]:** Exploiting potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities in FengNiao's body parsing logic (if it exists and is vulnerable), which could lead to code execution and system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Routing Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_routing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Targeting weaknesses in how FengNiao defines and matches routes to handlers.
    *   Focuses on bypassing intended routing logic to access unauthorized resources or trigger unexpected application behavior.

                *   **Path Traversal Sequences (e.g., `../`) [CRITICAL NODE - HIGH IMPACT POTENTIAL]:** Using path traversal sequences like `../` in URLs to navigate outside the intended application directory and access sensitive files or resources on the server.
            *   **Insufficient Validation of Route Parameters in Application Code (Using FengNiao) [CRITICAL NODE - CONDITION ENABLER]:**
                *   **No Type Checking [CRITICAL NODE - CONDITION]:**  Failing to validate the data type of route parameters in the application code, allowing attackers to inject unexpected types and potentially bypass logic or cause errors.
                *   **No Range/Format Validation [CRITICAL NODE - CONDITION]:**  Not validating the range or format of route parameters, enabling attackers to provide out-of-bounds values or malformed data that can lead to vulnerabilities.

                *   **Network Sniffing (If HTTP Used - should be HTTPS) [CRITICAL NODE - HIGH IMPACT, BUT SHOULD BE MITIGATED]:** Intercepting network traffic (if HTTPS is not used) to sniff session identifiers being transmitted in the clear, enabling session hijacking. *Note: HTTPS is a fundamental mitigation for this.*

    *   **4.2. Session Fixation [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - VULNERABILITY]:**
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   **Force Session ID on User:**
                *   **Manipulate Session Cookie:** Setting a known session ID in the user's browser (e.g., by sending a crafted `Set-Cookie` header) before they authenticate.
                *   **URL-based Session ID (Less Common, but possible):**  If session IDs are passed in URLs (less secure practice), manipulating the URL to include a known session ID.
