# Threat Model Analysis for onevcat/fengniao

## Threat: [Code Injection via Malicious Response Parsing](./threats/code_injection_via_malicious_response_parsing.md)

**Description:** An attacker compromises a server and sends crafted, malicious responses. If FengNiao has vulnerabilities in its response parsing logic (e.g., in handling headers or body data), these responses could be designed to inject and execute arbitrary code within the application using FengNiao. This could happen if FengNiao uses unsafe deserialization or string handling practices internally.

**Impact:** Critical - Remote Code Execution (RCE). Full control of the application and potentially the user's device, leading to data theft, malware installation, or denial of service.

**FengNiao Component Affected:** Response Handling Module, potentially within data parsing or deserialization functions.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep FengNiao updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
* Monitor FengNiao's GitHub for reported vulnerabilities and security updates.
* Implement robust input validation and sanitization on data received from the network, even after FengNiao processing.
* Consider using static analysis tools to scan the application and FengNiao for potential code injection vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Insecure Configuration leading to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks](./threats/insecure_configuration_leading_to_man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks.md)

**Description:** Developers might misconfigure FengNiao, for example, by disabling TLS/SSL certificate verification (if possible through configuration or misuse of underlying `URLSession` features). This would allow an attacker performing a MitM attack to intercept and potentially modify network traffic between the application and the server, compromising data confidentiality and integrity.

**Impact:** High - Man-in-the-Middle Attack, Data Interception. Sensitive data transmitted over the network can be intercepted, read, and potentially modified by an attacker.

**FengNiao Component Affected:** Configuration Module, potentially related to TLS/SSL settings (though FengNiao relies on `URLSession` for this primarily).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure TLS/SSL certificate verification is always enabled and properly configured when using FengNiao.
* Enforce secure defaults in application configuration and prevent developers from easily disabling security features.
* Consider implementing certificate pinning (if supported and properly implemented in the application using FengNiao) to further enhance TLS security.
* Regularly review network security configurations and code related to TLS/SSL handling.
