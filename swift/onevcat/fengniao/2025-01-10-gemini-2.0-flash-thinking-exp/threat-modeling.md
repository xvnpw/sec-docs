# Threat Model Analysis for onevcat/fengniao

## Threat: [Malicious Image Exploitation](./threats/malicious_image_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted image file (e.g., a malformed JPEG, PNG, or GIF) through an application feature that utilizes FengNiao for image processing. FengNiao's core image processing functionality, when attempting to decode and process the malicious image, triggers a vulnerability within its underlying image decoding libraries.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (application crashes or becomes unresponsive), potential for Remote Code Execution on the server if the underlying image processing library has severe vulnerabilities, or information disclosure if the vulnerability allows access to server memory.
*   **Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Path Traversal via Filename](./threats/path_traversal_via_filename.md)

*   **Description:** If FengNiao's API allows the application to specify arbitrary file paths for image processing without sufficient sanitization within FengNiao itself, an attacker could potentially manipulate the provided filename to access files outside the intended directory on the server. FengNiao would then attempt to process this unintended file.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files on the server, potential for information disclosure, or even modification of critical system files depending on the application's and FengNiao's permissions.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via URL Processing](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_url_processing.md)

*   **Description:** If FengNiao provides functionality to fetch images from URLs and the application uses this feature with user-supplied URLs without proper validation within FengNiao's URL handling logic, an attacker could supply a malicious URL pointing to internal resources or services. FengNiao would then make a request to this internal resource on behalf of the server.
*   **Impact:** Access to internal services or APIs that are not intended to be exposed to the public internet, potential for information disclosure from internal systems, or the ability to launch attacks against other internal infrastructure.
*   **Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Underlying Image Processing Libraries](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_underlying_image_processing_libraries.md)

*   **Description:** FengNiao relies on external libraries for the actual image processing. Security vulnerabilities present in these underlying libraries (e.g., in their decoding logic) can be directly exploited when FengNiao uses these libraries to process images. This is a threat directly impacting FengNiao's functionality.
*   **Impact:** Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server, denial of service, or information disclosure, directly through FengNiao's processing.
*   **Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attacks on FengNiao](./threats/supply_chain_attacks_on_fengniao.md)

*   **Description:** The FengNiao library itself could be compromised by a malicious actor, leading to the injection of malicious code directly into the library. This could occur through compromised maintainer accounts or other means.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server where the application is running, data breaches, or other malicious activities, as the compromised FengNiao library would be directly executed by the application.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
