# Attack Surface Analysis for onevcat/fengniao

## Attack Surface: [Credential Exposure](./attack_surfaces/credential_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Accidental or malicious disclosure of cloud storage credentials (API keys, secrets, tokens) used by `fengniao`.
*   **How `fengniao` Contributes:** `fengniao` *requires* these credentials to function, making their management a central security concern. The tool's configuration and execution environment are potential points of exposure.  The way `fengniao` *handles* these credentials (even if it's just passing them through) is a direct contribution.
*   **Example:** A developer accidentally commits a `fengniao` configuration file containing a plaintext AWS S3 access key to a public GitHub repository.  Or, `fengniao` logs the credentials to a console in verbose mode.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the associated cloud storage account. An attacker can read, write, and delete data, potentially leading to data breaches, data loss, and financial damage.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never** store credentials in source code or configuration files.
    *   Use environment variables to provide credentials to `fengniao`.
    *   Employ a secure secret management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) to store and retrieve credentials dynamically.
    *   Implement least privilege: Grant `fengniao` only the minimum necessary permissions on the cloud storage service (e.g., write-only access to a specific bucket).
    *   Regularly rotate credentials.
    *   Monitor cloud storage access logs for suspicious activity.
    *   Educate developers on secure credential handling practices.
    *   Ensure `fengniao` itself does *not* log or expose credentials in any way (e.g., through verbose output or error messages). This is a direct responsibility of the `fengniao` developers.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates file paths provided to `fengniao` to access or upload files outside of the intended directory.
*   **How `fengniao` Contributes:** `fengniao` takes file paths as input, making it a direct target for path traversal attacks if input validation is insufficient.  The *core functionality* of `fengniao` involves handling file paths.
*   **Example:** An attacker uses a path like `../../../../etc/passwd` to attempt to read the system's password file. Or, they might try to upload a file to a system directory like `/etc/cron.d/` to achieve code execution.
*   **Impact:** Reading sensitive system files, potentially leading to further compromise. Overwriting critical system files, causing system instability or denial of service. In some cases, achieving remote code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strictly validate and sanitize all file paths** provided to `fengniao`. This is a *direct* responsibility of `fengniao`'s code.
    *   Reject any paths containing `..`, `/`, or other potentially dangerous characters or sequences.
    *   Implement a whitelist of allowed directories, if feasible. Only allow uploads from these pre-approved locations.
    *   Use platform-specific APIs for safe path handling (e.g., `pathlib` in Python).
    *   Run `fengniao` with the least privilege necessary. Avoid running it as root or with unnecessary permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Incorrect Permissions/ACLs (Cloud Storage)](./attack_surfaces/incorrect_permissionsacls__cloud_storage_.md)

*   **Description:** Files are uploaded with overly permissive access control settings, making them accessible to unauthorized users.
*   **How `fengniao` Contributes:** `fengniao` is responsible for setting the *initial* permissions on uploaded files. If misconfigured, or if it doesn't provide secure defaults, it directly creates this vulnerability.
*   **Example:** `fengniao` is configured to upload all files with "public-read" access, exposing sensitive data to anyone on the internet. Or, `fengniao` has a bug that ignores user-specified permission settings.
*   **Impact:** Data leakage, unauthorized access to sensitive information.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully configure the default permissions used by `fengniao`. Use the principle of least privilege. `fengniao` should default to the *most restrictive* settings possible.
    *   Provide options for users to specify permissions, but with strong validation to prevent overly permissive settings. `fengniao` should *validate* these settings before applying them.
    *   Regularly audit the permissions of files stored in the cloud storage service (this is a general mitigation, but `fengniao`'s configuration is the root cause).
    *   Use infrastructure-as-code (IaC) to manage cloud storage bucket policies and ensure consistent, secure configurations (again, a general mitigation, but relevant because of `fengniao`'s role).
