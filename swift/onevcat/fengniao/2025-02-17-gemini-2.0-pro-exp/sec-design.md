# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

The FengNiao project aims to provide a command-line tool for deleting unused resource files in Xcode projects. This addresses the following business priorities:

*   Reduce project size: By removing unused resources, the overall size of the Xcode project and the resulting application can be reduced.
*   Improve build times: Smaller project sizes can lead to faster build times, improving developer productivity.
*   Maintain a cleaner codebase: Removing unused resources helps maintain a cleaner and more organized codebase, making it easier to understand and maintain.
*   Reduce potential attack surface (although minimal in this context): Removing unused code reduces the overall attack surface, even if the impact is small in this specific case.

Business Risks:

*   Accidental deletion of required resources: The primary risk is the accidental deletion of resources that are still in use, potentially leading to runtime errors or application malfunctions. This could disrupt development workflows and require time to restore or recreate the deleted resources.
*   Compatibility issues with different Xcode versions or project setups: The tool may not be fully compatible with all Xcode versions or project configurations, leading to unexpected behavior or errors.
*   False positives/negatives: The tool might incorrectly identify used resources as unused (false positive) or fail to identify unused resources (false negative).
*   Impact on version control: Frequent deletion and addition of resources could create unnecessary noise in the version control history, making it harder to track meaningful changes.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Code reviews: The project is open-source and hosted on GitHub, allowing for community code reviews and contributions. (Described in GitHub repository)
*   security control: Limited scope: The tool's functionality is limited to identifying and deleting unused resource files, reducing the potential for broader security vulnerabilities. (Described in GitHub repository)
*   security control: User confirmation: The tool likely requires user confirmation before deleting files, mitigating the risk of accidental deletion. (Implied, needs verification)
*   accepted risk: Reliance on Xcode project structure: The tool's effectiveness relies on the accuracy and consistency of the Xcode project structure. Any deviations or inconsistencies could lead to incorrect results.
*   accepted risk: Limited error handling: The tool may have limited error handling for unexpected scenarios, potentially leading to crashes or incomplete operations.
*   accepted risk: No formal security audits: There is no indication of formal security audits or penetration testing being conducted on the tool.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement robust error handling: Enhance error handling to gracefully handle unexpected scenarios, such as invalid project files or file system errors.
*   security control: Provide a "dry run" option: Allow users to preview the files that would be deleted without actually deleting them.
*   security control: Integrate with version control: Before deleting files, check if they are under version control and potentially create a backup or commit.
*   security control: Static analysis: Incorporate static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities or code quality issues.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication: Not applicable, as the tool operates locally on the user's machine and does not require authentication.
*   Authorization: Not applicable, as the tool operates with the user's existing file system permissions.
*   Input Validation:
    *   The tool should validate the input Xcode project path to ensure it is a valid directory and contains a valid Xcode project file.
    *   The tool should handle file paths and names correctly, including those with special characters or spaces.
*   Cryptography: Not applicable, as the tool does not handle sensitive data that requires encryption.

    GitHubActions["GitHub Actions (CI)"]
    SwiftPackageManager["Swift Package Manager"]
    CodeQL["CodeQL (SAST)"]

    GitHub -- Triggers --> GitHubActions
    GitHubActions -- Uses --> SwiftPackageManager
    GitHubActions -- Uses --> CodeQL
    SwiftPackageManager -- Builds --> Artifacts
    CodeQL -- Analyzes --> GitHub
```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developer pushes code changes to the GitHub repository.
2.  GitHub Actions is triggered by the push event.
3.  The GitHub Actions workflow sets up the build environment (macOS, Swift).
4.  Swift Package Manager is used to build the project and resolve dependencies.
5.  CodeQL (GitHub's static analysis tool) is run to perform security checks on the codebase.
6.  If the build and security checks are successful, the build artifacts (the `fengniao` executable) are created.
7.  The artifacts can be uploaded to a release on GitHub or deployed to a package manager (e.g., Homebrew).

Security Controls:

*   security control: GitHub Actions: Automates the build process, ensuring consistency and repeatability.
*   security control: Swift Package Manager: Manages dependencies, reducing the risk of using vulnerable libraries (assuming dependencies are well-maintained).
*   security control: CodeQL: Performs static analysis to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code.
*   security control: Code Reviews: All changes are subject to code review before being merged into the main branch.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Software development and maintenance of Xcode projects.

Data Protection:

*   Source code: The tool interacts with the source code of Xcode projects. While source code is not typically considered highly sensitive in the same way as personal data, it is still valuable intellectual property. Sensitivity: Medium.
*   Project configuration files: The tool parses Xcode project files, which contain project settings and configurations. Sensitivity: Low.
*   Resource files: The tool identifies and deletes resource files (images, sounds, etc.). Sensitivity: Low to Medium (depending on the nature of the resources).

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   Does FengNiao have a mechanism to exclude specific files or directories from deletion?
*   What specific error handling mechanisms are in place?
*   Is there any logging or auditing of FengNiao's actions?
*   How does FengNiao handle symbolic links or aliases within the Xcode project?
*   Are there any known limitations or compatibility issues with specific Xcode versions or project types?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to reduce project size and improve build times, with a secondary benefit of maintaining a cleaner codebase.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: The tool requires user confirmation before deleting files. The tool operates with the user's existing file system permissions.
*   DESIGN: The tool's core components are a project parser, a resource analyzer, and a file deleter. The tool is deployed via Homebrew or manual installation. The build process is automated using GitHub Actions and includes static analysis with CodeQL.
