# Threat Model Analysis for onevcat/fengniao

## Threat: [T1: Unintentional Critical Resource Deletion](./threats/t1_unintentional_critical_resource_deletion.md)

*   **Threat:** T1: Unintentional Critical Resource Deletion

    *   **Description:** FengNiao, due to incorrect regular expressions, incomplete exclusion lists, or bugs in its file searching logic, deletes essential project files. This is a direct consequence of how FengNiao operates. A faulty regex like `.*_unused.*` might match files that *contain* "unused" but are still needed. A bug in the `find_unused` function could misinterpret file paths or dependencies.
    *   **Impact:** Loss of essential project files (source code, assets, configurations), leading to build failures, application malfunctions, data loss, and significant development delays. The application may become completely unusable.
    *   **FengNiao Component Affected:**
        *   `find_unused` function (and related file searching logic): This is the core function that identifies files for deletion. A bug or misconfiguration here directly leads to incorrect file selection.
        *   Configuration file parsing (if used): Incorrect parsing of a configuration file can lead to unintended deletion rules.
        *   Command-line argument parsing: Incorrect handling of command-line arguments (e.g., `--path`, `--exclude`) can lead to overly broad deletion, although this is more about *usage* than a direct FengNiao flaw.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mandatory Dry Run:** *Always* use the `--dry-run` option *first* to preview the files that would be deleted. Make this a mandatory step in any workflow.
        *   **Precise Regular Expressions:** Use highly specific and tested regular expressions to target only truly unused files. Avoid overly broad patterns.
        *   **Comprehensive Exclusion Lists:** Maintain a thorough and up-to-date exclusion list (`--exclude`) to protect critical files and directories.
        *   **Version Control & Rollback:** Use version control (Git) to allow easy rollback to a previous state if accidental deletion occurs.
        *   **Automated Testing:** Create automated tests that verify FengNiao's behavior on a representative sample project. These tests should check for false positives (incorrectly identified unused files).
        *   **Staged Rollout:** Introduce FengNiao gradually, starting with a small subset of the project and expanding its scope only after thorough testing.

## Threat: [T2: Malicious Code Removal/Injection (via Deletion)](./threats/t2_malicious_code_removalinjection__via_deletion_.md)

*   **Threat:** T2: Malicious Code Removal/Injection (via Deletion)

    *   **Description:** Although initiated by a malicious actor, the *mechanism* of this threat is FengNiao's deletion capability. The attacker leverages FengNiao to remove security-critical code, relying on FengNiao's intended functionality to achieve their malicious goal. They might delete authentication checks or input validation. The *vulnerability* is the ability to use FengNiao for malicious purposes, even if the tool itself isn't compromised.
    *   **Impact:** Introduction of security vulnerabilities, allowing unauthorized access, data breaches, or privilege escalation. The application's security posture is severely compromised.
    *   **FengNiao Component Affected:**
        *   `find_unused` function: The attacker relies on this function to delete the targeted files.
        *   Command-line arguments: The attacker might use specific arguments to target particular files or directories.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mandatory Code Review:** Require code reviews for *all* changes, including those that appear to be simple file deletions. Focus on the *reason* for the deletion.
        *   **Access Control:** Strictly limit who can run FengNiao and modify the project's configuration.
        *   **Audit Logging:** Log all FengNiao executions, including the user, timestamp, command-line arguments, and files affected.
        *   **Integrity Monitoring:** Use file integrity monitoring tools to detect unauthorized modifications to critical files, even if FengNiao doesn't flag them.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure FengNiao runs with the minimum necessary permissions.

## Threat: [T3: Supply Chain Attack (Compromised FengNiao Binary)](./threats/t3_supply_chain_attack__compromised_fengniao_binary_.md)

*   **Threat:** T3: Supply Chain Attack (Compromised FengNiao Binary)

    *   **Description:** This is a *direct* threat to FengNiao itself. An attacker compromises the FengNiao distribution and replaces it with a malicious version. This malicious version could contain backdoors, data exfiltration code, or subtly alter code instead of just deleting it. The attacker might modify the `find_unused` function or add new malicious functions.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the development environment and potentially the application itself. The attacker could steal code, credentials, deploy malware, or sabotage the project.
    *   **FengNiao Component Affected:** Potentially *any* part of the FengNiao codebase. The entire tool is suspect.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Dependency Pinning:** Use a specific, known-good version of FengNiao (e.g., `fengniao==1.2.3`) and *do not* automatically update.
        *   **Checksum Verification:** Verify the checksum (e.g., SHA256 hash) of the downloaded FengNiao binary against a trusted source (e.g., the official release page).
        *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Use SCA tools to scan FengNiao and its dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Code Review (of FengNiao itself):** If possible, review the source code of FengNiao before using it, especially if it's a critical part of your workflow.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Run FengNiao in a sandboxed environment (e.g., a Docker container) to limit its access to the host system.

## Threat: [T5: Data Exfiltration via Modified Output/Side Effects](./threats/t5_data_exfiltration_via_modified_outputside_effects.md)

* **Threat:** T5: Data Exfiltration via Modified Output/Side Effects

    *   **Description:** A compromised version of FengNiao is modified to collect and exfiltrate project information. This is a direct threat stemming from modifications *within* FengNiao. The attacker might add a function that "analyzes" the project and sends data to a remote server, or modify existing output functions to include sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:** Leakage of sensitive project information, which could be used for reconnaissance, intellectual property theft, or to plan further attacks.
    *   **FengNiao Component Affected:**
        *   Output handling (e.g., `print` statements, logging functions): The attacker modifies how FengNiao reports its findings.
        *   Potentially any function that accesses file metadata or contents.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Code Review (of FengNiao):** Carefully review the source code of FengNiao for any suspicious network activity or data handling.
        *   **Network Monitoring:** Monitor network traffic from the build environment for unexpected connections or data transfers.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Run FengNiao in a sandboxed environment with restricted network access.
        *   **Output Redirection:** Redirect FengNiao's output to a secure log file and review it regularly.
        *   **Limit Verbosity:** Avoid using overly verbose output options unless absolutely necessary.
