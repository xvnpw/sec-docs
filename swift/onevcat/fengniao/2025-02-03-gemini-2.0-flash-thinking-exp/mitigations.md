## Mitigation Strategy: [Encrypt Sensitive Cached Data (FengNiao Cache)](./mitigation_strategies/encrypt_sensitive_cached_data__fengniao_cache_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Sensitive Data in FengNiao Cache:** Determine which data being cached *by FengNiao* is sensitive (e.g., authentication tokens, user personal information, financial data within API responses cached by FengNiao).
2.  **Implement Encryption Layer for FengNiao Cache:** Since FengNiao itself doesn't provide built-in encryption, implement an encryption layer *around* the data before it is passed to FengNiao's caching mechanism. This means encrypting the data in your application code *before* using FengNiao's cache functions to store it.
3.  **Decryption on Retrieval from FengNiao Cache:** When retrieving data *from FengNiao's cache*, decrypt it immediately after retrieval in your application code *before* using it.
4.  **Secure Key Management (External to FengNiao):**  Manage encryption keys securely using platform-specific mechanisms (like Keychain/Keystore).  This key management is handled *outside* of FengNiao's scope, but is crucial for securing data cached by FengNiao.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Threat:** Data Breach via FengNiao Cache Exposure (Severity: High) - Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in FengNiao's cache if the device is compromised, lost, or stolen, or if the cache storage location is insecure.

**Impact:** Significantly reduces the risk of data breach from FengNiao cache exposure. Even if the FengNiao cache is accessed, the encrypted data remains unreadable.

**Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Authentication tokens cached via a custom caching mechanism (not directly FengNiao's built-in cache, but conceptually similar in usage with FengNiao for network responses) are encrypted.

**Missing Implementation:** Direct usage of FengNiao's built-in caching features for user profile data currently lacks encryption. If switching to FengNiao's cache for user profiles, encryption must be implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Cache Invalidation and Expiration (FengNiao Cache Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_cache_invalidation_and_expiration__fengniao_cache_configuration_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Configure FengNiao Cache Expiration:** Utilize FengNiao's cache configuration options to set appropriate expiration times for cached data. This is configured *within* FengNiao's cache settings.
2.  **Implement Application-Level Cache Invalidation for FengNiao:** Develop application logic to trigger cache invalidation *of FengNiao's cache* when necessary events occur. This might involve using FengNiao's API to clear specific cache entries or the entire cache programmatically. Events include:
    *   User logout: Clear user-specific data from FengNiao's cache.
    *   Data modification on server: Invalidate relevant cached data in FengNiao based on server-side updates.
3.  **Leverage FengNiao's Cache Control Headers:** Ensure your server API responses include appropriate cache-control headers (e.g., `max-age`, `no-cache`, `no-store`) that FengNiao can respect to manage its cache behavior. This influences *how FengNiao caches responses*.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Threat:** Stale Data Exposure from FengNiao Cache (Severity: Medium) - Users may be presented with outdated information retrieved from FengNiao's cache.
*   **Threat:** Access Control Bypass due to Stale FengNiao Cache (Severity: Medium) - Outdated authorization data in FengNiao's cache could lead to bypassed access controls.

**Impact:** Reduces the risk of stale data and access control issues arising from FengNiao's caching mechanism.

**Currently Implemented:** Time-based expiration is configured for the general network cache (using a custom mechanism, not directly FengNiao's built-in cache yet). User logout triggers cache invalidation (again, on the custom cache).

**Missing Implementation:** Direct configuration and utilization of FengNiao's built-in cache expiration and invalidation features are not fully implemented. If migrating to FengNiao's cache, these features need to be configured.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Authentication and Authorization with FengNiao Request Adapters](./mitigation_strategies/secure_authentication_and_authorization_with_fengniao_request_adapters.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Utilize FengNiao Request Adapters for Authentication:** If using FengNiao for authentication, implement authentication logic within FengNiao's request adapter mechanism. This allows for centralized and consistent authentication header injection.
2.  **Secure Credential Handling in FengNiao Adapters (External Storage):**  Within your FengNiao request adapters, retrieve credentials from secure storage (Keychain/Keystore) - *do not store credentials directly in the adapter code*.
3.  **HTTPS Enforcement in FengNiao Adapters:**  Ensure that within your authentication adapters, you are *only* making requests over HTTPS.  Do not allow HTTP for authenticated requests within the adapter logic.
4.  **Input Validation in FengNiao Adapters (If Applicable):** If your FengNiao adapter processes user input for authentication, perform input validation *within the adapter* to prevent injection attacks before constructing requests.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Threat:** Credential Exposure in Authentication Logic (Severity: Critical) - Insecure handling of credentials within authentication mechanisms used with FengNiao.
*   **Threat:** Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Authentication (Severity: High) - HTTP usage in authentication flows managed by FengNiao adapters.
*   **Threat:** Injection Attacks via Adapter Input (Severity: Medium to High) - Vulnerabilities arising from processing untrusted input within FengNiao authentication adapters.

**Impact:** Reduces risks associated with authentication and authorization when using FengNiao. Secure credential handling and HTTPS enforcement within adapters enhance security.

**Currently Implemented:** Authentication adapters are used with FengNiao for adding authorization headers. Credential retrieval is from Keychain/Keystore. HTTPS is enforced.

**Missing Implementation:** Input validation within authentication adapters is basic. More robust validation could be added to the `AuthenticationAdapter` to handle potential injection scenarios more comprehensively.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce HTTPS Globally in FengNiao Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_https_globally_in_fengniao_configuration.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Configure FengNiao to Prefer HTTPS:**  Set FengNiao's configuration to default to HTTPS for all requests.  This is a global configuration setting for FengNiao.
2.  **Avoid Overriding HTTPS in Specific FengNiao Requests (Unless Justified):**  Minimize or eliminate cases where you might explicitly create FengNiao requests using HTTP. If HTTP is necessary for specific, non-sensitive endpoints, ensure there is a strong security justification and compensating controls.
3.  **Review FengNiao Request Creation Code:** Regularly audit the code where FengNiao requests are created to ensure that `https://` is used consistently and not accidentally overridden with `http://`.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Threat:** Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks via FengNiao Requests (Severity: High) - Unencrypted HTTP requests made by FengNiao are vulnerable to interception and manipulation.

**Impact:** Significantly reduces the risk of MITM attacks on network traffic handled by FengNiao by ensuring encryption through HTTPS.

**Currently Implemented:** FengNiao's `NetworkManager` is configured to use HTTPS as the default scheme for all requests.

**Missing Implementation:** No missing implementation identified. Continuous vigilance is needed to prevent accidental introduction of HTTP requests when using FengNiao.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization in FengNiao Response Handlers](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization_in_fengniao_response_handlers.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Response Handlers Processing Untrusted Data (FengNiao):** Locate all response handlers used with FengNiao that process data received from API responses.
2.  **Implement Validation in FengNiao Response Handlers:** Within these FengNiao response handlers, validate the structure, data types, and expected values of the API response data.
3.  **Sanitize Data in FengNiao Response Handlers for Output:** If response data processed by FengNiao handlers is used in contexts where it could be interpreted as code (e.g., web views), sanitize it *within the response handler* to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
4.  **Secure Deserialization (FengNiao's Handling):** If FengNiao handles response deserialization (e.g., JSON parsing), ensure that the deserialization process is secure and uses up-to-date libraries to mitigate deserialization vulnerabilities.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via FengNiao Response Data (Severity: High - in web contexts) - Unsanitized data from FengNiao responses displayed in web views can lead to XSS.
*   **Threat:** Data Injection Attacks via FengNiao Responses (Severity: Medium to High) - Malicious data in FengNiao responses can exploit vulnerabilities in data processing logic within response handlers.
*   **Threat:** Deserialization Vulnerabilities (Severity: Medium) - Insecure deserialization of FengNiao responses can lead to various attacks.

**Impact:** Reduces input-based vulnerabilities arising from processing API responses received via FengNiao. Validation and sanitization in response handlers improve data safety.

**Currently Implemented:** Basic data type validation exists in some response handlers used with FengNiao in modules like `UserProfileService` and `ProductService`.

**Missing Implementation:** Consistent and comprehensive input validation and sanitization are not applied across *all* FengNiao response handlers. HTML sanitization for web view display of FengNiao response data is specifically missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Certificate Pinning for FengNiao Requests (Advanced)](./mitigation_strategies/certificate_pinning_for_fengniao_requests__advanced_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Implement Certificate Pinning with FengNiao (If Supported or via URLSession):** Investigate if FengNiao directly supports certificate pinning. If not, explore implementing certificate pinning at the URLSession level (if FengNiao uses URLSession under the hood) for requests made through FengNiao.
2.  **Pin Server Certificates or Public Keys:** Choose to pin either the server's certificate or its public key. Public key pinning is generally more robust against certificate rotation.
3.  **Implement Pinning Fallback Mechanism:**  Include a fallback mechanism in case of pinning failures (e.g., network error, fallback to system trust, or controlled application shutdown) to avoid unexpected application behavior.
4.  **Regularly Update Pins:**  Establish a process to update pinned certificates or public keys when server certificates are rotated. Outdated pins can cause application failures.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Threat:** Advanced Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks against FengNiao Requests (Severity: High) - Certificate pinning provides stronger protection against sophisticated MITM attacks, including those involving compromised Certificate Authorities.

**Impact:** Provides enhanced protection against advanced MITM attacks for network requests made by FengNiao.

**Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. Certificate pinning is not currently used for FengNiao requests.

**Missing Implementation:** Certificate pinning needs to be implemented for FengNiao requests to enhance security against advanced MITM threats. This would likely involve custom URLSession configuration if FengNiao relies on it.
