## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit FengNiao Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - PATH START]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_fengniao_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path___critical_node_-_path_start_.md)

Attack Vectors: This is the overarching path. Attackers will focus on finding specific vulnerabilities within FengNiao's code or how applications use it.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Request Handling Weaknesses [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - CATEGORY]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_request_handling_weaknesses__high-risk_path___critical_node_-_category_.md)

Attack Vectors:
    *   **Input Validation Bypass [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - VULNERABILITY]:**
        *   **Crafted Request Parameters (Exceed Expected Length Limits, Inject Unexpected Data Types) [CRITICAL NODE - HIGH LIKELIHOOD]:**
            *   **Attack Vectors:** Sending requests with parameters that are longer than expected, contain unexpected characters, or are of the wrong data type.
            *   **Example:**  A username field expecting a maximum of 50 characters, sending a request with a 1000-character username. Or, sending a string where an integer is expected.
            *   **Impact:** Can lead to buffer overflows (less likely in Swift but possible in underlying C), logic errors, or application crashes.
        *   **Insufficient Sanitization in FengNiao [CRITICAL NODE - CONDITION ENABLER]:**
            *   **No Built-in Sanitization Functions [CRITICAL NODE - CONDITION]:** FengNiao, being lightweight, might not provide automatic sanitization.
            *   **Developer Neglect in Application Code (Using FengNiao) [CRITICAL NODE - CONDITION]:** Developers might assume FengNiao handles sanitization or forget to implement it themselves.
            *   **Impact:**  Increases the likelihood of successful input validation bypass and subsequent attacks like injection.
    *   **Body Parsing Exploits [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Malformed Request Body (Exceed Body Size Limits (DoS) [CRITICAL NODE - HIGH LIKELIHOOD, MEDIUM IMPACT], Inject Malicious Payloads (If Body Parsed and Processed Unsafely) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - MEDIUM-HIGH IMPACT]):**
            *   **Attack Vectors:** Sending excessively large request bodies to cause resource exhaustion (DoS). Injecting malicious payloads within the request body (e.g., in JSON or XML data) if the application parses and processes this data unsafely.
            *   **Example:** Sending a multi-gigabyte request body to overwhelm the server. Injecting SQL commands within a JSON payload if the application directly uses JSON data in SQL queries without sanitization.
            *   **Impact:** DoS, data manipulation, potentially code execution if payloads are processed unsafely.
        *   **Vulnerabilities in Body Parsing Logic (If Any in FengNiao) (Buffer Overflow [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - HIGH IMPACT]):**
            *   **Attack Vectors:** Exploiting potential buffer overflows or logic errors in FengNiao's body parsing code (if it exists and handles complex body types). Buffer overflows are less likely in Swift itself but could occur in underlying C libraries if FengNiao uses them for parsing.
            *   **Example:** Sending a specially crafted request body that triggers a buffer overflow in a C-based parsing library used by FengNiao.
            *   **Impact:** Code execution, system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Routing Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_routing_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vectors:
    *   **Route Traversal/Bypass [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - VULNERABILITY]:**
        *   **Crafted URL Paths (Path Traversal Sequences (e.g., `../`) [CRITICAL NODE - HIGH IMPACT POTENTIAL]):**
            *   **Attack Vectors:** Using path traversal sequences like `../` in URLs to access files or directories outside the intended web root.
            *   **Example:**  `https://example.com/images/../../../../etc/passwd` to try and access the `/etc/passwd` file.
            *   **Impact:** Access to sensitive files, information disclosure, potentially leading to further compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Session Management Weaknesses (If FengNiao or Application Handles Sessions) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - CATEGORY]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_session_management_weaknesses__if_fengniao_or_application_handles_sessions___high-risk_path__e3a2cec9.md)

Attack Vectors:
    *   **Session Hijacking [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - VULNERABILITY]:**
        *   **Steal Session Identifier (Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - HIGH IMPACT, APPLICATION LEVEL], Network Sniffing [CRITICAL NODE - HIGH IMPACT, BUT SHOULD BE MITIGATED]):**
            *   **Attack Vectors:** Stealing session IDs through XSS vulnerabilities in the application (not FengNiao itself, but in application code using FengNiao). Network sniffing if HTTPS is not enforced (should be mitigated by using HTTPS).
            *   **Example (XSS):** Injecting malicious JavaScript into a vulnerable page that steals the session cookie and sends it to the attacker.
            *   **Example (Network Sniffing):** If HTTP is used, an attacker on the same network can sniff network traffic and capture session cookies.
            *   **Impact:** Account takeover.
    *   **Session Fixation [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - VULNERABILITY]:**
        *   **FengNiao or Application Accepts Fixed Session IDs (No Session ID Regeneration on Login [CRITICAL NODE - CONDITION]):**
            *   **Attack Vectors:** Forcing a known session ID on a user. If the application doesn't regenerate session IDs after login, the attacker can hijack the session after the user authenticates.
            *   **Example:** An attacker sets a session cookie with a known ID in the user's browser. If the application accepts this ID and doesn't regenerate it upon login, the attacker can use the same ID to access the user's account after they log in.
            *   **Impact:** Account takeover.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Error Handling/Information Disclosure [CRITICAL NODE - CATEGORY]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_error_handlinginformation_disclosure__critical_node_-_category_.md)

Attack Vectors:
    *   **Verbose Error Messages [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - VULNERABILITY]:**
        *   **FengNiao or Application Returns Detailed Error Information (Stack Traces [CRITICAL NODE - HIGH IMPACT - INFO DISCLOSURE], Internal Paths/Configurations [CRITICAL NODE - HIGH IMPACT - INFO DISCLOSURE]):**
            *   **Attack Vectors:** Triggering application errors that result in detailed error messages being displayed to the user. These messages can reveal stack traces, internal file paths, configuration details, and other sensitive information.
            *   **Example:** Sending invalid input to a route that causes an unhandled exception, resulting in a stack trace being displayed in the response.
            *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, which can aid further attacks.
    *   **Debug Information Leakage [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - VULNERABILITY]:**
        *   **Application in Debug Mode (Accidental Deployment) [CRITICAL NODE - CONDITION ENABLER]:**
            *   **Attack Vectors:**  Accidentally deploying the application in debug mode to production. Debug mode often enables verbose logging, debug endpoints, and less strict security checks.
            *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potentially leading to control if debug endpoints are exposed.
        *   **FengNiao or Application Exposes Debug Endpoints/Logs (Verbose Logging Enabled in Production [CRITICAL NODE - HIGH LIKELIHOOD, MEDIUM IMPACT - INFO DISCLOSURE]):**
            *   **Attack Vectors:**  Leaving debug endpoints accessible in production or enabling verbose logging in production. Logs can contain sensitive data.
            *   **Example:**  Leaving a `/debug/routes` endpoint unprotected in production.
            *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potentially leading to control if debug endpoints are exposed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - CATEGORY]](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos__attacks__high-risk_path___critical_node_-_category_.md)

Attack Vectors:
    *   **Resource Exhaustion [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - VULNERABILITY]:**
        *   **Send High Volume of Requests (Flooding Attacks [CRITICAL NODE - HIGH LIKELIHOOD, HIGH IMPACT]):**
            *   **Attack Vectors:** Sending a massive number of requests to overwhelm the server's resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth).
            *   **Example:** Using botnets to send millions of HTTP requests per second to the application.
            *   **Impact:** Service unavailability.
        *   **FengNiao's Resource Management Weaknesses (Lack of Request Rate Limiting [CRITICAL NODE - CONDITION ENABLER]):**
            *   **Attack Vectors:** FengNiao, as a lightweight framework, likely doesn't have built-in rate limiting. Lack of rate limiting makes it easier for attackers to perform resource exhaustion attacks.
            *   **Impact:**  Increases the likelihood of successful DoS attacks.
    *   **Application Logic DoS [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - VULNERABILITY]:**
        *   **Trigger Resource-Intensive Operations (Specific Crafted Requests [CRITICAL NODE - HIGH IMPACT POTENTIAL]):**
            *   **Attack Vectors:** Sending specific requests that trigger computationally expensive operations in the application code, leading to resource exhaustion and DoS.
            *   **Example:** Sending requests that trigger complex database queries or computationally intensive algorithms in the application.
            *   **Impact:** Service unavailability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (Indirectly related to FengNiao) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - CATEGORY]](./attack_tree_paths/dependency_vulnerabilities__indirectly_related_to_fengniao___high-risk_path___critical_node_-_catego_7e9f34da.md)

Attack Vectors:
    *   **Vulnerable Swift Standard Library [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - VULNERABILITY, HIGH IMPACT POTENTIAL]:**
        *   **Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Swift Core Libraries (Memory Corruption Bugs [HIGH-RISK IMPACT]):**
            *   **Attack Vectors:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities (especially memory corruption bugs) in the Swift standard library or underlying C libraries used by Swift.
            *   **Impact:** Code execution, system compromise.
    *   **Vulnerable Third-Party Libraries (If FengNiao or Application Uses Them) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - VULNERABILITY]:**
        *   **Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Dependencies (Outdated Libraries [CRITICAL NODE - CONDITION ENABLER], Unpatched Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE - CONDITION ENABLER]):**
            *   **Attack Vectors:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by FengNiao or the application. Using outdated libraries or libraries with unpatched vulnerabilities increases the risk.
            *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but can range from information disclosure to code execution.
