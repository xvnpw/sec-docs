# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, named fengniao, is a command-line tool designed to expedite the process of modifying Xcode project settings. The primary business priority it addresses is enhancing developer productivity and efficiency in managing Xcode projects.

- Business Priorities:
  - Increase developer productivity by automating repetitive Xcode project configuration tasks.
  - Reduce manual errors associated with modifying Xcode project settings.
  - Streamline the development workflow, allowing developers to focus on core development activities rather than project setup.

- Business Goals:
  - Provide a user-friendly command-line interface for common Xcode project setting modifications.
  - Minimize the time spent on project configuration, leading to faster iteration cycles.
  - Improve the consistency and accuracy of Xcode project settings across development teams.

- Business Risks:
  - Incorrect project settings application leading to build failures, unexpected application behavior, or issues during app submission to the App Store.
  - Potential for accidental or malicious modification of critical project settings, causing development delays or security vulnerabilities.
  - Risk of tool malfunction or bugs that could corrupt Xcode project files, leading to data loss or project instability.
  - Supply chain risks if dependencies of the tool are compromised, potentially introducing malicious functionality.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Currently, based on the nature of a command-line tool and the provided repository, there are likely limited explicit security controls implemented within fengniao itself, relying heavily on the security posture of the user's development environment.

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: User access control provided by the operating system, governing who can execute the tool and access Xcode project files. Implemented by: Operating System.
  - security control: Code hosted on GitHub, benefiting from GitHub's security measures for repository integrity and access control. Implemented by: GitHub.

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on the user's local machine security posture. It is assumed that developers using the tool have secure development environments.
  - accepted risk: Trust in the source of the tool (GitHub repository and maintainer). Users implicitly trust that the provided code is not malicious.
  - accepted risk: Potential for user error in specifying project settings through the command-line interface.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - recommended security control: Implement input validation and sanitization for all command-line arguments and project settings to prevent injection attacks or unexpected behavior.
  - recommended security control: Code signing of the compiled binary to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the tool, allowing users to verify they are running a genuine version.
  - recommended security control: Implement basic error handling and logging to provide informative feedback to users and aid in debugging potential issues, including security-related problems.
  - recommended security control: Conduct static application security testing (SAST) during the build process to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the codebase.
  - recommended security control: Dependency scanning to identify and manage known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by the tool.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable for a command-line tool executed locally. Authentication is implicitly handled by the user's operating system login.
  - Authorization: Authorization is managed by the file system permissions of the operating system. The tool operates under the permissions of the user executing it. Ensure the tool operates with the least privileges necessary.
  - Input Validation: Robust input validation is crucial. All inputs from the command line, especially those modifying project settings, must be validated to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity. Validate data type, format, and allowed values for each setting.
  - Cryptography: Cryptography is likely not a primary requirement for this tool, as it primarily manipulates Xcode project settings. However, if future features involve handling sensitive data (e.g., API keys in project files - which is discouraged), appropriate encryption mechanisms should be considered. For now, focus on secure storage and handling of project files by relying on operating system security features.

# DESIGN

fengniao is designed as a command-line interface (CLI) tool that developers can use to modify Xcode project settings. The tool interacts directly with Xcode project files on the user's local file system.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Software Development Lifecycle, specifically the Xcode project configuration phase.
  - Maintaining consistency and accuracy in Xcode project settings across development teams and projects.

- Data to Protect:
  - Xcode Project Files (.xcodeproj, project.pbxproj): These files contain project configurations, build settings, and potentially sensitive information like API keys (though best practices discourage storing sensitive keys directly in project files).
    - Data Sensitivity: Moderate to High. While project files are not typically considered highly sensitive in themselves, they are crucial for the integrity and functionality of software projects. Incorrect modifications or corruption can lead to significant development disruptions. If sensitive information is inadvertently included, the sensitivity increases.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - Is there a plan to implement automated security testing (SAST, dependency scanning) in the build pipeline?
  - Are there any specific guidelines or best practices followed during development to ensure secure coding?
  - Is code signing of the fengniao executable planned for future releases?
  - What is the intended audience for fengniao (internal team, public developers)? This can influence the risk appetite and required security measures.

- Assumptions:
  - Assumption: fengniao is intended to be used by developers to improve their workflow and is not directly exposed to end-users or external systems in a production environment.
  - Assumption: Developers using fengniao are expected to have a basic understanding of Xcode project settings and the potential impact of modifications.
  - Assumption: The primary goal is to enhance developer productivity, and security is a secondary but important consideration.
  - Assumption: The tool is distributed as a command-line executable for macOS.
  - Assumption: The development team is small and likely operates with a startup-like posture, potentially accepting slightly higher risks in favor of rapid development and feature delivery, but still valuing security best practices.
