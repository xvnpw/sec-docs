### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving FengNiao

Here's a filtered list of high and critical threats that directly involve the FengNiao library:

* **Threat:** Unintended Deletion of Critical Project Assets
    * **Description:** FengNiao, due to incorrect configuration or bugs in its logic, could delete essential project files (e.g., actively used images, code files, localization files).
    * **Impact:** Loss of critical project assets leading to build failures, application crashes, data loss, or the inability to release updates. Significant development time could be required to recover the lost files.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Thoroughly test FengNiao's configuration in a non-production environment before applying it to the main project.
        * Utilize FengNiao's exclusion list feature to explicitly protect important directories and files.
        * Carefully review and validate the configured paths and patterns used by FengNiao.
        * Implement robust version control for the Xcode project to allow for easy rollback in case of accidental deletions.
        * Consider using FengNiao's dry-run or read-only mode to preview changes before applying them.

* **Threat:** Exploitation of Symbolic Link Vulnerabilities
    * **Description:** Malicious symbolic links within the Xcode project could trick FengNiao into deleting files or directories outside the project's boundaries due to how FengNiao traverses the file system.
    * **Impact:** Deletion of sensitive files or directories on the developer's machine or build server, potentially leading to data breaches or system compromise.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Ensure FengNiao's configuration and execution environment prevent it from following symbolic links outside the intended project structure.
        * Implement security checks within the application or build process to detect and prevent the creation of suspicious symbolic links within the project.
        * Keep FengNiao and its dependencies updated to patch any known vulnerabilities related to symbolic link handling.

* **Threat:** Execution of FengNiao in Production Environment
    * **Description:** Running FengNiao in a production environment could lead to the deletion of live application assets, causing service disruption or data loss for end-users.
    * **Impact:** Significant service disruption, data loss for users, negative impact on business operations and reputation.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Clearly define and enforce strict separation between development, staging, and production environments.
        * Implement safeguards to prevent the execution of development tools like FengNiao in production environments.
        * Educate developers about the risks of running such tools in production.
