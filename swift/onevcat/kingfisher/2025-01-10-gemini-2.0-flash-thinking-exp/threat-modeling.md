# Threat Model Analysis for onevcat/kingfisher

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on HTTP Resources](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_http_resources.md)

*   **Description:** When Kingfisher fetches images over HTTP (not HTTPS), an attacker intercepting the network traffic can modify the image data in transit. This directly involves Kingfisher's network request functionality.
    *   **Impact:** Displaying tampered images, potentially leading to misinformation, phishing attempts, or UI manipulation.
    *   **Affected Component:** Kingfisher's network image download mechanism.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** **Always use HTTPS for image URLs.** Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict image sources.

## Threat: [Serving Malicious Images from Compromised Server](./threats/serving_malicious_images_from_compromised_server.md)

*   **Description:** If an image server is compromised and serves malicious images, Kingfisher will download and potentially cache these images. This directly involves Kingfisher's download and caching mechanisms.
    *   **Impact:** Displaying malicious content, potentially leading to drive-by downloads, cross-site scripting (if the application doesn't sanitize SVG images properly after Kingfisher fetches them), or other client-side exploits.
    *   **Affected Component:** Kingfisher's download and caching mechanisms.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the exploit and application vulnerabilities).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement strong security measures on the image server. Implement input validation and sanitization on the client-side when rendering images. Use Subresource Integrity (SRI) if applicable.

## Threat: [Cache Poisoning](./threats/cache_poisoning.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates Kingfisher's caching mechanism to replace legitimate cached images with malicious ones. This directly targets Kingfisher's cache functionality.
    *   **Impact:** Displaying malicious content to users even after the legitimate image source is corrected, until the cache is cleared. This can lead to persistent attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:** Kingfisher's caching module (disk cache or custom cache).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Ensure the integrity of the cache directory and its contents. If using a custom cache, implement proper access controls and security measures. Consider using cache invalidation mechanisms.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities within the Kingfisher Library Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_within_the_kingfisher_library_itself.md)

*   **Description:** Kingfisher might contain security vulnerabilities in its code (e.g., buffer overflows, memory corruption) that an attacker could exploit if they can control the image URLs being processed. This is a direct vulnerability within the Kingfisher library.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for crashes, remote code execution, or other unexpected behavior.
    *   **Affected Component:** Various modules within the Kingfisher library, depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (depending on the nature of the vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Keep the Kingfisher library updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches. Monitor Kingfisher's release notes and security advisories.

## Threat: [Misconfiguration of Kingfisher Settings Leading to Insecure Practices](./threats/misconfiguration_of_kingfisher_settings_leading_to_insecure_practices.md)

*   **Description:** Developers might misconfigure Kingfisher settings, such as disabling secure caching options or not properly handling authentication, leading to security vulnerabilities directly related to how Kingfisher operates.
    *   **Impact:** Increased risk of MITM attacks or unauthorized access to images.
    *   **Affected Component:** Kingfisher's configuration and initialization within the application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Carefully review and understand Kingfisher's configuration options. Follow security best practices when configuring the library. Ensure proper handling of authentication and authorization when fetching protected images.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Kingfisher's Dependencies](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_kingfisher's_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Kingfisher relies on other libraries. If these dependencies have critical security vulnerabilities, they could be exploited through Kingfisher's usage of those dependencies. This directly involves Kingfisher's dependency management.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for crashes, remote code execution, or other exploits.
    *   **Affected Component:** The vulnerable dependency used by Kingfisher.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (depending on the nature of the dependency vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Regularly update Kingfisher and its dependencies. Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
