# Threat Model Analysis for onevcat/kingfisher

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Image Injection](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__image_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic during image download over HTTP or compromised HTTPS. They replace the legitimate image with malicious content (e.g., malware, phishing image). This is achieved by eavesdropping on unencrypted HTTP connections or exploiting weaknesses in HTTPS certificate validation used by Kingfisher's network module.
**Impact:** Malware injection onto user devices, phishing attacks leading to credential theft or data breaches, display of misleading or harmful content damaging application reputation.
**Kingfisher Component Affected:** Network downloading module.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Enforce HTTPS for all image URLs:** Ensure all image URLs used with Kingfisher start with `https://`.
*   **Enable Default HTTPS Certificate Validation:** Do not disable or weaken Kingfisher's default HTTPS certificate validation settings.
*   **Implement HSTS on Image Servers:** Encourage or require image providers to enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to force HTTPS usage.

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via URL Manipulation](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_url_manipulation.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates image URLs provided to Kingfisher to target internal servers or services. By crafting URLs that point to internal resources, the attacker can bypass firewalls and access restricted data or functionalities on the server-side. Kingfisher's URL handling in the download module is exploited to make requests to these internal resources.
**Impact:** Access to internal systems and data, potential for further exploitation of internal services, data breaches, denial of service of internal resources.
**Kingfisher Component Affected:** URL handling within the downloading module.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Strict URL Sanitization and Validation:** Thoroughly sanitize and validate all inputs used to construct image URLs *before* passing them to Kingfisher. Use allowlists for allowed domains or URL patterns.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege for Image Servers:** Configure image servers with minimal necessary permissions and restrict access to sensitive internal resources.
*   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate image servers and internal networks to limit the impact of SSRF attacks.

## Threat: [Image Processing Vulnerabilities (via Malicious Images)](./threats/image_processing_vulnerabilities__via_malicious_images_.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides specially crafted malicious images designed to exploit vulnerabilities in image decoding libraries used by Kingfisher or the underlying system. Processing these images by Kingfisher's decoding module can trigger buffer overflows, heap overflows, or other vulnerabilities, potentially leading to application crashes or arbitrary code execution.
**Impact:** Application crashes, potential for arbitrary code execution on the client device, system compromise.
**Kingfisher Component Affected:** Image processing/decoding module.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Keep System Libraries Updated:** Ensure the operating system and underlying image processing libraries are kept up-to-date with the latest security patches.
*   **Input Validation (Basic Image Format Checks):** Perform basic validation on downloaded images (e.g., checking file headers) to detect potentially malformed or suspicious files before full processing.
*   **Sandboxing/Isolation (Advanced):** Consider running image processing in a sandboxed or isolated environment to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Insecure Kingfisher Configuration (Critical Security Weakening)](./threats/insecure_kingfisher_configuration__critical_security_weakening_.md)

**Description:** Developers critically misconfigure Kingfisher by disabling HTTPS certificate validation or implementing other severely insecure settings. This drastically weakens the security posture of the application, making it highly vulnerable to attacks like MITM.
**Impact:**  High risk of MITM attacks and subsequent malware injection or data breaches, significant compromise of application security.
**Kingfisher Component Affected:** Configuration settings of Kingfisher, initialization and setup of Kingfisher.
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Strictly Follow Security Best Practices for Kingfisher Configuration:** Adhere to Kingfisher's documentation and security recommendations, especially regarding HTTPS and certificate validation.
*   **Mandatory Security Reviews of Configuration:** Implement mandatory security reviews for any changes to Kingfisher's configuration, focusing on potential security implications.
*   **Use Secure Defaults and Avoid Security-Weakening Modifications:**  Rely on Kingfisher's secure default settings and strictly avoid any configuration changes that weaken security, especially disabling HTTPS certificate validation.
