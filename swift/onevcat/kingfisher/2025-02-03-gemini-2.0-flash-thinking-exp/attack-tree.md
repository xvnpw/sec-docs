## Attack Tree Path: [1.0 Exploit Malicious Image Delivery](./attack_tree_paths/1_0_exploit_malicious_image_delivery.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attacker compromises an image server or sets up a malicious server to serve images to the application.
*   **Breakdown of Sub-Attacks:**
    *   **1.1.1 Exploit Image Format Vulnerability:**
        *   **Attack:** Serve a specially crafted image that exploits vulnerabilities in image decoding libraries used by Kingfisher or the underlying system.
        *   **1.1.1.1 [CRITICAL NODE] Trigger Code Execution on Client Device:**
            *   **Impact:**  Attacker gains complete control over the application and potentially the user's device.
            *   **Example:** Buffer overflows, heap overflows in image parsing logic.
    *   **1.1.2 Embed Malicious Content within Image (XSS):**
        *   **Attack:** Embed malicious scripts (e.g., JavaScript) within image metadata or pixel data. If the application reflects image URLs or metadata without sanitization, this can lead to XSS.
        *   **1.1.2.1 [CRITICAL NODE] Steal User Credentials/Session Tokens:**
            *   **Impact:** Attacker can steal sensitive user information, leading to account compromise and data breaches.
            *   **Example:** Embedding JavaScript in EXIF metadata that executes when the application displays or processes the image URL.
    *   **1.1.3 Serve Large/Resource-Intensive Image:**
        *   **Attack:** Serve extremely large or computationally expensive images to overwhelm the client device.
        *   **1.1.3.1 Cause Client-Side Resource Exhaustion (DoS):**
            *   **Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive or crashes due to resource exhaustion on the client device.
            *   **Example:** Serving a multi-gigabyte image or an image that requires excessive CPU/memory to decode.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attacker intercepts network traffic between the application and the image server.
*   **Breakdown of Sub-Attacks:**
    *   **1.2.1 [CRITICAL NODE] Intercept and Replace Image Response with Malicious Image:**
        *   **Attack:**  Attacker intercepts the legitimate image response and replaces it with a malicious image (as described in 1.1).
        *   **Impact:**  Same as 1.1 (code execution, XSS, DoS) but achieved through network interception.
    *   **1.2.2 [CRITICAL NODE] Downgrade HTTPS to HTTP:**
        *   **Attack:** If the application does not strictly enforce HTTPS, the attacker attempts to downgrade the connection to HTTP.
        *   **Impact:**  Facilitates MitM attacks (like 1.2.1) by removing encryption and making interception easier.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.0 Exploit Misconfiguration/Misuse of Kingfisher in Application](./attack_tree_paths/4_0_exploit_misconfigurationmisuse_of_kingfisher_in_application.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Vulnerabilities arise from how the application is configured or how Kingfisher is used within the application's code.
*   **Breakdown of Sub-Attacks:**
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] 4.1 Insecure Image URL Handling:**
        *   **4.1.1 Application Constructs Image URLs from User Input without Proper Sanitization:**
            *   **Attack:** The application builds image URLs using user-provided input without proper validation or sanitization.
            *   **Impact:** Can lead to Open Redirect vulnerabilities (if the application redirects based on image loading) or SSRF (in server-side contexts).
            *   **Example:** User input is directly concatenated into the image URL string without encoding or validation.
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] 4.2 Inadequate Security Policies:**
        *   **4.2.1 [CRITICAL NODE] Facilitate MitM attacks:**
            *   **Attack:**  The application or its environment is configured to allow HTTP connections when HTTPS is expected for image loading.
            *   **Impact:** Enables MitM attacks (as in 1.2) and exposes the application to malicious image delivery.
            *   **Example:** Not enforcing HTTPS in application code or server configuration, allowing image URLs to be loaded over HTTP.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.1 Insecure Image URL Handling](./attack_tree_paths/4_1_insecure_image_url_handling.md)

*   **4.1.1 Application Constructs Image URLs from User Input without Proper Sanitization:**
            *   **Attack:** The application builds image URLs using user-provided input without proper validation or sanitization.
            *   **Impact:** Can lead to Open Redirect vulnerabilities (if the application redirects based on image loading) or SSRF (in server-side contexts).
            *   **Example:** User input is directly concatenated into the image URL string without encoding or validation.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.2 Inadequate Security Policies](./attack_tree_paths/4_2_inadequate_security_policies.md)

*   **4.2.1 [CRITICAL NODE] Facilitate MitM attacks:**
            *   **Attack:**  The application or its environment is configured to allow HTTP connections when HTTPS is expected for image loading.
            *   **Impact:** Enables MitM attacks (as in 1.2) and exposes the application to malicious image delivery.
            *   **Example:** Not enforcing HTTPS in application code or server configuration, allowing image URLs to be loaded over HTTP.
