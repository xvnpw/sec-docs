# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
 - Improve application performance by efficiently downloading and caching images.
 - Enhance user experience by reducing image loading times.
 - Optimize bandwidth usage and potentially reduce data transfer costs.

- Business Risks:
 - Application performance degradation or instability due to issues within the image loading and caching library.
 - Security vulnerabilities in the library leading to potential compromise of applications using it.
 - Operational disruptions if the library fails to function correctly, impacting image display within applications.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
 - security control: Dependency management using Swift Package Manager or CocoaPods. Described in project documentation and dependency files.
 - security control: Code review process via GitHub pull requests. Evident in project's contribution guidelines and pull request history.
 - security control: Open source community review and scrutiny. Inherent to the open source nature of the project on GitHub.
 - accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies used by Kingfisher. Assumed to be managed through dependency updates and community vigilance.
 - accepted risk: Risk of misconfiguration or misuse of the library by developers integrating it into their applications. Addressed through documentation and examples.

- Recommended Security Controls:
 - security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) on Kingfisher codebase to identify potential vulnerabilities.
 - security control: Integrate dependency vulnerability scanning into the development pipeline to proactively detect and address vulnerable dependencies.
 - security control: Provide security guidelines and best practices for developers using Kingfisher to ensure secure integration and usage.

- Security Requirements:
 - Authentication:
  - Requirement: If Kingfisher is used to download images that require authentication, the application integrating Kingfisher is responsible for handling authentication and providing necessary credentials (e.g., headers, tokens) to the image server. Kingfisher itself should support passing through authentication headers.
 - Authorization:
  - Requirement: Authorization to access images is assumed to be handled by the image server and the application. Kingfisher should not bypass any authorization mechanisms implemented by the image server.
 - Input Validation:
  - Requirement: Kingfisher should perform basic validation of image URLs to prevent malformed requests. However, comprehensive input validation of URLs and image data is primarily the responsibility of the application using Kingfisher and the image server providing the images.
 - Cryptography:
  - Requirement: Kingfisher should support HTTPS for secure communication with image servers to protect image data in transit.
  - Requirement: If cached images contain sensitive information (which is generally not expected for public image caching libraries), consider encrypting the cache storage. However, for typical use cases of caching public images, encryption of the cache might not be a primary requirement.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
 - Displaying images within applications is a critical process for user engagement, content presentation, and overall application functionality. If image loading fails or is slow, user experience is negatively impacted.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
 - Primarily, the data being handled by Kingfisher is image data downloaded from image servers and cached locally.
 - Sensitivity of image data depends on the application context. For many applications using Kingfisher for public images (e.g., social media, news apps), the sensitivity is low. However, if Kingfisher is used in applications dealing with private or sensitive images (e.g., medical imaging, personal photo storage), the sensitivity would be higher.
 - For typical use cases of Kingfisher as a public image caching library, the primary data security concerns are related to availability and integrity of the library and the images, rather than confidentiality of the image content itself. However, ensuring the library is free from vulnerabilities that could compromise the application or user device is a high priority.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- BUSINESS POSTURE:
 - Assumption: The primary business goal for using Kingfisher is to improve application performance and user experience by efficiently handling image loading and caching of publicly accessible images.
 - Question: Are there specific regulatory compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) that need to be considered for applications using Kingfisher, especially if handling user-generated or potentially sensitive images?

- SECURITY POSTURE:
 - Assumption: Applications integrating Kingfisher are responsible for implementing higher-level security controls such as user authentication and authorization for accessing protected images. Kingfisher's role is primarily focused on secure and efficient image handling once the application has access to the image URL.
 - Question: Are there known common vulnerabilities or attack patterns associated with image processing libraries in general or Kingfisher specifically that should be considered during threat modeling?

- DESIGN:
 - Assumption: Kingfisher is designed to be integrated into applications and relies on the security features of the underlying operating system and application environment.
 - Question: Are there any specific configuration options or usage patterns of Kingfisher that could introduce security risks if not properly understood or implemented by developers? For example, are there any insecure default settings or features that should be avoided?
