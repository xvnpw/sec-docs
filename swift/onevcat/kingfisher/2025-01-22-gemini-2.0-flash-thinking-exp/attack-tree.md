## Attack Tree Path: [1.0 Exploit Malicious Image Delivery](./attack_tree_paths/1_0_exploit_malicious_image_delivery.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Attacker delivers images designed to harm the application or user, by compromising image servers or controlling image sources.
*   **Sub-Paths:**
    *   **1.1 Serve Malicious Image from Compromised/Attacker-Controlled Server:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Serving malicious images from servers under attacker control.
        *   **Critical Node: 1.1.1.1 Trigger Code Execution on Client Device:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in image decoding libraries (used by Kingfisher or the OS) via crafted images to execute arbitrary code on the client device.
            *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the application and potentially the user's device.
        *   **High-Risk Path: 1.1.2 Embed Malicious Content within Image (e.g., Stored XSS):**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Embedding malicious scripts within image metadata or pixel data, leading to XSS if the application improperly handles or reflects image URLs or metadata.
            *   **Critical Node: 1.1.2.1 Steal User Credentials/Session Tokens:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Using XSS to steal user session tokens or credentials, leading to account takeover and data breaches.
                *   **Impact:** Account compromise, unauthorized access to user data.
        *   **High-Risk Path: 1.1.3 Serve Large/Resource-Intensive Image:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Serving extremely large or computationally expensive images to cause client-side resource exhaustion and denial of service.
            *   **Impact:** Application unresponsiveness, degraded user experience, potential application crash.

    *   **1.2 Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack (High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Intercepting network traffic between the application and image servers to inject malicious images.
        *   **Critical Node: 1.2.1 Intercept and Replace Image Response with Malicious Image:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Replacing legitimate image responses with malicious images during a MitM attack.
            *   **Impact:** Same as sub-attacks under 1.1 (Code Execution, XSS, DoS) but achieved through network interception.
        *   **Critical Node: 1.2.2 Downgrade HTTPS to HTTP:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Forcing a downgrade from HTTPS to HTTP to facilitate MitM attacks if the application doesn't strictly enforce HTTPS.
            *   **Impact:** Enables MitM attacks, leading to malicious image injection and other network-based attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.0 Exploit Misconfiguration/Misuse of Kingfisher in Application](./attack_tree_paths/4_0_exploit_misconfigurationmisuse_of_kingfisher_in_application.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities arising from insecure configuration or improper usage of Kingfisher within the application.
*   **Sub-Paths:**
    *   **4.1 Insecure Image URL Handling (High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Constructing image URLs based on unsanitized user input, leading to vulnerabilities like Open Redirect or SSRF (in server-side contexts).
        *   **Impact:** Open redirection to malicious sites, potential Server-Side Request Forgery.

    *   **4.2 Inadequate Security Policies (e.g., allowing HTTP when HTTPS is expected) (High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Failing to enforce HTTPS for image loading, allowing insecure HTTP connections.
        *   **Critical Node: 4.2.1 Facilitate MitM attacks (as in 1.2):**
            *   **Attack Vector:**  Inadequate security policies, specifically allowing HTTP, directly enable Man-in-the-Middle attacks.
            *   **Impact:** Enables MitM attacks, leading to malicious image injection and other network-based attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.0 Exploit Kingfisher Library Vulnerabilities (Hypothetical - based on common library vulnerabilities)](./attack_tree_paths/3_0_exploit_kingfisher_library_vulnerabilities__hypothetical_-_based_on_common_library_vulnerabiliti_65b25867.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting potential, yet undiscovered, vulnerabilities within the Kingfisher library itself or its underlying dependencies.
*   **Sub-Paths:**
    *   **3.1 Vulnerability in Image Decoding/Processing Logic (within Kingfisher or underlying libraries):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the code responsible for decoding and processing image formats within Kingfisher or its dependencies.
        *   **Critical Node: 3.1.1.1 Code Execution (if vulnerability is severe):**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Triggering a code execution vulnerability within Kingfisher or its image processing libraries through specially crafted images.
            *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the application and potentially the user's device.
