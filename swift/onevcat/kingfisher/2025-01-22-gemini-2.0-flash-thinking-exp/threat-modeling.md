# Threat Model Analysis for onevcat/kingfisher

## Threat: [Image Spoofing via Non-HTTPS URLs](./threats/image_spoofing_via_non-https_urls.md)

*   **Description:** If the application allows loading images from non-HTTPS URLs, an attacker performing a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack can intercept the image download initiated by Kingfisher and replace the legitimate image with a malicious or misleading one. The attacker controls the network path between the application and the image server.
*   **Impact:** Display of misleading, inappropriate, or malicious content to the user. Potential for phishing, social engineering, or reputational damage to the application.
*   **Kingfisher Component Affected:** Downloader module, specifically the `retrieveImage` function when handling non-HTTPS URLs.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strictly enforce HTTPS for all image URLs used with Kingfisher.** Configure the application to only load images from HTTPS sources.
    *   Implement certificate pinning for critical image servers to further mitigate MITM risks if dealing with highly sensitive content.
    *   Regularly audit application code to ensure no accidental or intentional use of HTTP URLs for image loading.

## Threat: [Kingfisher Code Vulnerabilities](./threats/kingfisher_code_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** The Kingfisher library itself might contain undiscovered security vulnerabilities in its code. Attackers could potentially exploit these vulnerabilities if found. Vulnerabilities could be present in any module or function within the Kingfisher library.
*   **Impact:** Impact depends on the nature of the vulnerability. Could range from application crashes to more serious security breaches like remote code execution or data breaches, potentially compromising user data or device security.
*   **Kingfisher Component Affected:** Potentially any module or function within the Kingfisher library.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies, potentially Critical to High if a vulnerability is discovered and exploitable, especially if it allows remote code execution or significant data access.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Kingfisher library updated to the latest stable version.** Regularly check for and apply updates to benefit from security patches.
    *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases related to Kingfisher and its dependencies.
    *   Incorporate static and dynamic code analysis tools into the development process to identify potential vulnerabilities in application code and Kingfisher usage.
    *   Follow secure coding practices when using Kingfisher and integrating it into the application to minimize the attack surface and potential for exploitation of vulnerabilities.
