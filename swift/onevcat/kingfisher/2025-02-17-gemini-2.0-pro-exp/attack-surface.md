# Attack Surface Analysis for onevcat/kingfisher

## Attack Surface: [1. Remote Image Source Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/1__remote_image_source_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers control the URLs passed to Kingfisher, leading to malicious image downloads.
*   **Kingfisher Contribution:** Kingfisher is the component that fetches and displays images from the provided URLs, making it the direct target of this manipulation.  It *executes* the request based on the attacker-controlled input.
*   **Example:** An attacker injects a URL pointing to a crafted image designed to exploit a vulnerability in the system's image decoding library (e.g., a buffer overflow, even if that library isn't *part* of Kingfisher). Or, the URL points to a massive image to cause a DoS.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) if a vulnerability in image processing (even external to Kingfisher) is exploited.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) due to resource exhaustion (Kingfisher downloads the large file).
    *   Information Disclosure (e.g., through SSRF, though this is more indirect).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if RCE is possible) or High (for DoS and information disclosure).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict URL Whitelisting:** Only allow image loading from a predefined list of trusted domains. Reject any URL not on the whitelist. This is the *most important* mitigation.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize any user input or data from external sources that contribute to the image URL.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to restrict the domains from which images can be loaded. This is crucial defense-in-depth.
    *   **Download Size and Timeout Limits:** Configure Kingfisher's `maxContentLength` and `downloadTimeout` to prevent excessive resource consumption. This directly mitigates the DoS aspect.
    *   **Server-Side URL Validation (if applicable):** If URLs are generated server-side, ensure that process is secure against SSRF and other injection attacks.

## Attack Surface: [2. Cache Poisoning](./attack_surfaces/2__cache_poisoning.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers modify Kingfisher's image cache to replace legitimate images with malicious ones.
*   **Kingfisher Contribution:** Kingfisher's caching mechanism is the direct target. If the cache is compromised, Kingfisher *will serve the malicious image*.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the device's file system (e.g., through a *separate* vulnerability) and replaces a cached image file with a malicious one. Subsequent requests for that image will be served by Kingfisher from the poisoned cache.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Display of malicious or inappropriate content.
    *   Potential for exploiting vulnerabilities in downstream image processing if the application further processes cached images (even if that processing is outside of Kingfisher).
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Cache Storage:** Rely on the operating system's security mechanisms to protect the cache directory. This is a platform-level concern, but Kingfisher's *use* of the cache is the direct vulnerability.
    *   **Strong Cache Keys:** Kingfisher uses the URL as the default cache key. Therefore, robust URL validation (as described in #1) is *absolutely essential* to prevent predictable cache keys, and thus, is a direct Kingfisher-related mitigation.
    *   **Cache Expiration:** Use appropriate cache expiration policies (e.g., `diskCache.expiration`) to limit the lifetime of cached images, reducing the window of opportunity. This is a direct Kingfisher configuration setting.
    *   **Cache Integrity Checks (Advanced):** Consider checksums (more complex, but directly related to how Kingfisher *could* be modified to be more secure).

## Attack Surface: [3. Malicious Image Processor Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/3__malicious_image_processor_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** If a custom `ImageProcessor` is used, vulnerabilities within that processor could be exploited by a crafted image.
*   **Kingfisher Contribution:** Kingfisher provides the framework for applying image processors and *calls* the custom processor. The vulnerability is in the *custom* code, but Kingfisher is the *mechanism* that delivers the malicious input to that code.
*   **Example:** A custom `ImageProcessor` uses a vulnerable third-party library. An attacker provides an image to trigger a buffer overflow in that library *through* Kingfisher's processing pipeline.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE) if the vulnerability in the custom processor allows it.
    *   Application crashes or instability.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical if RCE is possible).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Thorough Code Audit:** Rigorously audit any custom `ImageProcessor` implementations. This is crucial because Kingfisher *directly uses* this code.
    *   **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding practices when developing custom processors.
    *   **Dependency Management:** Keep any third-party libraries used by the custom processor up-to-date (relevant because Kingfisher uses the processor).
    *   **Input Validation (within Processor):** Even within the custom processor, validate the image data before processing. This is a direct mitigation for code *called by* Kingfisher.
