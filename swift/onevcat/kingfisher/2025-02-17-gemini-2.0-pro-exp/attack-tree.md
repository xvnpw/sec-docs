# Attack Tree Analysis for onevcat/kingfisher

Objective: To gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, manipulate application behavior, or cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in the Kingfisher image loading and caching library.

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Data Exposure/Leakage (via Image Source Manipulation)](./attack_tree_paths/1__data_exposureleakage__via_image_source_manipulation_.md)

*   **1.2.1 Replace Legitimate Image URL with Malicious URL [CRITICAL]**: 
    *   **Description:** The attacker provides a malicious URL instead of a legitimate image URL to the application. This malicious URL could point to a server controlled by the attacker, allowing them to return arbitrary content disguised as an image.
    *   **How it works:** The application, lacking proper input validation, passes the attacker-supplied URL directly to Kingfisher. Kingfisher then fetches the content from the malicious URL. The attacker's server can then return:
        *   A seemingly valid image containing hidden data (steganography).
        *   An image designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the image *display* component (not Kingfisher itself, but the component rendering the image, e.g., a `UIImageView`).
        *   An image that redirects to a phishing site or triggers other malicious actions when displayed.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (If user input directly influences the image URL without proper validation.)
    *   **Impact:** High (Potential for data exfiltration, phishing, or exploitation of image display vulnerabilities.)
    *   **Effort:** Low (Simply providing a malicious URL.)
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice (Basic understanding of URLs.)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (If proper input validation and logging are in place. Malicious URLs can be identified.)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Strict URL Validation and Whitelisting:** *Do not* allow arbitrary URLs. Validate URLs against a strict whitelist of allowed domains and paths. Use a robust URL parsing library.
        *   **Sanitize User Input:** Thoroughly sanitize any user-provided data that contributes to the image URL.
        *   **Proxy/Intermediary:** Fetch images through a trusted proxy that performs validation and sanitization.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Data Exposure/Leakage (via Cache Poisoning)](./attack_tree_paths/2__data_exposureleakage__via_cache_poisoning_.md)

*    **1.1.1 Shared Cache Exploit:**
    *   **Description:** The attacker exploits a shared caching environment (e.g., a CDN or proxy) where Kingfisher's cache is not properly isolated between different users or applications. The attacker replaces a legitimate cached image with a malicious one.
    *   **How it works:**
        *   The attacker identifies a shared cache used by Kingfisher.
        *   The attacker requests a specific image URL with manipulated parameters (or uses other cache poisoning techniques) to cause the cache to store their malicious image under a key that will be used by legitimate users.
        *   Subsequent users requesting the same image (using the same cache key) will receive the attacker's malicious image from the cache.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends heavily on the deployment environment. Lower if proper cache isolation is used.)
    *   **Impact:** High (Exposure of sensitive images or potential for XSS if image display is vulnerable. Can affect multiple users.)
    *   **Effort:** Low (If a shared cache is vulnerable, injecting a malicious image is relatively easy.)
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (Understanding of caching mechanisms and potential injection techniques.)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires monitoring cache contents and network traffic. Might be difficult to distinguish from legitimate cache updates.)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Ensure Proper Cache Isolation:** Use separate cache instances or namespaces for different users/applications. If using a shared CDN, ensure strong tenant isolation.
        *   **Implement Cache Key Validation:** Verify that the cache key corresponds to the expected image URL and parameters. Use Kingfisher's `cacheKey` and `originalCacheKey`.
        *   **Strong Cache Control Headers:** Set appropriate `Cache-Control` and `Expires` headers.
        *   **Subresource Integrity (SRI):** Consider using SRI for the final image display (implemented in the application, not Kingfisher itself).
