**Key Attack Surfaces Introduced by Moya (High and Critical Severity):**

*   **Attack Surface:** Insecure `TargetType` Implementation
    *   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities arising from how the `TargetType` protocol is implemented, particularly in handling sensitive data or constructing requests.
    *   **How Moya Contributes:**  Moya relies on developers to implement the `TargetType` protocol correctly. Incorrect implementation can directly lead to security flaws.
    *   **Example:**
        *   Hardcoding an API key directly within the `headers` or `task` of a `TargetType` case.
        *   Using user-provided input without validation to construct the `path` or `baseURL` in a `TargetType`, allowing path traversal or arbitrary endpoint access.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, unauthorized access to API endpoints, potential for data manipulation or deletion.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid hardcoding sensitive information. Use secure configuration management or environment variables.
        *   Implement robust input validation for any user-provided data used in `TargetType` definitions.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when defining `TargetType` cases, restricting access to only necessary endpoints.
        *   Regularly review and audit `TargetType` implementations for potential security flaws.

*   **Attack Surface:** Misconfigured or Malicious Moya Plugins
    *   **Description:** Security risks introduced by the use of Moya's plugin system, either through misconfiguration of legitimate plugins or the use of malicious ones.
    *   **How Moya Contributes:** Moya's plugin architecture allows for extensive customization of network requests and responses. This flexibility can be exploited if plugins are not handled securely.
    *   **Example:**
        *   A logging plugin inadvertently logging sensitive authentication tokens or API keys in plain text.
        *   A custom plugin with a vulnerability that allows for remote code execution or data exfiltration.
        *   Using a third-party plugin from an untrusted source that contains malicious code.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, potential for remote code execution, compromise of application integrity.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly vet and understand the functionality of any Moya plugins used.
        *   Avoid using plugins from untrusted or unverified sources.
        *   Carefully configure plugins to avoid logging sensitive information.
        *   Regularly update plugins to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement code reviews for custom plugins to identify potential security flaws.

*   **Attack Surface:** Insecure Authentication Handling via Moya
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities related to how authentication is implemented and handled within the context of Moya requests.
    *   **How Moya Contributes:** Moya facilitates the inclusion of authentication credentials in requests (e.g., through headers). Insecure implementation at this stage is a risk.
    *   **Example:**
        *   Storing authentication tokens insecurely (e.g., in UserDefaults without encryption) and then directly using them in Moya request headers.
        *   Implementing a custom authentication plugin that has vulnerabilities in how it retrieves or handles credentials.
        *   Not properly implementing token refresh mechanisms, leading to the use of expired or compromised tokens.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts or protected resources, potential for account takeover.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use secure storage mechanisms (e.g., Keychain on iOS) for sensitive authentication credentials.
        *   Implement robust token refresh mechanisms to minimize the risk of using compromised tokens.
        *   Avoid storing sensitive credentials in memory for longer than necessary.
        *   Carefully review and secure any custom authentication logic implemented within Moya.
