## Attack Tree Path: [1. Bypass Moya's Abstraction Layer / Subvert Moya's `TargetType` Conformance (High Risk)](./attack_tree_paths/1__bypass_moya's_abstraction_layer__subvert_moya's__targettype__conformance__high_risk_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This attack path focuses on manipulating the `TargetType` protocol conformance, which is the core of how Moya defines network requests. By exploiting weaknesses in how the application implements `TargetType`, an attacker can control various aspects of the request, such as the URL, HTTP method, headers, and request body.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2 Exploit Weaknesses in Custom `TargetType` Implementations (High Risk):](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2_exploit_weaknesses_in_custom__targettype__implementations__high_risk_.md)

This focuses on flaws within the developer's implementation of the `TargetType` protocol.

    *   **1.2.2.1 Poorly validated input used to construct `TargetType` properties (Critical):**
        *   **Description:** This is the most critical vulnerability. If user-provided data, URL parameters, or any external input is used to construct parts of the `TargetType` (e.g., the `baseURL`, `path`, `task`, or `headers`) *without* proper validation and sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious values.
        *   **Example:** If the application constructs the URL path using user input without validation, an attacker could inject "`/../../sensitive_data`" to access unauthorized resources.  Or, they could inject parameters into the `task` to manipulate the request body.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

    *   **1.2.2.3 Insecure storage of sensitive data used within `TargetType` (e.g., API keys) (Critical):**
        *   **Description:** If the `TargetType` implementation stores sensitive data like API keys, authentication tokens, or other secrets insecurely (e.g., hardcoded, in plain text, in easily accessible locations), an attacker who gains access to the application's code or memory can extract this information.
        *   **Example:** Hardcoding an API key directly within the `TargetType` enum.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Moya Plugins / Vulnerable Plugin (High Risk)](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_moya_plugins__vulnerable_plugin__high_risk_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** Moya plugins can intercept and modify requests and responses. A vulnerable or malicious plugin can introduce security risks.

    *   **2.2.2 Plugin has dependencies with known vulnerabilities (Critical):**
        *   **Description:** Even if the plugin's code itself is secure, it might rely on other libraries (dependencies) that have known security vulnerabilities. An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the plugin and, consequently, the application's network communication. This is a classic supply chain attack.
        *   **Example:** A plugin uses an outdated version of a networking library with a known remote code execution vulnerability.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Moya's Error Handling / Information Leakage](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_moya's_error_handling__information_leakage.md)

*    **3.1.2 Custom error handling in the application exposes internal implementation details (Critical):**
    *    **Description:** While not a direct Moya vulnerability, poor error handling *around* Moya calls can leak sensitive information. If the application displays detailed error messages to the user (e.g., stack traces, internal API paths, database error messages), an attacker can use this information to learn about the application's internal structure and potentially identify further vulnerabilities.
    *    **Example:** An unhandled Moya error results in a detailed stack trace being displayed to the user, revealing internal file paths and class names.
    *    **Likelihood:** Medium
    *    **Impact:** Medium
    *    **Effort:** Low
    *    **Skill Level:** Beginner
    *    **Detection Difficulty:** Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Exploit Moya's Stubbing Capabilities / Production Code Accidentally Uses Stubs (High Risk)](./attack_tree_paths/5__exploit_moya's_stubbing_capabilities__production_code_accidentally_uses_stubs__high_risk_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** Moya's stubbing feature is designed for testing, allowing developers to simulate network responses. If stubbing code is accidentally included in a production build, it creates a major security vulnerability.

    *   **5.1.1 Incorrect build configuration includes stubbing code (Critical):**
        *   **Description:** A misconfigured build process might inadvertently include stubbing code in the release version of the application. This means the application will use the predefined stub responses instead of making actual network requests.
        *   **Example:** A developer forgets to remove a `#define` that enables stubbing before building the release version.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Very Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Beginner
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy

    *   **5.1.2 Failure to disable stubbing in production environment (Critical):**
        *   **Description:** Even if the build configuration is correct, there might be a programmatic error that fails to disable stubbing when the application is running in a production environment.
        *   **Example:** A conditional check to enable stubbing based on the environment is flawed.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Very Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Beginner
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
