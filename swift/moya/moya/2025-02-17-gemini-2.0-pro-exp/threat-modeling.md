# Threat Model Analysis for moya/moya

## Threat: [Request Tampering via Malicious Moya Plugin](./threats/request_tampering_via_malicious_moya_plugin.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker introduces a malicious Moya plugin (compromised third-party or developer-tricked installation) that intercepts and modifies outgoing requests. The plugin alters headers, parameters, or the request body before sending to the server. This can inject malicious data, bypass security, or manipulate server behavior.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Injection of malicious data into the request.
    *   Bypassing of client-side security checks.
    *   Modification of request parameters to unauthorized values.
    *   Potential exploitation of server-side vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
    *   Data corruption or unauthorized modification.
*   **Affected Moya Component:** `PluginType` protocol and any implementations. Specifically, `prepare(_:target:)`, `willSend(_:target:)`, and `didReceive(_:target:)` methods.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Plugin Vetting:** Thoroughly vet all third-party Moya plugins. Examine source code, developer reputation, and security advisories.
    *   **Source Code Review:** Conduct detailed source code reviews of custom Moya plugins, focusing on request modification.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Design plugins with least privilege, granting minimal access to request/response data.
    *   **Input Validation (within Plugin):** Validate any data added or modified in the request within the plugin itself.
    *   **Code Signing:** If possible, use code signing to verify plugin integrity.
    *   **Limit Plugin Usage:** Minimize the number of plugins used.

## Threat: [Response Spoofing via Malicious Moya Plugin](./threats/response_spoofing_via_malicious_moya_plugin.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious plugin intercepts and modifies the server's *response* before the application processes it. The plugin could fabricate a fake response or alter parts of the real response, tricking the application into displaying incorrect data, making wrong decisions, or executing malicious code (if the response renders UI or executes scripts).
*   **Impact:**
    *   Display of false or misleading information.
    *   Incorrect application behavior based on fabricated data.
    *   Potential client-side vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS if the response renders HTML).
    *   Bypassing security checks relying on the server's response.
*   **Affected Moya Component:** `PluginType` protocol and any implementations. Specifically, `process(_:target:)` and `didReceive(_:target:)` methods.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** (Same as for "Request Tampering via Malicious Moya Plugin")
    *   **Plugin Vetting:** Thoroughly vet all third-party Moya plugins.
    *   **Source Code Review:** Review custom Moya plugin code.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Design plugins with least privilege.
    *   **Input Validation (within Plugin):** Validate data within the plugin.
    *   **Code Signing:** Use code signing if possible.
    *   **Limit Plugin Usage:** Minimize the number of plugins.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Plugin Logging](./threats/information_disclosure_via_plugin_logging.md)

*   **Description:** A poorly written Moya plugin (third-party or custom) logs sensitive information from requests or responses, including API keys, tokens, PII, or confidential data. Logs might be stored insecurely, exposed to unauthorized users, or sent to a third-party service without proper security.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exposure of sensitive data.
    *   Potential identity theft, financial fraud, or other malicious activities.
    *   Violation of privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
*   **Affected Moya Component:** `PluginType` protocol and implementations. Specifically, methods with access to `Request` or `Response` objects (e.g., `prepare(_:target:)`, `willSend(_:target:)`, `didReceive(_:target:)`, `process(_:target:)`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Review Plugin Logging:** Carefully review the logging behavior of all Moya plugins.
    *   **Disable/Redact Sensitive Data:** Disable logging of sensitive data or implement redaction.
    *   **Secure Log Storage:** Store logs securely with encryption and access controls.
    *   **Limit Log Retention:** Implement a log retention policy.
    *   **Avoid Third-Party Logging (for Sensitive Data):** Avoid sending sensitive data to third-party services without security measures.
    *   **Use Logging Levels:** Configure logging levels appropriately (debug/verbose only during development).
