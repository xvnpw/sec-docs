# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Moya Error Handling Information Leakage

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the potential for information leakage vulnerabilities arising from improper error handling *around* Moya API calls within the target application.  We aim to identify specific scenarios where sensitive information about the application's internal structure, dependencies, or data could be exposed to an attacker due to mishandled Moya errors or overly verbose error messages presented to the user.  This analysis will inform mitigation strategies to prevent such leaks.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the following attack tree path:

**3. Exploit Moya's Error Handling / Information Leakage**
    *   **3.1.2 Custom error handling in the application exposes internal implementation details (Critical)**

The scope includes:

*   **Moya Integration Points:**  All points within the application's codebase where Moya is used to make network requests.  This includes all defined `TargetType` enums, `MoyaProvider` instances, and calls to `request()`.
*   **Error Handling Logic:**  The code responsible for handling errors returned by Moya, including `catch` blocks, custom error types, and error reporting mechanisms.  This includes both synchronous and asynchronous error handling.
*   **User Interface (UI) Components:**  Any UI elements that display error messages to the user, including alerts, error pages, and in-app notifications.
*   **Logging Mechanisms:** How errors related to Moya calls are logged, and whether those logs might contain sensitive information.  We are primarily concerned with logs *accessible to the attacker*, such as those displayed in the browser console or returned in API responses.

The scope *excludes*:

*   Direct vulnerabilities *within* the Moya library itself (assuming the library is up-to-date).  We are focusing on misuse or improper handling of Moya's features.
*   Network-level attacks (e.g., Man-in-the-Middle) that are not directly related to Moya's error handling.
*   Vulnerabilities unrelated to network requests or API interactions.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will employ a combination of the following techniques:

1.  **Code Review (Static Analysis):**
    *   **Manual Inspection:**  A thorough manual review of the codebase, focusing on the areas identified in the Scope section.  We will use tools like grep, ripgrep, or IDE search features to locate relevant code sections.
    *   **Automated Static Analysis (SAST):**  Employ SAST tools (e.g., SonarQube, Semgrep, SwiftLint with custom rules) to identify potential error handling issues, such as:
        *   Uncaught exceptions.
        *   Overly broad `catch` blocks (e.g., `catch { ... }` without specifying the error type).
        *   Direct exposure of error messages to the user.
        *   Use of `print()` or similar functions to display error details in production builds.
        *   Custom error types that inadvertently expose sensitive information.

2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Testing):**
    *   **Fuzzing:**  Intentionally provide invalid or unexpected input to API endpoints (through Moya) to trigger error conditions and observe the application's response.  This will help identify cases where error handling is insufficient or reveals too much information.
    *   **Manual Penetration Testing:**  Simulate attacker actions by attempting to trigger various error scenarios and examining the resulting error messages, UI behavior, and network responses.  This includes:
        *   Providing invalid authentication tokens.
        *   Sending requests with malformed data.
        *   Triggering rate limiting or other server-side errors.
        *   Simulating network connectivity issues.
    *   **Debugging:**  Use a debugger (e.g., Xcode's debugger) to step through the code execution path when errors occur, examining the values of variables and the flow of control.  This will help pinpoint the exact location where sensitive information might be leaked.

3.  **Threat Modeling:**  Consider various attacker scenarios and how they might exploit information leakage vulnerabilities to gain further access or compromise the application.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 3.1.2

**3.1.2 Custom error handling in the application exposes internal implementation details (Critical)**

This section delves into the specifics of the identified attack vector.

**4.1. Detailed Explanation:**

Moya, while providing robust error handling mechanisms (e.g., `MoyaError`), relies on the *application* to correctly handle these errors and present appropriate, non-sensitive information to the user.  The vulnerability arises when the application's custom error handling logic fails to sanitize or abstract error details before displaying them to the user or including them in logs accessible to the attacker.

**4.2. Potential Vulnerable Code Patterns:**

Several common coding patterns can lead to this vulnerability:

*   **Directly Displaying `MoyaError`:**
    ```swift
    provider.request(.myTarget) { result in
        switch result {
        case .success(let response):
            // ... handle success ...
        case .failure(let error):
            // VULNERABLE: Directly displaying the MoyaError
            self.showAlert(message: error.localizedDescription)
        }
    }
    ```
    `MoyaError` can contain details about the underlying network request, response status code, and potentially even response body (if the error is related to parsing).  `localizedDescription` might be too verbose for end-users.

*   **Unwrapping `response` without Checking:**
    ```swift
    provider.request(.myTarget) { result in
        switch result {
        case .success(let response):
            // ... handle success ...
        case .failure(let error):
            if let response = error.response {
                // VULNERABLE: Directly using response.data without checking status code
                let errorData = String(data: response.data, encoding: .utf8)
                self.showAlert(message: "Error: \(errorData ?? "")")
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    The server might return sensitive information in the response body even for error status codes.  Directly displaying this data is a major vulnerability.

*   **Generic `catch` Blocks:**
    ```swift
    provider.request(.myTarget) { result in
        do {
            let response = try result.get()
            // ... handle success ...
        } catch {
            // VULNERABLE: Catching all errors and displaying a generic message
            //  that might still leak information (e.g., "Network error").
            //  Even worse: displaying the error itself.
            self.showAlert(message: "An error occurred: \(error)")
        }
    }
    ```
    A generic `catch` block might not differentiate between different types of errors, leading to inconsistent and potentially revealing error messages.  It's crucial to catch specific error types and handle them appropriately.

*   **Custom Error Types with Sensitive Data:**
    ```swift
    enum MyCustomError: Error {
        case apiError(message: String, statusCode: Int, responseBody: String)
    }

    // ... later, in error handling ...
    case .apiError(let message, let statusCode, let responseBody):
        // VULNERABLE: Exposing the response body in the error message
        self.showAlert(message: "API Error: \(message), Status: \(statusCode), Body: \(responseBody)")
    ```
    Carelessly designed custom error types can inadvertently include sensitive information that should not be exposed.

*   **Leaking Information in Logs:**
    ```swift
    provider.request(.myTarget) { result in
        switch result {
        case .success(let response):
            // ... handle success ...
        case .failure(let error):
            // VULNERABLE: Logging the entire error object, potentially including
            // sensitive information in the response.
            print("Moya request failed: \(error)") // Or a logging framework
        }
    }
    ```
    Even if the error message displayed to the user is sanitized, logging the full error object (especially in development or debugging builds) can create a vulnerability if those logs are accessible to an attacker (e.g., through a separate vulnerability or misconfiguration).

**4.3. Example Scenario (Detailed):**

1.  **Attacker Action:** An attacker attempts to access a protected resource in the application without proper authentication. They send a request to an API endpoint that requires a valid JWT token.
2.  **Moya Request:** The application uses Moya to make the API request.
3.  **Server Response:** The server responds with a 401 Unauthorized status code and a JSON response body that includes a detailed error message: `{"error": "Invalid JWT token", "details": "Token expired", "internal_code": "AUTH_123"}`.
4.  **Moya Error:** Moya wraps the server's response in a `MoyaError.statusCode` error.
5.  **Vulnerable Error Handling:** The application's error handling code does the following:
    ```swift
    case .failure(let error):
        if let response = error.response {
            if let json = try? JSONSerialization.jsonObject(with: response.data, options: []) as? [String: Any],
               let errorMessage = json["error"] as? String {
                self.showAlert(message: "API Error: \(errorMessage)") // Displays "Invalid JWT token"
            }
        }
    ```
6.  **Information Leakage:** The application displays "API Error: Invalid JWT token" to the attacker. While seemingly innocuous, this confirms that the application *uses* JWT tokens for authentication.  The attacker now knows the authentication mechanism.  If the `internal_code` or `details` fields were also displayed, it would provide even more information.
7.  **Attacker Exploitation:** The attacker can now focus their efforts on JWT-specific attacks, such as attempting to guess or brute-force tokens, looking for vulnerabilities in the token generation or validation process, or searching for leaked JWT secrets.

**4.4. Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Generic User-Facing Error Messages:**  Display generic, user-friendly error messages that do not reveal any internal details.  For example, instead of "Invalid JWT token," display "Authentication failed. Please try again."
*   **Specific Error Handling:**  Use `switch` statements or `if let` chains to handle different `MoyaError` types and other potential errors (e.g., decoding errors) separately.
*   **Sanitize Error Data:**  Before displaying or logging any error information, carefully sanitize it to remove any sensitive details.  Create a whitelist of allowed information to display.
*   **Custom Error Types (Carefully Designed):**  If using custom error types, ensure they do not contain sensitive information that could be exposed.  Consider separate internal and external error representations.
*   **Log Levels:**  Use different log levels (e.g., debug, info, warning, error) to control the verbosity of logging.  In production, log only essential information, avoiding sensitive details.
*   **Centralized Error Handling:**  Implement a centralized error handling mechanism to ensure consistent and secure error handling across the application.  This could be a dedicated class or function responsible for processing and displaying/logging errors.
*   **Code Reviews and SAST:**  Regularly conduct code reviews and use SAST tools to identify potential error handling vulnerabilities.
* **Regular expression filtering:** Before displaying error, filter it with regular expression, to remove any sensitive data.

**4.5. Detection Difficulty:** Easy

As stated in the original attack tree, detecting this vulnerability is relatively easy.  It primarily involves observing the application's behavior when errors occur and examining the displayed error messages and network responses.  Automated tools can also help identify potential issues in the codebase.

**4.6. Effort:** Low
**4.7. Skill Level:** Beginner
**4.8. Likelihood:** Medium
**4.9. Impact:** Medium

## 5. Conclusion

Improper error handling around Moya API calls presents a significant risk of information leakage, potentially exposing sensitive details about the application's internal workings.  By employing a combination of code review, dynamic analysis, and threat modeling, developers can identify and mitigate these vulnerabilities, ensuring that error messages and logs do not inadvertently aid attackers.  The mitigation strategies outlined above provide a comprehensive approach to preventing information leakage through Moya error handling.
