## Mitigation Strategy: [Plugin Security Audits](./mitigation_strategies/plugin_security_audits.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Inventory Moya Plugins:** Create a comprehensive list of all Moya plugins used in the application, including both first-party and third-party plugins.
    2.  **Third-Party Plugin Review:** For each third-party Moya plugin, conduct a security review focusing on the plugin's code and its interaction with Moya's request/response lifecycle.
        *   **Source Code Review (if available):** Examine the plugin's source code for potential vulnerabilities or insecure practices within the context of Moya's functionality.
        *   **Reputation and Trustworthiness:** Assess the plugin's developer reputation and community support, favoring plugins from reputable sources within the Moya ecosystem.
    3.  **First-Party Plugin Security Development:** If developing custom Moya plugins:
        *   **Secure Coding Practices:** Adhere to secure coding principles during plugin development, especially concerning how the plugin modifies requests, responses, or handles authentication within Moya.
        *   **Security Testing:** Conduct security testing of custom Moya plugins, focusing on vulnerabilities that could arise from their interaction with Moya's core functionalities.
    4.  **Regular Plugin Re-evaluation:** Periodically re-evaluate the security of all Moya plugins, especially when updating Moya or Alamofire, or when new vulnerabilities are disclosed in the Moya plugin ecosystem.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Plugins (High Severity):** Using compromised or intentionally malicious Moya plugins that could introduce backdoors or steal data through Moya's request/response handling.
    *   **Vulnerable Plugins (Medium to High Severity):** Utilizing Moya plugins with unintentional security vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit within the application's networking layer managed by Moya.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Plugins:** High risk reduction. Reduces the risk of introducing harmful code into the application through Moya plugins.

    *   Formal security audit process specifically for Moya plugins (third-party and first-party).
    *   Automated checks for vulnerabilities in Moya plugins.
    *   Code review and security testing for custom Moya plugins.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Request and Response Mapping](./mitigation_strategies/secure_request_and_response_mapping.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Input Validation Post-Mapping:** After using Moya's `map` functions to transform API responses, implement robust input validation on the mapped data before using it within the application. This validation should be applied to the data *after* Moya's mapping process.
    2.  **Avoid Dynamic Code Execution in Mapping:** Refrain from using dynamic code execution or string interpolation within Moya's `map` functions, especially when dealing with data from API responses, to prevent potential code injection issues within the data transformation process.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Injection Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):** Insecure mapping within Moya could potentially contribute to injection vulnerabilities if mapped data is used in vulnerable contexts later in the application.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues (Medium Severity):** Incorrect or insecure mapping within Moya could lead to data corruption or misinterpretation after Moya processes the response.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Injection Vulnerabilities:** Medium risk reduction. Reduces the potential for injection vulnerabilities arising from Moya's data transformation processes.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues:** Medium risk reduction. Improves data reliability after Moya's processing and reduces errors caused by incorrect data mapping.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic type checking is performed after mapping in some parts of the application.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Standardized and comprehensive input validation for all mapped API responses obtained through Moya.
    *   Security guidelines for data mapping processes within Moya.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Custom Network Adapter Security (If Applicable)](./mitigation_strategies/custom_network_adapter_security__if_applicable_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Justification for Custom Adapter:** Carefully consider the necessity of a custom `NetworkAdapter` in Moya. Using the default Alamofire adapter is generally recommended unless there are specific requirements that necessitate replacement.
    2.  **Secure Implementation:** If a custom adapter is required for Moya, implement it with strong security considerations, ensuring it correctly handles HTTPS, certificate validation, and secure protocols as Alamofire does by default.
    3.  **Thorough Security Testing:** Rigorously test the custom `NetworkAdapter` used with Moya for security vulnerabilities, especially concerning network communication and data handling within Moya's framework.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks (High Severity):** A poorly implemented custom adapter in Moya might fail to properly validate certificates or enforce HTTPS, making the application vulnerable to MITM attacks when using Moya for networking.
    *   **Insecure Network Communication (High Severity):** Weaknesses in a custom Moya adapter's handling of network protocols could lead to insecure communication channels when Moya is used for network requests.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** High risk reduction. Ensures secure communication channels when using Moya and prevents attackers from intercepting or tampering with data.
    *   **Insecure Network Communication:** High risk reduction. Strengthens the network communication layer within Moya and reduces data exposure risks.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   The project currently uses the default Alamofire `NetworkAdapter` with Moya.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   N/A - Custom adapter is not currently implemented. If a custom adapter were to be implemented for Moya in the future, all the described security measures would be crucial.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce HTTPS for All API Requests via Moya Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_https_for_all_api_requests_via_moya_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure `baseURL` with HTTPS in Moya `TargetType`:** In your Moya `TargetType` definitions, ensure that the `baseURL` property always starts with `https://` to enforce HTTPS for all requests managed by Moya.
    2.  **Transport Security Settings (Alamofire Level):** While Moya relies on Alamofire, verify that Alamofire's `Session` (or custom `NetworkAdapter` if used with Moya) is configured to enforce HTTPS and reject insecure connections for all Moya requests.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks (High Severity):** Using HTTP instead of HTTPS with Moya allows attackers to intercept network traffic managed by Moya.
    *   **Data Exposure in Transit (High Severity):** Data transmitted over HTTP via Moya is unencrypted and vulnerable to eavesdropping.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** High risk reduction. Prevents attackers from intercepting and manipulating network traffic handled by Moya.
    *   **Data Exposure in Transit:** High risk reduction. Protects sensitive data transmitted via Moya from eavesdropping.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `baseURL` in `TargetType` definitions is generally configured with `https://`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal policy and guidelines mandating HTTPS for all API requests made through Moya.
    *   Automated checks to verify HTTPS usage in Moya `TargetType` configurations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sensitive Data Handling in Moya Logging and Debugging](./mitigation_strategies/sensitive_data_handling_in_moya_logging_and_debugging.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Data in Moya Requests/Responses:** Clearly define what constitutes sensitive data within the context of API requests and responses handled by Moya (e.g., API keys in headers, personal data in request/response bodies).
    2.  **Redact Sensitive Data in Moya Logs:** Implement mechanisms to automatically redact or mask sensitive data from logs generated by Moya plugins or custom logging interceptors. This includes redacting sensitive headers, body parameters, or response data that might be logged by Moya or its plugins.
    3.  **Conditional Moya Logging:** Configure Moya's logging (if used through plugins or custom mechanisms) to be conditional based on build configurations or environments. Enable verbose Moya logging only in development and disable or reduce it in production to minimize sensitive data exposure in production logs.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Leakage through Moya Logs (Medium to High Severity):** Sensitive data inadvertently included in Moya logs can be exposed to unauthorized individuals.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Verbose Moya logging in production can expose technical details about API interactions, potentially aiding attackers.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Leakage through Moya Logs:** Medium to High risk reduction. Reduces the risk of sensitive data exposure through Moya logs.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Medium risk reduction. Minimizes technical information exposed in Moya production logs.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic logging might be used for debugging purposes, potentially including Moya request/response details.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Standardized logging library with built-in sensitive data redaction capabilities for Moya logs.
    *   Configuration to define sensitive data patterns for automatic redaction in Moya logs.
    *   Policy and guidelines on secure logging practices specifically for Moya usage.
