# Attack Surface Analysis for moya/moya

## Attack Surface: [Insufficient or Misconfigured SSL/TLS Pinning](./attack_surfaces/insufficient_or_misconfigured_ssltls_pinning.md)

- **Description:** The application fails to validate the server's SSL/TLS certificate against a known set of trusted certificates (pins), allowing man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
- **How Moya Contributes:** Moya provides the `ServerTrustManager` and `PinnedCertificatesTrustEvaluator` to implement SSL pinning. Failure to use or correctly configure these directly leads to this vulnerability.
- **Impact:** Confidential data transmitted over the network can be exposed, and attackers could inject malicious data.
- **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Trust Evaluation](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_trust_evaluation.md)

- **Description:** Incorrectly implemented custom trust evaluation logic, bypassing necessary security checks.
- **How Moya Contributes:** Moya allows developers to create custom `TrustEvaluator` implementations. Flawed custom logic directly undermines certificate validation.
- **Impact:**  MITM attacks and data compromise.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical.

## Attack Surface: [Abuse of Moya's Plugin System](./attack_surfaces/abuse_of_moya's_plugin_system.md)

- **Description:** Malicious or poorly written Moya plugins introduce security vulnerabilities.
- **How Moya Contributes:** Moya's architecture allows the use of plugins to intercept and modify requests and responses. Insecure plugins directly introduce risks.
- **Impact:** Data leakage, manipulation of requests, potentially leading to unintended actions or code execution.
- **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.

## Attack Surface: [Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Handlers](./attack_surfaces/incorrect_implementation_of_authentication_handlers.md)

- **Description:** Flawed implementation of authentication mechanisms using Moya's request adaptors and retriers, leading to authentication bypass or credential compromise.
- **How Moya Contributes:** Moya provides tools like request adaptors and retriers for managing authentication. Incorrect use of these features directly creates vulnerabilities.
- **Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical.
