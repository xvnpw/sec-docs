## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Request Manipulation -> Parameter Injection -> Inject Malicious Parameters via Dynamic Endpoint Construction](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_request_manipulation_-_parameter_injection_-_inject_malicious_parameters_via_dynamic_endpoin_fd8a072f.md)

An attacker identifies an API call where the application constructs the endpoint dynamically using user input. They craft malicious input designed to inject unwanted parameters into the constructed URL. Moya then sends this crafted request to the server. If the backend is vulnerable (e.g., susceptible to SQL injection), the injected parameters can cause the server to execute malicious commands or disclose sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Response Handling Vulnerabilities -> Malicious Response Injection (Man-in-the-Middle)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_response_handling_vulnerabilities_-_malicious_response_injection__man-in-the-middle_.md)

An attacker positions themselves in the network path between the application and the API server. The application makes a request using Moya. The attacker intercepts this request and the server's response. Instead of forwarding the legitimate response, the attacker crafts a malicious response and sends it to the application. Because the application lacks proper SSL pinning, it trusts this malicious response, and Moya delivers it for processing, potentially leading to harm.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Response Handling Vulnerabilities -> Exploiting Insecure Data Handling After Response](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_response_handling_vulnerabilities_-_exploiting_insecure_data_handling_after_response.md)

The application makes a legitimate request using Moya and receives a response from the server. However, the server (or an attacker through a MitM) includes malicious content (e.g., JavaScript code) in the response data. The application then processes this data and, without proper sanitization or encoding, renders it in the user interface. This allows the malicious script to execute within the user's browser or application context, potentially stealing sensitive information or performing actions on the user's behalf.
