# Threat Model Analysis for moya/moya

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle Attack due to Insufficient TLS Configuration](./threats/man-in-the-middle_attack_due_to_insufficient_tls_configuration.md)

*   **Threat:** Man-in-the-Middle Attack due to Insufficient TLS Configuration
    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between the application and the API server by exploiting a lack of proper TLS configuration within Moya. This allows them to eavesdrop on or modify data because Moya's `Session` or custom plugins might not be enforcing strong TLS or performing adequate certificate validation.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, data integrity compromise, potential for account takeover or unauthorized actions.
    *   **Affected Moya Component:** `Session` (configuration of `serverTrustManager`), potentially custom plugins interacting with `URLSession`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure proper configuration of `serverTrustManager` within Moya's `Session`.
        *   Avoid disabling TLS certificate validation unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.
        *   Enforce HTTPS for all API communication.
        *   Consider using certificate pinning for critical APIs.

## Threat: [Certificate Pinning Bypass due to Implementation Flaws](./threats/certificate_pinning_bypass_due_to_implementation_flaws.md)

*   **Threat:** Certificate Pinning Bypass due to Implementation Flaws
    *   **Description:** An attacker bypasses the intended certificate pinning mechanism facilitated by Moya. This happens if the pinning logic, often implemented using Moya's features or custom plugins, is flawed (e.g., pinning to an expired certificate, not handling certificate rotation). Bypassing pinning allows man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **Impact:** Allows for man-in-the-middle attacks, leading to confidentiality breach, data integrity compromise, and potential for account takeover or unauthorized actions.
    *   **Affected Moya Component:** Custom plugins implementing certificate pinning, potentially custom `Session` configurations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement certificate pinning correctly, ensuring it handles certificate rotation and uses secure storage for pins.
        *   Thoroughly test the certificate pinning implementation.
        *   Consider using a robust certificate pinning library or framework if implementing it manually.
        *   Regularly update pinned certificates.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Credentials in Logging](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_credentials_in_logging.md)

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Credentials in Logging
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to application logs and finds sensitive credentials (e.g., API keys, authentication tokens) that were inadvertently logged by Moya's built-in logging or custom logging implemented through its plugins or interceptors.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the exposed credentials, allowing the attacker to impersonate legitimate users or services, access protected resources, and potentially perform unauthorized actions.
    *   **Affected Moya Component:** Moya's built-in logging, custom plugins using logging mechanisms, request/response interceptors.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict logging policies, avoiding logging sensitive data.
        *   Sanitize request and response headers and bodies before logging.
        *   Securely store and manage application logs, restricting access to authorized personnel only.
        *   Review logging configurations to ensure they are not overly verbose.

## Threat: [Insecure Data Transformation in Plugins or Interceptors](./threats/insecure_data_transformation_in_plugins_or_interceptors.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Data Transformation in Plugins or Interceptors
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in custom Moya plugins or request/response interceptors that perform data transformations. This could involve manipulating data in transit in a way that leads to unintended application behavior, security flaws, or even remote code execution if deserialization vulnerabilities are present within these Moya components.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, application crashes, potential for remote code execution, privilege escalation, or bypassing security controls.
    *   **Affected Moya Component:** Custom plugins, request/response interceptors.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and test all custom plugins and interceptors for security vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement proper input validation and sanitization within plugins and interceptors.
        *   Follow secure coding practices when developing custom Moya components.
        *   Consider using established and well-vetted libraries for data transformation tasks.

## Threat: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Custom Decoding Logic](./threats/deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_custom_decoding_logic.md)

*   **Threat:** Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Custom Decoding Logic
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious data that, when processed by custom decoding logic within Moya plugins (e.g., when handling API responses), leads to unintended code execution or other harmful outcomes. This directly exploits how Moya's extensibility allows for custom response handling.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, application crashes, denial of service, potential for data exfiltration or manipulation.
    *   **Affected Moya Component:** Custom plugins handling response parsing and decoding.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid implementing custom deserialization logic if possible; rely on well-established and secure libraries.
        *   If custom deserialization is necessary, carefully sanitize and validate all input data before deserialization.
        *   Use secure deserialization techniques and libraries that mitigate common deserialization vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Abuse of Malicious or Poorly Written Custom Plugins](./threats/abuse_of_malicious_or_poorly_written_custom_plugins.md)

*   **Threat:** Abuse of Malicious or Poorly Written Custom Plugins
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities or malicious code intentionally introduced within custom Moya plugins. This directly leverages Moya's plugin architecture to introduce security flaws, backdoors, or expose sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the plugin's functionality and the vulnerability, including data breaches, remote code execution, privilege escalation, and complete system compromise.
    *   **Affected Moya Component:** Custom plugins.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly vet and review the code of all custom plugins before deployment.
        *   Implement code signing and integrity checks for custom plugins.
        *   Restrict the permissions and capabilities of custom plugins.
        *   Regularly audit and update custom plugins.

## Threat: [Targeted Attacks through Dynamic Target Selection Vulnerabilities](./threats/targeted_attacks_through_dynamic_target_selection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Targeted Attacks through Dynamic Target Selection Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** An attacker manipulates the logic used for dynamically selecting API endpoints within the application, specifically exploiting how Moya's `EndpointClosure` or similar mechanisms are used. By exploiting vulnerabilities in this logic, they can redirect network requests to malicious servers under their control.
    *   **Impact:** Sensitive data could be sent to the attacker's server, leading to confidentiality breaches. The attacker's server could also return malicious responses, potentially leading to further exploitation of the application.
    *   **Affected Moya Component:** Logic implementing dynamic target selection, potentially using Moya's `EndpointClosure`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize any input used to determine the target API endpoint.
        *   Implement strict whitelisting of allowed API endpoints.
        *   Avoid relying solely on user input for determining the target endpoint.
        *   Use secure configuration mechanisms for managing API endpoint URLs.
