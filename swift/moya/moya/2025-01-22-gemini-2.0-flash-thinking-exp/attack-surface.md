# Attack Surface Analysis for moya/moya

## Attack Surface: [Target Type Misconfiguration and Injection](./attack_surfaces/target_type_misconfiguration_and_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from improper construction of `TargetType` implementations, especially when dynamically generating API paths, headers, or parameters based on external or user-controlled input.

*   **Moya Contribution:** Moya's design relies on developers defining API endpoints and request details within `TargetType`.  The flexibility of `TargetType` allows for dynamic generation, which, if not handled carefully, opens doors to injection vulnerabilities.

*   **Example:** A `TargetType` constructs an API path by directly concatenating a user-provided `itemId` without proper validation or encoding, allowing path traversal.

*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data, data exfiltration, Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), potential command injection depending on backend implementation.

*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all external or user-provided input used in `TargetType` implementations.
    *   **Parameterized Queries:** Utilize parameterized queries or URLComponents for constructing dynamic paths and parameters to prevent injection.
    *   **Avoid String Concatenation:** Minimize direct string concatenation for path construction. Use safer methods like `URLComponents` or dedicated path building libraries.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Design APIs and `TargetType` implementations with the principle of least privilege in mind.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication Handling Weaknesses](./attack_surfaces/authentication_handling_weaknesses.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities stemming from insecure implementation of authentication mechanisms within the context of Moya, particularly in `TargetType` or request interceptors.

*   **Moya Contribution:** Moya provides hooks for authentication through `Task` and `TargetType`, but the actual secure implementation is the developer's responsibility. Incorrect handling within this framework can introduce significant risks.

*   **Example:** Hardcoding API keys directly within `TargetType` implementations or logging request headers containing sensitive authorization tokens in debug builds, leading to credential exposure.

*   **Impact:** Credential exposure, unauthorized access to APIs and data, account takeover if credentials are compromised.

*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Credential Storage:** Avoid hardcoding credentials. Use secure storage mechanisms like Keychain or environment variables.
    *   **Token Management:** Implement proper token management, including secure storage, refresh mechanisms, and revocation.
    *   **Request Interceptors:** Utilize Moya's plugins or request interceptors to manage authentication headers in a centralized and secure manner.
    *   **HTTPS Only:** Enforce HTTPS for all API communication to protect credentials in transit.
    *   **Logging Controls:**  Avoid logging sensitive information like authorization headers in production environments.

## Attack Surface: [Plugin Vulnerabilities and Misuse](./attack_surfaces/plugin_vulnerabilities_and_misuse.md)

*   **Description:** Security risks introduced by using plugins with Moya, especially custom or third-party plugins that might be malicious, poorly written, or misused in the application.

*   **Moya Contribution:** Moya's plugin system allows for extending its functionality and intercepting requests and responses.  Plugins have significant access and can become a critical attack vector if compromised or misused.

*   **Example:** A malicious or vulnerable third-party plugin intercepts requests and responses to steal authentication tokens or modify data in transit, leading to data breaches or unauthorized actions.

*   **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, credential theft, introduction of new vulnerabilities into the application.

*   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Plugin Security Audits:**  Carefully review and audit all plugins, especially third-party or custom plugins, for security vulnerabilities before using them.
    *   **Trusted Sources:**  Obtain plugins from trusted sources and verify their integrity.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Plugins:**  Configure plugins with the principle of least privilege, granting them only the necessary permissions and access to data.
    *   **Regular Plugin Updates:** Keep plugins updated to patch any known security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Code Reviews for Custom Plugins:** Conduct thorough code reviews for any custom plugins developed in-house.
