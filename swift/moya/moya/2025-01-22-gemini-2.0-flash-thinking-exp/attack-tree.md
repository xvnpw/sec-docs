## Attack Tree Path: [Misconfiguration/Misuse of Moya [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/misconfigurationmisuse_of_moya__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This is a broad category encompassing vulnerabilities arising from developer errors in how they configure and use the Moya library. It's critical because misconfiguration is a common and often easily exploitable weakness in applications.
*   **Potential Impact:**  Wide range of impacts, from data breaches to complete application compromise, depending on the specific misconfiguration.
*   **Mitigation Focus:**  Developer training, secure coding guidelines, code reviews, automated configuration checks.

    *   **1.1. Insecure Endpoint Configuration**
        *   **Attack Vector:**  Incorrectly configured API endpoints within the Moya Provider. This can lead to unintended exposure of sensitive endpoints or redirection of traffic to malicious servers.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Data leaks, unauthorized access to internal functionality, complete control over application communication if redirected to a malicious server.
        *   **Mitigation Focus:**  Strict configuration management, validation of base URLs, environment-specific configurations, removal of debug/internal endpoints in production.

            *   **1.1.1. Hardcoded API Keys/Secrets in Moya Provider [CRITICAL NODE]**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Embedding API keys, authentication tokens, or other secrets directly within the Moya Provider code (e.g., in string literals).
                *   **Potential Impact:**  **Critical.** Complete compromise of API access, allowing attackers to impersonate the application, access sensitive data, and potentially perform actions on behalf of users.
                *   **Mitigation Focus:** **Eliminate hardcoded secrets.** Use secure configuration management (environment variables, secure vaults, keychains) to store and retrieve secrets. Never commit secrets to version control.

    *   **1.2. Insecure Authentication Handling via Moya [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **Attack Vector:**  Implementing weak or insecure authentication mechanisms when using Moya to communicate with APIs. This includes insecure storage of credentials and weak authentication protocols.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts, sensitive data, and application functionality.
        *   **Mitigation Focus:**  Strong authentication protocols (OAuth 2.0, JWT, API Keys with rotation), secure storage of tokens, proper handling of authentication errors.

            *   **1.2.1. Storing API Keys/Tokens Insecurely (e.g., plain text in code) [CRITICAL NODE]**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Storing authentication tokens in insecure locations such as plain text in code, shared preferences, or UserDefaults.
                *   **Potential Impact:** **Critical.** If an attacker gains access to the device or application data (e.g., through malware, device compromise, or backup extraction), they can easily steal the tokens and gain unauthorized access.
                *   **Mitigation Focus:** **Use platform-provided secure storage mechanisms** (Keychain on iOS, Keystore on Android) to store sensitive authentication tokens. Encrypt tokens at rest and in transit.

    *   **1.3. Failure to Implement TLS/SSL Pinning with Moya/Alamofire [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Not implementing TLS/SSL pinning when using Moya (and its underlying Alamofire library). This leaves the application vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.
        *   **Potential Impact:** **Critical.**  Attackers can intercept, decrypt, and modify network traffic between the application and the API server. This allows them to steal sensitive data (including authentication tokens), inject malicious content, and manipulate application behavior.
        *   **Mitigation Focus:** **Implement TLS/SSL pinning immediately.** Pin the server's certificate or public key to ensure the application only trusts legitimate servers. Regularly update pinned certificates.

            *   **1.3.1. Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (MitM) to Intercept/Modify Moya Traffic [CRITICAL NODE]**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting the lack of TLS/SSL pinning to perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack. Attackers can use tools like ARP spoofing, DNS spoofing, or rogue Wi-Fi access points to intercept network traffic.
                *   **Potential Impact:** **Critical.** Complete compromise of data in transit. Attackers can steal credentials, session tokens, personal data, and modify API requests and responses, potentially leading to account takeover, data manipulation, and application subversion.
                *   **Mitigation Focus:** **TLS/SSL Pinning (primary mitigation).**  Educate users about the risks of using untrusted networks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Endpoint Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_endpoint_configuration.md)

*   **Potential Impact:** Data leaks, unauthorized access to internal functionality, complete control over application communication if redirected to a malicious server.
*   **Mitigation Focus:**  Strict configuration management, validation of base URLs, environment-specific configurations, removal of debug/internal endpoints in production.

            *   **1.1.1. Hardcoded API Keys/Secrets in Moya Provider [CRITICAL NODE]**

## Attack Tree Path: [Network-Level Attacks Targeting Moya Communication [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/network-level_attacks_targeting_moya_communication__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Network-level attacks that target the communication channel used by Moya, even if Moya itself is configured correctly (except for TLS/SSL pinning, which is a key mitigation against MitM).
*   **Potential Impact:** Data interception, redirection of traffic to malicious servers, denial of service.
*   **Mitigation Focus:** Network security best practices, TLS/SSL pinning, user awareness of network security risks.

    *   **2.1. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (if TLS/SSL Pinning is not implemented) [CRITICAL NODE]**
