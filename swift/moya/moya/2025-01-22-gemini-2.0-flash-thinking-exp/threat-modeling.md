# Threat Model Analysis for moya/moya

## Threat: [Misconfigured TargetType - Base URL Manipulation](./threats/misconfigured_targettype_-_base_url_manipulation.md)

**Description:** An attacker might exploit a misconfigured `TargetType` where the `baseURL` is unintentionally pointing to a malicious server or a development environment in production. The attacker could then intercept network requests intended for the legitimate API, potentially stealing sensitive data sent in requests or serving malicious responses to the application.
**Impact:** Data breach, Man-in-the-Middle attack, application malfunction due to unexpected responses.
**Moya Component Affected:** `TargetType` protocol implementation, specifically the `baseURL` property.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use environment variables or configuration management to manage `baseURL`.
* Implement strict environment separation (development, staging, production).
* Thoroughly test `TargetType` configurations in different environments.
* Use code reviews to verify `baseURL` settings.

## Threat: [Misconfigured TargetType - Path Traversal](./threats/misconfigured_targettype_-_path_traversal.md)

**Description:** An attacker might exploit a vulnerability if the `path` in `TargetType` is dynamically constructed based on user input without proper sanitization. The attacker could manipulate the input to include path traversal characters (e.g., `../`) to access unauthorized API endpoints or resources on the server.
**Impact:** Unauthorized access to API endpoints, potential data leakage, server-side vulnerabilities exploitation.
**Moya Component Affected:** `TargetType` protocol implementation, specifically the `path` property and its dynamic construction.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid dynamic construction of `path` based on untrusted user input if possible.
* If dynamic path construction is necessary, implement robust input validation and sanitization to prevent path traversal attacks.
* Use parameterized routes on the server-side API to limit path manipulation.

## Threat: [Exposed Credentials in TargetType Headers](./threats/exposed_credentials_in_targettype_headers.md)

**Description:** An attacker who gains access to the application's codebase (e.g., through reverse engineering or code repository breach) could find hardcoded API keys, authentication tokens, or other sensitive credentials within the `headers` property of `TargetType` implementations. These credentials could then be used to access the backend API directly or impersonate legitimate users.
**Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized API access, data breach, privilege escalation.
**Moya Component Affected:** `TargetType` protocol implementation, specifically the `headers` property.
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Never hardcode sensitive credentials in code.
* Use secure storage mechanisms (Keychain, Credential Manager) to store and retrieve credentials.
* Utilize environment variables or configuration files for managing API keys and secrets.
* Implement proper access control and authorization mechanisms on the backend API.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Third-Party Moya Plugin](./threats/vulnerable_third-party_moya_plugin.md)

**Description:** If the application uses third-party Moya plugins, these plugins might contain security vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities (e.g., code injection, insecure data handling) to compromise the application's security, potentially gaining unauthorized access, executing malicious code, or causing denial of service.
**Impact:** Application compromise, code execution, data breach, denial of service.
**Moya Component Affected:** Third-party Moya plugins.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly vet and audit third-party plugins before using them.
* Choose plugins from reputable sources with active maintenance and security updates.
* Regularly update third-party plugins to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Implement security best practices within the application, even when using plugins, such as input validation and output encoding.
