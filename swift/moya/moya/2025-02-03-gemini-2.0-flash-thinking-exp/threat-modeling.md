# Threat Model Analysis for moya/moya

## Threat: [Insecure Configuration of Plugins](./threats/insecure_configuration_of_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities introduced by poorly configured or malicious Moya plugins. By leveraging a compromised plugin, they could potentially intercept or modify network requests and responses handled by Moya, leading to data breaches or unauthorized actions. For example, a logging plugin might unintentionally expose sensitive data from Moya's request/response cycle.
    *   **Impact:** Data leakage from network requests/responses, unauthorized modification of network traffic, potential for bypassing security controls implemented within Moya or the application's networking layer, leading to backend access or data manipulation.
    *   **Moya Component Affected:** Plugins system, specifically custom or third-party plugins integrated with Moya.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strictly vet all plugins:** Thoroughly review the code and functionality of any plugin before integrating it with Moya.
        *   **Use trusted sources:** Only use plugins from reputable and well-maintained sources. Avoid plugins from unknown or untrusted developers.
        *   **Principle of least privilege:** Configure plugins with the minimum necessary permissions and access to Moya's internal components.
        *   **Regular plugin updates:** Keep plugins updated to the latest versions to patch any known security vulnerabilities.
        *   **Secure logging practices:** If using logging plugins, ensure they are configured to avoid logging sensitive data from Moya requests and responses.

## Threat: [Misuse of Stubbing in Production](./threats/misuse_of_stubbing_in_production.md)

*   **Description:** If Moya's stubbing feature, intended for testing, is mistakenly or maliciously enabled in a production environment, attackers can exploit this misconfiguration. By controlling the stubbed responses, they can manipulate the application's behavior, bypass backend logic enforced through Moya requests, and potentially cause data corruption or denial of service.  Moya's `stubClosure` in `TargetType` becomes a point of control.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption due to manipulated responses, incorrect application behavior as real API calls are bypassed, security bypass of backend authorization or validation logic enforced through Moya requests, potential for denial of service by providing invalid or resource-intensive stubbed responses.
    *   **Moya Component Affected:** Stubbing feature, specifically the `stubClosure` property within Moya's `TargetType` protocol.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Production build disabling:** Ensure stubbing is strictly disabled in production builds through build configurations, compiler flags, or environment variables.
        *   **Automated testing:** Implement automated tests to verify that stubbing is not active in production code paths and is correctly disabled.
        *   **Code review:** Conduct thorough code reviews to prevent accidental inclusion of stubbing logic in production code.
        *   **Runtime environment checks:** Implement runtime checks within the application to detect and disable stubbing if it is inadvertently enabled in a production environment.

## Threat: [Parameter Injection through TargetType Configuration](./threats/parameter_injection_through_targettype_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in how `TargetType` is implemented within Moya to inject malicious parameters into API requests. If the `path` or `task` properties of `TargetType` are constructed using unsanitized user input or external data, attackers can manipulate these inputs to alter the intended API endpoint or request parameters. This can lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of backend resources through Moya.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to backend data or functionalities by manipulating API requests, data manipulation on the backend if injection leads to unintended actions, potential for server-side injection vulnerabilities if the backend is susceptible to parameter injection based on the manipulated request from Moya.
    *   **Moya Component Affected:** `TargetType` protocol, specifically the `path` and `task` properties used to define API requests within Moya.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input sanitization and validation:** Sanitize and validate all user inputs or external data before using them to construct `path` or `task` within `TargetType`.
        *   **Parameterized queries on backend:** Utilize parameterized queries or prepared statements on the backend API to prevent injection vulnerabilities, regardless of client-side input.
        *   **Moya's parameter encoding:** Leverage Moya's built-in parameter encoding features instead of manually constructing URLs or request bodies with potentially unsafe string concatenation.
        *   **Backend input validation:** Implement robust input validation on the backend API to further protect against parameter injection attempts, even if client-side validation is bypassed.

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization in Custom Response Mapping](./threats/insecure_deserialization_in_custom_response_mapping.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can exploit insecure deserialization practices within custom response mapping functions used with Moya. If the application uses unsafe deserialization methods (e.g., `NSKeyedUnarchiver` without proper class restrictions in Objective-C/Swift or similar insecure practices in other languages) or fails to validate the structure of API responses before deserialization within Moya's `map` functions, a malicious API response could be crafted to execute arbitrary code on the client application when Moya processes the response.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution (RCE) on the client application, denial of service (DoS) if deserialization leads to crashes or resource exhaustion, data corruption if malicious objects are deserialized and used within the application's state, potential for client-side compromise and data exfiltration.
    *   **Moya Component Affected:** Response mapping functions (`map` functions) and custom response handling logic implemented when using Moya to process API responses.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure deserialization libraries:** Use secure and well-vetted deserialization libraries that offer protection against deserialization vulnerabilities. Avoid using unsafe deserialization methods.
        *   **Response structure validation:** Validate the structure and content of API responses *before* attempting deserialization within Moya's `map` functions. Ensure the response conforms to the expected schema.
        *   **Robust error handling:** Implement robust error handling for deserialization failures within Moya's response mapping. Prevent application crashes and handle errors gracefully.
        *   **Avoid deserializing untrusted data:** Treat API responses as potentially untrusted data. Apply strict validation and sanitization before deserialization, especially if the API endpoint is exposed to external or untrusted sources.
