# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business priorities and goals:
 - Simplify network layer implementation for Swift developers.
 - Provide a type-safe and composable way to define API clients.
 - Reduce boilerplate code associated with network requests.
 - Enhance code maintainability and testability in Swift networking layers.
 - Foster a strong community around the library for continuous improvement and support.
- Most important business risks:
 - Security vulnerabilities in the library could be exploited by malicious actors in applications using Moya, leading to data breaches or other security incidents.
 - Instability or bugs in the library could disrupt applications relying on Moya, impacting user experience and business operations.
 - Lack of community support or slow response to issues could deter developers from adopting or continuing to use Moya.
 - Supply chain attacks targeting the library's dependencies or distribution channels could compromise the integrity of Moya and applications using it.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing security controls:
 - security control: Code review process for contributions (described in GitHub repository contribution guidelines).
 - security control: Dependency management using Swift Package Manager (implicitly used in Swift projects).
 - accepted risk: Open source nature implies public code visibility, potentially revealing vulnerabilities if not carefully reviewed.
- Recommended security controls:
 - security control: Implement automated static analysis security testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential code vulnerabilities.
 - security control: Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
 - security control: Establish a process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities, including a security policy and contact information.
 - security control: Consider signing releases to ensure authenticity and integrity of distributed artifacts.
- Security requirements:
 - Authentication: Not directly applicable to a networking library itself, but Moya is designed to facilitate the implementation of authentication in client applications using it when interacting with backend services. Applications using Moya should implement appropriate authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0, API keys) based on the requirements of the backend services they interact with.
 - Authorization: Similar to authentication, authorization is the responsibility of applications using Moya. Moya should provide mechanisms to easily include authorization tokens or headers in network requests, enabling applications to enforce access control policies defined by backend services.
 - Input validation: While Moya itself doesn't directly handle user input, it's crucial that applications using Moya validate all data received from backend services before processing or displaying it. Moya should not introduce vulnerabilities that bypass input validation in consuming applications.
 - Cryptography: Moya relies on the underlying networking libraries provided by the operating system (e.g., URLSession in iOS, macOS) for secure communication channels like HTTPS. Moya should encourage and facilitate the use of HTTPS for all network requests to protect data in transit. Moya should not implement custom cryptography but rely on well-established and vetted system libraries.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical business processes to protect:

 - Ensuring the security and reliability of the library for developers and applications using it.
 - Preserving the trust and reputation of the Moya project within the Swift developer community.
- Data to protect and sensitivity:
 - Moya source code: High sensitivity - compromise could lead to vulnerabilities in the library and applications using it.
 - Build artifacts (distribution packages): High sensitivity - integrity is crucial to prevent supply chain attacks.
 - Developer credentials and secrets used in the build process: High sensitivity - compromise could allow unauthorized modifications or releases.
 - Community trust and project reputation: High sensitivity - essential for the long-term success and adoption of Moya.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
 - What is the intended audience and use cases for applications using Moya? (Assuming general-purpose Swift applications needing network communication).
 - Are there specific regulatory compliance requirements for applications using Moya? (Assuming general best practices for security and data protection).
 - What is the process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities in Moya? (Assuming standard open-source vulnerability reporting practices should be implemented).
 - Are there any specific security certifications or audits planned for Moya? (Assuming no specific certifications are currently in place, but recommended security controls should be considered).
- Assumptions:
 - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to provide a secure, reliable, and easy-to-use networking library for the Swift community.
 - SECURITY POSTURE: Standard open-source security practices are followed, but there is room for improvement in automated security testing and vulnerability management. Applications using Moya are expected to implement their own application-level security controls.
 - DESIGN: Moya is designed as a modular and extensible library, relying on system-provided security features (e.g., HTTPS via URLSession). Deployment is primarily through dependency managers, and the build process can be enhanced with more robust security checks.
