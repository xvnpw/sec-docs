# Attack Surface Analysis for moya/moya

## Attack Surface: [Hardcoded Sensitive Data in `TargetType` Endpoints](./attack_surfaces/hardcoded_sensitive_data_in__targettype__endpoints.md)

*   **Description:** Developers accidentally embed sensitive information like API keys, tokens, or user IDs directly within the `path` or `baseURL` properties of `TargetType` enum cases.
*   **How Moya Contributes:** `TargetType`'s design encourages defining API endpoints directly in code, making it easy to inadvertently hardcode sensitive data within these definitions.
*   **Example:**
    *   `baseURL = URL(string: "https://api.example.com/v1?apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY")!`
    *   `path = "/users/\(userID)/profile"` where `userID` is a hardcoded user identifier.
*   **Impact:** Credential leakage, unauthorized access to APIs, data breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Environment Variables/Configuration Files:** Store sensitive data like API keys in environment variables or secure configuration files, and load them at runtime.
    *   **Secure Key Management Systems:** Utilize secure key management systems (e.g., Keychain, dedicated secrets management services) to store and retrieve sensitive credentials.
    *   **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews to identify and remove any hardcoded sensitive data.
    *   **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools to scan code for potential hardcoded secrets.

## Attack Surface: [Lack of HTTPS Enforcement due to `TargetType` Misconfiguration](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_https_enforcement_due_to__targettype__misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** Applications fail to consistently use HTTPS for all network communication because `TargetType` definitions are incorrectly configured with `http://` URLs, leaving data vulnerable to interception and manipulation via Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.
*   **How Moya Contributes:** While Moya doesn't enforce HTTPS, developers using it must ensure their `baseURL` and endpoint paths are correctly configured with `https://` within `TargetType`. Oversight in these definitions directly leads to insecure HTTP connections when using Moya.
*   **Example:**
    *   `baseURL = URL(string: "http://api.example.com")!` (using `http` instead of `https` in `TargetType`).
    *   Making requests to endpoints defined with `http://` URLs within `TargetType`.
*   **Impact:** Data interception, data manipulation, session hijacking, credential theft.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always Use HTTPS in `TargetType`:**  Ensure all `baseURL` and endpoint paths in `TargetType` definitions explicitly use `https://`.
    *   **Transport Layer Security (TLS) Configuration:** Configure `URLSession` (underlying Moya) to enforce TLS and reject insecure connections.
    *   **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS):** Implement HSTS on the server-side to instruct browsers and clients to always use HTTPS for the domain.
    *   **Network Security Policies:** Implement network security policies that mandate HTTPS for all application traffic, and verify `TargetType` configurations adhere to this.

## Attack Surface: [Improper Parameter Encoding via `TargetType` Leading to Injection](./attack_surfaces/improper_parameter_encoding_via__targettype__leading_to_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrectly configured parameter encoding in `TargetType`'s `task` property can lead to vulnerabilities like parameter injection, where attackers can manipulate request parameters to inject malicious code or commands. This arises from misuse of Moya's parameter handling features in `TargetType`.
*   **How Moya Contributes:** `TargetType` provides flexibility in defining request parameters and encoding through the `task` property. Misuse or misunderstanding of these options within `TargetType`'s `task` configuration can directly lead to injection vulnerabilities when Moya makes the network request.
*   **Example:**
    *   Using `.requestParameters(parameters: ["search": userInput], encoding: URLEncoding.default)` within `TargetType`'s `task`, without proper sanitization of `userInput` before it's passed to Moya. If `userInput` contains malicious characters, it could be injected into the query string via Moya.
    *   Incorrectly using `.requestBody` without proper encoding within `TargetType`'s `task`, leading to potential command injection if the backend is vulnerable when Moya sends the request.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized actions, server-side command execution (depending on backend vulnerability).
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization Before `TargetType`:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user inputs *before* including them as request parameters in the `TargetType`'s `task` definition.
    *   **Use Secure Encoding Methods in `TargetType`:**  Utilize appropriate encoding methods provided by Moya (e.g., `JSONEncoding`, `URLEncoding`) within `TargetType`'s `task` and understand their security implications.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege in `TargetType`:** Only send necessary parameters via `TargetType`'s `task` and avoid exposing internal parameters to users.
    *   **Backend Security:** Implement robust backend security measures to prevent injection attacks, even if parameters are manipulated through client-side vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Moya Library or its Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_moya_library_or_its_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities might be discovered in the Moya library itself or in its dependencies. Using outdated versions of Moya or its dependencies directly exposes applications to these known vulnerabilities.
*   **How Moya Contributes:** Applications directly depend on the Moya library and its transitive dependencies. Vulnerabilities within Moya's codebase or its dependencies become inherent attack surfaces for applications using Moya.
*   **Example:**
    *   A hypothetical vulnerability discovered in a specific version of Moya that allows for request forgery when using a particular feature of `TargetType`.
    *   A vulnerability in a dependency of Moya (e.g., Alamofire) that could be exploited through Moya's usage patterns and API calls.
*   **Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the nature of the vulnerability, potentially including remote code execution, data breaches, denial of service, all stemming from vulnerabilities within the networking layer provided by Moya.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regularly Update Moya and Dependencies:**  Keep Moya and all its dependencies updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities. This is crucial as Moya is the core networking library.
    *   **Dependency Scanning:**  Use dependency scanning tools to continuously monitor for known vulnerabilities in project dependencies, including Moya and its transitive dependencies.
    *   **Security Advisories:**  Subscribe to security advisories specifically for Moya and its ecosystem to be promptly informed of any newly discovered vulnerabilities.
    *   **Vulnerability Management Process:**  Establish a rapid process for addressing and patching any identified vulnerabilities in Moya or its dependencies to minimize the window of exposure.
