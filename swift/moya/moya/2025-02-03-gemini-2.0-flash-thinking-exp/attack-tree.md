## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Misconfiguration/Misuse of Moya [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__misconfigurationmisuse_of_moya__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting developer errors in how Moya is configured and used within the application. This is a broad category encompassing various specific misconfigurations.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   Developers may lack sufficient security training on Moya best practices.
    *   Code reviews may not adequately focus on security aspects of Moya integration.
    *   Time pressure or lack of awareness can lead to insecure configurations being deployed.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Insecure Endpoint Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__insecure_endpoint_configuration.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Targeting vulnerabilities arising from improperly configured API endpoints within the Moya Provider.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Hardcoded API Keys/Secrets in Moya Provider [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Direct extraction of API keys or secrets embedded in the application code (e.g., by reverse engineering, code leaks, or insider threats).
        *   **Impact:** Full compromise of API access, potential data breaches, unauthorized actions on behalf of the application.
        *   **Mitigation:** Never hardcode secrets. Use secure configuration management (environment variables, secure vaults, keychains).
    *   **Incorrect Base URL Configuration (pointing to malicious server):**
        *   **Attack Vector:**  Tricking the application into sending requests to an attacker-controlled server by manipulating the base URL configuration. This could be accidental (developer error) or malicious (configuration injection).
        *   **Impact:**  Data exfiltration to attacker server, manipulation of application behavior by attacker-controlled responses, potential for further attacks from the malicious server.
        *   **Mitigation:** Robust configuration management, validation of base URLs, different configurations for environments, compile-time or runtime checks.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Insecure Authentication Handling via Moya [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__insecure_authentication_handling_via_moya__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting weaknesses in how the application implements authentication when using Moya for API communication.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Storing API Keys/Tokens Insecurely (e.g., plain text in code) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:**  Retrieval of authentication tokens stored in insecure locations (e.g., plain text in code, shared preferences, UserDefaults) by malware, device compromise, or unauthorized access.
        *   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to user data and application functionality, impersonation of legitimate users.
        *   **Mitigation:** Use platform-provided secure storage (Keychain, Keystore), encrypt tokens at rest and in transit, minimize token lifespan.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Failure to Implement TLS/SSL Pinning with Moya/Alamofire [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path___critical_node__failure_to_implement_tlsssl_pinning_with_moyaalamofire__critical_no_ca567d09.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Exploiting the absence of TLS/SSL pinning to perform Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (MitM) to Intercept/Modify Moya Traffic [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Interception of network traffic between the application and the API server by an attacker positioned in the network path (e.g., on public Wi-Fi, compromised network infrastructure). Without pinning, the application may trust a fraudulent certificate presented by the attacker.
        *   **Impact:**  Data interception (including sensitive user data, API keys, authentication tokens), modification of requests and responses (leading to data manipulation, application malfunction, or injection of malicious content), session hijacking.
        *   **Mitigation:** **Implement TLS/SSL pinning** using Alamofire's capabilities within Moya. Pin server certificates or public keys. Regularly update pinned certificates.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (if TLS/SSL Pinning is not implemented - see above) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path___critical_node__man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks__if_tlsssl_pinning_is_not_implemen_6ac074cc.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  This is a reiteration of the MitM attack vector, emphasizing its critical nature and direct link to the failure to implement TLS/SSL pinning. It highlights that even if other security measures are in place, the lack of pinning creates a significant vulnerability.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Network-level interception as described in point 4.
    *   **Impact:** Same as point 4 - Data interception, modification, session hijacking.
    *   **Mitigation:** **Implement TLS/SSL pinning** (primary mitigation). Educate users about risks of untrusted networks.
