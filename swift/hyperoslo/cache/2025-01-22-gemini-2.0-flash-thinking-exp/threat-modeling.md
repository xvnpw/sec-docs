# Threat Model Analysis for hyperoslo/cache

## Threat: [Cache Poisoning](./threats/cache_poisoning.md)

*   **Threat:** Cache Poisoning
*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious or incorrect data into the cache, leveraging vulnerabilities in the application's data handling *before* it reaches `hyperoslo/cache` for storage via `cache.set()` or `cache.wrap()`.  While `hyperoslo/cache` itself doesn't introduce the injection vulnerability, it becomes the vector for distributing the poisoned data to users.  For example, if the application doesn't properly validate data before calling `cache.set()`, an attacker could manipulate input to store malicious content in the cache.
*   **Impact:** Serving incorrect or malicious content to users directly from the cache, application malfunction due to corrupted cached data, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if poisoned data is rendered by the application after retrieval from the cache, leading to potential account compromise or further attacks.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   `cache.set()` function: Used to directly store data in the cache, vulnerable if input data is not validated beforehand.
    *   `cache.wrap()` function:  If the function wrapped by `cache.wrap()` returns malicious data due to upstream vulnerabilities, this data will be stored in the cache.
    *   Underlying Cache Storage: Persistently stores the poisoned data, making the poisoning persistent until cache invalidation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation before Caching:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all data *before* it is passed to `cache.set()` or returned by the function wrapped in `cache.wrap()`. Ensure data conforms to expected formats and does not contain malicious payloads.
    *   **Secure Data Sources:** Secure all upstream data sources that feed data into the cache. Prevent manipulation of data at its origin to avoid caching compromised information.
    *   **Cache Invalidation:** Implement robust cache invalidation mechanisms to quickly remove poisoned entries. Utilize time-based invalidation, event-based invalidation triggered by data changes, or manual invalidation options.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong Content Security Policy to mitigate the impact of potential XSS vulnerabilities if poisoned data is inadvertently rendered by the application after being retrieved from the cache.

## Threat: [Cache Data Leakage / Information Disclosure](./threats/cache_data_leakage__information_disclosure.md)

*   **Threat:** Cache Data Leakage / Information Disclosure
*   **Description:** Sensitive data stored within the cache managed by `hyperoslo/cache` is unintentionally exposed to unauthorized parties. This can occur due to insecure configuration of the underlying cache storage mechanism chosen for `hyperoslo/cache`, or if the application inadvertently logs or exposes the contents of the cache. For example, if using disk-based caching and file permissions are misconfigured, an attacker gaining filesystem access could read cached sensitive data.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive user data (Personally Identifiable Information - PII, credentials, financial information) stored in the cache, violation of privacy regulations and compliance requirements, reputational damage, potential for identity theft, fraud, or other malicious activities stemming from the leaked sensitive information.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   Underlying Cache Storage configured for `hyperoslo/cache`: The chosen storage mechanism (e.g., memory, disk, Redis) and its security configuration directly impact data leakage risk.
    *   Logging mechanisms used in conjunction with `hyperoslo/cache`: If logging inadvertently captures cache keys or values containing sensitive data, it can lead to information disclosure.
    *   Application code interacting with `hyperoslo/cache`:  If application code improperly handles or exposes cached data after retrieval using `cache.get()` or `cache.wrap()`, it can lead to leakage.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Cache Storage Backend:** Carefully select and securely configure the storage backend used by `hyperoslo/cache`. For disk-based storage, enforce strict file system permissions. Consider in-memory caching for highly sensitive data if persistence is not required and memory management is carefully considered.
    *   **Encryption at Rest:** Encrypt sensitive data *before* storing it in the cache, especially if using persistent storage. This protects data even if the storage medium is compromised.
    *   **Minimize Sensitive Data Caching:**  Avoid caching sensitive data whenever possible. If caching is absolutely necessary, only cache the minimum required data and explore anonymization or pseudonymization techniques to reduce the sensitivity of cached information.
    *   **Secure Logging Practices:**  Thoroughly review and configure logging to ensure that sensitive data is never logged in cache keys or values. Implement secure logging practices to prevent unintentional data leakage through logs.
    *   **Access Controls:** Implement strict access controls to the cache storage and any related management interfaces, limiting access to only authorized users and processes.
