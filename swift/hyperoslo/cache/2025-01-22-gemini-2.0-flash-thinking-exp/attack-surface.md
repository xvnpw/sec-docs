# Attack Surface Analysis for hyperoslo/cache

## Attack Surface: [Cache Poisoning](./attack_surfaces/cache_poisoning.md)

*   **Description:** Injecting malicious or incorrect data directly into the cache, causing subsequent users to receive the poisoned content. This bypasses normal application logic and directly manipulates the cached data.
*   **Cache Contribution:** The cache is the direct target and vector. Successful poisoning means the cache will persistently serve malicious content until invalidation.
*   **Example:** An attacker identifies a way to directly write to the cache storage (e.g., exploiting a vulnerability in a custom cache adapter or through misconfigured access controls). They inject a malicious HTML page into the cache associated with a popular URL. Users requesting that URL will now be served the malicious page directly from the cache.
*   **Impact:**  XSS execution, data corruption, defacement, redirection to malicious sites, account compromise, serving malware.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Cache Storage Access:** Implement strict access controls and authentication for any process that can write to the cache storage.
    *   **Input Validation on Cache Population:** Even if data is intended for the cache, validate and sanitize it before storing it to prevent injection if the population process itself is compromised.
    *   **Integrity Checks:** Implement integrity checks (e.g., checksums, signatures) on cached data to detect and reject poisoned entries.
    *   **Immutable Cache Storage (where feasible):** Consider using immutable storage mechanisms for the cache where data, once written, cannot be modified, reducing the risk of post-write poisoning.

## Attack Surface: [Cache Exhaustion/Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_surfaces/cache_exhaustiondenial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Description:**  Directly overwhelming the cache with requests designed to fill its storage capacity with low-value or attacker-controlled data, evicting legitimate, frequently used data and degrading performance or causing service outage.
*   **Cache Contribution:** The cache itself is the target of the DoS attack. The attack aims to reduce the cache's effectiveness and potentially overload backend systems due to increased cache misses.
*   **Example:** An attacker floods the application with requests containing unique, attacker-controlled cache keys. These requests are designed to be cached, rapidly filling the cache storage and forcing the eviction of legitimate, frequently accessed data. This leads to increased latency for legitimate users and potential backend overload.
*   **Impact:** Performance degradation, increased latency, backend overload, denial of service for legitimate users, reduced application availability.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Cache Size Limits and Eviction Policies:**  Carefully configure cache size limits and use appropriate eviction policies (e.g., LRU) to manage cache capacity effectively.
    *   **Rate Limiting on Cacheable Requests:** Implement rate limiting specifically for requests that are likely to be cached to prevent rapid cache filling from a single source.
    *   **Request Filtering and Throttling:** Filter or throttle requests based on patterns indicative of cache exhaustion attacks (e.g., high volume of unique cache keys from a single IP).
    *   **Cache Admission Control:** Implement mechanisms to control what data is admitted into the cache, preventing low-value or attacker-generated data from dominating the cache.

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure through Cache Storage (Insecure Storage)](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_through_cache_storage__insecure_storage_.md)

*   **Description:** Direct unauthorized access to the cache storage mechanism, allowing attackers to read cached data and potentially expose sensitive information stored within the cache.
*   **Cache Contribution:** The cache storage itself becomes the point of vulnerability. If the storage is insecure, the cached data is directly exposed.
*   **Example:** `hyperoslo/cache` is configured to use file-based storage with default, overly permissive file system permissions. An attacker gains access to the server's file system (e.g., through a separate vulnerability or misconfiguration) and directly reads the cache files, revealing sensitive user data, API keys, or application secrets that were inadvertently cached.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, disclosure of sensitive data, potential for identity theft, financial fraud, or further attacks based on exposed information.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Cache Storage Configuration:**  Configure the underlying cache storage mechanism with the strictest possible access controls. Ensure only authorized processes and users can access the storage.
    *   **Encryption at Rest for Cache:** Encrypt cached data at rest, especially if it contains sensitive information. This protects data even if the storage is compromised.
    *   **Regular Security Audits of Cache Storage:** Regularly audit the security configuration of the cache storage and the surrounding infrastructure to identify and remediate any vulnerabilities.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Cache Access:** Grant only the minimum necessary permissions to users and processes that need to access the cache storage.

## Attack Surface: [Serialization/Deserialization Vulnerabilities (Direct Cache Interaction)](./attack_surfaces/serializationdeserialization_vulnerabilities__direct_cache_interaction_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the serialization and deserialization processes *directly* used by the cache library or its storage adapters to handle cached data. This can lead to remote code execution when the cache deserializes malicious data.
*   **Cache Contribution:** The cache's internal data handling (serialization/deserialization) becomes the vulnerability. If this process is flawed, attackers can inject malicious serialized data into the cache and trigger code execution upon retrieval.
*   **Example:** `hyperoslo/cache` or a chosen storage adapter uses an insecure serialization library (e.g., `pickle` in Python if used indirectly and unsafely). An attacker finds a way to inject a malicious serialized Python object directly into the cache storage (e.g., through a custom adapter vulnerability). When the application retrieves and deserializes this object from the cache, it triggers remote code execution on the server.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), arbitrary code execution on the server, complete system compromise, data breach, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Insecure Serialization in Cache:**  If possible, configure `hyperoslo/cache` and its adapters to use secure serialization formats like JSON for data that might be exposed to untrusted sources or if custom serialization is implemented.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization (Serialized Data):** If serialization is necessary, rigorously validate and sanitize data *before* serialization and *after* deserialization to prevent injection of malicious serialized objects.
    *   **Use Safe Deserialization Libraries and Practices:** If using libraries known to have deserialization vulnerabilities, ensure they are up-to-date and patched. Follow secure deserialization best practices and consider safer alternatives.
    *   **Restrict Deserialization Scope:** Limit the types of objects that are allowed to be deserialized from the cache to only those strictly necessary and expected by the application.
