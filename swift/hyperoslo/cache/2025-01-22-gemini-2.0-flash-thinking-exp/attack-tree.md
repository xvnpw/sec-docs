## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Cache Storage Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH START]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_cache_storage_vulnerabilities__critical_node__high-risk_path_start_.md)

*   **Why High-Risk:** This category is critical because successful exploitation allows attackers to bypass application logic and directly manipulate or access the core cache data. This can lead to data breaches, data corruption, and further application compromise.

    *   **1.1.2. Insecure Redis/Memcached Configuration (If using 'redis'/'memcached' driver) [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH START]**
        *   **Why High-Risk:** If the application uses Redis or Memcached as a cache store, misconfigurations in these services can directly expose the cached data and potentially the entire application infrastructure.

            *   **1.1.2.1. Default/Weak Passwords [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to authenticate to Redis or Memcached using default credentials or common weak passwords.
                *   **Why High-Risk:** High Impact (Full access to cache data, potentially lateral movement), Medium Likelihood (Common misconfiguration), Low Effort, Beginner Skill.
                *   **Actionable Insight:** Implement strong, unique passwords and enable authentication for Redis/Memcached. Regularly audit and rotate credentials.

            *   **1.1.2.2. Publicly Accessible Redis/Memcached Instance [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers scan for publicly accessible Redis or Memcached instances on the internet or internal networks.
                *   **Why High-Risk:** High Impact (Full access to cache data, potential data breach, DoS), Low Likelihood (Should be avoided, but misconfigurations happen), Low Effort, Beginner Skill.
                *   **Actionable Insight:** Restrict network access to Redis/Memcached to only trusted application servers. Use firewalls and network segmentation to enforce access control.

    *   **1.2. Cache Data Deserialization Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH START]**
        *   **Why High-Risk:** If the application caches serialized PHP objects and uses `unserialize`, it becomes vulnerable to object injection and remote code execution.

            *   **1.2.1. Insecure Deserialization of Cached Data (PHP's `unserialize`) [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH START]**
                *   **Why High-Risk:** `unserialize` in PHP is inherently vulnerable and can be exploited if attacker-controlled data is unserialized.

                    *   **1.2.1.1. Object Injection via Cached Data [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]**
                        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious serialized PHP objects into the cache (e.g., via cache poisoning or direct storage manipulation). When the application retrieves and unserializes this data, it leads to object injection.
                        *   **Why High-Risk:** High Impact (Remote Code Execution), Medium Likelihood (If application caches serialized objects and is vulnerable to poisoning or direct access), Medium Effort, Intermediate/Advanced Skill.
                        *   **Actionable Insight:** Avoid storing serialized objects in cache if possible. If necessary, use safer serialization methods (like JSON, if object fidelity is not critical) or implement robust input validation/sanitization on retrieved cache data *before* unserializing. Consider using signed serialization to verify data integrity.

                    *   **1.2.1.2. Code Execution via Deserialization Gadgets [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]**
                        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit existing "gadget chains" in the application's codebase or dependencies. They craft serialized data that, when unserialized, triggers these gadgets and leads to remote code execution.
                        *   **Why High-Risk:** High Impact (Remote Code Execution), Medium Likelihood (If vulnerable dependencies exist and application uses `unserialize`), Medium Effort, Advanced Skill.
                        *   **Actionable Insight:** Regularly update PHP and all dependencies to patch known deserialization vulnerabilities. Implement input validation/sanitization. Consider using safer serialization methods. Employ Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) that can detect deserialization attacks.

    *   **1.1.1. Filesystem Cache Exposure (If using 'fs' driver) [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH START]**
        *   **Why High-Risk:** If the application uses the filesystem driver and the cache directory is misconfigured, attackers with local access (or via vulnerabilities like Local File Inclusion) can directly read cached data.

            *   **1.1.1.1. World-Readable Cache Directory [HIGH-RISK PATH END]**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit misconfigured filesystem permissions where the cache directory is world-readable.
                *   **Why High-Risk:** Medium Impact (Exposure of cached data), Medium Likelihood (Configuration error), Low Effort, Beginner Skill.
                *   **Actionable Insight:** Configure restrictive permissions on the cache directory, ensuring it's only readable and writable by the web server user.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Denial of Service (DoS) via Cache Abuse [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2__denial_of_service__dos__via_cache_abuse__critical_node_.md)

*   **Why High-Risk:**  Cache abuse can lead to service degradation or complete denial of service, impacting application availability and user experience.

    *   **3.1. Cache Flooding [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **Why High-Risk:** Cache flooding is a relatively easy DoS attack to execute and can quickly degrade cache performance and potentially exhaust resources.

            *   **3.1.1. Generate Unique Cache Keys to Fill Cache [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH START]**
                *   **Why High-Risk:** Attackers can easily generate a large number of unique cache keys, filling the cache and potentially evicting legitimate cached data.

                    *   **3.1.1.1. Parameter Manipulation to Create New Cache Entries [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]**
                        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers manipulate URL parameters, query strings, or POST data to create requests that generate unique cache keys for each request.
                        *   **Why High-Risk:** Medium Impact (Service degradation, cache performance issues, potential resource exhaustion), High Likelihood (Easy to attempt, common DoS vector), Low Effort, Beginner Skill.
                        *   **Actionable Insight:** Implement rate limiting to restrict the number of requests that can create new cache entries. Implement robust input validation to sanitize parameters used in cache key generation. Limit the maximum cache size and configure appropriate eviction policies (LRU, FIFO, etc.).
