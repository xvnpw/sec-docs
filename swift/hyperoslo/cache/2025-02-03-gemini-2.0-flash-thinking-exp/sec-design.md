# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project is a caching library for Swift. The primary business goal for using a caching library is to improve application performance and responsiveness by reducing latency and server load. This is achieved by storing frequently accessed data closer to the application, minimizing the need to fetch it from slower sources like databases or remote APIs repeatedly.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Improve application performance and user experience.
- Reduce server load and infrastructure costs by minimizing requests to backend systems.
- Enhance application scalability by efficiently handling high traffic volumes.
- Provide offline capabilities by caching data for use when network connectivity is limited or unavailable.

Business Risks:
- Data staleness: Cached data might become outdated, leading to inconsistencies if not managed properly.
- Cache invalidation issues: Incorrect or inefficient cache invalidation can result in serving stale data or unnecessary cache misses, negating the benefits of caching.
- Data security in cache: Sensitive data stored in the cache could be exposed if the cache storage mechanism is not properly secured.
- Increased complexity: Introducing caching adds complexity to the application architecture and requires careful design and implementation to avoid introducing bugs or performance bottlenecks.
- Operational overhead: Managing and monitoring the cache infrastructure (if not using in-memory cache) can add operational overhead.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Secure software development lifecycle (assumed): The project is hosted on GitHub, suggesting the use of version control and collaborative development practices.
- security control: Code review (assumed): Contributions to open-source projects on GitHub often undergo code review processes.
- security control: Unit testing (assumed):  Caching libraries typically require unit tests to ensure correctness and reliability.
- security control: Dependency management (assumed): Swift Package Manager is likely used for managing dependencies.

Accepted Risks:
- accepted risk: Lack of formal security audit: As an open-source library, a dedicated security audit might not have been performed.
- accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability identification and patching.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Implement automated static analysis security testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential code vulnerabilities.
- security control: Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
- security control: Provide clear documentation and guidance on secure usage of the library, especially regarding handling sensitive data in the cache.
- security control: Consider fuzz testing to identify potential input validation vulnerabilities.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication: Not directly applicable to a caching library itself. Authentication is handled by the applications using the library.
- Authorization: Not directly applicable to a caching library itself. Authorization is handled by the applications using the library.
- Input Validation:
    - Requirement: The library should perform input validation on cache keys to prevent injection attacks or unexpected behavior.
    - Requirement: If the library handles user-provided data as cache values, it should provide mechanisms or guidance to applications for sanitizing or validating this data before caching to prevent stored cross-site scripting (XSS) or other injection vulnerabilities when the data is retrieved from the cache.
- Cryptography:
    - Requirement: If sensitive data is cached, the library should provide options or guidance for applications to encrypt the data before storing it in the cache and decrypt it upon retrieval. This might involve using encryption at rest for persistent caches or providing APIs for applications to integrate their own encryption mechanisms.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- Application performance and availability: Caching directly impacts application performance and responsiveness, which are critical for user satisfaction and business operations. Degradation in caching performance or availability can negatively impact the user experience and potentially business revenue.
- Data consistency: Maintaining data consistency between the cache and the source of truth (database, API) is crucial. Inconsistencies can lead to incorrect information being presented to users, impacting decision-making and trust.

Data Sensitivity:
- Data sensitivity depends on the application using the caching library. The caching library itself is agnostic to the data it caches.
- Potential data types cached could include:
    - Public data: Low sensitivity (e.g., website content, product catalogs).
    - Semi-sensitive data: Medium sensitivity (e.g., user preferences, non-PII user data).
    - Sensitive data: High sensitivity (e.g., Personally Identifiable Information (PII), financial data, authentication tokens).
- Sensitivity level dictates the required security controls for the cache storage and handling of cached data, including encryption, access controls, and data retention policies.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What are the intended use cases for this caching library? Is it primarily for web applications, mobile apps, or other types of Swift applications?
- What types of data are expected to be cached using this library? Are there specific requirements for handling sensitive data?
- What are the performance requirements for the cache? Are there specific latency or throughput targets?
- What are the operational requirements for the cache? Is it expected to be self-managed or integrated with a managed caching service?
- Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS) that the applications using this library need to adhere to?

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business driver for using this library is to improve application performance and user experience. The business is moderately risk-averse and recognizes the importance of data security and consistency.
- SECURITY POSTURE: Standard secure software development practices are followed, including version control, code review, and testing. However, formal security audits and dedicated security testing might not be regularly performed for this open-source library. Applications using this library are responsible for implementing application-level security controls and securely handling sensitive data cached by the library.
- DESIGN: The caching library is intended to be integrated into various Swift applications. It supports different cache storage backends (in-memory, disk, NSCache). The deployment model involves including the library as a Swift Package dependency within applications. The build process utilizes standard CI/CD practices for Swift packages.
