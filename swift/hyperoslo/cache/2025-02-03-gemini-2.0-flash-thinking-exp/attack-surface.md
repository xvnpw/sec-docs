# Attack Surface Analysis for hyperoslo/cache

## Attack Surface: [Cache Poisoning](./attack_surfaces/cache_poisoning.md)

*   **Description:** Injecting malicious or incorrect data into the cache, leading to the application serving this poisoned data to users. This directly exploits the cache's role in storing and serving data.
*   **Cache Contribution:** The cache is the direct vector for serving poisoned data.  If the cache population process is flawed, the cache will store and distribute the malicious content.
*   **Example:** An application caches API responses based on request parameters. An attacker crafts a request that, when cached, contains malicious JavaScript. Subsequent requests for the same (or similar) cached data will serve this malicious script, leading to XSS for users.
*   **Impact:** Serving malicious content, application malfunction, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, information disclosure, potential account compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation *for Cache Population*:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize data *specifically before* it is stored in the cache. Focus on inputs that influence what gets cached.
    *   **Output Encoding *from Cache*:** Encode data retrieved *from the cache* before rendering it in the application, especially if it originates from external or potentially untrusted sources.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to limit the impact of XSS, even if cache poisoning occurs.
    *   **Data Integrity Checks *for Cached Data*:** Consider using checksums or digital signatures to verify the integrity of data *when retrieving it from the cache*.

## Attack Surface: [Cache Deception/Stale Data Injection](./attack_surfaces/cache_deceptionstale_data_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Manipulating cache invalidation or network conditions to force the application to serve outdated or stale data when fresh data should be available. This directly undermines the cache's intended purpose of providing up-to-date information.
*   **Cache Contribution:** The cache's mechanism of storing data for a duration and invalidation processes are directly targeted. Exploiting these allows attackers to control data freshness served *from the cache*.
*   **Example:** A financial application caches stock prices. An attacker manipulates network traffic to prevent cache invalidation when prices update. Users relying on the cached prices might make incorrect trading decisions based on stale information served *from the cache*.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure (outdated information leading to incorrect decisions), business logic bypasses (accessing features based on outdated state), financial loss, reputational damage, Denial of Service (if critical functionalities rely on fresh data and stale data causes errors).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Robust Cache Invalidation Mechanisms:** Implement reliable and timely cache invalidation logic. Ensure invalidation is triggered correctly when underlying data changes and that the *cache* is effectively updated.
    *   **Appropriate TTL Configuration:** Carefully configure Time-To-Live (TTL) values based on data volatility and application needs.  Balance freshness with cache performance.  *Incorrect TTL configuration directly impacts cache effectiveness and vulnerability to stale data attacks.*
    *   **Monitoring and Alerting *for Cache Staleness*:** Monitor cache hit ratios and investigate unexpected increases in cache misses or signs of stale data being served. Implement alerts for anomalies that might indicate cache manipulation.

## Attack Surface: [Data Leakage through Cache Storage](./attack_surfaces/data_leakage_through_cache_storage.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored within the cache storage backend. This directly exposes the data held within the cache.
*   **Cache Contribution:** The cache *itself* is the repository of potentially sensitive data.  If the storage mechanism for the cache is insecure, the cached data becomes vulnerable.
*   **Example:** An application caches user session data (including session tokens) in Redis. If Redis is misconfigured with weak authentication or exposed to unauthorized networks, an attacker could access the Redis instance and extract session tokens *directly from the cache*, leading to account takeover.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, information disclosure, unauthorized access to sensitive data, potential account compromise, compliance violations.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Cache Storage Backend Configuration:**  Secure the underlying storage used by `hyperoslo/cache`. This is paramount for protecting data *within the cache*.
        *   **Strong Authentication and Authorization *for Cache Access*:** Implement robust authentication and authorization to control access to the cache storage.
        *   **Network Isolation *for Cache Storage*:** Isolate the cache storage on a private network, restricting access from untrusted networks.
        *   **Encryption in Transit and at Rest *for Cache Data*:** Use encryption to protect data both in transit to/from the cache and while stored at rest in the cache backend.
    *   **Regular Security Audits and Patching *of Cache Infrastructure*:** Regularly audit and patch the cache storage backend and related infrastructure to address known vulnerabilities that could compromise the *cache*.
