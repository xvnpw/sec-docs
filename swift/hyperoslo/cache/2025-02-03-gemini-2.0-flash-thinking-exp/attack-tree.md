## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Cache Storage Vulnerabilities (Critical Node & High-Risk Path Start):](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_cache_storage_vulnerabilities__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_start_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This category encompasses attacks that directly target the underlying storage mechanism used by `hyperoslo/cache` (filesystem, Redis, Memcached). Bypassing application logic, attackers aim to directly access, manipulate, or compromise the cached data at its storage level.
*   **Potential Impact:**  Depending on the vulnerability exploited, the impact can range from data theft and manipulation to complete compromise of the cache system and potentially the application if sensitive data or credentials are cached.
*   **Mitigation Actions:**
    *   Secure the underlying storage based on the chosen driver (filesystem permissions, strong authentication and access control for Redis/Memcached, encryption in transit and at rest where applicable).
    *   Regularly audit and monitor access to the cache storage.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2. Insecure Redis/Memcached Configuration (Critical Node & High-Risk Path Start):](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2__insecure_redismemcached_configuration__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_start_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If using Redis or Memcached as the cache store, misconfigurations are a prime target. This includes using default or weak passwords, exposing the instance publicly, or lacking encryption.
*   **Potential Impact:**  Gaining unauthorized access to Redis or Memcached allows attackers to read, modify, or delete all cached data. This can lead to data breaches, cache poisoning, denial of service, and potentially lateral movement within the infrastructure if the cache server is poorly segmented.
*   **Mitigation Actions:**
    *   **1.1.2.1. Default/Weak Passwords (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):**  Always set strong, unique passwords for Redis and Memcached and enforce authentication.
    *   **1.1.2.2. Publicly Accessible Redis/Memcached Instance (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):** Restrict network access to Redis and Memcached instances to only the application servers that require it. Use firewalls and network segmentation.
    *   **1.1.2.3. Lack of Encryption in Transit (Redis):** Enable TLS/SSL encryption for all communication between the application and Redis to prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2. Cache Data Deserialization Vulnerabilities (Critical Node & High-Risk Path Start):](./attack_tree_paths/1_2__cache_data_deserialization_vulnerabilities__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_start_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  If `hyperoslo/cache` or the application stores serialized PHP objects in the cache (using `serialize`/`unserialize`), it becomes vulnerable to insecure deserialization attacks. Attackers can inject malicious serialized objects into the cache (via poisoning or direct storage manipulation if possible). When the application retrieves and unserializes this data, it can lead to Object Injection and Remote Code Execution.
*   **Potential Impact:**  Remote Code Execution (RCE) is the most severe potential impact. Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to full system compromise.
*   **Mitigation Actions:**
    *   **1.2.1. Insecure Deserialization of Cached Data (PHP's `unserialize`) (Critical Node & High-Risk Path Start):**
        *   **1.2.1.1. Object Injection via Cached Data (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):** Avoid storing serialized objects in the cache if possible. Use simpler data formats. If serialization is necessary, explore safer alternatives to `unserialize` or implement robust input validation and sanitization *before* unserializing cached data. Consider using signed serialization to verify data integrity.
        *   **1.2.1.2. Code Execution via Deserialization Gadgets (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):** Keep PHP and all dependencies updated to patch known deserialization vulnerabilities. Implement input validation and sanitization. Consider using safer serialization methods. Employ Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) to detect and block deserialization attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1. Filesystem Cache Exposure (If using 'fs' driver) -> 1.1.1.1. World-Readable Cache Directory (High-Risk Path End):](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1__filesystem_cache_exposure__if_using_'fs'_driver__-_1_1_1_1__world-readable_cache_directory__h_9a6a3fa1.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If the 'fs' driver is used and the cache directory is misconfigured with world-readable permissions, local attackers (or those gaining access through Local File Inclusion vulnerabilities) can directly read cached files.
*   **Potential Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive cached data, potentially including user session information, API keys, or other confidential data that was intended to be cached for performance but not for public access.
*   **Mitigation Actions:**
    *   **1.1.1.1. World-Readable Cache Directory:** Configure restrictive file system permissions on the cache directory, ensuring it is only readable and writable by the web server user.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Denial of Service (DoS) via Cache Abuse -> 3.1. Cache Flooding -> 3.1.1. Generate Unique Cache Keys to Fill Cache -> 3.1.1.1. Parameter Manipulation to Create New Cache Entries (High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/3__denial_of_service__dos__via_cache_abuse_-_3_1__cache_flooding_-_3_1_1__generate_unique_cache_keys_a974ab46.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit the application's cache key generation logic to create a large number of unique cache entries. By manipulating request parameters (e.g., query strings, POST data), they can force the application to cache responses for a vast number of distinct keys, rapidly filling up the cache storage.
*   **Potential Impact:**  Cache flooding can lead to denial of service by:
    *   Exhausting cache storage space, potentially causing eviction of legitimate cached data and degrading cache performance for all users.
    *   Increasing load on the cache backend and potentially the origin servers as the cache becomes ineffective and requests are forwarded to the origin.
    *   In extreme cases, causing the cache service to crash or become unresponsive.
*   **Mitigation Actions:**
    *   **3.1.1.1. Parameter Manipulation to Create New Cache Entries (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):**
        *   Implement rate limiting to restrict the number of requests from a single source that can create new cache entries within a given time frame.
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization to prevent attackers from easily generating a large number of unique cache keys through parameter manipulation.
        *   Set appropriate limits on the maximum cache size and configure effective cache eviction policies (e.g., LRU - Least Recently Used) to manage cache capacity and prevent it from being completely filled by malicious entries.
