# Threat Model Analysis for hyperoslo/cache

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure in Cache Storage](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_in_cache_storage.md)

**Description:** An attacker might gain unauthorized access to the underlying cache storage (e.g., file system, database, memory) if it is not properly secured. They could directly read cached files, memory dumps, or database entries to extract sensitive information like user credentials, API keys, or personal data. This could happen due to misconfigured permissions, lack of encryption, or vulnerabilities in the storage mechanism itself.
**Impact:** High. Exposure of sensitive data can lead to identity theft, account compromise, data breaches, financial loss, reputational damage, and legal/regulatory penalties.
**Affected Cache Component:** Cache Storage Mechanism (e.g., file system, in-memory store, database backend used by `hyperoslo/cache`).
**Risk Severity:** High to Critical, depending on the sensitivity of the data cached.
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Encrypt sensitive data before caching, especially if using persistent storage.
*   Implement strict access controls (file system permissions, database access rules, etc.) on the cache storage location, limiting access to only necessary processes and users.
*   Regularly audit and monitor access to the cache storage.
*   Consider using in-memory caching for highly sensitive, short-lived data to minimize persistence risks.
*   If using disk-based caching, ensure the storage location is on a secure volume and properly protected.

## Threat: [Cache Poisoning](./threats/cache_poisoning.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious or manipulated data into the cache. This could be achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's data handling before caching, or by directly manipulating the cache storage if access controls are weak. Once poisoned, subsequent requests might serve this malicious data to users, leading to various attacks.
**Impact:** Medium to High. Cache poisoning can lead to serving malicious content (XSS), redirection to attacker-controlled sites, bypassing security checks, serving incorrect information, application malfunction, and potentially further compromise depending on the nature of the poisoned data and application logic.
**Affected Cache Component:** Cache Population/Update Logic, Data Validation within the application using the cache.
**Risk Severity:** High, in scenarios where poisoned data can lead to significant security breaches or widespread impact.
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all data *before* it is stored in the cache.
*   Use strong and unpredictable cache keys to make it difficult for attackers to guess or manipulate keys for injection.
*   Implement proper cache invalidation mechanisms (TTL, event-based) to limit the lifespan of potentially poisoned data.
*   Consider using data integrity checks (checksums, signatures) for cached data to detect tampering.
*   Regularly review and test the cache population and invalidation logic.

## Threat: [Cache Exhaustion leading to Denial of Service (DoS)](./threats/cache_exhaustion_leading_to_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

**Description:** An attacker could flood the application with requests designed to generate a large number of unique cache keys. This forces the cache to store excessive data, rapidly consuming cache resources (memory, disk space).  If the cache reaches its capacity, it can lead to performance degradation, slow response times, or complete application unavailability for legitimate users.
**Impact:** Medium to High. Cache exhaustion can cause service disruption, impacting availability and user experience. In severe cases, it can lead to application crashes and prolonged downtime.
**Affected Cache Component:** Cache Storage, Cache Eviction Policy, Request Handling Logic.
**Risk Severity:** High, if successful exhaustion leads to significant service disruption or application unavailability.
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement cache size limits and appropriate eviction policies (LRU, FIFO, etc.) to prevent uncontrolled cache growth.
*   Implement rate limiting on requests, especially those that generate new cache entries, to mitigate rapid key generation.
*   Optimize cache key generation to reduce the number of unique keys created unnecessarily.
*   Monitor cache performance and resource usage (memory, disk space) to detect and respond to potential exhaustion attacks.
*   Consider using tiered caching with different levels of persistence and capacity.

## Threat: [Stale Data Serving with Security Implications](./threats/stale_data_serving_with_security_implications.md)

**Description:**  Due to flawed or misconfigured cache invalidation, the application might serve outdated data from the cache for longer than intended. For security-sensitive information (authorization decisions, permissions, security policies), serving stale data can lead to unauthorized access or privilege escalation. For example, a user whose access has been revoked might still be granted access if the cached permission data is not updated promptly.
**Impact:** Medium to High. Serving stale security-related data can result in unauthorized access, privilege escalation, security policy violations, and potential data breaches.
**Affected Cache Component:** Cache Invalidation Logic, Time-To-Live (TTL) configuration.
**Risk Severity:** High, when stale security data leads to unauthorized access to critical resources or sensitive information.
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully design and implement cache invalidation strategies, especially for security-sensitive data.
*   Use appropriate and short TTL values for security-critical cached data.
*   Implement event-based cache invalidation triggers for security-related updates (e.g., permission changes).
*   Prioritize cache invalidation for security data over performance optimization in critical scenarios.
*   Implement mechanisms to force cache refresh for critical security updates.
*   Regularly review and test cache invalidation logic, particularly for security-related data.
