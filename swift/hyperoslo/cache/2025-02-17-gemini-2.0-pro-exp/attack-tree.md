## Attack Tree Path: [1. Cache Poisoning [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__cache_poisoning__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** This attack aims to inject malicious data into the cache, causing the application to serve incorrect or harmful content to users. It exploits weaknesses in how cache keys are generated or how user input is handled.
*   **Attack Vectors:**

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1. Predictable Key Generation (Weak Hashing/Keying) -> 1.1.1.1. Exploit predictable key generation logic. [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1__predictable_key_generation__weak_hashingkeying__-_1_1_1_1__exploit_predictable_key_generation_959a3524.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker identifies or predicts the algorithm used to generate cache keys. This could be due to weak hashing functions, insufficient entropy (e.g., relying solely on easily guessable data like sequential IDs), or a lack of proper salting.
            *   **Steps:**
                1.  Analyze the application's requests and responses to identify patterns in cache keys.
                2.  Reverse-engineer or guess the key generation algorithm.
                3.  Craft requests with predictable parameters that will generate keys corresponding to existing, legitimate cache entries.
                4.  Overwrite the legitimate cache entries with malicious data.
            *   **Example:** If the cache key is simply `md5(product_id)`, and `product_id` is a sequential integer, the attacker can easily calculate the keys for all products and overwrite their cached data.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** High
            *   **Effort:** Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2. Input-Dependent Cache Key Manipulation [HIGH RISK] -> 1.2.1.1. Inject malicious input to control the cache key. [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2__input-dependent_cache_key_manipulation__high_risk__-_1_2_1_1__inject_malicious_input_to_control_350df4a7.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker manipulates user-supplied input that is directly or indirectly used in the generation of cache keys.  This allows the attacker to control which cache entry is accessed or modified.
            *   **Steps:**
                1.  Identify input fields or parameters that influence the cache key.
                2.  Inject malicious input (e.g., special characters, long strings, crafted values) designed to alter the cache key.
                3.  Cause the application to either:
                    *   Write malicious data to an arbitrary cache key.
                    *   Read data from an unintended cache key (potentially a poisoned one).
            *   **Example:** If the cache key is generated as `product_details_{user_input}`, and `user_input` is not sanitized, an attacker could provide input like `../sensitive_data` to potentially access or overwrite a different cache entry.
            *   **Likelihood:** High
            *   **Impact:** Very High
            *   **Effort:** Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Denial of Service (DoS) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/3__denial_of_service__dos___high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** This attack aims to make the application unavailable to legitimate users by exploiting the caching mechanism.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**

## Attack Tree Path: [3.3. Resource Exhaustion via Large Cache Entries [HIGH RISK] -> 3.3.1. Store excessively large objects. [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/3_3__resource_exhaustion_via_large_cache_entries__high_risk__-_3_3_1__store_excessively_large_object_75beb40d.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker submits requests that cause the application to store very large objects in the cache. This consumes excessive memory, potentially leading to the cache server or the application crashing.
            *   **Steps:**
                1.  Identify input fields or parameters that influence the size of the data stored in the cache.
                2.  Submit requests with very large values for these parameters.
                3.  Repeat this process until the cache server or application runs out of memory and crashes.
            *   **Example:** If the application caches user-uploaded files without size limits, an attacker could upload extremely large files, filling the cache and causing a denial of service.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** High
            *   **Effort:** Low
