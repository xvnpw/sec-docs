# Threat Model Analysis for hyperoslo/cache

## Threat: [Cache Poisoning (Data Leakage)](./threats/cache_poisoning__data_leakage_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts requests that result in cache key collisions, causing them to receive cached data intended for other users. This leverages the *direct* mechanism of how the `cache` library generates and uses keys (e.g., the `@cache.cached()` decorator and its `key` argument). The attacker exploits insufficient key uniqueness *within the caching logic itself*.
*   **Impact:**  Leakage of sensitive user data (PII, financial data, etc.), leading to privacy violations and potential legal consequences.
*   **Cache Component Affected:**  Cache key generation logic *within* the application's use of the `cache` library (specifically, how `@cache.cached()` or similar decorators are used, and the `key` argument). The underlying storage is a secondary effect.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on data sensitivity).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory User-Specific Keys:**  *Always* include a unique, user-specific identifier (user ID, session token) in the cache key when caching *any* user-related data.  This is a direct mitigation within the `cache` library's usage.  Example: `key=f"user:{user_id}:resource:{resource_id}"`.
    *   **Key Component Validation (Within Cache Logic):** While general input validation is important, specifically validate the *components* that form the cache key *before* they are used by the `cache` library. This prevents injection *into the key itself*.

## Threat: [Cache Tampering (Data Integrity Violation - *If Storage is Directly Accessible*)](./threats/cache_tampering__data_integrity_violation_-_if_storage_is_directly_accessible_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains *direct* access to the cache storage (Redis, Memcached, filesystem) and modifies the cached data. This threat is only "direct" if the attacker can bypass application-level controls and interact with the cache storage *directly*. If the attacker is manipulating application inputs, it's an indirect attack.
*   **Impact:**  Application malfunction, incorrect results, potential security vulnerabilities if tampered data is used in security decisions. Could lead to code execution if combined with unsafe deserialization.
*   **Cache Component Affected:**  The cache storage (Redis, Memcached, filesystem) itself. The `cache` library is indirectly affected because it reads the tampered data.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on data and usage).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Cache Storage (Paramount):**  Strong authentication, access controls, and network restrictions for the cache backend are *essential*. This is the primary defense.
    *   **Data Integrity Checks (Custom Implementation):** Implement checksums or digital signatures *within your application code* to verify data integrity upon retrieval from the cache. The `cache` library doesn't provide this, so it's a custom solution *around* the library.

## Threat: [Cache Data Exposure (Information Disclosure - *If Storage is Directly Accessible*)](./threats/cache_data_exposure__information_disclosure_-_if_storage_is_directly_accessible_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains *direct*, unauthorized access to the cache storage and reads the cached data.  Similar to tampering, this is only a "direct" threat if the attacker bypasses application-level security and interacts with the cache storage directly.
*   **Impact:**  Leakage of sensitive data stored in the cache.
*   **Cache Component Affected:**  The cache storage (Redis, Memcached, filesystem).
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on data sensitivity).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Cache Storage (Paramount):**  (Same as for Cache Tampering). This is the primary defense against direct access.
    *   **Data Encryption (Custom Implementation):** Encrypt sensitive data *before* storing it in the cache (and decrypt after retrieval). This is a custom solution implemented *around* the `cache` library, as it doesn't offer built-in encryption.

## Threat: [Unsafe Deserialization (Remote Code Execution)](./threats/unsafe_deserialization__remote_code_execution_.md)

*   **Description:** If the `cache` library is configured to use Pickle for serialization, and an attacker can tamper with the cached data (either directly or indirectly), they can inject malicious Pickle payloads that execute arbitrary code upon deserialization. This is a *direct* threat to the `cache` library's handling of serialized data.
*   **Impact:**  Complete system compromise; the attacker gains full control of the application server.
*   **Cache Component Affected:**  The serialization/deserialization logic *within* the `cache` library (specifically, any function using `pickle.loads()` if Pickle is enabled).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Pickle:**  Use a safer serialization format like JSON. This is the *best* mitigation.
    *   **Signed Pickle (If Absolutely Necessary):** If Pickle is unavoidable, use a signed Pickle implementation (e.g., `itsdangerous`) to verify data integrity *before* deserialization. This prevents the execution of arbitrary code.
    *   **Trusted Data Source (Essential with Pickle):**  *Never* cache data from untrusted sources if using Pickle.
