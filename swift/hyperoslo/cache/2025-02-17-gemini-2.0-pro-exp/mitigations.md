# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for hyperoslo/cache

## Mitigation Strategy: [Key Separation and Namespacing](./mitigation_strategies/key_separation_and_namespacing.md)

1.  **Analyze cache key usage:** Review all code that interacts with the cache and identify how cache keys are constructed.
2.  **Define clear key structures:**  Develop a consistent naming convention for cache keys.  Keys should be descriptive and include all factors that differentiate cached content.
3.  **Use namespaces:**  Group related cache entries under namespaces to prevent collisions.  For example, use prefixes like `product:`, `user:`, `category:`, etc.
4.  **Incorporate all relevant factors:**  Ensure the cache key includes *all* factors that affect the cached data, including user IDs, language preferences, device types, etc.  This is crucial for preventing unintended data sharing between users or contexts.
5.  **Document the key structure:**  Clearly document the cache key structure and naming conventions for all developers.
6.  **Automated key generation (Optional):** Consider creating helper functions or classes to automatically generate cache keys based on input parameters, ensuring consistency and reducing the risk of manual errors.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Cache Poisoning:** (Severity: High) - Reduces the risk of attackers overwriting legitimate cache entries with malicious data by making it harder to guess or predict cache keys.
        *   **Information Disclosure:** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents accidental leakage of data between users or contexts due to key collisions.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Cache Poisoning:** Significantly reduces the risk, especially when combined with input validation.
        *   **Information Disclosure:** Reduces the risk of accidental data leakage.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Partial namespacing used for product details (`product:{product_id}:details`).

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   No consistent key structure for other cached data (e.g., user profiles, category listings).
        *   No incorporation of request headers (e.g., `Accept-Language`) into cache keys.
        *   No documentation of the cache key structure.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Cache Key Hardening](./mitigation_strategies/cache_key_hardening.md)

1.  **Identify attacker-controlled inputs:** Determine which parts of the cache key are derived from user-supplied data (e.g., request headers, URL parameters).
2.  **Choose a hashing algorithm:** Select a strong cryptographic hash function (e.g., SHA-256, SHA-3). Avoid weaker algorithms like MD5 or SHA-1.
3.  **Hash attacker-controlled inputs:** Before incorporating attacker-controlled inputs into the cache key, hash them using the chosen algorithm.
4.  **Combine hashed inputs with other key components:** Combine the hashed inputs with other parts of the cache key (e.g., static prefixes, version numbers) to create the final key.
5.  **Consider salting (Optional):** For added security, you can add a secret "salt" to the input before hashing. This makes it harder for attackers to pre-compute hashes.
6. **Consistent Hashing:** Ensure that the hashing process is consistent across all parts of the application that interact with the cache.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Cache Poisoning:** (Severity: High) Makes it significantly harder for attackers to predict or manipulate cache keys, even if they can control some of the input data.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Cache Poisoning:** Substantially reduces the risk, especially when combined with other mitigations.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Not implemented.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   No hashing of any part of the cache key. This is a significant vulnerability, especially for keys that include request headers.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Vary Header Handling](./mitigation_strategies/vary_header_handling.md)

1.  **Identify Varying Responses:** Analyze your application's responses to determine which ones depend on request headers (e.g., `Accept-Language`, `User-Agent`, `Accept-Encoding`).
2.  **Inspect `cache` Library Configuration:** Review the configuration of the `hyperoslo/cache` library to understand how it handles the `Vary` header.  Ensure it's configured to correctly incorporate the values of `Vary` headers into the cache key.
3.  **Test Vary Header Behavior:** Thoroughly test the caching behavior with different values for the relevant request headers.  Verify that separate cache entries are created for each unique combination of header values.
4.  **Explicitly Include Headers in Keys (If Necessary):** If the library doesn't automatically handle `Vary` headers correctly, you may need to manually include the relevant header values in your cache key generation logic.
5.  **Monitor for Incorrect Vary Handling:** Monitor your application logs for any warnings or errors related to `Vary` header handling.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Cache Poisoning:** (Severity: Critical) - Prevents a *very* common and dangerous type of cache poisoning where responses intended for one user (with specific headers) are served to another user.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Cache Poisoning:** Eliminates a major class of cache poisoning vulnerabilities.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Unknown.  Needs to be verified by inspecting the `cache` library configuration and conducting thorough testing.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Likely missing proper handling of `Vary: User-Agent` and `Vary: Accept-Language`.  This needs to be confirmed and addressed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Encryption at Rest (Disk/Hybrid Caches)](./mitigation_strategies/encryption_at_rest__diskhybrid_caches_.md)

1.  **Determine Cache Storage Type:** Confirm whether you're using disk-based or hybrid caching.  This mitigation is only relevant if data is stored on disk.
2.  **Choose Encryption Method:** If the `cache` library provides built-in encryption, use it.  If not, you'll need to implement encryption yourself.  Use a strong, well-vetted encryption library (e.g., `cryptography` in Python).
3.  **Select Encryption Algorithm:** Use a strong, modern encryption algorithm (e.g., AES-256 in GCM or CTR mode).
4.  **Key Management:** Implement secure key management.  *Never* hardcode encryption keys in your application code.  Use a secure key storage mechanism (e.g., environment variables, a dedicated key management service, HashiCorp Vault).  Rotate keys regularly.
5.  **Encrypt Data Before Writing:** Encrypt data *before* writing it to the cache.
6.  **Decrypt Data After Reading:** Decrypt data *after* reading it from the cache.
7.  **Handle Encryption Errors:** Implement proper error handling for encryption and decryption failures.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Information Disclosure:** (Severity: High) - Protects cached data from unauthorized access if the server is compromised or if the cache storage is accessed directly.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Information Disclosure:** Significantly reduces the risk of data breaches if the cache storage is compromised.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Not implemented.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   No encryption of cached data on disk. This is a major vulnerability if using disk-based or hybrid caching.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Cache Size Limits](./mitigation_strategies/cache_size_limits.md)

1.  **Determine Appropriate Limits:** Based on your application's resources and expected usage, determine appropriate limits for the cache size. This can be based on the number of entries, the total memory used, or the total disk space used.
2.  **Configure Cache Library:** Configure the `cache` library to enforce these limits. The library should provide options for setting maximum cache size and eviction policies.
3.  **Monitor Cache Usage:** Regularly monitor cache usage to ensure the limits are effective and to detect any unexpected growth.
4.  **Test Limit Enforcement:** Test the application under load to verify that the cache size limits are enforced correctly and that the application behaves gracefully when the limits are reached.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Cache Exhaustion:** (Severity: High) Prevents attackers from filling the cache and causing performance degradation or application crashes.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Significantly reduces the risk of DoS attacks targeting the cache.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   A maximum number of entries limit is set, but it's likely too high.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   No limits on total memory or disk space used by the cache.
        *   No monitoring of cache usage.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Event-Driven Invalidation](./mitigation_strategies/event-driven_invalidation.md)

1.  **Identify Data Update Events:** Determine the events that trigger changes to the underlying data that is cached (e.g., database updates, API calls).
2.  **Implement Event Listeners:** Implement event listeners or subscribers that are triggered when these data update events occur.
3.  **Invalidate Cache Entries:** Within the event listeners, invalidate the corresponding cache entries. This can be done by deleting the entries or updating them with fresh data.
4.  **Use Specific Keys or Tags:** If possible, use specific cache keys or tags to identify the entries that need to be invalidated. This avoids invalidating the entire cache unnecessarily.
5.  **Handle Invalidation Failures:** Implement proper error handling for cache invalidation failures.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Improper Invalidation/Stale Data:** (Severity: High) Ensures that cached data is kept up-to-date and that users are not served stale information.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Improper Invalidation/Stale Data:** Significantly reduces the risk of serving stale data.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Partially implemented. Some cache entries are invalidated when related data is updated, but the implementation is not consistent or comprehensive.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Missing event listeners for several data update events, leading to potential stale data issues.
        *   No use of cache tags for more efficient invalidation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Short TTLs (Time-to-Live)](./mitigation_strategies/short_ttls__time-to-live_.md)

1.  **Analyze Data Volatility:** Determine how frequently the data being cached changes.
2.  **Set Appropriate TTLs:** Configure the `cache` library to use short TTLs for data that changes frequently.  Balance the need for fresh data with the performance benefits of caching.
3.  **Use Different TTLs for Different Data:**  Consider using different TTLs for different types of cached data, based on their volatility.
4.  **Test TTL Effectiveness:** Test the application to ensure that the TTLs are working as expected and that stale data is not being served.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Improper Invalidation/Stale Data:** (Severity: High) - Reduces the window of time during which stale data might be served.
        *   **Cache Poisoning:** (Severity: Medium) - Limits the impact of a successful cache poisoning attack by reducing the time a poisoned entry remains in the cache.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Improper Invalidation/Stale Data:** Significantly reduces the risk, especially for frequently changing data.
        *   **Cache Poisoning:** Provides some additional protection.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   A default TTL is set, but it might be too long for some data.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   No analysis of data volatility to determine appropriate TTLs.
        *   No use of different TTLs for different data types.
