# Attack Surface Analysis for hyperoslo/cache

## Attack Surface: [Cache Poisoning (Data Injection)](./attack_surfaces/cache_poisoning__data_injection_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates inputs to inject malicious or incorrect data *into the cache*, which is then served to other users.
*   **How Cache Contributes:** The cache is the *direct target* and persistence mechanism for the injected data. This is the core of the vulnerability.
*   **Example:**
    *   An attacker injects an XSS payload into a data field that is cached without sanitization. The cache then serves this payload to all users.
    *   An attacker, by manipulating request headers included in the cache key, injects malicious content that will be served to users with specific header configurations.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    *   Data Corruption
    *   Defacement
    *   Potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE) if combined with deserialization vulnerabilities (making this *Critical*).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if RCE is possible via deserialization) or High (for XSS and other data corruption).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Validate *all* data *before* it is cached. This is the primary defense.
    *   **Output Encoding:** Encode data retrieved from the cache *before* using it. This prevents injected scripts from executing.
    *   **Careful Key Design:** Ensure the cache key includes *all* factors that influence the cached content.
    *   **Secure Serialization (if used):** *Never* deserialize untrusted data. Use a secure serializer (like `json`) and strongly consider alternatives to serialization.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to mitigate XSS, even if injection occurs.

## Attack Surface: [Cache Exhaustion (Denial of Service)](./attack_surfaces/cache_exhaustion__denial_of_service_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker floods the cache with unique entries, consuming resources and evicting legitimate data, *directly impacting the cache's availability*.
*   **How Cache Contributes:** The cache's limited storage is the *direct target* of the attack.
*   **Example:**
    *   An attacker sends requests with rapidly changing, random values in a parameter that forms part of the cache key, creating numerous entries.
    *   Manipulating HTTP headers that are part of the cache key to generate a large number of unique cache entries.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) – legitimate users experience slow performance or unavailability due to cache misses.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Limit requests that can generate cache entries, especially those based on user input.
    *   **Cache Size Limits:** Configure a maximum cache size and a suitable eviction policy (LRU, LFU, etc.).
    *   **Key Normalization:** Normalize cache keys to reduce the impact of minor input variations.
    *   **Input Validation (for Key Components):** Validate the components of the cache key.
    *   **Monitoring:** Monitor cache size and hit/eviction rates to detect attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Cache Invalidation Failures (Leading to Stale Data)](./attack_surfaces/cache_invalidation_failures__leading_to_stale_data_.md)

*   **Description:** Stale or incorrect data is served from the cache because the cache was *not properly invalidated* when the underlying data changed.
*   **How Cache Contributes:** The cache is *directly responsible* for serving the outdated data. The core issue is the cache's failure to stay synchronized.
*   **Example:**
    *   A product price is updated, but the cached product page is not invalidated, leading users to see the old price.
    *   User profile is updated, but cache is not invalidated.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data Inconsistency – users receive outdated or incorrect information.
    *   Business Logic Errors.
    *   Loss of Trust.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the data's sensitivity and the impact of inconsistencies).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Robust Invalidation Logic:** Implement *correct* and *complete* cache invalidation. This is the primary mitigation.
    *   **Use Cache Tags (if supported):** Group related cache entries with tags for easier invalidation.
    *   **Event-Driven Invalidation:** Trigger invalidation based on data change events.
    *   **Testing:** Thoroughly test cache invalidation logic, including race condition tests.
    *   **Short TTLs (as a fallback):** Use short TTLs to limit the impact of failures, but *not* as the primary strategy.
