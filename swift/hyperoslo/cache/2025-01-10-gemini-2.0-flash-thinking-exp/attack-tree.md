## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Cache Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_cache_exploitation.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. It represents a successful breach of the application's security by leveraging weaknesses in the caching mechanism. Success here means the attacker has achieved their objective of influencing application behavior or accessing sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Data into Cache](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_data_into_cache.md)

This critical step involves the attacker successfully inserting harmful or manipulated data into the cache. This can be achieved through various means, making it a central point of attack. If successful, the malicious data will be served to users or processed by the application, leading to further compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerable Data Handling](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerable_data_handling.md)

This node represents a flaw in the application's code where it processes untrusted input without proper sanitization or validation before caching it.
        * Attackers can inject various types of malicious payloads:
            * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) payloads:**  Scripts that execute in the victim's browser when the cached data is displayed, potentially stealing cookies or redirecting users.
            * **Command Injection payloads:**  Data that, when processed by the application, leads to the execution of arbitrary commands on the server.
            * **Data Manipulation payloads:**  Altered data that causes the application to behave incorrectly or make flawed decisions.
            * **Privilege Escalation payloads:** Data designed to grant the attacker elevated privileges within the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Library-Specific Weaknesses (Focus on hyperoslo/cache)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_library-specific_weaknesses__focus_on_hyperoslocache_.md)

This category focuses on vulnerabilities inherent in the `hyperoslo/cache` library itself, rather than the application's specific usage.
        * Attack vectors here depend on the specific weaknesses present in the library:
            * **Exploiting known vulnerabilities:**  Taking advantage of publicly disclosed security flaws in the library's code.
            * **Exploiting insecure defaults:**  Leveraging default configurations that are not secure, such as weak storage mechanisms or overly long TTLs.
            * **Exploiting logical flaws:**  Finding and exploiting design or implementation errors in the library's core functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Vulnerable Data Handling leading to Malicious Data Injection](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_vulnerable_data_handling_leading_to_malicious_data_injection.md)

This path involves the attacker identifying and exploiting input points in the application that are not properly secured.
        * The attacker crafts malicious input designed to exploit the identified vulnerability.
        * This malicious input is then processed by the application and subsequently stored in the cache.
        * When the cached data is retrieved and used by the application or presented to users, the malicious payload is executed, leading to the intended compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Deserialization of Cached Data](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_deserialization_of_cached_data.md)

This path targets applications that serialize objects before caching them and then deserialize them upon retrieval.
        * The attacker crafts a malicious serialized object.
        * This malicious object is injected into the cache, often by exploiting application logic vulnerabilities.
        * When the application retrieves and deserializes this object without proper validation, it can lead to:
            * **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The malicious object contains instructions that allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cache Poisoning via Cache Key Injection](./attack_tree_paths/cache_poisoning_via_cache_key_injection.md)

This path exploits situations where the application allows user-controlled input to directly influence the generation of cache keys.
        * The attacker manipulates input fields to craft specific cache keys.
        * They then submit a request with malicious data associated with a key that overlaps with or overwrites a legitimate cache entry.
        * Subsequent requests for the legitimate data will retrieve the attacker's malicious data from the cache.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Bugs in Library's Key Generation/Hashing](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_bugs_in_library's_key_generationhashing.md)

This path focuses on vulnerabilities within the `hyperoslo/cache` library related to how it generates or hashes cache keys.
        * If the key generation algorithm is flawed or predictable, attackers can:
            * **Force key collisions:**  Craft different data inputs that result in the same cache key, allowing them to overwrite legitimate entries.
            * **Predict keys:**  Guess or calculate the keys for other users' data and inject malicious content.

## Attack Tree Path: [Utilizing an Insecure Default Storage Mechanism](./attack_tree_paths/utilizing_an_insecure_default_storage_mechanism.md)

This path relies on the `hyperoslo/cache` library having an insecure default storage mechanism that is not changed by the application developers.
        * If the default storage is weak (e.g., insecure local storage without proper permissions), attackers can potentially:
            * **Access cached data directly:**  Bypassing the application logic and retrieving sensitive information from the storage.
            * **Manipulate cached data at rest:**  Modifying the cached data directly in the storage, leading to cache poisoning.
