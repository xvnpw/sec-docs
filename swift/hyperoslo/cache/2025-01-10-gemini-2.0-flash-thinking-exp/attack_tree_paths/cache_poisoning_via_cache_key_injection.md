## Deep Analysis: Cache Poisoning via Cache Key Injection using hyperoslo/cache

This analysis delves into the attack tree path "Cache Poisoning via Cache Key Injection" within the context of an application utilizing the `hyperoslo/cache` library (or similar caching mechanisms where key generation is susceptible to user input).

**Understanding the Threat:**

Cache poisoning is a critical vulnerability that can have far-reaching consequences. By successfully poisoning the cache, an attacker can manipulate the data served to legitimate users, potentially leading to:

* **Data breaches:** Serving sensitive information intended for another user.
* **Account takeover:** Injecting malicious session identifiers or authentication tokens.
* **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** Injecting malicious JavaScript that executes in the user's browser.
* **Denial of service (DoS):** Filling the cache with useless data, forcing expensive re-computations or cache misses.
* **Business logic manipulation:** Altering prices, permissions, or other critical application data.

**Detailed Breakdown of the Attack Path:**

Let's break down each step of the provided attack path and analyze the potential vulnerabilities within an application using `hyperoslo/cache`.

**Step 1: The attacker manipulates input fields to craft specific cache keys.**

* **Vulnerability Point:** This step highlights a critical design flaw: **allowing user-controlled input to directly influence the composition of cache keys.**  If the application naively concatenates user-provided data (e.g., URL parameters, request headers, form fields) into the cache key without proper sanitization or validation, it becomes susceptible to this attack.

* **How it relates to `hyperoslo/cache`:**  The `hyperoslo/cache` library itself doesn't inherently introduce this vulnerability. The issue lies in **how the application *uses* the library.** If the application's logic for generating cache keys incorporates unsanitized user input, the attacker can manipulate this input to craft specific keys.

* **Example Scenarios:**
    * **URL Parameter Injection:**  Imagine a product page where the cache key is generated based on the product ID in the URL: `cache.get(req.params.productId)`. An attacker could craft a URL like `/products/123-malicious-payload` where "malicious-payload" is designed to create a specific cache key.
    * **Header Injection:** If the cache key includes a user-controlled header (e.g., a custom language header), an attacker can manipulate this header in their request to influence the key.
    * **Form Field Injection:**  In scenarios where form data contributes to the cache key, attackers can manipulate these fields to craft desired keys.

* **Attacker Techniques:**
    * **Simple String Manipulation:** Appending or prepending characters to influence the key.
    * **Special Characters:**  Using characters like spaces, hyphens, or other delimiters that might be used in key generation logic.
    * **Encoding Exploitation:**  Using URL encoding or other encoding techniques to bypass basic sanitization attempts.

**Step 2: They then submit a request with malicious data associated with a key that overlaps with or overwrites a legitimate cache entry.**

* **Action:** The attacker crafts a request containing malicious data. This data could be anything from a simple string containing an XSS payload to a complete HTML page redirecting the user to a phishing site. The crucial part is that this malicious data is associated with the crafted cache key from Step 1.

* **Impact on `hyperoslo/cache`:** When the application receives this malicious request, it will likely store the attacker's data in the cache under the crafted key using the `cache.set()` method. If this crafted key overlaps with a legitimate key used for storing valid data, the legitimate entry will be **overwritten** or a new entry with the malicious data will be created.

* **Example:**  Continuing the product ID example, the attacker might submit a request to `/products/123-malicious-payload` with a response body containing malicious JavaScript. If the application's caching logic uses `req.params.productId` to generate the key, the malicious data will be cached under the key "123-malicious-payload".

* **Race Conditions (Potential Complexity):** In some scenarios, attackers might exploit race conditions. If they can send their malicious request just before a legitimate request for the same data, they might be able to poison the cache before the legitimate data is stored.

**Step 3: Subsequent requests for the legitimate data will retrieve the attacker's malicious data from the cache.**

* **Consequence:** This is the core of the cache poisoning attack. When a legitimate user requests the resource associated with the now-poisoned cache key, the application will retrieve the attacker's malicious data from the cache instead of the correct data.

* **How `hyperoslo/cache` facilitates this:** The `cache.get()` method will simply retrieve the data associated with the requested key, regardless of whether it's legitimate or malicious. The library itself doesn't have built-in mechanisms to differentiate between poisoned and legitimate entries.

* **Example:** A legitimate user navigates to `/products/123`. If the cache is poisoned with malicious data under a key derived from "123" (due to the attacker's manipulation in Step 1 and 2), the user will receive the attacker's content instead of the actual product information.

**Specific Considerations for Applications Using `hyperoslo/cache`:**

* **Key Generation Logic:**  The primary focus should be on reviewing the application's code where cache keys are generated. Identify any instances where user input directly influences the key without proper sanitization or validation.
* **Cache Configuration:**  While `hyperoslo/cache` offers options for TTL (Time To Live), it doesn't inherently prevent key injection. Shorter TTLs can mitigate the impact by reducing the window of opportunity for the poisoned data to be served, but they don't address the root cause.
* **Lack of Built-in Sanitization:**  `hyperoslo/cache` is a simple caching library. It doesn't provide built-in functions for sanitizing or validating data used in cache keys. This responsibility falls entirely on the application developers.

**Potential Impacts and Exploitation Scenarios:**

* **XSS Injection:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code that executes in the victim's browser when they access the poisoned cache entry. This can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, and other malicious actions.
* **Redirection to Phishing Sites:** The attacker replaces the legitimate content with a fake login page or other phishing content, tricking users into revealing their credentials.
* **Information Disclosure:** The attacker injects data that reveals sensitive information intended for other users.
* **Denial of Service:** By repeatedly poisoning the cache with invalid or large amounts of data, the attacker can force cache misses and overload the backend servers.
* **Business Logic Errors:**  The attacker manipulates cached data to alter critical business logic, such as changing product prices or granting unauthorized access.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To prevent Cache Poisoning via Cache Key Injection, the development team should implement the following measures:

* **Robust Input Validation and Sanitization:**  **Never directly use unsanitized user input to construct cache keys.**  Implement strict validation rules to ensure that only expected and safe characters are used. Sanitize user input to remove or escape potentially harmful characters.
* **Secure Key Generation:**
    * **Avoid Direct User Input:** Minimize or eliminate the use of user-controlled data in cache key generation.
    * **Hashing and Salting:** Use cryptographic hash functions (e.g., SHA-256) to create unique and unpredictable keys based on a combination of static and dynamic elements. Include a salt to further enhance security.
    * **Namespaces or Prefixes:**  Use namespaces or prefixes in cache keys to isolate different types of cached data and prevent unintended overlaps. For example, prefix product data keys with "product-" and user data keys with "user-".
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to mitigate the impact of successful XSS attacks resulting from cache poisoning.
* **Regular Cache Invalidation:** Implement mechanisms to periodically invalidate cache entries or specific keys, reducing the lifespan of potentially poisoned data.
* **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on requests that could potentially be used for cache poisoning attempts.
* **Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Regularly audit the application's caching logic and conduct penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities.
* **Consider Alternative Caching Strategies:** Explore alternative caching mechanisms or configurations that offer better protection against key injection, if applicable.

**Code Examples (Illustrative - Conceptual):**

**Vulnerable Code (Illustrative):**

```javascript
const cache = require('hyperoslo/cache')();

app.get('/products/:productId', async (req, res) => {
  const productId = req.params.productId;
  const cacheKey = `product-${productId}`; // Directly using user input

  const cachedProduct = await cache.get(cacheKey);
  if (cachedProduct) {
    return res.send(cachedProduct);
  }

  const productData = await fetchProductFromDatabase(productId);
  await cache.set(cacheKey, productData, { ttl: 3600 });
  res.send(productData);
});
```

**Secure Code (Illustrative):**

```javascript
const cache = require('hyperoslo/cache')();

app.get('/products/:productId', async (req, res) => {
  const productId = parseInt(req.params.productId, 10); // Validate and sanitize

  if (isNaN(productId) || productId <= 0) {
    return res.status(400).send('Invalid product ID');
  }

  const cacheKey = `product-${productId}`; // Using the sanitized ID

  const cachedProduct = await cache.get(cacheKey);
  if (cachedProduct) {
    return res.send(cachedProduct);
  }

  const productData = await fetchProductFromDatabase(productId);
  await cache.set(cacheKey, productData, { ttl: 3600 });
  res.send(productData);
});
```

**Conclusion:**

Cache Poisoning via Cache Key Injection is a serious vulnerability that arises from insufficient control over how cache keys are generated. By allowing user input to directly influence key creation, applications become susceptible to attackers injecting malicious data into the cache. When using libraries like `hyperoslo/cache`, it is crucial to implement robust input validation, secure key generation practices, and other mitigation strategies to prevent this type of attack. A thorough understanding of the application's caching logic and potential attack vectors is essential for building secure and resilient systems.
