# Threat Model Analysis for hyperoslo/cache

## Threat: [Cache Poisoning](./threats/cache_poisoning.md)

**Description:** An attacker manages to insert malicious or incorrect data directly into the `hyperoslo/cache`. This could be achieved if there are vulnerabilities in how the application interacts with the `cache` library's `set` functionality or if the underlying storage mechanism of the cache is exposed and writable. When the application retrieves this poisoned data from the `cache`, it may act on it, leading to incorrect behavior or further security breaches.

**Impact:** Application malfunction, serving incorrect information to users, potential for privilege escalation or further attacks if the poisoned data is used in security-sensitive operations.

**Affected Component:** `cache` module's `set` function, the underlying storage mechanism used by `hyperoslo/cache`.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure in Cache](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_in_cache.md)

**Description:** Developers might inadvertently store sensitive information directly within the `hyperoslo/cache` without proper protection. An attacker gaining unauthorized access to the cache's storage (e.g., through a server vulnerability or by exploiting a weakness in how the cache data is persisted) could then access this sensitive data.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach, potential compliance violations (e.g., GDPR), reputational damage.

**Affected Component:** `cache` module's storage mechanism, potentially the `get` function if access controls are missing.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Cache Fill Attack (Denial of Service)](./threats/cache_fill_attack__denial_of_service_.md)

**Description:** An attacker floods the `hyperoslo/cache` with numerous unique requests, causing it to consume excessive resources (memory). This can lead to performance degradation or even a denial of service for legitimate users as the cache becomes overloaded and potentially evicts useful data. The vulnerability lies in the `cache` library's capacity to store and manage a large number of entries without proper safeguards.

**Impact:** Application slowdown, service unavailability, increased latency for legitimate users.

**Affected Component:** `cache` module's internal storage mechanism, potentially the eviction policy implementation within `hyperoslo/cache`.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion due to Unbounded Cache](./threats/resource_exhaustion_due_to_unbounded_cache.md)

**Description:** If the `hyperoslo/cache` is not configured with appropriate size limits or eviction policies, it could grow indefinitely, consuming all available memory and potentially crashing the application or the server. An attacker might exploit this by continuously triggering cache population without limits, directly overwhelming the `cache` library's storage.

**Impact:** Application crash, server instability, denial of service.

**Affected Component:** `cache` module's configuration options related to maximum size or eviction policies (or the lack thereof in the default implementation).

**Risk Severity:** High
