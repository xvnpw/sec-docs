# Attack Surface Analysis for hyperoslo/cache

## Attack Surface: [Cache Poisoning](./attack_surfaces/cache_poisoning.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious data into the cache, which is then served to other users as legitimate content.

**How Cache Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The cache stores the poisoned data, amplifying the impact by serving it to multiple users until the cache entry expires or is invalidated. Without the cache, the malicious data would only affect the initial request.

**Example:** An attacker finds a way to influence the data cached for a user profile. They inject malicious JavaScript. When other users view that profile, the script executes in their browsers (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS).

**Impact:** Can lead to XSS, redirection attacks, information disclosure, and other malicious activities affecting multiple users.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Input Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize all data *before* it is stored in the cache, especially data originating from user input or external sources.
* **Immutable Caching:** Where possible, cache immutable content that is not derived from user input.

## Attack Surface: [Cache Deception/Key Collision](./attack_surfaces/cache_deceptionkey_collision.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts cache keys that collide with or overwrite legitimate cache entries, allowing them to serve their own content or invalidate legitimate data.

**How Cache Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The cache relies on keys to identify and retrieve stored data. If key generation is flawed, attackers can exploit this mechanism.

**Example:** An application uses user-provided usernames to generate cache keys for user settings. An attacker crafts a username that, after the key generation process, results in the same key as an administrator's settings. The attacker can then manipulate the cached settings for the administrator.

**Impact:** Serving stale or incorrect data, unauthorized modification of data, potential denial of service by repeatedly overwriting cache entries.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Secure Key Generation:** Implement robust and unpredictable methods for generating cache keys, avoiding direct use of untrusted input. Use hashing algorithms or unique identifiers.
* **Namespaces/Prefixes:** Use namespaces or prefixes for cache keys to prevent collisions between different types of data or users.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Cache](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_cache.md)

**Description:** Sensitive information is stored in the cache without proper encryption or redaction, making it vulnerable if the cache is compromised.

**How Cache Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The cache becomes another location where sensitive data resides, increasing the potential attack surface.

**Example:**  User Personally Identifiable Information (PII) like social security numbers or credit card details are cached without encryption. If an attacker gains access to the cache storage, this sensitive data is exposed.

**Impact:**  Data breaches, privacy violations, regulatory penalties.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Avoid Caching Sensitive Data:**  Whenever possible, avoid caching sensitive data.
* **Encryption:** If sensitive data must be cached, encrypt it at rest and in transit.
* **Redaction:** Redact sensitive information before caching if the full data is not required.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Cache Storage](./attack_surfaces/insecure_cache_storage.md)

**Description:** The underlying storage mechanism for the cache has security vulnerabilities, allowing unauthorized access or manipulation of cached data.

**How Cache Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The cache relies on its storage backend. If the storage is insecure, the entire caching mechanism becomes vulnerable.

**Example:** The cache is configured to use a local file system with world-readable permissions. An attacker with access to the server can directly read and modify the cached files.

**Impact:**  Data breaches, cache poisoning, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Secure Cache Backend Configuration:**  Follow security best practices for the chosen caching store (e.g., strong authentication, access controls, network isolation).
* **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant the cache process only the necessary permissions to access the storage.
