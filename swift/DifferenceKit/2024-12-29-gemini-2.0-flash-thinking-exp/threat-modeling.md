*   **Threat:** Maliciously Crafted Input Collections Leading to Excessive Processing
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides specially crafted input collections (the "old" and "new" collections being compared) that exploit the algorithmic complexity of DifferenceKit's diffing process. This could involve creating collections with specific patterns or extremely large sizes that force the library to perform a significantly larger number of comparisons and operations than expected.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) by consuming excessive CPU and memory resources on the server or client device, leading to application slowdown or unresponsiveness.
    *   **Affected Component:** Core diffing algorithm (e.g., functions within the `ExtendedBalanced` or similar diffing strategies used by DifferenceKit).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Set reasonable limits on the size and complexity of the collections being diffed *before* passing them to DifferenceKit.
        *   Implement timeouts for diffing operations to prevent indefinite resource consumption.
        *   Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory) during diff operations and implement alerts for unusual spikes.

*   **Threat:** Data Corruption Through Exploitation of Diffing Logic Bugs
    *   **Description:** An attacker identifies a specific edge case or bug within DifferenceKit's diffing algorithm that, when triggered by carefully crafted input collections, results in incorrect or incomplete diff calculations. This could lead to the application applying incorrect updates to its data structures, causing data corruption or inconsistencies. The attacker might need to understand the internal workings of DifferenceKit to craft such inputs.
    *   **Impact:** Data integrity issues, incorrect application state, potential for further exploitation based on the corrupted data.
    *   **Affected Component:** Core diffing algorithm, specifically the logic that determines the insertions, deletions, moves, and updates between the two collections.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Stay updated with the latest stable version of DifferenceKit, as bug fixes are regularly released.
        *   Thoroughly test the application's data handling logic with a wide range of input data, including edge cases and potentially problematic scenarios.
        *   Consider using checksums or other data verification methods before and after diff operations.
