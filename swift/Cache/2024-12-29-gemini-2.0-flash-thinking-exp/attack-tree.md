## Threat Model for Application Using hyperoslo/Cache - High-Risk Sub-Tree

**Objective:** Compromise application using hyperoslo/Cache by exploiting weaknesses within the library.

**Attacker's Goal:** Gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, disrupt application functionality, or manipulate application behavior by exploiting vulnerabilities in the caching mechanism.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

*   Gain Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data
    *   HIGH-RISK PATH - Cache Poisoning to Inject Malicious Data
        *   CRITICAL - Exploit Insecure Deserialization (if applicable)
            *   Inject serialized malicious object into cache
        *   HIGH-RISK PATH - Inject Malicious Code/Scripts
            *   Inject code that will be executed when retrieved from cache
*   Manipulate Application Behavior
    *   HIGH-RISK PATH - Cache Poisoning to Influence Logic
        *   CRITICAL - Inject Data to Bypass Authentication/Authorization
            *   Overwrite user roles or permissions in the cache
        *   CRITICAL - Inject Data to Alter Business Logic
            *   Modify cached configuration settings or data used in calculations

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**1. Gain Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data -> Cache Poisoning to Inject Malicious Data -> Exploit Insecure Deserialization (if applicable):**

*   **Attack Vector:** Inject serialized malicious object into cache.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on application using serialization with cache).
*   **Impact:** High (Remote Code Execution, Data Breach).
*   **Effort:** Medium (Requires understanding of serialization format and vulnerabilities).
*   **Skill Level:** Medium-High.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Can be detected by monitoring for unusual serialized data or deserialization errors).

**2. Gain Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data -> Cache Poisoning to Inject Malicious Data -> Inject Malicious Code/Scripts:**

*   **Attack Vector:** Inject code that will be executed when retrieved from cache.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on application rendering cached data without sanitization).
*   **Impact:** High (Cross-Site Scripting, Session Hijacking).
*   **Effort:** Low-Medium (Requires basic understanding of web technologies and scripting).
*   **Skill Level:** Low-Medium.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Can be detected by monitoring for suspicious script tags in cached data or unusual client-side behavior).

**3. Manipulate Application Behavior -> Cache Poisoning to Influence Logic -> Inject Data to Bypass Authentication/Authorization:**

*   **Attack Vector:** Overwrite user roles or permissions in the cache.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (Should not be solely reliant on cache for auth/auth).
*   **Impact:** High (Unauthorized access to sensitive resources and actions).
*   **Effort:** Medium-High (Requires understanding of authentication/authorization logic and cache keys).
*   **Skill Level:** Medium-High.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** High (Difficult to detect without specific monitoring of authentication/authorization flows).

**4. Manipulate Application Behavior -> Cache Poisoning to Influence Logic -> Inject Data to Alter Business Logic:**

*   **Attack Vector:** Modify cached configuration settings or data used in calculations.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (If business logic relies heavily on cached data without validation).
*   **Impact:** Medium-High (Incorrect calculations, flawed decisions, financial impact).
*   **Effort:** Medium (Requires understanding of business logic and relevant cache keys).
*   **Skill Level:** Medium.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Can be detected by monitoring for anomalies in business processes or data).
