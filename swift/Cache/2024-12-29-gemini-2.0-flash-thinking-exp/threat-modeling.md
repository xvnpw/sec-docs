### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving hyperoslo/Cache

Here's a list of high and critical severity threats that directly involve the `hyperoslo/Cache` library:

* **Threat:** Cache Poisoning
    * **Description:** An attacker injects malicious or incorrect data into the cache managed by `hyperoslo/Cache`. This could occur if the application doesn't properly sanitize data before storing it using `Cache`'s `set` method, or if there are vulnerabilities in the data source being cached that are then propagated through the cache. An attacker might also try to exploit weaknesses in how cache keys are generated if the application relies on that.
    * **Impact:** The application serves the poisoned data retrieved via `Cache`'s `get` method to users, leading to incorrect application behavior, display of false information, potential execution of malicious scripts (if the cached data is used in a context where it can be interpreted as code), or redirection to malicious sites.
    * **Affected Component:** `Cache`'s `set` method, `Cache`'s `get` method, potentially key generation if application-defined.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement robust input validation and sanitization on data *before* it is stored in the cache using `Cache`'s `set` method.
        * Secure the source of data being cached to prevent unauthorized modification before it reaches `Cache`.
        * If the application defines cache keys, ensure they are strong, unpredictable, and non-sequential.
        * Implement integrity checks on cached data after retrieval using `Cache`'s `get` method.

* **Threat:** Sensitive Data Exposure in Cache
    * **Description:** The application stores sensitive information within the cache managed by `hyperoslo/Cache` without proper encryption or access controls. An attacker gaining unauthorized access to the underlying cache storage (whether in-memory or a persistent backend if configured) can directly read this sensitive data. This is a direct consequence of how `hyperoslo/Cache` stores the data provided to its `set` method.
    * **Impact:** Confidentiality of sensitive data is compromised, potentially leading to identity theft, financial loss, reputational damage, and legal repercussions.
    * **Affected Component:** `Cache`'s `set` method, the underlying cache storage mechanism used by `Cache`.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid caching sensitive data using `hyperoslo/Cache` if possible.
        * Encrypt sensitive data *before* storing it in the cache using `Cache`'s `set` method. The encryption should happen at the application level, as `hyperoslo/Cache` doesn't provide built-in encryption.
        * Secure the underlying cache storage with appropriate access controls and permissions, ensuring only authorized processes can access the cache data.
