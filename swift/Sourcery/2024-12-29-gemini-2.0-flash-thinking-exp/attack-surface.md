* **Malicious or Crafted Input Files**
    * **Description:** An attacker provides specially crafted or malicious Swift source code files as input to Sourcery.
    * **How Sourcery Contributes:** Sourcery's core function is to parse and analyze Swift code. Vulnerabilities in its parsing logic can be exploited by malicious input.
    * **Example:** A developer unknowingly includes a file from an untrusted source containing Swift code designed to trigger a buffer overflow or code injection vulnerability within Sourcery's parsing engine.
    * **Impact:** Could lead to arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine or the build server running Sourcery, potentially compromising the development environment or injecting malicious code into the generated output.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Only process source code from trusted and verified sources.
        * Implement strict input validation and sanitization (though this is challenging with code).
        * Run Sourcery in a sandboxed or isolated environment to limit the impact of potential exploits.
        * Regularly update Sourcery to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.

* **Dependency Vulnerabilities**
    * **Description:** Sourcery relies on external Swift packages or libraries that contain security vulnerabilities.
    * **How Sourcery Contributes:** By depending on these libraries, Sourcery inherits their potential vulnerabilities, which could be exploited during its execution.
    * **Example:** Sourcery uses a templating library with a known vulnerability that allows for remote code execution if a malicious template is processed.
    * **Impact:**  Could lead to arbitrary code execution on the machine running Sourcery, potentially compromising the development environment or the generated code.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Utilize dependency management tools (like Swift Package Manager) to track Sourcery's dependencies and regularly update them.
        * Consider using vulnerability scanning tools on the project's dependencies to identify and address known vulnerabilities.
        * Evaluate the security posture of Sourcery's dependencies before integrating it.

* **Configuration File Manipulation**
    * **Description:** An attacker gains the ability to modify Sourcery's configuration files (e.g., `.sourcery.yml`).
    * **How Sourcery Contributes:** Sourcery uses configuration files to determine input sources, output destinations, and template paths. Modifying these can redirect its behavior.
    * **Example:** An attacker modifies the configuration to point Sourcery to a malicious template file hosted on an external server, which then executes arbitrary code when processed.
    * **Impact:** Could lead to arbitrary code execution, information disclosure (by redirecting output), or denial of service (by pointing to non-existent resources).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Secure access to the project's repository and development environment to prevent unauthorized modification of configuration files.
        * Implement code review processes for changes to Sourcery's configuration.
        * Store configuration files securely and consider using version control to track changes.

* **Template Injection Vulnerabilities**
    * **Description:**  Vulnerabilities exist within the code generation templates used by Sourcery, allowing for the injection of malicious code.
    * **How Sourcery Contributes:** Sourcery uses templating engines to generate code based on the parsed Swift code. If templates are not carefully written, they can be exploited.
    * **Example:** A template uses user-controlled input (e.g., from a comment in the source code) without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject code that gets executed during the generation process.
    * **Impact:** Could lead to arbitrary code execution during the code generation phase, potentially injecting malicious code into the final application.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Carefully review and sanitize all template code used by Sourcery.
        * Avoid using user-controlled input directly within templates without proper encoding or escaping.
        * Follow secure coding practices when developing and maintaining Sourcery templates.

* **Sourcery Executable Compromise**
    * **Description:** The Sourcery executable itself is compromised, potentially through a supply chain attack or a compromised download source.
    * **How Sourcery Contributes:** If the core executable is malicious, any operation performed by it is inherently untrusted.
    * **Example:** An attacker compromises the official Sourcery release channel and replaces the legitimate executable with a backdoored version.
    * **Impact:**  Running the compromised executable could lead to complete compromise of the development machine or build server.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Download Sourcery from official and trusted sources only.
        * Verify the integrity of the downloaded executable using checksums or digital signatures.
        * Consider using package managers with integrity verification features.

* **Plugin/Extension Vulnerabilities (If Applicable)**
    * **Description:** If Sourcery supports plugins or extensions, vulnerabilities within these extensions can be exploited.
    * **How Sourcery Contributes:** By providing an extensibility mechanism, Sourcery introduces the attack surface of its plugins.
    * **Example:** A malicious plugin is installed that intercepts and exfiltrates source code or injects malicious code during the generation process.
    * **Impact:** Could lead to arbitrary code execution, information disclosure, or code injection.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Only install plugins from trusted and verified sources.
        * Review the code of plugins before installation if possible.
        * Keep plugins updated to benefit from security patches.
        * Limit the permissions granted to plugins.
