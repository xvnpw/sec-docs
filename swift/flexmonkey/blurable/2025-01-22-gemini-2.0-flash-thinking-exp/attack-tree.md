## Attack Tree Path: [1. Input Manipulation Attacks (Malicious Image URL) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH - SSRF & Large Image]:](./attack_tree_paths/1__input_manipulation_attacks__malicious_image_url___critical_node___high-risk_path_-_ssrf_&_large_i_2672b1cd.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **1.1. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via URL (If Application fetches image server-side) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Description:** If the application fetches the image from the provided URL on the server-side before client-side blurring, an attacker can exploit this to perform SSRF.
        *   **Action:** Provide a malicious URL as input that targets:
            *   Internal services within the application's infrastructure.
            *   Cloud metadata services (e.g., AWS metadata endpoint).
            *   External malicious servers.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Access to internal resources, data exfiltration, further attacks on internal systems.
    *   **1.3. Large Image/DoS (Client-Side) [HIGH-RISK PATH - DoS]:**
        *   **Description:** Providing a URL to an extremely large image file can cause client-side Denial of Service.
        *   **Action:** Provide a URL pointing to a very large image file.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Client-side DoS, browser tab crash, temporary disruption for the user.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Resource Exhaustion Attacks (Client-Side DoS) [HIGH-RISK PATH - DoS]:](./attack_tree_paths/2__resource_exhaustion_attacks__client-side_dos___high-risk_path_-_dos_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **2.1. CPU/Memory Exhaustion via Repeated Blurring [HIGH-RISK PATH - DoS]:**
        *   **Description:** Repeatedly triggering the blurring function with large images or high blur radius can exhaust client resources.
        *   **Action:** Repeatedly interact with the application to trigger blurring, potentially through automation.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Client-side DoS, browser tab unresponsiveness, temporary disruption for the user.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Client-Side Vulnerabilities due to Blurable Usage (Indirect) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH - XSS]:](./attack_tree_paths/3__client-side_vulnerabilities_due_to_blurable_usage__indirect___critical_node___high-risk_path_-_xs_8b5fa3f0.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **3.1. Context-Dependent XSS via Unsafe Handling of Blurable Output (Application-Side Issue) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH - XSS]:**
        *   **Description:** If the application incorrectly handles or displays the input URL or related data without sanitization, it can lead to XSS.
        *   **Action:** Provide a malicious URL (containing JavaScript code) as input.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Full client-side compromise, session hijacking, data theft, defacement.
