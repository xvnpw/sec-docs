# Threat Model Analysis for flexmonkey/blurable

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  `blurable.js` itself might contain security vulnerabilities in its code. If such vulnerabilities exist and are exploitable, an attacker could leverage them to inject malicious scripts or perform other harmful actions within the user's browser. This would require the attacker to find a way to trigger the vulnerable code path in `blurable.js` through the application.
*   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if the vulnerability allows for code injection. This can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious websites, defacement of the application, or other malicious actions performed in the context of the user's browser and the application's domain.
*   **Affected Component:** `blurable.js` library code, specifically any vulnerable functions or modules within it.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (if XSS is possible)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Immediately update `blurable.js` to the latest version** as soon as updates are released. This is crucial for patching any known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Continuously monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases** specifically for `blurable.js`. Stay informed about any reported security issues.
    *   **Utilize Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools** in your development pipeline to automatically scan your project for dependencies with known vulnerabilities, including `blurable.js`.
    *   **Consider performing security code reviews of `blurable.js`** (if feasible and resources allow) to proactively identify potential security flaws before they are publicly disclosed.

## Threat: [Misuse of Blurring for Security (False Sense of Security)](./threats/misuse_of_blurring_for_security__false_sense_of_security_.md)

*   **Description:** Developers might incorrectly assume that using `blurable.js` to blur sensitive information on the client-side provides a robust security measure. An attacker who understands the limitations of client-side blurring can attempt to reverse or bypass the blurring effect to reveal the underlying sensitive data. This could be done through various client-side techniques, such as inspecting the DOM, manipulating CSS filters, or using browser developer tools to access the original image.
*   **Impact:** Disclosure of sensitive information that was intended to be protected by blurring. This could include personal data, financial details, confidential documents, or any other information that should not be exposed to unauthorized users.
*   **Affected Component:** Application's security architecture and implementation, specifically the decision to use `blurable.js` for security purposes.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (if sensitive information is exposed due to reliance on blurring)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Absolutely avoid relying on client-side blurring, including `blurable.js`, for security redaction of sensitive information.** Client-side blurring is not a security control.
    *   **Implement robust server-side security measures for handling sensitive data.** This includes server-side redaction, access control, and secure data storage.
    *   **Clearly document and communicate to the development team that `blurable.js` is intended for visual effects only and is not a security mechanism.** Emphasize the risks of using it for security purposes.
    *   **Conduct security awareness training for developers** to educate them about the limitations of client-side security and the importance of server-side security controls for sensitive data.
