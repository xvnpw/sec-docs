# Attack Surface Analysis for flexmonkey/blurable

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side Denial of Service (DoS) via Malicious Image Input](./attack_surfaces/client-side_denial_of_service__dos__via_malicious_image_input.md)

*   **Description:**  A specially crafted image, when processed by `blurable`, can consume excessive client-side resources (CPU, memory), leading to browser unresponsiveness or crash. This is due to `blurable` relying on browser's image processing and Canvas API, which can be vulnerable to resource exhaustion when handling maliciously crafted images.
*   **How Blurable Contributes:** `blurable` directly processes image data using the browser's Canvas API to apply blur effects.  Malicious images can exploit vulnerabilities or inefficiencies in the browser's image decoding or Canvas API *during* `blurable`'s processing, causing resource exhaustion specifically when used with this library.
*   **Example:** A user provides a URL to a highly complex PNG image. When `blurable` attempts to blur this image using the Canvas API, the browser's decoding and rendering process, triggered by `blurable`, becomes extremely resource-intensive, freezing the user's browser tab or the entire browser application.
*   **Impact:** Client-side Denial of Service. Users experience browser crashes or freezes, making the application unusable.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
        *   **Image Size Limits:** Implement strict client-side and server-side limits on image file size and dimensions *before* processing with `blurable`.
        *   **File Type Validation:** Restrict allowed image file types to a safe subset and validate file types based on content, not just extension, before passing to `blurable`.
    *   **Resource Management:**
        *   **Throttling/Debouncing:** If blurring is user-triggered, limit the frequency of `blurable` operations to prevent rapid, resource-exhausting calls.
        *   **Server-Side Processing (Alternative):** For critical applications, consider server-side blurring to offload processing and apply more robust resource controls *before* sending images to the client and `blurable`.

## Attack Surface: [Bypass of Intended Blurring (Logical/Functional Vulnerability)](./attack_surfaces/bypass_of_intended_blurring__logicalfunctional_vulnerability_.md)

*   **Description:**  The blurring algorithm implemented by `blurable`, or its specific configuration, might be insufficient to effectively obscure sensitive information. This can lead to a bypass of the intended security function if blurring is used for redaction purposes. This is a vulnerability inherent in the chosen blurring method within `blurable` if it's not robust enough for security-sensitive redaction.
*   **How Blurable Contributes:** `blurable` provides a specific blurring algorithm. If this algorithm is not strong enough, or if default parameters are weak, it directly contributes to the risk of blurring being bypassed. The library's choice of blurring technique and its default settings are key factors in this attack surface.
*   **Example:** An application uses `blurable` to blur potentially sensitive text in images. However, the default blur radius in `blurable` is too low. An attacker uses image enhancement techniques or deblurring algorithms to partially or fully recover the original text from the blurred image, bypassing the intended redaction provided by `blurable`.
*   **Impact:** Information Disclosure. Sensitive information intended to be protected by `blurable`'s blurring can be revealed, leading to privacy breaches or security incidents.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Stronger Blurring Techniques:**
        *   **Increase Blur Radius (Configuration):**  Configure `blurable` with a significantly higher blur radius to maximize obscuration. Test different radii to find a secure level.
        *   **Evaluate Blurring Algorithm:**  Thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of `blurable`'s blurring algorithm for the specific redaction needs. Consider if it's robust enough against deblurring attempts.
        *   **Pixelation or Masking (Alternatives):** For critical redaction, strongly consider using pixelation or solid masking *instead* of blurring provided by `blurable`, as these are generally more secure against information recovery.
    *   **Server-Side Redaction (Recommended):** Perform sensitive data redaction server-side using robust techniques *before* images are processed by `blurable` client-side or displayed to users. This removes reliance on client-side blurring for security.
    *   **Security Audits and Testing:** Conduct security assessments specifically focused on evaluating the effectiveness of `blurable`'s blurring for redaction and test for potential bypasses. Do not solely rely on visual inspection.
