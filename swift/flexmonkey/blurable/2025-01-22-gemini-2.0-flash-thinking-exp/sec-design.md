#### 4.2. Data Flow Description (Enhanced with Security Notes)

1.  **Upload Request (Media File: Image/Video):** The user initiates media upload via the Client Application. The media file (image or video) is sent to the API Gateway over HTTPS. **Security Note:** HTTPS ensures confidentiality and integrity of the media file during transmission.
2.  **Forward Upload Request:** The API Gateway routes the upload request to the Upload Service.
3.  **Store Media (Media File):** The Upload Service validates the media, generates a unique ID, and securely stores the original media file in Object Storage (S3). **Security Note:** S3 encryption at rest protects the stored media. Access to S3 is controlled by IAM roles.
4.  **Enqueue Processing Job (Message: File ID):** The Upload Service enqueues a message containing the unique file ID into the Processing Queue (SQS). **Security Note:** SQS access is restricted to authorized services. Message encryption can be enabled if needed.
5.  **Processing Job Message (Message: File ID):** The Face Detection Service retrieves a processing job message from the Processing Queue.
6.  **Retrieve Media (Media File):** The Face Detection Service retrieves the original media file from Object Storage (S3) using the file ID from the message. **Security Note:** Access to S3 is controlled by IAM roles, ensuring only the Face Detection Service can access the media.
7.  **Detect Faces (Media File):** The Face Detection Service sends the media file to the chosen Face Detection API (e.g., Rekognition) for face detection. **Security Note:** Data privacy considerations apply when sending media to a third-party API. Ensure compliance with API provider's terms and data processing agreements. Minimize data sent if possible.
8.  **Face Detection Results (JSON: Bounding Boxes):** The Face Detection API returns face detection results, typically in JSON format, including bounding box coordinates for detected faces. **Security Note:** API responses should be parsed securely to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
9.  **Pass Results & Media (Media File, JSON: Bounding Boxes):** The Face Detection Service passes the original media file and the face detection results (bounding boxes) to the Blurring Service.
10. **Retrieve Media (Media File):** The Blurring Service retrieves the original media file from Object Storage (S3). (If not already passed from the Face Detection Service).
11. **Apply Blur (Media File, JSON: Bounding Boxes):** The Blurring Service applies the blurring algorithm to the face regions in the media file based on the bounding box coordinates.
12. **Store Anonymized Media (Anonymized Media File):** The Blurring Service stores the anonymized media file back into Object Storage (S3). **Security Note:** Ensure the anonymized media is stored securely in S3, potentially in a separate location or with different access controls than the original media.
13. **Processing Complete (Notification) & 14. Status Confirmation (Optional):** (Optional) The Blurring Service might send a notification upon completion.
14. **Processing ID Response (Processing ID):** The Upload Service sends a response back to the Client Application via the API Gateway, including the processing ID.
15. **Download Request (Processing ID):** The user initiates a download request through the Client Application, using the processing ID. This request is sent to the API Gateway.
16. **Forward Download Request:** The API Gateway routes the download request to the Download Service.
17. **Retrieve Anonymized Media (Anonymized Media File):** The Download Service retrieves the anonymized media file from Object Storage (S3). **Security Note:** Access to S3 is controlled by IAM roles.
18. **Generate Download URL/Serve File (Pre-signed URL or Anonymized Media File):** The Download Service generates a pre-signed URL for secure download or streams the file content. **Security Note:** Pre-signed URLs should be time-limited and scoped to the specific file.
19. **Download Response (Pre-signed URL or Anonymized Media File):** The API Gateway sends the download response (pre-signed URL or file content) back to the Client Application. **Security Note:** Ensure download links are served over HTTPS.

*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** AWS CDK will be used to define and deploy the entire infrastructure, including API Gateway, Lambda functions, SQS queue, S3 buckets, and IAM roles. This ensures repeatable and consistent deployments.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline (Recommended):** Implement a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild) to automate the build, test, and deployment process.
*   **Publicly Accessible Frontend:** The Client Application (web frontend) will be deployed to a static website hosting service (e.g., AWS S3 or AWS CloudFront) and made publicly accessible via a domain name. API Gateway will also be publicly accessible.

#### 6.2. Environment Details

*   **Environments:** Recommended to have at least two environments:
    *   **Development/Staging:** For development, testing, and staging before production release.
    *   **Production:** For the live, user-facing Blurable service.
*   **Region:** Choose an AWS region based on target user location, data residency requirements, and service availability. Consider regions with AWS Rekognition service availability.
*   **Scalability and Resiliency:** Serverless architecture inherently provides automatic scalability. AWS Lambda, API Gateway, SQS, and S3 will automatically scale based on demand. AWS managed services are designed for high availability and fault tolerance.
*   **Monitoring and Logging:** AWS CloudWatch Logs will be used for logging from Lambda functions and API Gateway. CloudWatch Metrics can be used for monitoring performance and error rates. Basic dashboards can be created in CloudWatch.
*   **Disaster Recovery (Basic):** Leverage AWS S3's data durability and redundancy. For critical components, consider multi-AZ deployments if applicable and implement backup and recovery procedures for configuration and code.

### 7. Security Considerations (Comprehensive)

#### 7.1. Confidentiality

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized access to user-uploaded media, anonymized media, and intermediate processing data.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Encryption at Rest:** Enable server-side encryption for all S3 buckets storing media and data. Use KMS managed keys for enhanced control.
    *   **Encryption in Transit:** Enforce HTTPS for all communication channels: Client-API Gateway, API Gateway-Backend Services, Backend Services-S3, and communication with external Face Detection API.
    *   **Access Control (IAM):** Implement strict IAM roles and policies for all serverless functions and API Gateway to ensure least privilege access to S3 buckets, SQS queues, and other AWS resources.
    *   **Secure API Key Management:** Securely store and manage API keys for the Face Detection API using AWS Secrets Manager or environment variables with appropriate access controls.
    *   **Data Minimization:** Minimize the amount of data stored and retained. Implement lifecycle policies to automatically delete temporary files and anonymized media after a reasonable download period.

#### 7.2. Integrity

*   **Threat:** Tampering with user-uploaded media, anonymized media, or processing logic. Data corruption or unauthorized modification.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **HTTPS:** Use HTTPS for all communication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks and ensure data integrity during transmission.
    *   **Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation at all layers (client-side and backend) to prevent injection attacks and ensure data conforms to expected formats.
    *   **Immutable Infrastructure (IaC):** Use Infrastructure-as-Code (AWS CDK) to define and deploy infrastructure in a repeatable and immutable manner, reducing the risk of configuration drift and unauthorized changes.
    *   **Code Reviews and Security Testing:** Conduct regular code reviews and security testing (static and dynamic analysis) to identify and fix potential vulnerabilities in the application code and infrastructure configuration.
    *   **Logging and Auditing:** Implement comprehensive logging of all critical operations (uploads, processing, downloads, access attempts) for auditing and incident response.

#### 7.3. Availability

*   **Threat:** Service disruption, Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, system failures leading to unavailability of the Blurable service.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Serverless Architecture:** Leverage the inherent scalability and high availability of serverless services (AWS Lambda, API Gateway, SQS, S3).
    *   **Rate Limiting and Throttling:** Configure rate limiting and throttling at the API Gateway to protect backend services from DoS attacks and abuse.
    *   **Fault Tolerance:** Design backend services to be stateless and fault-tolerant. Utilize message queues (SQS) for asynchronous processing and retries in case of transient failures.
    *   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement monitoring of service health, performance metrics, and error rates using AWS CloudWatch. Set up alerts to notify administrators of potential issues and service disruptions.
    *   **Disaster Recovery Planning:** Define basic disaster recovery procedures, including data backup and recovery strategies for configuration and code. Leverage S3's data durability and redundancy.

#### 7.4. Authentication and Authorization (Future Enhancement)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized access to administrative functions or user data (if user accounts are implemented in the future).
*   **Mitigation (Future):**
    *   **API Key Authentication:** Implement API key authentication for the API Gateway to control access to backend API endpoints.
    *   **User Authentication (OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect):** Integrate a user authentication system (e.g., using OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect) for the web application to identify and authenticate users if user accounts are added.
    *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement RBAC to control access to specific functionalities and data based on user roles or permissions.
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Consider enabling MFA for administrative accounts and potentially for user accounts for enhanced security.

#### 7.5. Data Privacy and Compliance

*   **Threat:** Violation of data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and user privacy expectations.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Privacy by Design:** Implement privacy by design principles throughout the system development lifecycle.
    *   **Data Minimization:** Minimize the collection and retention of personal data. Only store necessary data for processing and service operation.
    *   **Transparency and User Consent:** Provide clear privacy policies and terms of service to users, explaining data processing practices. Obtain user consent where required.
