# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for flexmonkey/blurable

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation and Sanitization (as it pertains to `blurable`)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation_and_sanitization__as_it_pertains_to__blurable__.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Supported Formats:** Determine which image formats `blurable` *actually* supports. This might require examining the library's source code or documentation.
    2.  **Implement Format Verification:** Before passing any image data to `blurable`, verify that the image format is among those supported by the library. Use a robust method (e.g., parsing the image header) to confirm the format, not just file extensions.
    3.  **Set Dimension Limits:** Determine the maximum image dimensions that `blurable` can handle efficiently without causing performance issues or crashes. This might involve testing with various image sizes.  Reject any image exceeding these limits *before* calling `blurable`.
    4. **Implement Rejection Mechanism:** If an image is rejected (invalid format or excessive dimensions), ensure that the rejection occurs *before* any interaction with `blurable`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Image Exploits (Severity: High):**  If `blurable` has vulnerabilities in its image parsing, passing a malformed image could trigger them.  Pre-validation prevents this.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Large Images (Severity: Medium):**  `blurable` might be inefficient or crash when processing extremely large images.  Pre-validation of dimensions prevents this.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Severity: Medium):** Similar to DoS.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Image Exploits:** Risk reduction: Very High.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Risk reduction: High.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk reduction: High.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Format validation using `CGImageSource` (iOS) in `ImageValidator.swift`.
    *   Dimension limits checked in `UploadService.java` before processing.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Verification that the format validation logic *specifically* aligns with the formats supported by `blurable`.
    *   Dimension limits might need adjustment based on `blurable`'s specific limitations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Consumption Limits (focused on `blurable`'s processing)](./mitigation_strategies/resource_consumption_limits__focused_on__blurable_'s_processing_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Set Timeouts:**  *Specifically* when calling `blurable`'s blurring functions, set a strict timeout. This timeout should be based on the expected processing time for the *largest allowed image size* and the *most computationally intensive blur settings*.
    2.  **Implement Timeout Handling:**  If the timeout is reached while `blurable` is processing, ensure that the operation is *immediately* terminated and any resources held by `blurable` are released. This might involve platform-specific mechanisms to interrupt the blurring process.
    3. **Create Blurring Queue and Configure Concurrency:** Use a queue to manage calls to `blurable`. Limit the number of *concurrent* calls to `blurable` to prevent resource exhaustion. This is crucial if `blurable` is not thread-safe or if it consumes significant resources.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Long-Running Operations (Severity: Medium):**  `blurable` might have performance bottlenecks or vulnerabilities that could be exploited to cause long processing times.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Severity: Medium):**  Even without a full DoS, excessive resource consumption by `blurable` can impact the application.
    *   **Application Unresponsiveness (Severity: Medium):**

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Risk reduction: High.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk reduction: High.
    *   **Application Unresponsiveness:** Risk reduction: High.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic timeout (10 seconds) implemented in `BlurService.swift`.
    *   A simple `DispatchQueue` is used, but without concurrency limits.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   The timeout value needs to be specifically tuned based on `blurable`'s performance characteristics.
    *   Strict concurrency limits on the `DispatchQueue` are missing, specifically for calls to `blurable`.
    *   Robust handling of `blurable` termination on timeout.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Preventing Information Leakage Through Blurring (controlling `blurable`'s parameters)](./mitigation_strategies/preventing_information_leakage_through_blurring__controlling__blurable_'s_parameters_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Blurring Profiles:**  Instead of allowing arbitrary adjustment of `blurable`'s parameters (e.g., radius, blur type), create a set of predefined blurring profiles.  Each profile should have *fixed* parameter values that are passed to `blurable`.
    2.  **Restrict User Input:**  The application's user interface should *only* allow users to select from these predefined profiles.  Do *not* expose `blurable`'s raw parameters directly to the user.
    3. **Audit Blurring Results:** Ensure that the parameters passed to `blurable` consistently produce the intended level of blurring and do not inadvertently reveal information.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure via Differential Blurring (Severity: Medium):**  Allowing users to control `blurable`'s parameters directly could lead to inconsistent blurring that reveals information.
    *   **Inadvertent Information Leakage (Severity: Low/Medium):**

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduction: High.
    *   **Inadvertent Information Leakage:** Risk reduction: High.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   No predefined blurring profiles. Users can adjust the blur radius freely, directly affecting the parameter passed to `blurable`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Complete redesign of the blurring interface to use predefined profiles, controlling the values passed to `blurable`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Parameter Sanitization and Validation (for `blurable`'s input)](./mitigation_strategies/parameter_sanitization_and_validation__for__blurable_'s_input_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Parameters:**  Identify *all* parameters that the application passes to `blurable`.
    2.  **Define Allowed Values:**  For each parameter, define the allowed range of values or a whitelist of specific values.  This should be based on `blurable`'s documentation and expected behavior.
    3.  **Implement Validation:**  *Before* calling any `blurable` function, validate all parameters against the allowed values.  Use strict type checking.
    4.  **Reject Invalid Parameters:**  If any parameter is invalid, reject the entire operation *before* calling `blurable`.  Do not attempt to modify the parameter.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Filter Manipulation Attacks (Severity: Medium):**  Passing unexpected or extreme values to `blurable`'s parameters could cause crashes, unexpected behavior, or potentially exploit vulnerabilities.
    *   **Unexpected Behavior (Severity: Low):**

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Filter Manipulation Attacks:** Risk reduction: High.
    *   **Unexpected Behavior:** Risk reduction: High.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic range check for blur radius in `BlurSettingsViewController.swift`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive validation for *all* parameters passed to `blurable`.
    *   Stricter type checking.
    *   Use of whitelists where appropriate.
    *   Centralized validation logic to ensure consistency.
