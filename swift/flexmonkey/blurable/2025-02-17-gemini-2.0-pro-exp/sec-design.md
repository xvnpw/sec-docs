Okay, let's create a design document for the `blurable` project.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a simple, easy-to-use, and performant way to apply a blur effect to images in web applications.
*   Offer a lightweight solution that minimizes external dependencies.
*   Support a range of blur intensity levels.
*   Ensure cross-browser compatibility.
*   Provide a solution that can be easily integrated into existing projects.
*   Open-source the project to foster community contributions and transparency.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Performance bottlenecks: Inefficient blurring algorithms could lead to slow image processing and a poor user experience, especially on lower-powered devices or with large images.
*   Compatibility issues: Lack of support for certain image formats or browser inconsistencies could limit the project's usability.
*   Security vulnerabilities: While seemingly simple, image processing can introduce vulnerabilities if not handled carefully (e.g., buffer overflows, denial-of-service).
*   Maintainability: Poor code quality or lack of documentation could make it difficult to maintain and extend the project in the future.
*   Lack of adoption: If the project is not perceived as useful or easy to integrate, it may not gain traction.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Input validation: The code checks if the provided `src` is a string and if `radius` is a number. (index.js)
*   security control: Limited scope: The library focuses solely on blurring and doesn't handle image uploading, storage, or other potentially risky operations. (Project scope)
*   security control: No external dependencies: Reduces the risk of supply chain attacks. (package.json)
*   security control: Use of `OffscreenCanvas` where available: Improves performance and potentially reduces the attack surface by offloading work to a separate context. (index.js)
*   security control: MIT License: Permissive license that encourages scrutiny and contributions.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: The library assumes the input image data is trustworthy. It does not perform any sanitization or validation of the image content itself.
*   accepted risk: The library does not implement any specific countermeasures against denial-of-service attacks that might be triggered by excessively large images or blur radii.
*   accepted risk: The library does not currently have comprehensive security testing (e.g., fuzzing) in place.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement a maximum image size and/or blur radius limit to mitigate potential denial-of-service risks.
*   security control: Add fuzzing tests to the test suite to identify potential vulnerabilities related to image processing.
*   security control: Consider adding a Content Security Policy (CSP) if the library is used in a context where it can be controlled.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication: Not applicable (N/A) - This library does not handle authentication.
*   Authorization: N/A - This library does not handle authorization.
*   Input Validation:
    *   The `src` parameter must be a valid string representing a URL or a data URI.
    *   The `radius` parameter must be a non-negative number.
    *   Implement maximum limits for image dimensions and blur radius.
*   Cryptography: N/A - This library does not directly use cryptography.
*   Output Encoding: N/A - The library outputs a canvas element, not encoded text.

## BUILD

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer["Developer"] -- "Writes Code" --> SourceCode["Source Code (GitHub)"]
    SourceCode -- "Triggered by Push/PR" --> CI["CI (GitHub Actions)"]
    CI -- "Runs Tests" --> Tests["Tests (Jest)"]
    CI -- "Builds" --> Build["Build (Rollup)"]
    Build -- "Produces" --> Artifact["Artifact (blurable.min.js)"]
    CI -- "Publishes" --> NPMPublish["NPM Publish"]
    NPMPublish -- "Deploys to" --> NPMRegistry["NPM Registry"]

```

Build Process Description:

1.  **Development:** Developers write code and push changes to the GitHub repository.
2.  **Continuous Integration (CI):** GitHub Actions is used as the CI system.  A push or pull request to the repository triggers the CI workflow.
3.  **Testing:** The CI workflow runs the test suite using Jest. This ensures that the code functions as expected and helps prevent regressions.
4.  **Building:**  Rollup is used to bundle the code into a minified JavaScript file (`blurable.min.js`). This creates the distributable artifact.
5.  **Publishing:**  If the tests pass and the build is successful, the CI workflow publishes the package to the NPM registry.

Security Controls:

*   security control: **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automates the build and testing process, ensuring consistency and reducing the risk of manual errors. (GitHub Actions)
*   security control: **Automated Testing:**  The test suite (Jest) helps catch bugs and vulnerabilities early in the development process.
*   security control: **Dependency Management:** NPM is used to manage dependencies, and the `package-lock.json` file ensures consistent builds.
*   security control: **Code Review:** Pull requests require review before merging, providing an opportunity for security checks. (GitHub)
*   security control: **NPM Registry Security:**  Relies on NPM's security features (e.g., two-factor authentication for publishing).

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Image blurring functionality: The core process is providing the blur effect itself. If this fails, the library is useless.
*   Integration with web applications: The library must be easy to integrate into various web development workflows.

Data to Protect and Sensitivity:

*   Image data: The library processes image data, which *could* contain sensitive information, although Blurable doesn't know or care about the content. Sensitivity depends entirely on the images used by the integrating application. Blurable itself treats all image data as opaque binary data.
*   No user data or credentials are handled by the library itself.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   Are there any specific performance requirements or limitations (e.g., maximum image size, target frame rates)?
*   Are there any specific browser compatibility requirements beyond the currently supported browsers?
*   Are there any plans to extend the library's functionality beyond blurring (e.g., other image effects)?
*   What is the expected usage volume (e.g., number of images processed per day)? This helps assess the potential impact of denial-of-service attacks.

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to provide a simple, efficient, and easy-to-use blurring library.
*   BUSINESS POSTURE: The library is intended for use in web applications, not for server-side image processing.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: The input image data is considered potentially untrusted, but the library itself does not handle sensitive data directly.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: The library is not expected to be a high-value target for attackers, but basic security precautions are still necessary.
*   DESIGN: The library will be used primarily through its JavaScript API.
*   DESIGN: The library will be distributed primarily through NPM.
*   DESIGN: The development process will follow standard open-source practices, including code reviews and automated testing.
