## Attack Tree Path: [1. Denial of Service (DoS) / Performance Degradation [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__denial_of_service__dos___performance_degradation__high_risk_.md)

*   **1.1 Excessive Resource Consumption [HIGH RISK]**
    *   Description: The attacker aims to overload the application's resources (CPU and/or memory) by exploiting the computational cost of the blur operation.
    *   **1.1.1 Trigger Excessive Blur Calculations [HIGH RISK]**
        *   Description: The attacker forces the application to perform an excessive number of blur calculations.
        *   **1.1.1.1 Rapidly Changing Blurred Element Size/Position [HIGH RISK]**
            *   Description: The attacker manipulates the application (e.g., through JavaScript or user interaction) to rapidly change the size or position of a blurred element. This forces the `blurable` library to recalculate the blur effect repeatedly, consuming significant CPU resources.
            *   Example: An attacker could use JavaScript to create an animation that constantly resizes a blurred image, causing the blur to be recalculated on every frame.
            *   Likelihood: High (if animations/interactions are present)
            *   Impact: Medium to High (slowdown, potential DoS)
            *   Effort: Low
            *   Skill Level: Novice to Intermediate
            *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
        *   **1.1.1.2 Applying Blur to Extremely Large Elements [HIGH RISK]**
            *   Description: The attacker provides input (e.g., uploads an image or manipulates DOM elements) that causes the `blurable` library to be applied to an extremely large element.  Blurring large areas is computationally expensive.
            *   Example: An attacker could upload a very high-resolution image and trigger the blur effect on it.
            *   Likelihood: Medium (depends on input validation)
            *   Impact: High (potential DoS)
            *   Effort: Low to Medium
            *   Skill Level: Intermediate
            *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
*   **1.2 Memory Exhaustion**
    *   **1.2.1 Force Allocation of Large Blur Buffers**
        *   **1.2.1.1 Apply Blur to Very Large Elements Repeatedly [HIGH RISK]**
            *   Description: Similar to 1.1.1.2, but the attacker's goal is to exhaust available memory by repeatedly forcing the allocation of large buffers for blur calculations.
            *   Example:  Repeatedly triggering the blur on a large image, even if the image isn't constantly changing, could lead to memory exhaustion if the application or library doesn't properly manage memory.
            *   Likelihood: Medium (depends on input validation and memory management)
            *   Impact: High (potential DoS, application crash)
            *   Effort: Low to Medium
            *   Skill Level: Intermediate
            *   Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Information Disclosure (Bypass Blur)](./attack_tree_paths/2__information_disclosure__bypass_blur_.md)

*   **2.1 Exploit Rendering Artifacts**
    *   **2.1.1 Manipulate Blur Radius/Parameters to Reveal Underlying Content**
        *   **2.1.1.1 Set Extremely Low Blur Radius [HIGH RISK]**
            *   Description: The attacker attempts to set the blur radius to a very small value, making the underlying content partially or fully visible.
            *   Example: If the application allows users to control the blur radius through a slider or input field, the attacker could set it to the minimum possible value.
            *   Likelihood: Medium to High (depends on parameter validation)
            *   Impact: Medium (partial information disclosure)
            *   Effort: Very Low
            *   Skill Level: Novice
            *   Detection Difficulty: Easy

*   **2.3 CSS/Styling Manipulation [HIGH RISK]**
    *   Description: The attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the application's handling of CSS to override or disable the blur effect.
    *   **2.3.1 Override or Disable Blur Styles [HIGH RISK]**
        *   Description: The attacker modifies the CSS rules applied to the blurred element to remove or negate the blur effect.
        *   **2.3.1.1 Inject CSS to Remove or Modify Blur-Related Styles [HIGH RISK]**
            *   Description: The attacker injects malicious CSS code into the application (e.g., through a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability or by exploiting a feature that allows user-provided CSS). This injected CSS overrides the styles applied by `blurable`, effectively disabling the blur.
            *   Example: If the application is vulnerable to XSS, the attacker could inject a `<style>` tag containing CSS rules that set the `filter` property (or any other property used by `blurable`) to `none` for the blurred element.
            *   Likelihood: Medium to High (depends on application's vulnerability to CSS injection/lack of sanitization)
            *   Impact: High (complete information disclosure)
            *   Effort: Low to Medium
            *   Skill Level: Intermediate
            *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
