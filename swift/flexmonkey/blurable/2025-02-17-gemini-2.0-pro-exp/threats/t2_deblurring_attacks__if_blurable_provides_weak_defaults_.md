# Deep Analysis of Threat T2: Deblurring Attacks (Weak Defaults)

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to determine the actual risk posed by weak default blurring parameters within the `flexmonkey/blurable` library and to propose concrete, actionable steps to mitigate this risk.  We aim to answer the following key questions:

*   What are the *actual* default parameters used by `blurable`?
*   How susceptible are images blurred with these defaults to deblurring attacks?
*   What specific deblurring techniques are most effective against these defaults?
*   What are the *quantifiable* improvements achieved by using stronger parameters?
*   What specific changes to the library (code and documentation) are necessary to minimize this risk?

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the `flexmonkey/blurable` library itself, version [Insert Current Version Here - *CRITICAL TO CHECK*].  We will examine:

*   **Source Code:**  The core blurring algorithms and the default parameter values (radius, sigma, etc.) used within the library.  We'll look at the `blurable.swift` file and any related files that define the blurring process.
*   **Documentation:**  The official documentation, including README, API documentation, and any examples provided.  We'll assess the clarity and completeness of guidance on parameter selection.
*   **Deblurring Techniques:**  We will research and implement *practical* deblurring attacks, not just theoretical ones.  This includes readily available tools and techniques an attacker might use.
*   **Test Images:**  We will use a set of representative test images containing various types of sensitive information (text, faces, objects) to evaluate the effectiveness of blurring and deblurring.

**Out of Scope:**

*   Vulnerabilities in the *application* using `blurable` (e.g., input validation failures).  This analysis is solely about the library's inherent weaknesses.
*   Attacks that exploit vulnerabilities *other* than weak defaults (e.g., side-channel attacks on the blurring algorithm itself).
*   Performance optimization of the blurring algorithm, except as it relates to security (e.g., if a stronger algorithm is significantly slower, we'll note that).

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Library Inspection:**
    *   Clone the `flexmonkey/blurable` repository from GitHub.
    *   Identify the core blurring functions and the default parameter values used.  This will involve careful code review.
    *   Review the library's documentation to assess guidance on parameter selection.

2.  **Default Parameter Evaluation:**
    *   Create a simple test application that uses `blurable` with its default settings.
    *   Blur a set of test images containing various types of sensitive information.

3.  **Deblurring Attack Implementation:**
    *   Research common deblurring techniques.  Prioritize techniques that are:
        *   **Readily Available:**  Tools like GIMP, Photoshop, ImageMagick, or open-source deblurring libraries.
        *   **Relatively Simple:**  Techniques an attacker with moderate skills could employ.
        *   **Potentially Effective:**  Based on the type of blurring used by `blurable` (likely Gaussian blur).  Examples include:
            *   **Wiener Deconvolution:** A common technique for reversing Gaussian blur.
            *   **Richardson-Lucy Deconvolution:** An iterative method that can be effective.
            *   **Unsharp Masking (with careful parameter tuning):**  Can sometimes partially reverse blurring.
            *   **AI-based Deblurring:** Explore readily available AI models (if any) that can be used for deblurring.

    *   Implement these techniques using appropriate tools and libraries.

4.  **Attack Effectiveness Assessment:**
    *   Apply the deblurring techniques to the images blurred with default parameters.
    *   Evaluate the success of the deblurring attacks *qualitatively* (visual inspection) and *quantitatively* (if possible, using metrics like PSNR or SSIM to compare the deblurred image to the original).
    *   Document the results, including screenshots and any quantitative measurements.

5.  **Strong Parameter Evaluation:**
    *   Repeat steps 2 and 4, but this time use significantly stronger blurring parameters (larger radius, appropriate sigma).  Experiment with different values to find a good balance between security and visual blurring.

6.  **Recommendations:**
    *   Based on the findings, provide specific recommendations for:
        *   **Default Parameter Changes:**  Suggest concrete values for default radius and sigma that provide a reasonable level of security.
        *   **Documentation Updates:**  Outline specific changes to the documentation to emphasize the importance of parameter selection and provide clear guidance.
        *   **Code-Level Checks:**  Suggest potential code changes to warn or prevent the use of extremely weak parameters.  For example, a warning could be logged if the radius is below a certain threshold.
        *   **Algorithm Selection (if applicable):** If the library offers multiple algorithms, recommend a default choice based on security.

### 4.4. Conclusion and Recommendations

Based on findings from previous steps, we can conclude that:

*   The default blurring parameters in `flexmonkey/blurable` [are/are not] sufficiently strong to protect against common deblurring attacks.
*   Images blurred with the default parameters [can/cannot] be easily deblurred using readily available tools.
*   Using stronger blurring parameters significantly [increases/decreases] the difficulty of deblurring.

**Specific Recommendations:**

1.  **Change Default Parameters:** The library should change its default blurring parameters to:
    *   `radius`: [Recommended value, e.g., 10]  (Justification:  This value provides a good balance between visual blurring and resistance to deblurring based on our testing.)
    *   `sigma`: [Recommended value, e.g., radius / 2] (Justification:  This is a common heuristic for setting sigma based on the radius.)

2.  **Update Documentation:** The following changes should be made to the library's documentation:
    *   Add a prominent section titled "Security Considerations" or "Choosing Blurring Parameters."
    *   Clearly state that the default parameters are intended for *demonstration purposes only* and are *not* suitable for protecting sensitive information.
    *   Provide a table or chart showing the relationship between radius, sigma, and the level of security.
    *   Include examples of how to set custom blurring parameters.
    *   Warn users about the possibility of deblurring attacks and encourage them to choose parameters that provide sufficient protection for their specific use case.
    *   Example text:  "**WARNING:** The default blurring parameters are not secure.  To protect sensitive information, you *must* override the defaults with stronger values.  A larger radius provides stronger blurring.  We recommend a radius of at least 10 for moderate protection and 20 or higher for strong protection.  Experiment with different values to find the best balance between visual blurring and security for your application."

3.  **Implement Code-Level Checks (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   Add a check within the blurring function that logs a warning if the radius is below a certain threshold (e.g., 5).  This will alert developers who are using weak parameters.
    *   Example code (Swift):

    ```swift
    func blurImage(image: UIImage, radius: CGFloat) -> UIImage {
        if radius < 5.0 {
            print("WARNING: Blurring with a radius less than 5.0 may not provide sufficient security.  Consider using a larger radius to protect sensitive information.")
        }
        // ... rest of the blurring code ...
    }
    ```

4. **Consider providing helper functions:**
    * Add functions like `blurSecurely(image: UIImage)` which uses recommended strong parameters. This simplifies secure usage for developers.

By implementing these recommendations, the `flexmonkey/blurable` library can significantly improve its security posture and reduce the risk of deblurring attacks when used in applications that handle sensitive images. This proactive approach is crucial for protecting user privacy and data.
