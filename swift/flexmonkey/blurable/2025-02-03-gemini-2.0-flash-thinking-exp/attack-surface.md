# Attack Surface Analysis for flexmonkey/blurable

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Consumption](./attack_surfaces/client-side_denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_consumption.md)

*   **Description:**  Malicious or excessive use of `blurable`'s CSS filter application leading to client-side resource exhaustion (CPU, GPU, memory), resulting in significant performance degradation, browser freezing, or crashes, effectively denying service to legitimate users.
*   **How `blurable` Contributes:** `blurable` relies on CSS filters to achieve blur effects. Applying complex or numerous blur filters, especially to high-resolution images or a large number of elements, is computationally expensive in the browser.  `blurable`'s functionality directly enables this resource-intensive operation.
*   **Example:** An attacker injects JavaScript into a page (e.g., through a vulnerability unrelated to `blurable` but present in the application) that dynamically targets all images on the page and applies an extremely high blur radius using `blurable`.  Visiting this page can cause the user's browser to become unresponsive or crash due to the overwhelming processing demand from the excessive blur effects.
*   **Impact:** High impact on user experience, rendering the application unusable. In severe cases, it can lead to browser crashes and system instability for the user. This can be exploited to disrupt application availability for targeted users or broader user base.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Implement Resource Limits:**  Design application logic to limit the number of elements blurred simultaneously and restrict the maximum blur radius allowed. Avoid unbounded or user-controlled blur intensity without validation.
        *   **Lazy/Conditional Blurring:** Apply blurring only when necessary and on visible elements. Implement lazy loading for images and defer blurring until images are in the viewport or user interacts with them.
        *   **Rate Limiting Blur Operations:** If blur effects are triggered by user actions, implement rate limiting or debouncing to prevent rapid, resource-intensive blur operations from being triggered in quick succession.
        *   **Server-Side Validation (Indirect):** If blur parameters are derived from user input, validate and sanitize these inputs server-side to prevent attackers from injecting excessively large blur radii or targeting a large number of elements.
    *   **Users:**
        *   **Use Browser Resource Management:** Utilize browser features to limit resource usage per tab or process if available.
        *   **Close Problematic Tabs:** If a webpage using `blurable` causes excessive resource consumption, close the tab to recover browser performance.
        *   **Report Issues:** Report instances of excessive resource usage caused by `blurable` implementation to application developers.

## Attack Surface: [Bypass of Intended Content Obfuscation (when misused for security)](./attack_surfaces/bypass_of_intended_content_obfuscation__when_misused_for_security_.md)

*   **Description:**  Circumventing the client-side blurring applied by `blurable` when it is *misused* as a security mechanism to hide sensitive information within images. This allows attackers to reveal the original, unblurred content, defeating the intended (but flawed) obfuscation.
*   **How `blurable` Contributes:** `blurable` is a client-side library applying CSS filters.  Its very nature as a client-side, visual effect makes it inherently bypassable for security purposes.  Using `blurable` for security creates a false sense of security and introduces this bypassable attack surface.
*   **Example:** An application attempts to "securely" display user documents by blurring sensitive sections using `blurable` on the client-side. An attacker, viewing the page, can easily use browser developer tools to inspect the DOM, identify the CSS blur filter applied by `blurable`, and remove or disable the CSS style, instantly revealing the unblurred sensitive document content.
*   **Impact:** High impact if sensitive information intended to be protected by blurring is exposed. This can lead to privacy breaches, data leaks, and violation of security policies, depending on the nature of the revealed content (e.g., personal data, financial information, confidential documents).
*   **Risk Severity:** High (when misused for security/privacy of sensitive data)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Never Rely on Client-Side Blurring for Security:**  **Critical Mitigation:**  Do not use `blurable` or any client-side blurring as a security measure to protect sensitive information. Client-side obfuscation is fundamentally insecure.
        *   **Implement Server-Side Security:**  Employ robust server-side access control, authorization, and data redaction mechanisms to protect sensitive information.
        *   **Server-Side Redaction/Obfuscation:** If obfuscation is required for sensitive data in images, perform it server-side before delivering the images to the client. Server-side image processing can permanently alter the image content, making bypass significantly harder (though still not foolproof against determined attackers with server access).
        *   **Data Minimization:**  Reduce the amount of sensitive data displayed to the client in the first place. Only transmit necessary information.
    *   **Users:**
        *   **Assume Client-Side Blurring is Not Secure:** Users should be aware that client-side blurring is not a reliable security measure and should not trust applications that rely on it to protect sensitive data.
