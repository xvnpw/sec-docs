# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, "blurable", provides a JavaScript library for blurring images directly in the web browser.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Enhance user privacy by blurring sensitive parts of images displayed on websites.
  - Improve website aesthetics by selectively blurring images for design purposes.
  - Provide a client-side solution for image blurring to reduce server-side processing load and improve responsiveness.
  - Offer an easy-to-integrate library for web developers to implement image blurring functionality.

- Business Risks:
  - Potential for bypass of blurring functionality, leading to unintended exposure of sensitive information.
  - Performance impact on client-side rendering due to blurring calculations, especially on low-powered devices.
  - Compatibility issues across different web browsers and devices.
  - Dependency on client-side JavaScript, which can be disabled or manipulated by users.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Client-side execution environment provided by web browsers. (Implemented by: Web Browser Security Model)
  - security control: Code hosted on GitHub, potentially benefiting from GitHub's security features. (Implemented by: GitHub Platform Security)
  - security control: Open-source nature of the library allows for community review and scrutiny. (Implemented by: Open Source Community)

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Client-side JavaScript is inherently less secure than server-side processing as it is executed in an environment controlled by the user.
  - accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in the library code itself, requiring ongoing maintenance and updates.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on the security of web browsers and their JavaScript engines.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated dependency scanning to identify and address known vulnerabilities in library dependencies.
  - security control: Conduct regular code reviews, including security-focused reviews, to identify and mitigate potential security flaws in the library code.
  - security control: Provide clear documentation and examples on secure usage of the library, highlighting potential security considerations for developers.
  - security control: Consider providing server-side blurring as an alternative or complementary solution for scenarios requiring higher security.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to the library itself, as it is a client-side component. Authentication would be handled by the web application integrating the library.
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to the library itself. Authorization would be handled by the web application to control which images are blurred and under what conditions.
  - Input Validation: The library should handle image data robustly and prevent potential issues from malformed or malicious image inputs. Input validation should be implemented within the library to ensure it can process various image formats and sizes safely.
  - Cryptography: Cryptography is not a core requirement for this image blurring library. However, if future enhancements involve features like watermarking or secure image processing, cryptographic considerations might become relevant. For now, standard web security practices (HTTPS) for delivering the library and images are sufficient.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Displaying images on websites while maintaining user privacy or aesthetic design.
  - Ensuring website performance and responsiveness when blurring images.
  - Maintaining compatibility and functionality across different browsers and devices.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Images themselves are the primary data.
  - Sensitivity depends on the context of use. Images might contain:
    - Personally Identifiable Information (PII) like faces, tattoos, or identifiable objects.
    - Sensitive content that users might want to blur for privacy or content moderation reasons.
    - Proprietary or confidential visual information.
  - Sensitivity level can range from low (aesthetic blurring) to high (privacy protection of sensitive data).

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- BUSINESS POSTURE:
  - Question: What is the primary use case for the Blurable Library? Is it primarily for privacy, aesthetics, or content moderation?
  - Assumption: The library is intended for general-purpose image blurring in web applications, with a focus on ease of use and client-side performance.

- SECURITY POSTURE:
  - Question: Are there specific security policies or compliance requirements that the Blurable Library needs to adhere to?
  - Assumption: Standard web security best practices are sufficient for the initial version of the library. More stringent security measures might be needed depending on specific use cases and sensitivity of data being blurred.
  - Question: What is the acceptable level of risk regarding potential bypass of the blurring functionality?
  - Assumption:  While complete prevention of bypass is not guaranteed in a client-side library, reasonable efforts should be made to make it non-trivial and to document the limitations.

- DESIGN:
  - Question: Are there specific performance requirements for the blurring functionality?
  - Assumption: Performance is a key consideration, and the library is designed to be reasonably efficient for client-side execution.
  - Question: How will the library be integrated into web applications? Are there specific frameworks or environments it needs to support?
  - Assumption: The library is designed to be easily integrated into various web applications using standard JavaScript practices.
