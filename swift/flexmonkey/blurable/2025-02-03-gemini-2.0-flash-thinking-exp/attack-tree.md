## Attack Tree Path: [Attack Goal: Compromise Application via Blurable Library Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/attack_goal_compromise_application_via_blurable_library_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate objective of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized access, control, or causing harm to the application utilizing the `blurable` library.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Blurable Library Weaknesses [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_blurable_library_weaknesses__critical_node_.md)

This represents the attacker's primary strategy: to find and leverage vulnerabilities or weaknesses specifically related to the `blurable` library or its integration within the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Input Manipulation Attacks (Malicious Image URL) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH - SSRF & Large Image]](./attack_tree_paths/input_manipulation_attacks__malicious_image_url___critical_node___high-risk_path_-_ssrf_&_large_imag_b521ce79.md)

This category focuses on attacks that manipulate the input provided to the `blurable` library, specifically the image URL. It's a critical node because it's a direct and easily accessible attack surface.
*   **High-Risk Path - SSRF & Large Image:** This path groups the most concerning input manipulation attacks due to their likelihood and potential impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via URL (If Application fetches image server-side) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_url__if_application_fetches_image_server-side___critical_node_f90079bd.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   If the application fetches the image from the provided URL on the server-side *before* client-side blurring, an attacker can provide a malicious URL.
    *   This URL can target internal resources within the application's infrastructure (e.g., internal services, databases).
    *   It can also target external malicious servers to exfiltrate data or conduct further attacks.
*   **Impact:** High - Potential access to sensitive internal resources, data breaches, and further exploitation of the server-side infrastructure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Large Image/DoS (Client-Side) [HIGH-RISK PATH - DoS]](./attack_tree_paths/large_imagedos__client-side___high-risk_path_-_dos_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   An attacker provides a URL pointing to an extremely large image file.
    *   When `blurable` attempts to process this large image, it can exhaust client-side resources (CPU, memory).
    *   This leads to a client-side Denial of Service (DoS), making the application unresponsive or crashing the browser tab for the user.
*   **Impact:** Low to Medium - Client-side DoS, browser tab crash, temporary disruption for individual users. While not a full application compromise, it degrades user experience and can be used in conjunction with other attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Resource Exhaustion Attacks (Client-Side DoS) [HIGH-RISK PATH - DoS]](./attack_tree_paths/resource_exhaustion_attacks__client-side_dos___high-risk_path_-_dos_.md)

This category focuses on attacks that aim to exhaust client-side resources, leading to a Denial of Service.
*   **High-Risk Path - DoS:** This path highlights the risk of client-side DoS attacks, which are relatively easy to execute.

## Attack Tree Path: [CPU/Memory Exhaustion via Repeated Blurring [HIGH-RISK PATH - DoS]](./attack_tree_paths/cpumemory_exhaustion_via_repeated_blurring__high-risk_path_-_dos_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   An attacker repeatedly triggers the blurring function of `blurable`.
    *   This can be done by repeatedly interacting with the application or through automated scripts.
    *   Repeated blurring, especially with large images or high blur radius, can quickly overload the client's CPU and memory.
*   **Impact:** Low to Medium - Client-side DoS, browser tab unresponsiveness, temporary disruption for individual users. Similar to large image DoS, it impacts user experience and can be part of a broader attack strategy.

## Attack Tree Path: [Client-Side Vulnerabilities due to Blurable Usage (Indirect) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH - XSS]](./attack_tree_paths/client-side_vulnerabilities_due_to_blurable_usage__indirect___critical_node___high-risk_path_-_xss_.md)

This category highlights vulnerabilities that are not directly within `blurable` itself, but arise from *how* the application uses the library and handles related data. It's a critical node because application-side vulnerabilities are common and often overlooked.
*   **High-Risk Path - XSS:** This path focuses on Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, which are a significant risk due to their potential for full client-side compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Context-Dependent XSS via Unsafe Handling of Blurable Output (Application-Side Issue) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH - XSS]](./attack_tree_paths/context-dependent_xss_via_unsafe_handling_of_blurable_output__application-side_issue___critical_node_b88f0a1f.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   If the application displays or processes the *input* URL used for blurring, or any related data, without proper sanitization (output encoding).
    *   An attacker can craft a malicious URL containing JavaScript code.
    *   When the application displays this unsanitized URL, the malicious JavaScript code will be executed in the user's browser.
*   **Impact:** High - Full client-side compromise, including session hijacking, cookie theft, data theft, defacement of the webpage, and redirection to malicious sites. XSS is a severe vulnerability that can have significant consequences.
