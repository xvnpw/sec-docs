        *   Test with corrupted or modified `blurable.js` files (if applicable to the deployment scenario).
        *   Trigger potential exceptions within the application's blurring logic (e.g., invalid input to `blurable.js` functions).
        *   Verify appropriate error handling and user feedback mechanisms are in place.

*   **6. Accessibility Testing:**
    *   **Description:** Ensure blurring doesn't negatively impact accessibility.
    *   **Analysis:** Blurring can significantly impact users with visual impairments or cognitive disabilities. Accessibility testing is crucial to ensure that blurring is implemented in a way that doesn't create barriers for these users. This includes considering:
        *   **Screen reader compatibility:** How does blurring affect screen readers' ability to interpret content?
        *   **Keyboard navigation:** Is keyboard navigation still functional and intuitive when blurring is applied?
        *   **Cognitive load:** Does excessive or poorly implemented blurring increase cognitive load for users with cognitive disabilities?
        *   **Color contrast:** Does blurring affect color contrast ratios and readability?

**Threats Mitigated and Impact Analysis:**

The listed threats and their impact assessments are generally accurate and well-reasoned:

*   **Functional Bugs and Unexpected Behavior (Medium Severity):** Testing strategy effectively mitigates this through unit, integration, and error scenario testing. Medium severity is appropriate as functional bugs can disrupt user experience and potentially lead to security vulnerabilities if not handled correctly.
*   **Performance Issues (Medium Severity):** Performance testing directly addresses this threat. Medium severity is justified as performance issues can significantly degrade user experience and potentially impact application usability, especially on mobile devices.
*   **Cross-Browser Compatibility Issues (Medium Severity):** Cross-browser testing directly targets this threat. Medium severity is appropriate as browser compatibility issues can exclude users and lead to inconsistent application behavior.
*   **Accessibility Issues (Low Severity):** Accessibility testing addresses this threat. Low severity is assigned, likely because while important, accessibility issues are often not considered as critical as functional or performance issues in immediate security contexts. However, it's crucial to emphasize that accessibility is a fundamental aspect of ethical and inclusive software development and should be treated with higher priority than "low severity" might suggest in a broader context.

**Currently Implemented and Missing Implementation Analysis:**

The assessment of "Partially Implemented" is realistic.  General functional and integration testing are common practices, but specific testing for `blurable.js` nuances, especially performance and accessibility, is often overlooked.

The "Missing Implementation" section accurately identifies key areas for improvement:

*   **Dedicated Test Cases for Blurable.js:**  Moving beyond general testing to create specific test cases focused on `blurable.js` functionality is crucial for targeted and effective testing.
