# Attack Surface Analysis for flexmonkey/blurable

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Image URL Leading to Client-Side Resource Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/malicious_image_url_leading_to_client-side_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a URL to an extremely large image that is then processed by `blurable`.
    *   **How Blurable Contributes:** `blurable` fetches and processes the image data on the client-side to apply the blur effect. Handling very large images consumes significant CPU and memory resources in the user's browser.
    *   **Example:** A user profile page allows setting an avatar URL. An attacker provides a URL to a multi-gigabyte image. When another user views the profile, their browser attempts to download and blur this massive image, potentially freezing or crashing their browser.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) on the client-side, leading to a degraded user experience, browser crashes, and potential system instability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   Implement reasonable client-side checks on image file size before passing the URL to `blurable`.
            *   Implement server-side validation and sanitization of user-provided image URLs.
            *   Implement timeouts for image loading initiated by `blurable` to prevent indefinite resource consumption.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Image URL Exploiting Browser Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/malicious_image_url_exploiting_browser_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a URL to a specially crafted image designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the browser's image rendering engine.
    *   **How Blurable Contributes:** `blurable` fetches and passes the image data to the browser's rendering engine via the Canvas API for processing. If the browser has a vulnerability in how it handles certain image formats or headers, this could be triggered.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides a URL to a specially crafted PNG file that exploits a known vulnerability in the browser's PNG decoding library. When `blurable` attempts to process this image, it triggers the vulnerability, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or a crash.
    *   **Impact:**  Potentially critical, ranging from browser crashes and information disclosure to remote code execution on the user's machine.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   While direct mitigation within `blurable`'s scope is limited, ensure the application encourages users to use trusted image sources.
            *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which images can be loaded and processed by `blurable`.

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side Denial of Service via Excessive Blurring Parameters](./attack_surfaces/client-side_denial_of_service_via_excessive_blurring_parameters.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates the `blur` radius or `iterations` parameters of `blurable` to extremely high values.
    *   **How Blurable Contributes:** `blurable` directly uses these parameters in its blurring algorithm. High values lead to computationally intensive operations on the client-side.
    *   **Example:** A web application allows users to customize the blur level of images. An attacker uses their browser's developer tools to modify the JavaScript code and set the blur radius to an extremely large number. This causes the browser to freeze or become unresponsive due to the heavy processing load initiated by `blurable`.
    *   **Impact:** Client-side DoS, leading to a frozen or unresponsive user interface.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   Implement reasonable limits on the `blur` radius and `iterations` parameters that can be passed to `blurable`.
            *   Sanitize and validate user-provided input for these parameters on the client-side before using them with `blurable`.
