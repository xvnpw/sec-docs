# Threat Model Analysis for flexmonkey/blurable

## Threat: [Client-Side Denial of Service (Resource Exhaustion)](./threats/client-side_denial_of_service__resource_exhaustion_.md)

**Description:** An attacker might manipulate the application to repeatedly request blurring of extremely large images or a large number of images in a short period. This could overwhelm the user's browser, consuming excessive CPU and memory resources due to the processing demands of `blurable`.

**Impact:**  The user's browser or device could become unresponsive, potentially leading to application crashes or the need to force-quit the browser. This disrupts the user experience and can prevent them from using the application.

**Affected Blurrable Component:**  The core blurring logic within the library, particularly the functions responsible for image processing and pixel manipulation.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement client-side limits on the size and number of images that can be blurred at once.
* Implement timeouts for blurring operations to prevent indefinite processing by `blurable`.
* Consider using a web worker to offload blurring tasks to a separate thread, preventing the main thread from being blocked by `blurable`'s processing.
* Implement rate limiting on blurring requests if the application allows user-initiated blurring.

## Threat: [Circumventing Intended Blurring (Security Bypass)](./threats/circumventing_intended_blurring__security_bypass_.md)

**Description:** If blurring is used to obscure sensitive information, an attacker might find ways to manipulate the blurring parameters or exploit vulnerabilities within `blurable`'s code to reduce or reverse the blur effect, potentially revealing the underlying content.

**Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive information that was intended to be hidden by blurring due to a flaw in `blurable`'s implementation or usage.

**Affected Blurrable Component:** The blurring algorithm implementation within `blurable` and any functions controlling the blur intensity or parameters.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid relying solely on client-side blurring provided by libraries like `blurable` for security purposes. Implement server-side redaction or masking of sensitive data.
* Carefully review how the blurring parameters are controlled in the application's code and ensure they cannot be easily manipulated to bypass `blurable`'s intended effect.
* Consider using more robust techniques for obscuring sensitive information if client-side blurring is necessary.
