## Attack Tree Visualization

```
*   Attack: Compromise Application via Blurrable **HIGH-RISK**
    *   OR
        *   Execute Arbitrary JavaScript via Malicious Image Input [CRITICAL] **HIGH-RISK**
            *   OR
                *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Image URL **HIGH-RISK**
                    *   AND
                        *   **[CRITICAL]** Application uses user-controlled input for image URL passed to Blurrable
                        *   Attacker injects a malicious URL (e.g., data URI with JavaScript)
                        *   Blurrable processes the malicious URL, triggering script execution
                *   Content Injection via Image Source Manipulation **HIGH-RISK**
                    *   AND
                        *   **[CRITICAL]** Application dynamically sets the `src` attribute of the image element used by Blurrable
                        *   Attacker can manipulate the `src` attribute (e.g., through DOM manipulation or a vulnerable API endpoint)
                        *   Attacker sets the `src` to a malicious image (e.g., SVG with embedded script)
        *   Prototype Pollution Exploitation **HIGH-RISK**
            *   AND
                *   **[CRITICAL]** Blurrable or the application uses a vulnerable version of a dependency or has inherent prototype pollution vulnerabilities
                *   Attacker can manipulate Blurrable's configuration or internal objects (e.g., through URL parameters or DOM manipulation)
                *   Attacker pollutes object prototypes with malicious code that gets executed during Blurrable's operation
        *   Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack on Blurrable Delivery **HIGH-RISK**
            *   AND
                *   **[CRITICAL]** Application loads Blurrable over an insecure connection (HTTP)
                *   Attacker intercepts the connection
                *   Attacker replaces the legitimate Blurrable script with a malicious one

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Execute Arbitrary JavaScript via Malicious Image Input](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_execute_arbitrary_javascript_via_malicious_image_input.md)

*   This path represents the most direct way for an attacker to achieve the objective. It involves exploiting how the application handles image inputs provided to the Blurrable library.
*   **Critical Node: Application uses user-controlled input for image URL passed to Blurrable:**
    *   This is a critical point because if the application directly uses user-provided input as the source for images processed by Blurrable without proper sanitization, it opens the door for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
    *   An attacker can inject a malicious URL, such as a `data:` URI containing JavaScript, which will be executed when Blurrable attempts to process it.
*   **High-Risk Path: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Image URL:**
    *   This attack leverages the critical node mentioned above.
    *   The attacker's effort is low, as XSS techniques are well-known and readily available.
    *   The impact is high, as successful XSS allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser within the application's context.
*   **Critical Node: Application dynamically sets the `src` attribute of the image element used by Blurrable:**
    *   This is a critical point because if the application dynamically constructs or sets the `src` attribute of the image element used by Blurrable based on data from an untrusted source, it creates an opportunity for content injection.
*   **High-Risk Path: Content Injection via Image Source Manipulation:**
    *   This attack involves manipulating the `src` attribute of the image element used by Blurrable.
    *   An attacker could potentially exploit vulnerabilities in the application's DOM manipulation logic or API endpoints to set the `src` to a malicious image, such as an SVG file containing embedded JavaScript.
    *   Similar to XSS via URL, the impact is high, leading to arbitrary JavaScript execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Prototype Pollution Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_prototype_pollution_exploitation.md)

*   This path involves exploiting potential prototype pollution vulnerabilities in Blurrable itself or its dependencies, or within the application's code.
*   **Critical Node: Blurrable or the application uses a vulnerable version of a dependency or has inherent prototype pollution vulnerabilities:**
    *   This critical node represents the underlying vulnerability that makes prototype pollution possible. If Blurrable or its dependencies have such vulnerabilities, or if the application's code is susceptible, attackers can exploit it.
*   The attacker needs a medium to high skill level to understand and execute prototype pollution attacks.
*   The impact of successful prototype pollution is high, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution by manipulating object prototypes used by the application or Blurrable.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack on Blurrable Delivery](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_blurrable_delivery.md)

*   This path relies on the application loading the Blurrable library over an insecure HTTP connection.
*   **Critical Node: Application loads Blurrable over an insecure connection (HTTP):**
    *   This is a critical weakness. If the application doesn't use HTTPS to load Blurrable, an attacker on the network can intercept the connection.
*   The attacker with a medium skill level can then replace the legitimate Blurrable script with a malicious one.
*   The impact of a successful MitM attack is high, as the attacker gains full control over the Blurrable script executed in the user's browser.
