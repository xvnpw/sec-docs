# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for flexmonkey/blurable

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit the Number of Blurred Images (Blurable.js Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/limit_the_number_of_blurred_images__blurable_js_specific_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Limit the Number of Blurred Images (Blurable.js Specific)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Analyze Blurable.js Usage:** Identify all areas in your application where `blurable.js` is applied to images.
    2.  **Count Blurred Images per Viewport:** Determine how many images are being blurred by `blurable.js` within a user's viewport at any given time, especially on pages with many images.
    3.  **Implement Dynamic Limiting:**  Use JavaScript to track the number of currently blurred images managed by `blurable.js`. Set a threshold based on performance testing (e.g., limit to 5-10 concurrently blurred images visible in the viewport).
    4.  **Prioritize Blurring or Disable Excess:** When the threshold is reached, implement logic to either:
        *   Prevent `blurable.js` from blurring new images entering the viewport until existing blurred images are no longer visible.
        *   Prioritize blurring for images closest to the user's focus or viewport center, and disable blurring for less relevant images.
    5.  **Test Performance with Limits:**  Thoroughly test page performance on various devices (especially low-powered mobile devices) with the implemented limit to ensure smooth scrolling and interaction when `blurable.js` is active.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Client-Side Performance Degradation due to Blurable.js (Severity: High):**  Excessive use of `blurable.js` can overload the client's browser, leading to slow page rendering, UI freezes, and a poor user experience directly caused by the library's processing demands.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion from Blurable.js Processing (Severity: Medium):** High CPU and memory usage specifically due to `blurable.js` operations can potentially lead to browser crashes or device slowdowns, directly attributable to the library's resource consumption.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Client-Side Performance Degradation due to Blurable.js: High Reduction:**  Significantly reduces performance bottlenecks caused by `blurable.js` by controlling the number of concurrent blur effects it applies.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion from Blurable.js Processing: Medium Reduction:** Lowers the risk of resource exhaustion directly related to `blurable.js`'s processing load by limiting its active instances.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented in image gallery sections. A basic static limit of 10 blurred images in the viewport is set, but it's not dynamically adjusted based on device capabilities or real-time performance.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Dynamic adjustment of the blurred image limit based on device performance and browser capabilities when using `blurable.js`.
    *   Implementation of prioritization logic for blurring within `blurable.js` usage, focusing on viewport relevance.
    *   Application of these limits in all sections of the application where `blurable.js` is utilized.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Optimize Image Sizes for Blurable.js Processing](./mitigation_strategies/optimize_image_sizes_for_blurable_js_processing.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Optimize Image Sizes for Blurable.js Processing
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Analyze Image Sizes Used with Blurable.js:** Specifically review images that are targeted for blurring by `blurable.js` throughout the application.
    2.  **Identify Oversized Images for Blurable.js:** Check if images being blurred by `blurable.js` are larger than their rendered display dimensions.  Oversized images increase the processing burden for `blurable.js` unnecessarily.
    3.  **Resize Images for Blurable.js Context:** Resize images on the server-side to be appropriately sized for their display context *when they are intended to be blurred by `blurable.js`*. Create responsive image sizes, ensuring that the sizes used with `blurable.js` are optimized for the intended display area.
    4.  **Compress Images for Blurable.js:** Use image compression techniques (e.g., WebP, optimized JPEGs) to reduce file sizes of images processed by `blurable.js`, minimizing the data `blurable.js` needs to handle and process.
    5.  **Serve Optimized Formats to Blurable.js:** Ensure that optimized image formats (like WebP) are served to browsers that support them, especially for images that will be blurred by `blurable.js`, further reducing processing overhead for the library.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Client-Side Performance Degradation due to Blurable.js (Severity: Medium):** Blurring larger, unoptimized images with `blurable.js` requires significantly more processing power, directly impacting performance and responsiveness when using the library.
    *   **Increased Blurable.js Processing Time (Severity: Medium):**  Larger image files increase the time `blurable.js` takes to perform blurring operations, leading to delays and a less smooth user experience specifically related to the library's execution.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Lazy Loading and On-Demand Blurring with Blurable.js](./mitigation_strategies/lazy_loading_and_on-demand_blurring_with_blurable_js.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Lazy Loading and On-Demand Blurring with Blurable.js
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement Lazy Loading for Blurable.js Images:** Use lazy loading techniques (browser native or JavaScript libraries) to defer the loading of images that are intended to be blurred by `blurable.js` until they are about to enter the viewport.
    2.  **Delay Blurable.js Initialization Until Image Load:** Modify the application's logic to initialize `blurable.js` and apply blurring effects *only after* the target image has been fully loaded and is about to become visible to the user.
    3.  **Trigger Blurable.js Blurring on Visibility:** Use events like `IntersectionObserver` to detect when a lazily loaded image, intended for blurring, enters the viewport.  *Only then* trigger the `blurable.js` initialization and blurring process for that specific image.
    4.  **Placeholder Images Before Blurable.js:** Utilize low-resolution placeholder images or solid color backgrounds for images that will be blurred by `blurable.js` while they are loading and before the blurring effect is applied. This improves perceived performance and avoids upfront processing by `blurable.js`.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Client-Side Performance Degradation due to Initial Blurable.js Load (Severity: High):** Initial page load performance is negatively impacted if `blurable.js` attempts to blur all images upfront, including those not immediately visible, leading to unnecessary processing at page load.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion from Preemptive Blurable.js Processing (Severity: Medium):** Blurring all images at once, even those off-screen, consumes resources unnecessarily at page load, especially due to `blurable.js`'s client-side processing.
    *   **Poor User Experience due to Initial Blurable.js Delay (Severity: Medium):** Slow initial page load and potential UI jank caused by upfront `blurable.js` processing can degrade the user experience right from the start.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Client-Side Performance Degradation due to Initial Blurable.js Load: High Reduction:**  Significantly improves initial page load performance by deferring `blurable.js` processing until images are actually needed.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion from Preemptive Blurable.js Processing: Medium Reduction:** Reduces initial resource consumption by ensuring `blurable.js` only operates on images as they become relevant to the user.
    *   **Poor User Experience due to Initial Blurable.js Delay: High Reduction:** Improves perceived performance and overall user experience by making the initial page load faster and smoother, avoiding delays caused by `blurable.js` upfront processing.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Lazy loading is partially implemented. `blurable.js` initialization is generally triggered on page load, not on image visibility or load completion.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Consistent lazy loading for all images intended for `blurable.js` blurring.
    *   Implementation of event-based `blurable.js` initialization and blurring triggered by image visibility (using `IntersectionObserver`).
    *   Delaying `blurable.js` initialization until after images are fully loaded.
    *   Placeholder image implementation to enhance the loading experience before `blurable.js` is applied.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Throttling or Debouncing Blurable.js Operations](./mitigation_strategies/throttling_or_debouncing_blurable_js_operations.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Throttling or Debouncing Blurable.js Operations
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Dynamic Blurable.js Triggers:** Determine if `blurable.js` blurring is dynamically triggered by user interactions like scrolling, resizing, or other events that might cause rapid and repeated blur operations.
    2.  **Choose Throttling or Debouncing for Blurable.js:**
        *   **Throttling for Blurable.js:** Limit the rate at which `blurable.js`'s blur function is executed in response to events (e.g., apply blur at most once every 100ms during scrolling).
        *   **Debouncing for Blurable.js:** Delay the execution of `blurable.js`'s blur function until a period of inactivity has passed after the triggering event stops firing (e.g., wait 250ms after scrolling ends before re-applying blur).
    3.  **Implement Throttling/Debouncing for Blurable.js:** Use JavaScript utility functions (like Lodash's `throttle` or `debounce`) to wrap the `blurable.js` initialization or update function when it's triggered by dynamic events.
    4.  **Adjust Timing for Blurable.js:** Experiment with different throttling or debouncing intervals to find a balance between responsiveness of the blur effect and performance impact of `blurable.js` during dynamic interactions.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Client-Side Performance Degradation from Rapid Blurable.js Calls (Severity: Medium):** Rapidly triggering `blurable.js` blur operations in response to events like scrolling or resizing can lead to performance bottlenecks and UI lag specifically due to the library's repeated processing.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion from Excessive Blurable.js Processing (Severity: Low):**  Excessive and frequent `blurable.js` operations, especially during dynamic events, can contribute to higher CPU usage, although less severe than uncontrolled blurring of many images, but still relevant to the library's resource footprint.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Client-Side Performance Degradation from Rapid Blurable.js Calls: Medium Reduction:** Smooths out performance by limiting the frequency of `blurable.js` operations during rapid user interactions, preventing performance spikes caused by the library.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion from Excessive Blurable.js Processing: Low Reduction:** Slightly reduces resource consumption by preventing redundant and overly frequent `blurable.js` calculations during dynamic events.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Throttling/debouncing is not currently implemented for `blurable.js` usage. Blurring might be re-applied or initialized without rate limiting in response to dynamic events.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Implementation of throttling or debouncing specifically for `blurable.js` operations triggered by scroll-based or resize-based events.
    *   Review of existing `blurable.js` implementations to identify areas where throttling or debouncing would be beneficial to manage the library's performance impact during dynamic interactions.
