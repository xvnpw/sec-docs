### Blurable Library - High and Critical Threats

This document outlines high and critical security threats directly involving the `Blurable` JavaScript library.

* **Threat:** Client-Side Denial of Service (DoS) via Large Image Processing
    * **Description:** The `Blurable` library attempts to process an extremely large image on the client-side, consuming excessive CPU and memory resources due to its internal processing logic. This is a direct consequence of how `Blurable` handles image data.
    * **Impact:** The user's browser becomes unresponsive or crashes, leading to a denial of service.
    * **Affected Blurable Component:**
        * Blurable's core image processing module.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developer:**
            * Consider implementing a timeout mechanism for `Blurable` processing to prevent indefinite resource consumption within the library's execution.
            * Investigate if `Blurable` offers configuration options to limit resource usage or processing complexity. If not, consider forking and modifying the library or seeking alternatives.

* **Threat:** Client-Side Denial of Service (DoS) via Maliciously Crafted Images
    * **Description:** A specially crafted image file exploits a vulnerability or inefficiency within `Blurable`'s image decoding and processing logic. The library's internal handling of the malformed image leads to excessive resource consumption or an infinite loop.
    * **Impact:** The user's browser becomes unresponsive or crashes, leading to a denial of service.
    * **Affected Blurable Component:**
        * Blurable's image decoding and processing module.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developer:**
            * Keep the `Blurable` library updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches addressing such vulnerabilities within the library itself.
            * If feasible, explore alternative, more robust image processing libraries that are less susceptible to malformed input.

* **Threat:** Dependency Vulnerabilities
    * **Description:** The `Blurable` library relies on other JavaScript libraries or dependencies that contain known security vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are within the code that `Blurable` directly utilizes.
    * **Impact:** Vulnerabilities in `Blurable`'s dependencies could be exploited to perform various attacks, including cross-site scripting (XSS) or arbitrary code execution within the context of the user's browser.
    * **Affected Blurable Component:**
        * The specific vulnerable dependency library used by `Blurable`.
    * **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability in the dependency)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developer:**
            * Regularly check `Blurable`'s dependencies for known vulnerabilities using security scanning tools or vulnerability databases.
            * Keep `Blurable` and its dependencies updated to the latest versions to patch any identified vulnerabilities. If `Blurable` has outdated or unmaintained dependencies, consider alternatives or contributing to update the dependencies within the `Blurable` project.
