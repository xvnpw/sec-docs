*   **Attack Surface:** Malicious Image Uploads
    *   **Description:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted image file intended to exploit vulnerabilities in the image processing libraries used by `Blurable`.
    *   **How Blurable Contributes:** `Blurable` processes the uploaded image data to perform blurring. This processing relies on underlying image decoding and manipulation libraries, which can be susceptible to vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a PNG file with a crafted header that triggers a buffer overflow in the PNG decoding library used by `Blurable`, potentially leading to code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation: Verify file types, sizes, and potentially content before passing to `Blurable`.
        *   Utilize secure image processing libraries and keep them updated with the latest security patches.
        *   Consider using sandboxing or containerization to isolate the image processing environment.
        *   Implement content security policies (CSPs) to restrict the execution of potentially malicious scripts.

*   **Attack Surface:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via URL Input
    *   **Description:** If the application allows users to provide a URL for an image to be blurred by `Blurable`, an attacker can supply a URL pointing to internal resources or external services, potentially gaining unauthorized access or causing unintended actions.
    *   **How Blurable Contributes:** `Blurable` fetches the image from the provided URL to perform the blurring operation.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides a URL like `http://localhost:6379/` (the default port for Redis) to `Blurable`. The server hosting the application then makes a request to its own Redis instance, potentially allowing the attacker to interact with it.
    *   **Impact:** Access to internal resources, information disclosure, potential for further exploitation of internal services.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict URL validation and sanitization:  Whitelist allowed protocols (e.g., `https://`) and domains.
        *   Prevent access to internal network ranges and sensitive services.
        *   Use a dedicated service or library for fetching external resources with built-in SSRF protection.
        *   Implement network segmentation to limit the impact of a successful SSRF attack.

*   **Attack Surface:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Underlying Image Processing Libraries
    *   **Description:** `Blurable` relies on other libraries for image decoding and manipulation. These libraries may have known vulnerabilities that an attacker can exploit by providing specific image formats or crafted data.
    *   **How Blurable Contributes:** `Blurable` acts as an intermediary, utilizing these underlying libraries to process images. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies directly impact the security of applications using `Blurable`.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability exists in the JPEG decoding library used by `Blurable`. An attacker provides a specially crafted JPEG image that triggers this vulnerability, leading to a crash or code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), Remote Code Execution (RCE).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the severity of the underlying vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep all dependencies, including the underlying image processing libraries, updated to the latest versions with security patches.
        *   Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using software composition analysis (SCA) tools.
        *   Consider using alternative, more secure image processing libraries if available and feasible.
