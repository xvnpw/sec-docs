# Threat Model Analysis for devxoul/then

## Threat: [Unexpected State Manipulation Leading to Security Bypass During `then` Block Execution](./threats/unexpected_state_manipulation_leading_to_security_bypass_during__then__block_execution.md)

**Description:** An attacker might exploit the immediate execution and direct access to object properties within the `then` block to manipulate the object's state in a way that bypasses intended security checks or mechanisms *during the object's initialization phase*. This could occur if the configuration logic within the `then` block, while seemingly benign, has unintended consequences when combined with other parts of the application's logic or if the order of operations within the `then` block itself is exploitable. The direct manipulation facilitated by `then` during creation is the key factor here.

**Impact:** Security controls can be circumvented, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, or execution of malicious code.

**Affected Component:** The `then` block during object initialization.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Carefully analyze the logic within `then` blocks to ensure it doesn't introduce unintended side effects that could compromise security, especially during the crucial initialization phase.
*   Implement thorough unit and integration tests to verify the expected state of objects initialized using `then`, specifically focusing on security-related attributes immediately after the `then` block executes.
*   Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring objects within `then` blocks; only set necessary properties and avoid complex logic that could introduce unexpected state changes.
*   Consider if the initialization logic within the `then` block should be moved to a more controlled or explicit method if complex or security-sensitive state manipulation is required.

## Threat: [Malicious Code Execution via Exploitable Logic Within the `then` Block](./threats/malicious_code_execution_via_exploitable_logic_within_the__then__block.md)

**Description:** While `then` itself doesn't introduce direct code injection, if the logic within the `then` block takes input (even indirectly through object properties set elsewhere) and uses it in an unsafe manner that leads to code execution (e.g., constructing shell commands, using `eval`-like functions), an attacker who can control that input can achieve code execution. The `then` block provides the execution context for this vulnerable code.

**Impact:**  Remote code execution on the server or client, leading to complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying system.

**Affected Component:** The code within the `then` block.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Treat the code within `then` blocks with extreme caution, especially if it interacts with external data or performs operations that could be exploited for code execution.
*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for any data used within `then` blocks that could influence code execution paths.
*   Avoid using dynamic code execution constructs within `then` blocks if possible. If necessary, ensure extremely strict control over the input.
*   Follow secure coding practices to prevent code injection vulnerabilities within the logic executed within `then` blocks.
*   Regularly review and audit the code within `then` blocks for potential code execution vulnerabilities.
