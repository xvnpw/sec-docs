## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK, CRITICAL] Exploit Asynchronous Logic Flaws Introduced by 'then'](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk__critical__exploit_asynchronous_logic_flaws_introduced_by_'then'.md)

Targeting the inherent complexities of asynchronous programming facilitated by 'then' to induce unexpected behavior or resource exhaustion. This involves manipulating the timing or execution of promises to create vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK, CRITICAL] Promise Never Resolves/Hangs](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk__critical__promise_never_resolveshangs.md)

Exploiting scenarios where a promise within a 'then' chain fails to reach a resolved or rejected state. This can be achieved by providing specific inputs or triggering conditions that lead to indefinite waiting.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK, CRITICAL] Cause Resource Exhaustion/DoS](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk__critical__cause_resource_exhaustiondos.md)

Leveraging unresolved promises to tie up system resources (memory, threads, connections) until the application becomes unresponsive or crashes. This is a common goal for denial-of-service attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK] Send Malicious Input Triggering Long-Running/Infinite Promise](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk__send_malicious_input_triggering_long-runninginfinite_promise.md)

Crafting specific input data that, when processed by the application's promise logic, results in an extremely long processing time or an infinite loop within a promise. This can be done by exploiting inefficient algorithms or complex calculations within the promise chain.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK, CRITICAL] Exploit Lack of Timeouts/Cancellation Mechanisms](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk__critical__exploit_lack_of_timeoutscancellation_mechanisms.md)

Taking advantage of the absence of explicit timeout mechanisms or cancellation options for promises. An attacker can trigger a long-running operation knowing it will not be automatically terminated, leading to resource exhaustion.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK] Incorrect Error Handling in Promise Chains](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk__incorrect_error_handling_in_promise_chains.md)

Exploiting situations where developers have not implemented proper error handling (`catch` blocks) within 'then' promise chains. This can lead to unhandled exceptions, exposing sensitive information or causing the application to enter an inconsistent state.

## Attack Tree Path: [Information Disclosure via Unhandled Errors](./attack_tree_paths/information_disclosure_via_unhandled_errors.md)

Triggering error conditions within promise chains that are not properly caught and handled. This can result in error messages, stack traces, or other debugging information being exposed to the attacker, potentially revealing sensitive data or internal application details.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Error Condition Revealing Sensitive Data](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_error_condition_revealing_sensitive_data.md)

Specifically crafting input or conditions designed to cause an error within a promise chain, with the expectation that the resulting error message will inadvertently leak sensitive information such as API keys, database credentials, or internal file paths.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK] Abuse Background Threading Introduced by 'then'](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk__abuse_background_threading_introduced_by_'then'.md)

Targeting the use of background threads facilitated by 'then' to introduce concurrency issues. This involves manipulating the timing of operations on different threads to create race conditions or access shared resources without proper synchronization.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Shared Mutable State in Background Threads](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_shared_mutable_state_in_background_threads.md)

Identifying and exploiting scenarios where multiple background threads managed by 'then' access and modify the same data without adequate locking or synchronization mechanisms. This can lead to data corruption or inconsistent application state.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Corruption/Inconsistency](./attack_tree_paths/data_corruptioninconsistency.md)

Successfully manipulating concurrent access to shared data in background threads, resulting in data being overwritten, read in an incorrect order, or left in an inconsistent state. This can have significant consequences for application functionality and data integrity.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Concurrent Access to Shared Data Without Proper Synchronization](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_concurrent_access_to_shared_data_without_proper_synchronization.md)

Orchestrating multiple asynchronous operations that execute on background threads and attempt to access and modify the same shared data simultaneously, without the protection of locks, mutexes, or other synchronization primitives. This creates a race condition where the outcome depends on the unpredictable timing of thread execution.
