## Attack Tree Path: [1.0 Exploit Misconfiguration via `then` [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_0_exploit_misconfiguration_via__then___critical_node_.md)

Attack Vector: Exploiting vulnerabilities arising from improper or insecure configuration practices when using the `then` library. This is a broad category encompassing various misconfiguration issues.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Information Disclosure through Verbose Configuration [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_information_disclosure_through_verbose_configuration__critical_node_.md)

Attack Vector: Gaining access to sensitive information by exploiting overly verbose or insecure configuration processes that reveal confidential data.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Expose Sensitive Data in Configuration Closures (Logs, Errors) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_expose_sensitive_data_in_configuration_closures__logs__errors___critical_node_.md)

Attack Vector: Sensitive data embedded within `then` configuration closures is unintentionally exposed through logs, error messages, or debugging outputs.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.1 Log/Display Configuration Details Including Secrets [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_1_logdisplay_configuration_details_including_secrets__critical_node_.md)

Attack Vector: Developers inadvertently log or display the configuration process, including sensitive secrets (API keys, credentials, internal paths) that are hardcoded or directly used within `then` configuration closures.
    * Likelihood: Medium-High
    * Impact: Moderate-Significant (Exposure of secrets)
    * Effort: Low
    * Skill Level: Low
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH if Security Logic is Flawed] 1.2 Logic Flaws in Configuration Logic [CRITICAL NODE if Security Logic is Flawed]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path_if_security_logic_is_flawed__1_2_logic_flaws_in_configuration_logic__critical_node_i_aff489e7.md)

Attack Vector: Exploiting flaws in the application's logic that governs object configuration using `then`, particularly if security mechanisms are tied to the state of configured objects. This path is high-risk *if* the application's security design is flawed in this way.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH if Security Logic is Flawed] 1.2.1 Bypass Security Checks via Configuration Manipulation [CRITICAL NODE if Security Logic is Flawed]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path_if_security_logic_is_flawed__1_2_1_bypass_security_checks_via_configuration_manipula_01fd5ca1.md)

Attack Vector: Manipulating the configuration process (indirectly, through application logic flaws) to bypass security checks that rely on the state of objects configured using `then`.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH if Security Logic is Flawed] 1.2.1.1 Modify Object State to Skip Authentication/Authorization [CRITICAL NODE if Security Logic is Flawed]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path_if_security_logic_is_flawed__1_2_1_1_modify_object_state_to_skip_authenticationautho_6bad556e.md)

Attack Vector: Exploiting flaws to alter the state of authentication or authorization objects during configuration (using `then`), effectively bypassing these security measures.
    * Likelihood: Low-Medium (Requires specific application logic flaws)
    * Impact: Significant-Critical (Full access bypass)
    * Effort: Medium
    * Skill Level: Medium
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium-Hard (Depends on logging and monitoring)

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH if Security Logic is Flawed] 1.2.1.2 Alter Object Behavior to Circumvent Security Features [CRITICAL NODE if Security Logic is Flawed]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path_if_security_logic_is_flawed__1_2_1_2_alter_object_behavior_to_circumvent_security_fe_d55f2cb6.md)

Attack Vector: Exploiting flaws to modify the behavior of security-related objects (input validation, rate limiting, etc.) during configuration (using `then`), circumventing intended security features.
    * Likelihood: Low-Medium (Requires specific application logic flaws)
    * Impact: Significant-Critical (Circumvention of security controls)
    * Effort: Medium
    * Skill Level: Medium
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium-Hard (Depends on monitoring of security features)

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH - General DevSec] 3.0 Social Engineering/Developer-Side Attacks [CRITICAL NODE - General DevSec]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path_-_general_devsec__3_0_social_engineeringdeveloper-side_attacks__critical_node_-_gene_bba705c1.md)

Attack Vector: Exploiting weaknesses in the human element and development processes, rather than direct technical vulnerabilities in `then` itself. This is a general category of attacks applicable to any software development.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH - General DevSec] 3.1 Compromise Developer Environment [CRITICAL NODE - General DevSec]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path_-_general_devsec__3_1_compromise_developer_environment__critical_node_-_general_devs_c00a81e0.md)

Attack Vector: Gaining unauthorized access to a developer's environment (machine, accounts, repositories) to inject malicious code or modify application logic, including code that uses `then`.
    * Likelihood: Low-Medium (Depends on developer environment security)
    * Impact: Critical (Full application compromise)
    * Effort: Medium-High (Compromising developer environment)
    * Skill Level: Medium-High
    * Detection Difficulty: Hard (If done carefully)
