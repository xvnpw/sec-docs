## 1. Introduction

This document provides a detailed design overview of the `then` Swift Promise library. It is intended to be used as a foundation for threat modeling and security analysis of projects that integrate the `then` library. The document outlines the architecture, key components, data flow, and security considerations to facilitate understanding the library's functionality and potential security implications within a broader application context.

`then` is a lightweight Swift library implementing the Promises/A+ specification. Promises are a powerful design pattern for managing asynchronous operations, enhancing code clarity and maintainability by representing the eventual outcome of asynchronous tasks. This library offers a clean and intuitive API for leveraging promises in Swift development.

## 2. Project Overview

The primary objective of the `then` library is to deliver a robust, performant, and user-friendly promise implementation in Swift.  It aims to:

* **Simplify Asynchronous Programming:**  Make asynchronous code easier to write, understand, and maintain, reducing complexity associated with traditional callback approaches.
* **Improve Asynchronous Error Handling:** Provide a structured and centralized mechanism for managing errors in asynchronous workflows, leading to more resilient applications.
* **Enhance Code Readability and Structure:** Promote a more linear and less nested coding style, improving code comprehension and reducing cognitive load.
* **Ensure Interoperability:** Adhere strictly to the Promises/A+ specification, guaranteeing compatibility and seamless integration with other Promises/A+ compliant libraries and systems.

Key benefits of using the `then` library include:

* **Promise Composition:** Enables building complex asynchronous workflows by chaining and combining promises.
* **Clear Asynchronous Control Flow:** Provides a structured way to manage asynchronous operations, making the flow of execution explicit and easier to follow.
* **Improved Error Propagation:** Facilitates consistent and predictable error handling across asynchronous operations.
* **Enhanced Testability:** Simplifies testing of asynchronous code by providing a predictable and manageable structure.
* **Reduced Callback Hell:**  Avoids deeply nested callbacks, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.

## 3. System Architecture

The `then` library's architecture is centered around the `Promise` object and its interactions with resolvers and handlers. The following diagram illustrates the high-level architectural components:

    A["'Promise'"] -- "Manages state, result, and handler queues" --> B["'Resolver'"];
    A -- "Registers and manages handlers" --> C["'Handlers'"];
    B -- "Resolves or rejects the Promise (single-use)" --> A;
    C -- "Executed asynchronously upon Promise resolution/rejection" --> D["'Executor'"];
    D -- "Manages execution context (e.g., DispatchQueue, microtask queue)" --> C;

### 3.1. Component Description

* **Promise:**
    * **Responsibility:** Represents a future value or the possibility of an error. It is an immutable object representing the eventual result of an asynchronous operation.
    * **Design Aspects:**
        * **State Management:**  Maintains its internal state (pending, fulfilled, rejected) and transitions between these states based on the resolver's actions.
        * **Result Storage:** Stores the resolved value (on fulfillment) or the rejection reason (on rejection).
        * **Handler Queue:**  Maintains an ordered queue of `then`, `catch`, and `finally` handlers to be executed when the promise resolves or rejects.
        * **Immutability:** Once a promise is resolved or rejected, its state and result are immutable.
        * **Event-Driven:** Operates on an event-driven model, triggering handler execution upon state transitions.

* **Resolver:**
    * **Responsibility:**  Provides the controlled mechanism to settle a `Promise`. It is a single-use object given to the executor of the asynchronous operation to resolve or reject the associated promise.
    * **Design Aspects:**
        * **Single-Use:** Designed to be used only once to resolve or reject a promise. Subsequent calls have no effect, preventing accidental state changes.
        * **Controlled Settlement:**  Provides the only authorized way to transition a promise from the pending state to fulfilled or rejected.
        * **Encapsulation:**  Hides the promise's internal state from the external asynchronous operation, providing a clean interface for settlement.

* **Handlers:**
    * **Responsibility:** Define the actions to be performed when a `Promise` is fulfilled or rejected. They are functions registered with the promise using `then`, `catch`, and `finally` methods.
    * **Design Aspects:**
        * **Asynchronous Execution:** Handlers are designed to be executed asynchronously, typically within a microtask queue or dispatch queue, ensuring non-blocking behavior.
        * **Chaining Mechanism:** `then` handlers can return new promises, enabling promise chaining and sequential asynchronous workflows.
        * **Error Handling Separation:** `catch` handlers provide a dedicated mechanism for handling promise rejections, promoting clear separation of success and error paths.
        * **Guaranteed Execution (finally):** `finally` handlers ensure that cleanup or finalization logic is executed regardless of the promise's outcome.
        * **Microtask Queue:** Handlers are typically added to a microtask queue and executed after the current call stack is clear, ensuring predictable execution order within the asynchronous flow.

* **Executor:**
    * **Responsibility:** Manages the asynchronous execution context for both the initial asynchronous operation and the subsequent promise handlers.
    * **Design Aspects:**
        * **Concurrency Management:**  Leverages Swift's concurrency features, likely using Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) or similar mechanisms to manage asynchronous tasks and thread pools.
        * **Dispatch Queues:**  Utilizes dispatch queues (e.g., main queue, background queues, custom queues) to control where asynchronous operations and handlers are executed.
        * **Microtask Queue Integration:**  Likely incorporates a microtask queue (or emulates its behavior) to ensure Promises/A+ compliant handler execution order.
        * **Non-Blocking Operations:**  Ensures that promise operations and handler executions are non-blocking, maintaining responsiveness of the application.

## 4. Data Flow

The data flow in `then` revolves around the propagation of results and errors through promise chains. The following diagram illustrates a typical asynchronous operation and promise resolution flow:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["'Start Asynchronous Operation'"] --> B["'Executor provides Resolver'"];
    B --> C["'Asynchronous Task (e.g., Network Request)'"];
    C -- "Completes with Result or Error" --> D["'Resolver.resolve(result)' or 'Resolver.reject(error)'"];
    D --> E["'Promise State Transition (Fulfilled or Rejected)'"];
    E --> F{{"Microtask Queue"}};
    F -- "Enqueue Handlers" --> G["'Execute Handlers (then, catch, finally)'"];
    G -- "Handler returns Value or Promise" --> H["'Next Promise in Chain (if any)'"];
    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style B fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style E fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style F fill:#eef,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,stroke-dasharray: 5 5
    style G fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style H fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

### 4.1. Data Flow Description

1. **Initiate Asynchronous Operation:** An asynchronous operation is started, and a new `Promise` is created to represent its eventual result. The executor is provided with a `Resolver` object.
2. **Asynchronous Task Execution:** The asynchronous task (e.g., network request, file I/O, background computation) is executed.
3. **Operation Completion and Resolver Invocation:** Upon completion of the asynchronous task:
    * **Success:** If successful, the `Resolver.resolve(result)` method is called with the resulting value.
    * **Failure:** If an error occurs, the `Resolver.reject(error)` method is called with the error reason.
4. **Promise State Transition:** The `Promise` receives the resolution or rejection signal from the `Resolver` and updates its internal state to fulfilled or rejected, respectively, storing the result or error.
5. **Microtask Queue Enqueue:**  Instead of immediately executing handlers, the `then`, `catch`, and `finally` handlers associated with the promise are enqueued into a microtask queue. This ensures handlers are executed asynchronously but in a predictable order after the current synchronous execution context.
6. **Handler Execution from Microtask Queue:**  The event loop processes the microtask queue. Handlers are dequeued and executed one by one.
    * **`then` Handlers (Success Path):** Executed if the promise is fulfilled. They receive the resolved value.
    * **`catch` Handlers (Error Path):** Executed if the promise is rejected. They receive the rejection reason (error).
    * **`finally` Handlers:** Executed regardless of fulfillment or rejection, after `then` or `catch` handlers.
7. **Promise Chaining and Propagation:** If a `then` or `catch` handler returns a value, it implicitly resolves the next promise in the chain with that value. If a handler returns a new promise, the chain waits for that promise to settle before proceeding. Errors propagate down the chain until a `catch` handler is encountered.

## 5. Security Considerations (For Threat Modeling)

When using `then` within applications, consider the following security aspects during threat modeling. These are categorized for clarity and include potential threat modeling questions.

### 5.1. Availability Risks

* **Unhandled Promise Rejections leading to Application Instability:**
    * **Risk:** Unhandled rejections can lead to silent failures, unexpected application states, or crashes if errors are not gracefully managed.
    * **Threat Modeling Questions:**
        * Are all promise chains in critical workflows properly terminated with a `catch` handler or a global rejection handler?
        * What is the application's behavior when a promise rejection occurs in a core asynchronous operation? Are there fallback mechanisms or error reporting in place?
        * Could unhandled rejections lead to resource leaks or deadlocks, impacting application availability?

* **Denial of Service (DoS) through Asynchronous Task Abuse:**
    * **Risk:**  Malicious or unintentional creation of a large number of promises or excessively long promise chains could exhaust resources (memory, threads), leading to DoS.
    * **Threat Modeling Questions:**
        * Are there any uncontrolled inputs that could trigger the creation of a large number of promises?
        * Are there limits on the depth or complexity of promise chains that can be created?
        * How does the application handle resource exhaustion scenarios related to promise usage? Are there safeguards against runaway promise creation?

### 5.2. Integrity Risks

* **Data Corruption due to Race Conditions in Handlers:**
    * **Risk:** If promise handlers access and modify shared mutable state without proper synchronization, race conditions can occur, leading to data corruption or inconsistent application state.
    * **Threat Modeling Questions:**
        * Do promise handlers access shared mutable state? If so, what synchronization mechanisms are in place to prevent race conditions?
        * Are the asynchronous operations wrapped by promises thread-safe if they interact with shared resources?
        * Could a malicious actor manipulate the timing of asynchronous operations to exploit potential race conditions in promise handlers?

* **Error Handling Bypass or Manipulation:**
    * **Risk:**  Improperly implemented error handling in promise chains could allow errors to be bypassed or manipulated, potentially leading to incorrect application behavior or security vulnerabilities.
    * **Threat Modeling Questions:**
        * Are error handling paths in promise chains thoroughly tested and validated?
        * Could a malicious actor intentionally trigger or suppress errors in asynchronous operations to bypass security checks or manipulate application logic?
        * Is error information logged and monitored appropriately for security auditing and incident response?

### 5.3. Confidentiality Risks

* **Information Disclosure through Error Messages:**
    * **Risk:**  Error messages or rejection reasons propagated through promise chains might inadvertently expose sensitive information (e.g., internal paths, database connection strings, user data) if not carefully sanitized, especially in client-facing applications.
    * **Threat Modeling Questions:**
        * Are error messages and rejection reasons sanitized before being presented to users or logged in production environments?
        * Do error messages contain sensitive information that could be exploited by an attacker?
        * Is there a mechanism to control the level of detail in error messages based on the environment (e.g., detailed errors in development, generic errors in production)?

* **Dependency Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Risk:** Although less directly related to the design of `then`, vulnerabilities in `then` itself or its dependencies could introduce security risks into applications using it.
    * **Threat Modeling Questions:**
        * Is the `then` library regularly updated to address known vulnerabilities?
        * Are dependency checks performed to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities in the library's dependencies (if any)?
        * What is the process for responding to and patching security vulnerabilities discovered in the `then` library?

## 6. Deployment Considerations

`then` is deployed as a Swift library integrated into Swift applications. Deployment considerations are standard for Swift library integration.

* **Dependency Management Integration:** Utilize Swift Package Manager (SPM), CocoaPods, or Carthage to manage the `then` library dependency within your Swift project.
* **Swift Runtime Environment:** Ensure the target deployment environment supports the Swift runtime version compatible with the `then` library.
* **Binary Size Impact:** Be mindful of the potential impact of including the `then` library on the final binary size of your application, especially for resource-constrained environments.
* **Testing and Compatibility:** Thoroughly test applications using `then` across all target platforms and Swift versions to ensure compatibility and proper functionality.
