### 4. Deep Analysis of Mitigation Strategy: Code Reviews Focused on Closure Behavior

#### 4.1. Effectiveness Against Threats

*   **Unintended Side Effects in Configuration Closures (High Severity):**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  **High**. Code reviews, when diligently executed with a focus on closure behavior, are highly effective at catching unintended side effects. By explicitly scrutinizing the code within `then` closures, reviewers can identify logic errors, unexpected variable modifications, or unintended function calls that might lead to side effects. The dedicated review step and checklist ensure this aspect is not overlooked.
    *   **Justification:** Human review is excellent at understanding complex logic and identifying subtle anomalies that automated tools might miss. Focusing specifically on closures, which can often encapsulate complex logic in `then`, increases the likelihood of detection.
