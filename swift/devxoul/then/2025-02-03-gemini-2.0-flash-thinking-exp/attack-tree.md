## Attack Tree Path: [1.0 Exploit Misconfiguration via `then` [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_0_exploit_misconfiguration_via__then___critical_node_.md)

This is the overarching category for vulnerabilities arising from improper configuration practices when using `then`. It encompasses mistakes in how developers set up objects using the library, leading to security weaknesses.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Information Disclosure through Verbose Configuration [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_information_disclosure_through_verbose_configuration__critical_node_.md)

This focuses on the risk of unintentionally revealing sensitive information during the configuration process. This often happens when developers are overly verbose in logging or error handling, exposing details that should remain private.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Expose Sensitive Data in Configuration Closures (Logs, Errors) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_expose_sensitive_data_in_configuration_closures__logs__errors___critical_node_.md)

This is a more specific instance of information disclosure. It highlights the danger of embedding sensitive data directly within the configuration closures used with `then`. If these closures are then logged or exposed through error messages, the sensitive data becomes compromised.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.1 Log/Display Configuration Details Including Secrets [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_1_logdisplay_configuration_details_including_secrets__critical_node_.md)

This is the most critical and likely path within information disclosure. Developers might inadvertently log the entire configuration state of objects, including sensitive secrets like API keys, database credentials, or internal paths that are hardcoded within `then`'s configuration closures.  These logs, if accessible to attackers (e.g., through log files, error reporting systems, or even displayed in development environments left exposed), can directly reveal secrets.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Logic Flaws in Configuration Logic [CRITICAL NODE if Security Logic is Flawed]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_logic_flaws_in_configuration_logic__critical_node_if_security_logic_is_flawed_.md)

This path becomes high-risk *if* the application's security mechanisms are tightly coupled with the configuration of objects managed by `then`. If the configuration logic itself has flaws, or if it can be manipulated indirectly, attackers might be able to bypass security checks.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1 Bypass Security Checks via Configuration Manipulation [CRITICAL NODE if Security Logic is Flawed]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_bypass_security_checks_via_configuration_manipulation__critical_node_if_security_logic_is_flaw_e5e66604.md)

This is a more specific type of logic flaw. If security decisions (like authentication or authorization) are based on the state of objects configured using `then`, and the configuration process is vulnerable, attackers might be able to manipulate the configuration to bypass these security checks.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1.1 Modify Object State to Skip Authentication/Authorization [CRITICAL NODE if Security Logic is Flawed]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_1_modify_object_state_to_skip_authenticationauthorization__critical_node_if_security_logic_is__1ad0558d.md)

In this scenario, attackers aim to alter the configuration of authentication or authorization objects. By exploiting flaws in the configuration logic, they could potentially modify the object's state to a condition where authentication or authorization is bypassed entirely, granting them unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1.2 Alter Object Behavior to Circumvent Security Features [CRITICAL NODE if Security Logic is Flawed]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_2_alter_object_behavior_to_circumvent_security_features__critical_node_if_security_logic_is_fl_2ff68127.md)

Similar to bypassing authentication, attackers might target other security features. By manipulating the configuration of objects responsible for security features (like input validation, rate limiting, or access controls), they could alter their behavior to circumvent these security measures, weakening the application's defenses.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.0 Social Engineering/Developer-Side Attacks [CRITICAL NODE - General DevSec]](./attack_tree_paths/3_0_social_engineeringdeveloper-side_attacks__critical_node_-_general_devsec_.md)

This is a broader category encompassing attacks that target the development process and environment, rather than directly exploiting `then` itself.  It highlights the risk of attackers compromising developer systems to inject malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1 Compromise Developer Environment [CRITICAL NODE - General DevSec]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_compromise_developer_environment__critical_node_-_general_devsec_.md)

This is the most direct path within developer-side attacks. If an attacker gains access to a developer's machine or development environment, they can directly manipulate the application's codebase. This allows them to inject malicious configuration code, modify application logic to misuse `then`, or introduce other vulnerabilities, leading to full application compromise. This is a general security concern for all software development, not specific to `then`, but crucial to consider.
