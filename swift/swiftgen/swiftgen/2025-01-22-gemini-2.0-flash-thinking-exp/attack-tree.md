## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Application via SwiftGen [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_application_via_swiftgen__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the root goal of the attacker. Successful compromise means gaining unauthorized access, control, or causing damage to the application that utilizes SwiftGen.
*   **Attack Vectors Leading Here (High-Risk Paths originate from here):**
    *   Inject Malicious Code via SwiftGen
    *   Supply Chain Attack on SwiftGen Tool

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Inject Malicious Code via SwiftGen [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2__inject_malicious_code_via_swiftgen__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:**  The attacker aims to inject malicious code into the application's codebase through vulnerabilities or weaknesses related to SwiftGen's usage. This could lead to arbitrary code execution within the application.
*   **Attack Vectors Leading Here (High-Risk Paths originate from here):**
    *   Malicious Configuration Files
    *   Supply Chain Attack on SwiftGen Tool (indirectly, as a malicious SwiftGen can inject code)

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Malicious Configuration Files [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/3__malicious_configuration_files__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers target SwiftGen configuration files (YAML, TOML, JSON) as a vector for injecting malicious code. This is achieved by compromising the source of these files or exploiting weaknesses in how SwiftGen processes them.
*   **Attack Vectors Leading Here (High-Risk Paths originate from here):**
    *   Compromise Configuration File Source
    *   Inject Malicious Code via Custom Templates (if custom templates are configured via config files)

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Compromise Configuration File Source [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/4__compromise_configuration_file_source__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:**  To inject malicious configuration, attackers must first compromise the source where these files are stored and managed. This typically involves developer machines or Version Control Systems (VCS).
*   **Attack Vectors Leading Here (High-Risk Paths originate from here):**
    *   Compromise Developer Machine

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Compromise Developer Machine [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/5__compromise_developer_machine__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** Developer machines are often the weakest link in the security chain. Compromising a developer's machine provides attackers with access to sensitive project files, including SwiftGen configurations and potentially the ability to modify them.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Phishing:** Tricking developers into revealing credentials or installing malware through deceptive emails or websites.
    *   **Malware:** Infecting developer machines with viruses, trojans, or spyware to gain remote access and control.
    *   **Social Engineering:** Manipulating developers into performing actions that compromise security, such as sharing credentials or disabling security measures.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Inject Malicious Code via Custom Templates (if used) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/6__inject_malicious_code_via_custom_templates__if_used___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** If the project utilizes custom SwiftGen templates, these templates become a potential injection point. Attackers can modify these templates to generate malicious Swift code that will be incorporated into the application during the SwiftGen process.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Craft Malicious Template Logic:** Directly editing custom template files to include malicious code snippets or logic that executes harmful actions within the generated application. This requires understanding the template language and SwiftGen's context.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. Craft Malicious Template Logic [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/7__craft_malicious_template_logic__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the specific action of modifying the logic within custom templates to introduce malicious behavior. This could involve injecting code that performs unauthorized actions, steals data, or disrupts application functionality.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Template Injection:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in the template engine itself (though less likely in well-established template engines) or in how templates handle external input to inject code.
    *   **Logic Manipulation:**  Subtly altering the template's logic to generate code that appears normal but contains hidden malicious functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [8. Supply Chain Attack on SwiftGen Tool [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/8__supply_chain_attack_on_swiftgen_tool__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** This is a highly impactful attack where attackers compromise the SwiftGen tool itself at its distribution point. By distributing a malicious version of SwiftGen, attackers can potentially compromise any application that uses it.
*   **Attack Vectors Leading Here (High-Risk Paths originate from here):**
    *   Compromise SwiftGen Distribution Channel

## Attack Tree Path: [9. Compromise SwiftGen Distribution Channel [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/9__compromise_swiftgen_distribution_channel__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** To execute a supply chain attack, attackers must compromise the channels through which SwiftGen is distributed to developers. This primarily involves package manager registries.
*   **Attack Vectors Leading Here (High-Risk Paths originate from here):**
    *   Compromise Package Manager Registry

## Attack Tree Path: [10. Compromise Package Manager Registry (e.g., Homebrew, CocoaPods, Swift Package Manager) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/10__compromise_package_manager_registry__e_g___homebrew__cocoapods__swift_package_manager___high-ris_a9b9ab24.md)

*   **Description:** Package manager registries are central repositories for software packages. Compromising a registry or a maintainer account on a registry allows attackers to publish malicious versions of packages, including SwiftGen.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Compromised Registry Account:** Gaining unauthorized access to a legitimate maintainer's account on the package registry through credential theft, phishing, or social engineering.
    *   **Registry Vulnerability:** Exploiting security vulnerabilities within the package registry platform itself to inject or replace packages with malicious versions.
