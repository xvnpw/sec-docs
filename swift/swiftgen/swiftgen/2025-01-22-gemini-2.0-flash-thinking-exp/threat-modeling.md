# Threat Model Analysis for swiftgen/swiftgen

## Threat: [Malicious Code Injection via Asset Files](./threats/malicious_code_injection_via_asset_files.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Code Injection via Asset Files
*   **Description:** An attacker could modify asset files (e.g., storyboards, strings files) with malicious content. SwiftGen, during parsing, might interpret this content as code and inject it into the generated Swift source code. An attacker could gain code execution within the application by crafting malicious strings or storyboard elements that, when processed by SwiftGen, result in harmful Swift code being generated and subsequently executed by the application.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Code execution within the application's context.
    *   Data breaches or manipulation.
    *   Application instability or crashes.
    *   Compromise of user devices.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   SwiftGen Parsers (e.g., `strings`, `storyboards`, `plists` parsers)
    *   Code Generation Modules (across all generators)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization in SwiftGen:** SwiftGen developers should implement robust input validation and sanitization within the parsers to prevent interpretation of malicious content as code.
    *   **Secure Asset Management:** Store asset files in secure locations with restricted access to prevent unauthorized modifications. Use version control and code review processes for asset file changes.
    *   **Regular SwiftGen Updates:** Keep SwiftGen updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes in parsing and code generation logic.
    *   **Code Review of Generated Code:** Periodically review the generated Swift code to identify any unexpected or suspicious code patterns that might have originated from manipulated asset files.

## Threat: [Compromised SwiftGen Distribution (Supply Chain Attack)](./threats/compromised_swiftgen_distribution__supply_chain_attack_.md)

*   **Threat:** Compromised SwiftGen Distribution (Supply Chain Attack)
*   **Description:** An attacker could compromise SwiftGen's distribution channels (e.g., GitHub repository, release binaries, package managers). If a compromised version of SwiftGen is downloaded and used, it could inject malicious code into the development environment and potentially into the built application. An attacker could gain control over the SwiftGen repository or distribution mechanism to replace legitimate versions with malicious ones.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Injection of malicious code into development environments.
    *   Potential compromise of built applications.
    *   Wide-scale impact if many developers download and use the compromised version.
    *   Loss of trust in the SwiftGen tool and its ecosystem.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   SwiftGen Distribution Infrastructure (GitHub repository, release pipelines, package manager integrations)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Verify SwiftGen Source and Binaries:** Developers should verify the source repository (official SwiftGen GitHub) and, if possible, checksums or signatures of release binaries when downloading SwiftGen.
    *   **Use Reputable Package Managers:** Use reputable package managers (like Homebrew, Mint, or Swift Package Manager) and ensure they are configured to use trusted sources.
    *   **Monitor for Suspicious Activity:** Be vigilant for any unusual activity related to SwiftGen updates, downloads, or repository changes.
    *   **Code Signing and Checksums:** SwiftGen maintainers should implement code signing for releases and provide checksums to allow users to verify the integrity of downloaded binaries.
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication and Access Control:** SwiftGen maintainers should enforce multi-factor authentication and strong access controls for their development and release infrastructure.
