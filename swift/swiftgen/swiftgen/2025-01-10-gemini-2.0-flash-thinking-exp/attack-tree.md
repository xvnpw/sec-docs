# Attack Tree Analysis for swiftgen/swiftgen

Objective: Compromise application functionality or data by exploiting vulnerabilities introduced by SwiftGen.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
*   **CRITICAL NODE: Manipulate SwiftGen Configuration**
    *   **HIGH-RISK PATH:** Direct Modification of swiftgen.yml
    *   **HIGH-RISK PATH:** Indirect Modification via Dependency Confusion
*   **CRITICAL NODE: Inject Malicious Content into Resource Files**
    *   **HIGH-RISK PATH:** Inject Malicious Code via String Interpolation/Templates
```


## Attack Tree Path: [Direct Modification of swiftgen.yml](./attack_tree_paths/direct_modification_of_swiftgen_yml.md)

**Goal:** Alter configuration to inject malicious code or expose sensitive information paths.

**Attack:** Directly edit swiftgen.yml file in the project repository or on a developer's machine.

## Attack Tree Path: [Indirect Modification via Dependency Confusion](./attack_tree_paths/indirect_modification_via_dependency_confusion.md)

**Goal:** Introduce a malicious SwiftGen configuration through a compromised dependency.

**Attack:** Publish a malicious package with a similar name to a legitimate SwiftGen dependency.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code via String Interpolation/Templates](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_via_string_interpolationtemplates.md)

**Goal:** Embed executable code snippets in resource files.

**Attack:** Craft resource files containing specially formatted strings that, when processed by SwiftGen's templates, result in the generation of malicious code.
