# Attack Surface Analysis for swiftgen/swiftgen

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Configuration File](./attack_surfaces/malicious_configuration_file.md)

**Description:** A compromised or intentionally malicious `swiftgen.yml` (or similar configuration) file can instruct SwiftGen to perform unintended actions.

**How SwiftGen Contributes:** SwiftGen parses and executes instructions from the configuration file. If this file is tampered with, SwiftGen will follow those malicious instructions.

**Example:** An attacker modifies `swiftgen.yml` to include a script that executes arbitrary commands on the build machine during SwiftGen's execution.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine or build server, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or supply chain attacks.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict access controls and permissions on the `swiftgen.yml` file.
* Store the configuration file in a version control system and carefully review all changes.
* Consider using a configuration validation schema to ensure the file adheres to expected rules.
* Avoid storing sensitive information directly within the configuration file.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal in Configuration](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_in_configuration.md)

**Description:** The `swiftgen.yml` file might allow specifying paths to input files or output locations. If these paths are not properly sanitized, an attacker could use path traversal techniques to access or overwrite files outside the intended project scope.

**How SwiftGen Contributes:** SwiftGen uses the paths provided in the configuration to locate input files and write output files. Lack of sanitization makes it vulnerable to path traversal.

**Example:** An attacker modifies `swiftgen.yml` to set the output path to `/etc/passwd`, potentially overwriting critical system files during SwiftGen execution.

**Impact:** File system access and modification beyond the project scope, potentially leading to data corruption, information disclosure, or system instability.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure SwiftGen or the build process sanitizes and validates all paths provided in the configuration file.
* Use relative paths within the configuration where possible.
* Implement checks to prevent writing output files outside of designated directories.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised SwiftGen Gem](./attack_surfaces/compromised_swiftgen_gem.md)

**Description:** In a supply chain attack scenario, the official SwiftGen gem on RubyGems.org could be compromised, potentially injecting malicious code into the tool itself.

**How SwiftGen Contributes:**  Developers rely on the integrity of the official SwiftGen gem. If it's compromised, any project using it is at risk.

**Example:** A malicious actor gains access to the SwiftGen gem repository and injects code that exfiltrates sensitive data during the build process.

**Impact:**  Wide-ranging impact, potentially affecting all projects using the compromised version of SwiftGen, leading to data breaches, code injection, and supply chain compromise.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use a specific and locked version of SwiftGen in your project's Gemfile or similar dependency management system.
* Monitor security advisories and community discussions related to SwiftGen.
* Consider using tools that verify the integrity of downloaded dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure CI/CD Pipeline Integration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_cicd_pipeline_integration.md)

**Description:** If the CI/CD pipeline where SwiftGen is executed is not properly secured, attackers could potentially manipulate the environment or configuration to inject malicious code during the build process.

**How SwiftGen Contributes:** SwiftGen is a step in the build process within the CI/CD pipeline. If the pipeline is compromised, SwiftGen can be a vector for injecting malicious code.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to the CI/CD configuration and modifies the SwiftGen execution step to download and execute a malicious script before or after SwiftGen runs.

**Impact:**  Compromise of build artifacts, deployment of malicious code, or access to sensitive credentials within the CI/CD environment.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Secure the CI/CD pipeline with strong authentication and authorization.
* Implement proper input validation and sanitization within the CI/CD scripts.
* Regularly audit the CI/CD configuration for unauthorized changes.
* Use isolated and ephemeral build environments.
