# Threat Model Analysis for swiftgen/swiftgen

## Threat: [Malicious Image Exploitation](./threats/malicious_image_exploitation.md)

**Threat:** Malicious Image Exploitation

**Description:** An attacker embeds malicious data or exploits within an image file (e.g., PNG, JPEG) that is processed by SwiftGen. When SwiftGen parses this file, the malicious content could trigger vulnerabilities within the image processing libraries used by SwiftGen, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine or within the build environment.

**Impact:** Code execution on the developer's machine or build server, potentially compromising sensitive information, injecting malware into the build artifacts, or disrupting the development process.

**Affected SwiftGen Component:** `swiftgen images` module, specifically the image parsing functionality.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly vet the source of all image assets.
*   Implement static analysis tools that can scan asset files for potential threats.
*   Consider using sandboxed environments for running SwiftGen, especially when processing untrusted assets.
*   Keep SwiftGen and its underlying image processing libraries up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [YAML/JSON Injection in Configuration](./threats/yamljson_injection_in_configuration.md)

**Threat:** YAML/JSON Injection in Configuration

**Description:** An attacker gains control over the `swiftgen.yml` or other configuration files used by SwiftGen. They inject malicious code or commands within the YAML or JSON structure. When SwiftGen parses this configuration, the injected code could be executed by the YAML/JSON parsing library, potentially leading to arbitrary command execution on the developer's machine or build server.

**Impact:** Code execution on the developer's machine or build server, potentially compromising sensitive information, injecting malware into the build artifacts, or disrupting the development process.

**Affected SwiftGen Component:** Configuration parsing logic within the SwiftGen CLI.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Restrict write access to SwiftGen configuration files to authorized personnel only.
*   Store configuration files in version control and monitor changes for suspicious modifications.
*   Avoid constructing configuration files based on untrusted input.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Threat:** Dependency Vulnerabilities

**Description:** SwiftGen relies on third-party libraries for various functionalities. If these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, an attacker could potentially exploit these vulnerabilities through SwiftGen. This could involve crafting specific input files or triggering specific SwiftGen functionalities that utilize the vulnerable dependency.

**Impact:**  The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency, but it could range from denial of service to arbitrary code execution.

**Affected SwiftGen Component:** Various modules depending on the vulnerable dependency (e.g., image parsing, YAML parsing).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update SwiftGen to the latest version, which often includes updates to its dependencies.
*   Utilize dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in SwiftGen's dependencies.
*   Consider using tools like Swift Package Index to monitor dependency security advisories.

## Threat: [Compromised SwiftGen Distribution](./threats/compromised_swiftgen_distribution.md)

**Threat:** Compromised SwiftGen Distribution

**Description:** An attacker compromises the SwiftGen distribution channel (e.g., GitHub repository, release artifacts). They replace the legitimate SwiftGen binary with a malicious one. Developers unknowingly download and use this compromised binary, which could then execute arbitrary code on their machines or inject malware into the generated code.

**Impact:**  Complete compromise of the developer's machine or build environment, potentially leading to data theft, malware injection, and supply chain attacks.

**Affected SwiftGen Component:** The entire SwiftGen application.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Download SwiftGen from trusted sources only (official GitHub releases).
*   Verify the integrity of the downloaded binary using checksums (e.g., SHA256) provided by the SwiftGen maintainers.
*   Consider using package managers with security features and provenance tracking.
