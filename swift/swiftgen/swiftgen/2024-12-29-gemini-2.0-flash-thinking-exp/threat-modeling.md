### High and Critical SwiftGen Threats

This list includes only high and critical security threats that directly involve the SwiftGen tool.

*   Threat: Malicious Configuration File Injection/Modification
    *   Description: An attacker gains access to the project's repository or development environment and modifies the `.swiftgen.yml` configuration file. They might point SwiftGen to malicious input file locations or alter template paths to inject arbitrary code during generation.
    *   Impact: The application build process could be compromised, leading to the generation of code containing vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, remote code execution), inclusion of malicious resources, or disruption of the build pipeline.
    *   Affected SwiftGen Component: Configuration Parsing (within the core SwiftGen library).
    *   Risk Severity: High
    *   Mitigation Strategies:
        *   Secure access to the project repository and development environments with strong authentication and authorization.
        *   Implement code review processes for all changes to the `.swiftgen.yml` file.
        *   Store the configuration file securely and restrict write access.
        *   Consider using a configuration management system to track and control changes.

*   Threat: Malicious Input Files Leading to Code Injection
    *   Description: An attacker with write access to the project's input files (e.g., `.strings`, `.xcassets`, `.storyboard`) modifies them to include malicious content. SwiftGen then processes these files and generates code that incorporates the malicious payload. This could involve injecting script tags in string files intended for web views or crafting resource names that exploit vulnerabilities in resource loading mechanisms.
    *   Impact: The generated application code could contain vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS), arbitrary code execution, or data exfiltration, depending on the context where the generated code is used.
    *   Affected SwiftGen Component: Parsers for various input file types (e.g., `StringsParser`, `AssetsCatalogParser`, `InterfaceBuilderParser`). Code generation logic within templates.
    *   Risk Severity: Critical
    *   Mitigation Strategies:
        *   Strictly control write access to input files used by SwiftGen.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization on the content of these files before they are processed by SwiftGen (although this might be complex depending on the file type).
        *   Regularly review the content of input files for any unexpected or suspicious changes.
        *   Consider using digital signatures or checksums to verify the integrity of input files.

*   Threat: Exploiting Vulnerabilities in SwiftGen Itself
    *   Description: A vulnerability exists within the SwiftGen codebase that an attacker could exploit. This could involve crafting specific input files or configuration settings that trigger a bug in SwiftGen, leading to unexpected behavior, crashes, or the generation of insecure code.
    *   Impact: Unpredictable behavior during code generation, potential generation of vulnerable code, or disruption of the build process.
    *   Affected SwiftGen Component: Any part of the SwiftGen codebase, depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   Risk Severity: Varies (can be Critical if it leads to code injection, otherwise High).
    *   Mitigation Strategies:
        *   Keep SwiftGen updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
        *   Monitor SwiftGen's release notes and security advisories for any reported vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider contributing to SwiftGen's security by reporting any potential vulnerabilities you discover.
