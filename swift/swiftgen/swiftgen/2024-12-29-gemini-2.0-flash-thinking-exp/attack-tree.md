## Threat Model: Compromising Applications Using SwiftGen - High-Risk Sub-Tree

**Objective:** Compromise application using SwiftGen by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the project itself.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

* Compromise Application Using SwiftGen **(CRITICAL NODE)**
    * Introduce Malicious Code via SwiftGen **(HIGH RISK PATH START)**
        * Inject Malicious Content into SwiftGen Input Files **(CRITICAL NODE)**
            * YAML/JSON Injection **(HIGH RISK, CRITICAL NODE)**
            * Exploit Vulnerabilities in Custom Templates **(HIGH RISK, CRITICAL NODE)**
            * Exploit SwiftGen Configuration Weaknesses **(HIGH RISK, CRITICAL NODE)**
    * Compromise the SwiftGen Execution Environment **(HIGH RISK PATH START)**
        * Supply Chain Attack on SwiftGen Dependencies **(CRITICAL NODE)**
        * Compromise the Machine Running SwiftGen **(HIGH RISK, CRITICAL NODE)**

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**High-Risk Paths:**

* **Introduce Malicious Code via SwiftGen:**
    * This path encompasses all methods by which an attacker can inject malicious code into the application through the SwiftGen code generation process. This is considered high-risk because successful exploitation directly leads to the inclusion of attacker-controlled code within the application's codebase.

* **Compromise the SwiftGen Execution Environment:**
    * This path focuses on attacks that target the environment where SwiftGen is executed. Gaining control of this environment allows attackers to manipulate SwiftGen's behavior, input, or output, effectively bypassing many security controls and enabling the injection of malicious code.

**Critical Nodes:**

* **Compromise Application Using SwiftGen:**
    * This is the root goal of the attacker and represents the ultimate successful compromise of the application.

* **Inject Malicious Content into SwiftGen Input Files:**
    * This node represents a critical control point. If an attacker can successfully inject malicious content into the files that SwiftGen processes (YAML, JSON, Storyboards, strings files, assets), they can directly influence the generated code.

* **YAML/JSON Injection:**
    * Attackers can inject malicious code or commands within YAML or JSON configuration files used by SwiftGen. When SwiftGen parses these files, it might inadvertently execute the injected code, potentially granting the attacker access to the file system or allowing them to run arbitrary commands on the build machine.

* **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Custom Templates:**
    * If developers use custom Stencil templates for code generation, attackers can introduce malicious logic or insecure practices within these templates. This directly injects vulnerabilities into the generated code, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) if generating web content, or insecure data handling.

* **Exploit SwiftGen Configuration Weaknesses:**
    * Attackers can manipulate SwiftGen's configuration files to point to malicious input files or templates hosted on their own infrastructure. This forces SwiftGen to process attacker-controlled files, leading to the injection of malicious code into the application.

* **Supply Chain Attack on SwiftGen Dependencies:**
    * Attackers can compromise a dependency of SwiftGen (e.g., Stencil, Yams) and inject malicious code into it. When SwiftGen uses this compromised dependency, the malicious code will be executed during SwiftGen's operation, potentially allowing access to project files or secrets.

* **Compromise the Machine Running SwiftGen:**
    * If an attacker gains access to the developer's machine or the CI/CD environment where SwiftGen is executed, they can directly manipulate SwiftGen's configuration, input files, or even replace the SwiftGen executable with a malicious version. This provides a direct path to injecting malicious code into the application build process.
