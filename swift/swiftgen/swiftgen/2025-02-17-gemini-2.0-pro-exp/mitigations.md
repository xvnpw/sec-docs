# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for swiftgen/swiftgen

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Configuration File Schema Validation](./mitigation_strategies/strict_configuration_file_schema_validation.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Implement robust schema validation for `swiftgen.yml`.

**Description:**
1.  **Define a Schema:** Create a formal schema definition (e.g., JSON Schema, YAML Schema) that specifies allowed structure, data types, and values for `swiftgen.yml`.  Be highly restrictive.
2.  **Choose a Validation Tool:** Select a YAML validation library/tool (e.g., Yams in Swift, `yamale`, `kubeval` for CI/CD).
3.  **Integrate Validation:**
    *   **Pre-Commit Hook:** Integrate as a pre-commit hook to prevent committing invalid configurations.
    *   **CI/CD Pipeline:** Include validation in your CI/CD pipeline; fail the build on invalid configurations.
4.  **Schema Enforcement:** Validation should:
    *   Check required keys.
    *   Verify data types.
    *   Enforce allowed values (regex for paths, enums for parsers).
    *   Reject unknown keys.
5.  **Error Handling:** Provide clear error messages on validation failures.
6.  **Regular Schema Updates:** Update the schema as SwiftGen and project needs evolve.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Code Injection (High Severity):** Prevents malicious code injection via the configuration file.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Limits configurations that cause excessive resource use.
*   **Path Traversal (High Severity):** Controls input/output paths, preventing access outside project directories.
*   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Reduces risk by limiting configuration options and validating input.

**Impact:**
*   **Code Injection:** Significantly reduces risk; almost eliminates it with a comprehensive schema.
*   **DoS:** Reduces risk, but doesn't fully eliminate it.
*   **Path Traversal:** Significantly reduces risk; very effective with robust path validation.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Reduces risk.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   *Example:* Partially implemented. Basic `yamale` validation in CI/CD, checks for required keys only. No pre-commit hook.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Pre-commit hook.
*   Comprehensive schema (data types, allowed values, unknown key rejection).
*   Regular schema updates.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Template Sandboxing](./mitigation_strategies/template_sandboxing.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce sandboxing within Stencil templates.

**Description:**
1.  **Review Stencil Documentation:** Understand Stencil's security features and limitations.
2.  **Disable Unsafe Features:** Disable/restrict:
    *   `include` tag (or strictly control paths).
    *   Custom filters/tags doing file system operations, network access, or command execution.
3.  **Context Control:** Carefully control data passed to the Stencil context; provide only the minimum necessary data.
4.  **Custom Filter/Tag Auditing:** Meticulously audit custom filters/tags for vulnerabilities. Prefer built-in filters.
5.  **Regular Audits:** Periodically review templates and custom filters/tags.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Code Injection (High Severity):** Limits malicious code injection through templates.
*   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Reduces data exposure by controlling context and external resource access.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Low Severity):** Indirectly helps by limiting template complexity.

**Impact:**
*   **Code Injection:** Significantly reduces risk.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Reduces risk.
*   **DoS:** Minor impact.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   *Example:* Not implemented. Relying on default Stencil behavior.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Explicit Stencil configuration to disable/restrict unsafe features.
*   Template review and auditing.
*   Guidelines for secure template writing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Sanitization](./mitigation_strategies/input_sanitization.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Sanitize all input values used within templates.

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Input Sources:** Determine all input sources used in templates (configuration values, data from source files).
2.  **Escaping:** Apply appropriate escaping:
    *   **HTML/XML Escaping:** Use `escape` or `xmlEscape` filters for web contexts.
    *   **Swift String Escaping:** Ensure strings are valid Swift code (escape quotes, backslashes).
3.  **Path Validation:** For file paths:
    *   **Normalize Paths:** Resolve relative paths, remove redundancies.
    *   **Whitelist Allowed Directories:** Only allow paths within specific project directories. Reject `..` and absolute paths.
    *   **Check Existence (Optional):** Verify file/directory existence if appropriate.
4.  **Length Limits:** Impose reasonable length limits on input strings.
5.  **Type Validation:** Ensure input values conform to expected data types.
6.  **Encoding:** Ensure that the input is properly encoded.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Code Injection (High Severity):** Prevents code injection by escaping and validating input.
*   **Path Traversal (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized file access via strict path validation.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Reduces risk of large output by limiting input lengths.

**Impact:**
*   **Code Injection:** Significantly reduces risk; essential for prevention.
*   **Path Traversal:** Significantly reduces risk; crucial for prevention.
*   **DoS:** Reduces risk.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   *Example:* Partially implemented. Some use of `escape` filter, but not consistent. No path validation.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Consistent escaping in all templates.
*   Robust path validation.
*   Length limits.
*   Type validation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege (File System Access)](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege__file_system_access_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Run SwiftGen with minimal file system permissions.

**Description:**
1. **Identify Required Permissions:** Determine the *minimum* read and write permissions SwiftGen needs to function correctly. This usually involves read access to source files and write access to the output directory.
2. **Dedicated User/Group (Optional):** Consider creating a dedicated user or group with limited permissions specifically for running SwiftGen. This is more common in server environments but can be beneficial for local development as well.
3. **Restrict Access:** Configure file system permissions to grant only the necessary access to the identified user/group or the user running SwiftGen. Avoid granting write access to the entire project directory or any sensitive system locations.
4. **Containerization (Recommended):** If possible, run SwiftGen within a container (e.g., Docker). This provides strong isolation and limits the potential impact of any vulnerabilities. The container should be configured with minimal file system mounts, only exposing the necessary input and output directories.
5. **CI/CD Integration:** Ensure that your CI/CD pipeline runs SwiftGen with the same restricted permissions. Avoid running build steps as root or with overly permissive users.

**Threats Mitigated:**
* **Path Traversal (High Severity):** Limits the damage an attacker can do if they manage to exploit a path traversal vulnerability. Even if they can manipulate a path, they won't be able to write to arbitrary locations on the file system.
* **Code Injection (Medium Severity):** Indirectly mitigates code injection by limiting the potential impact. If an attacker injects code that attempts to write to the file system, the limited permissions will prevent it from affecting sensitive areas.
* **Denial of Service (DoS) (Low Severity):** Can help prevent certain DoS attacks that rely on writing large amounts of data to the file system.

**Impact:**
* **Path Traversal:** Significantly reduces the impact of successful path traversal attacks.
* **Code Injection:** Provides a secondary layer of defense, limiting the damage from successful code injection.
* **DoS:** Offers some protection against specific DoS scenarios.

**Currently Implemented:**
* *Example:* Not implemented. SwiftGen is run with the developer's user account, which has broad write access to the project.

**Missing Implementation:**
* Running SwiftGen with a dedicated user/group with limited permissions.
* Containerizing SwiftGen for stronger isolation.
* Configuring the CI/CD pipeline to run SwiftGen with restricted permissions.
