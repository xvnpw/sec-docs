## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Code via SwiftGen Exploit [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_code_via_swiftgen_exploit__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the ultimate objective of the attacker.  Successful exploitation of any of the underlying vulnerabilities leads to this outcome.
*   **Impact:** Very High. Complete control over the developer's machine or the build process, potentially leading to compromise of the application, source code, credentials, and other sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Template Manipulation Attack (Stencils) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/template_manipulation_attack__stencils___critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This attack vector focuses on manipulating the Stencil templates used by SwiftGen to generate code.  It's considered critical due to its versatility and the potential for high impact.
*   **Impact:** High.  Successful template manipulation leads to arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Stencil Template (Remote) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_stencil_template__remote___high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker creates a malicious Stencil template and hosts it on a publicly accessible location (e.g., a GitHub repository, a compromised website).  They then trick a developer into using this template, either through social engineering, by compromising a dependency that references the template, or by exploiting a vulnerability that allows them to inject the template's URL.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium. Developers often use third-party templates.
*   **Impact:** High. Arbitrary code execution.
*   **Effort:** Medium. Requires creating the template and finding a distribution method.
*   **Skill Level:** Medium. Requires Stencil knowledge and potentially social engineering skills.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium. Requires careful code review of the template.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Existing Template [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/modify_existing_template__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker gains unauthorized access to the project's source code repository (e.g., through compromised credentials, a supply chain attack, or a vulnerability in the version control system) and modifies an existing Stencil template to include malicious code.
*   **Likelihood:** Low. Requires compromising the repository.
*   **Impact:** High. Arbitrary code execution.
*   **Effort:** High. Requires gaining unauthorized access.
*   **Skill Level:** High. Requires skills in compromising version control or exploiting vulnerabilities.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High. Depends on repository auditing and monitoring.

## Attack Tree Path: [Host Malicious Stencil on Public Repo [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/host_malicious_stencil_on_public_repo__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Similar to injecting a remote template, but specifically focuses on hosting the malicious template on a seemingly legitimate public repository (like GitHub). The attacker relies on developers finding and using the template, potentially through misleading names or descriptions.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium. Developers may search for and use templates from public sources.
*   **Impact:** High. Arbitrary code execution.
*   **Effort:** Medium. Requires creating the template and hosting it.
*   **Skill Level:** Medium. Requires Stencil knowledge and potentially social engineering skills.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium. Requires careful code review and vetting of the template's source.

## Attack Tree Path: [Dependency Hijacking/Poisoning (of SwiftGen itself)](./attack_tree_paths/dependency_hijackingpoisoning__of_swiftgen_itself_.md)

*    **Description:** This attack vector targets SwiftGen itself, aiming to compromise the tool before it's even used by the developer.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise SwiftGen's Repository (GitHub) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_swiftgen's_repository__github___high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker gains control of the official SwiftGen repository (e.g., on GitHub) and modifies the source code to include malicious functionality.  This is a low-likelihood, but extremely high-impact event.
*   **Likelihood:** Low. Requires compromising a well-secured repository.
*   **Impact:** Very High. Widespread compromise of all SwiftGen users.
*   **Effort:** Very High. Requires significant resources and expertise.
*   **Skill Level:** Very High. Advanced hacking skills, potentially insider access.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** High. Requires sophisticated monitoring and intrusion detection.

## Attack Tree Path: [Publish Malicious Package (CocoaPods, SPM, etc.) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/publish_malicious_package__cocoapods__spm__etc____high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker publishes a malicious package to a package manager (e.g., CocoaPods, Swift Package Manager) that either impersonates SwiftGen (typosquatting) or is a legitimate-looking package that includes SwiftGen as a compromised dependency.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium. Typosquatting and dependency confusion attacks are increasingly common.
*   **Impact:** High. Arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine.
*   **Effort:** Medium. Requires creating and publishing the malicious package.
*   **Skill Level:** Medium. Requires knowledge of package management.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium. Requires careful verification of package names and authors.
*    **Wait for Developer to Install:**
    *   **Description:** After publishing malicious package, attacker waits for developer to install it.

## Attack Tree Path: [Social Engineer Dev to Use Malicious Package [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/social_engineer_dev_to_use_malicious_package__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker uses social engineering techniques (e.g., phishing emails, fake blog posts, misleading documentation) to convince a developer to install a malicious package that compromises SwiftGen or includes it as a compromised dependency.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium. Depends on the attacker's social engineering skills.
*   **Impact:** High. Arbitrary code execution.
*   **Effort:** Medium. Requires crafting a convincing social engineering attack.
*   **Skill Level:** Medium. Requires strong social engineering skills.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium. Relies on developer vigilance and awareness.
