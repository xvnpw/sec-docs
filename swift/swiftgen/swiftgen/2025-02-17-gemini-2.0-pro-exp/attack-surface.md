# Attack Surface Analysis for swiftgen/swiftgen

## Attack Surface: [Template Manipulation/Poisoning (Repository/Storage)](./attack_surfaces/template_manipulationpoisoning__repositorystorage_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers gain unauthorized write access to where SwiftGen templates are stored and modify or inject malicious templates.
    *   **How SwiftGen Contributes:** SwiftGen's core function is processing user/third-party Stencil templates. This reliance on external templates is the direct vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** An attacker compromises a developer's machine and alters a `colors.stencil` template to include a command that steals project source code during the next build.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Build environment compromise (theft of secrets, API keys, certificates).
        *   Build process modification (altering settings, injecting malicious code elsewhere in the app).
        *   Source code exfiltration.
        *   Build-time backdoor installation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Access Control:** Least privilege principle. Only grant write access to authorized developers. Strong authentication/authorization.
        *   **Code Reviews:** Mandatory code reviews for *all* template changes.
        *   **Template Integrity Verification:** Pre-build script to calculate checksums (e.g., SHA-256) and compare against a known-good list. Reject builds on mismatch.
        *   **Version Control:** Store templates in Git (or similar) for tracking, auditing, and rollback.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Run SwiftGen in a sandboxed environment (e.g., Docker) with restricted access to the host.
        *   **Regular Audits:** Audit access controls and review template changes regularly.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Custom Templates (Command-Line Injection)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_custom_templates__command-line_injection_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers influence SwiftGen's command-line arguments (e.g., `--templatePath`) to point to a malicious template.
    *   **How SwiftGen Contributes:** SwiftGen provides command-line options for custom template locations, which can be abused if not secured.
    *   **Example:** CI/CD pipeline compromise; attacker modifies the SwiftGen build step to use `--templatePath /tmp/evil.stencil`, containing code to install a backdoor.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Same as "Template Manipulation/Poisoning": build environment compromise, build process modification, data exfiltration, backdoor installation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Harden Build Scripts:** Secure build scripts and CI/CD configurations. Avoid user input in SwiftGen arguments. Sanitize input if necessary.
        *   **Validate Template Paths:** If custom paths are needed, use strict validation. Whitelist allowed (absolute) paths. Reject others. Avoid relative paths.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the build with minimal privileges.
        *   **Input Sanitization:** If template paths come from input, rigorously sanitize to prevent path traversal/injection.
        *   **Configuration as Code:** Treat build configs (including SwiftGen commands) as code. Version control, code reviews, apply security principles.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities within SwiftGen Itself](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_within_swiftgen_itself.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitable bugs within SwiftGen's code (parsing, template engine, code generation) are triggered by malformed input.
    *   **How SwiftGen Contributes:**  SwiftGen's complexity in parsing various input formats and generating code creates a (relatively low, but present) potential for vulnerabilities. This is inherent to the software's function.
    *   **Example:**  A crafted, malformed asset catalog triggers a buffer overflow in SwiftGen, leading to code execution during the build.
    *   **Impact:**  Potentially arbitrary code execution during the build process. Attacker likely needs control over input files.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep SwiftGen Updated:**  Regularly update to the latest version. Subscribe to release notifications.
        *   **Input Validation (Indirect):** Ensure input files (asset catalogs, strings files, etc.) are well-formed. Reduces the chance of triggering vulnerabilities.
        *   **Fuzzing (Advanced):**  Consider fuzzing SwiftGen with malformed inputs (specialized technique).
        *   **Monitor Security Advisories:**  Check for advisories on GitHub, security lists.
        *   **Static Analysis (Advanced):** Scan SwiftGen's source code for vulnerabilities.
