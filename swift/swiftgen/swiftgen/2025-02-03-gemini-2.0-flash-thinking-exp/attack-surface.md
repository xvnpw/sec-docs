# Attack Surface Analysis for swiftgen/swiftgen

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Input File Injection](./attack_surfaces/malicious_input_file_injection.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers inject malicious content into input files (e.g., `.strings`, `.xcassets`, `.json`, `.yaml`) that SwiftGen processes, leading to code injection or other severe impacts.

    *   **SwiftGen Contribution:** SwiftGen directly parses and uses the content of these input files to generate Swift code. Compromised input files directly translate to vulnerabilities in the generated code.

    *   **Example:** An attacker modifies a `.strings` file to include a string that, when processed by SwiftGen and used in the application, executes arbitrary code due to a format string vulnerability or similar injection point in the application's code that uses the generated string.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Remote Code Execution (if injected code is executed).
        *   Information Disclosure (if injected content leaks sensitive data).
        *   Denial of Service (if injected content causes crashes or performance issues).
        *   Application Logic Manipulation (if injected content alters application behavior).

    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input File Integrity Checks:** Implement version control and integrity checks (e.g., checksums, digital signatures) for input files to detect unauthorized modifications.
        *   **Secure Input File Storage:** Store input files in secure locations with restricted access to prevent unauthorized modifications.
        *   **Input File Auditing:** Regularly audit input files for unexpected or suspicious content changes.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant access to modify input files only to authorized personnel and processes.
        *   **Code Review of Generated Code:** Review the generated Swift code, especially parts derived from external input files, to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
        *   **Input Validation (Application Side):** Even though SwiftGen generates code, the application using this code should still perform input validation on data derived from generated resources where appropriate, especially if used in security-sensitive contexts.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious SwiftGen Configuration (`swiftgen.yml`) Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/malicious_swiftgen_configuration___swiftgen_yml___manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers modify the `swiftgen.yml` configuration file to alter SwiftGen's behavior, leading to malicious code generation or build process compromise.

    *   **SwiftGen Contribution:** `swiftgen.yml` controls SwiftGen's execution, including input file paths, output paths, templates, and parsers. Compromising this file allows attackers to redirect SwiftGen to malicious sources or manipulate its output.

    *   **Example:** An attacker modifies `swiftgen.yml` to:
        *   Point SwiftGen to malicious input files under attacker control, injecting malicious content into the generated code.
        *   Change the output path to overwrite critical application files with malicious generated code, potentially replacing legitimate application components.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Code Injection (via malicious input files).
        *   Build Process Manipulation leading to application compromise.
        *   Supply Chain Compromise (if configuration changes introduce malicious dependencies or processes indirectly).

    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Configuration File Integrity Checks:** Implement version control and integrity checks for `swiftgen.yml`.
        *   **Secure Configuration File Storage:** Store `swiftgen.yml` securely with restricted access.
        *   **Configuration Change Review:** Mandate code reviews for any changes to `swiftgen.yml` before they are applied.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Restrict access to modify `swiftgen.yml` to authorized personnel and processes.
        *   **Automated Configuration Validation:** Implement automated checks to validate the `swiftgen.yml` configuration against a known good state or schema.
