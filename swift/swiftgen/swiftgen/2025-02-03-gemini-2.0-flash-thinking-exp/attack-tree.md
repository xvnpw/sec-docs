## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Application via SwiftGen [CRITICAL NODE] (Root Goal):](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_application_via_swiftgen__critical_node___root_goal_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success here means the attacker has achieved some level of control or negative impact on the application that utilizes SwiftGen.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Inject Malicious Code via SwiftGen [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/2__inject_malicious_code_via_swiftgen__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

This is a primary attack vector. By injecting malicious code through SwiftGen, the attacker aims to have their code executed within the context of the application. This could lead to data breaches, unauthorized actions, or complete application takeover.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Malicious Configuration Files [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/3__malicious_configuration_files__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

SwiftGen relies on configuration files (YAML, TOML, JSON) to define how assets are processed and code is generated.

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker modifies these configuration files to introduce malicious instructions or logic that SwiftGen will then use to generate compromised code.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Compromise Configuration File Source [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/4__compromise_configuration_file_source__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

To inject malicious configuration files, the attacker needs to compromise the source where these files are stored and managed.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Compromise Developer Machine [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   This is a highly effective way to manipulate configuration files. If an attacker gains access to a developer's machine, they can directly modify the configuration files before they are used by SwiftGen.
        *   **Examples:** Phishing emails to steal developer credentials, malware infections on developer machines, social engineering to trick developers into running malicious code or providing access.
    *   **Compromise Version Control System (VCS):** (While marked as lower risk overall, it's still a path to compromise configuration files)
        *   If configuration files are stored in VCS (like Git), compromising the VCS allows the attacker to modify the files in the repository, affecting all developers and builds using that repository.
        *   **Examples:** Stolen VCS credentials, exploiting vulnerabilities in the VCS platform itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Inject Malicious Code via Custom Templates (if used) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/5__inject_malicious_code_via_custom_templates__if_used___high-risk_path_.md)

SwiftGen allows for custom templates to control code generation. If a project uses custom templates, they become a potential attack surface.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Craft Malicious Template Logic [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   An attacker modifies the custom templates to inject malicious code directly into the generated output. This code will then be compiled and run as part of the application.
        *   This is especially dangerous if templates are complex or process external data, as vulnerabilities in template logic can be exploited.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Supply Chain Attack on SwiftGen Tool [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/6__supply_chain_attack_on_swiftgen_tool__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

This is a broad and impactful attack vector that targets the SwiftGen tool itself, rather than just project-specific configurations or assets.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Compromise SwiftGen Distribution Channel [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   The attacker aims to compromise the mechanisms used to distribute SwiftGen to developers.
        *   **Compromise Package Manager Registry (e.g., Homebrew, CocoaPods, Swift Package Manager) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   Package managers are a common way to install SwiftGen. If an attacker can compromise a package manager registry and upload a malicious version of SwiftGen, they can distribute malware to a wide range of developers who unknowingly download the compromised tool.
            *   **Examples:** Compromising maintainer accounts on package registries, exploiting vulnerabilities in the registry platform itself to inject malicious packages.
    *   **Compromise SwiftGen GitHub Repository:** (While marked as lower risk overall for *direct code injection*, it's still a path for release tampering)
        *   Compromising the official SwiftGen GitHub repository could allow an attacker to tamper with releases, potentially injecting malicious code into official SwiftGen versions.
        *   **Examples:** Compromised maintainer accounts on GitHub, exploiting vulnerabilities in GitHub's infrastructure.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. Malicious Asset Files [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/7__malicious_asset_files__high-risk_path_.md)

SwiftGen processes various asset files (images, strings, storyboards, etc.). Maliciously crafted asset files can be used to exploit vulnerabilities in SwiftGen's processing logic.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Compromise Asset File Source [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   Similar to configuration files, attackers need to compromise the source of asset files to inject malicious ones.
        *   **Compromise Developer Machine [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** (Same as described above for configuration files)
            *   Directly modifying asset files on a compromised developer machine.
