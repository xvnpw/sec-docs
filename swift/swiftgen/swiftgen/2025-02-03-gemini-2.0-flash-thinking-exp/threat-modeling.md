# Threat Model Analysis for swiftgen/swiftgen

## Threat: [Malicious `swiftgen.yml` Configuration File](./threats/malicious__swiftgen_yml__configuration_file.md)

**Description:** An attacker modifies the `swiftgen.yml` file to inject malicious commands that SwiftGen executes during its run. This could be achieved by exploiting features in SwiftGen that allow custom scripts or by finding vulnerabilities in YAML parsing. The attacker aims to gain control over the build process and potentially the development environment.

**Impact:**
*   **Code Injection:** Injecting malicious code into the generated Swift files, leading to application compromise at runtime.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Stealing sensitive data from the development environment by executing commands that access files or network resources.
*   **Remote Code Execution (in build environment):**  Achieving arbitrary code execution on the build machine, potentially compromising the entire development infrastructure.

**SwiftGen Component Affected:** `swiftgen.yml` configuration parsing and execution, core SwiftGen execution engine.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Strict Access Control:** Implement rigorous access control to the `swiftgen.yml` file, limiting write access to only highly trusted and necessary personnel.
*   **Mandatory Code Review:** Enforce mandatory code reviews for all changes to `swiftgen.yml` to detect and prevent malicious modifications.
*   **Input Sanitization (SwiftGen Improvement):** SwiftGen should implement robust input validation and sanitization for the `swiftgen.yml` file to prevent command injection and other forms of malicious input.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run SwiftGen processes with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the potential damage from a successful exploit.

## Threat: [Malicious or Compromised Asset Files (Exploiting Parsing Vulnerabilities)](./threats/malicious_or_compromised_asset_files__exploiting_parsing_vulnerabilities_.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts malicious asset files (strings, images, colors, etc.) designed to exploit parsing vulnerabilities within SwiftGen or its underlying libraries. By providing these crafted files as input to SwiftGen, the attacker aims to trigger vulnerabilities during the asset parsing stage.

**Impact:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (in build environment):** Successful exploitation of parsing vulnerabilities could lead to arbitrary code execution within the SwiftGen process, compromising the build machine.
*   **Denial of Service:** Malicious asset files could crash SwiftGen during code generation, disrupting the build process and potentially causing significant delays.

**SwiftGen Component Affected:** Asset parsing modules (e.g., `strings`, `images`, `colors` parsers) and potentially core SwiftGen execution engine if vulnerabilities are severe.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Trusted Asset Sources:** Ensure asset files are sourced only from trusted and controlled locations. Implement strict controls over who can add or modify asset files.
*   **Regular SwiftGen Updates:** Keep SwiftGen and its dependencies updated to the latest versions to patch known parsing vulnerabilities. Regularly monitor SwiftGen's release notes and security advisories.
*   **Static Analysis of Assets:** Consider using static analysis tools to scan asset files for potentially malicious content or malformed structures before processing them with SwiftGen.
*   **Robust Input Validation (SwiftGen Improvement):** SwiftGen should implement comprehensive input validation and sanitization for all asset file types to prevent exploitation of parsing vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Compromised SwiftGen Distribution (Supply Chain Attack)](./threats/compromised_swiftgen_distribution__supply_chain_attack_.md)

**Description:** An attacker compromises the SwiftGen distribution channels (e.g., GitHub releases, package manager repositories) and replaces the legitimate SwiftGen binary with a malicious version. Developers unknowingly download and use this compromised SwiftGen, executing the attacker's malicious code as part of their build process.

**Impact:**
*   **Development Environment Compromise:** Malicious SwiftGen can compromise the developer's machine and development environment, allowing the attacker to steal code, credentials, or inject backdoors.
*   **Backdoored Applications:** The compromised SwiftGen could inject malicious code directly into the generated application, leading to widespread compromise of applications built using the malicious tool.

**SwiftGen Component Affected:** Entire SwiftGen distribution and installation process, impacting all SwiftGen modules and functionalities.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Official and Trusted Sources Only:** Download SwiftGen exclusively from official and highly trusted sources, such as the official GitHub releases or reputable package manager repositories. Avoid downloading from unofficial or untrusted websites.
*   **Integrity Verification (Checksums/Signatures):** Verify the integrity of downloaded SwiftGen binaries using checksums or digital signatures provided by the SwiftGen project whenever possible.
*   **Reputable Package Managers:** Utilize reputable package managers that have security measures in place to detect and prevent supply chain attacks and package tampering.
*   **Code Signing Verification:** If SwiftGen releases are code-signed, always verify the code signature before using the binary to ensure authenticity and integrity.
*   **Network Monitoring (Build Environment):** Monitor network activity from build environments for unusual outbound connections that might indicate a compromised build tool.
