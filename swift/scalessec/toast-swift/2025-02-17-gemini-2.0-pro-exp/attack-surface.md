# Attack Surface Analysis for scalessec/toast-swift

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Excessive Toast Creation](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_excessive_toast_creation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker floods the application with toast notifications, leading to UI unresponsiveness or crashes.
*   **How toast-swift contributes:** `toast-swift` is the *direct mechanism* for displaying the toasts. The application's logic controls the *triggering* of these toasts, making it the root cause, but `toast-swift` is the enabler.
*   **Example:** An attacker repeatedly submits a malformed form that triggers an error toast for each submission, overwhelming the UI. `toast-swift` is used to display each of these error toasts.
*   **Impact:** Application becomes unusable; potential for complete denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rate Limiting (Server-Side):** Implement server-side rate limiting on actions that can trigger toasts.
    *   **Rate Limiting (Client-Side):** Implement client-side rate limiting on toast creation, even if the trigger originates from the server.
    *   **Toast Queueing:** Use a queue with a maximum size for toast notifications. Discard older toasts if the queue is full.
    *   **Circuit Breaker:** Temporarily disable toast notifications if an excessive number are detected.

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure via Toast Content](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_via_toast_content.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information is inadvertently displayed in toast messages, exposing it to unauthorized users.
*   **How toast-swift contributes:** `toast-swift` is the *direct mechanism* that displays the sensitive content. The application's logic is responsible for *providing* this content, but `toast-swift` is the component that makes it visible.
*   **Example:** An error handler displays a raw database error message (containing table names) in a toast. `toast-swift` is used to render this sensitive information to the user.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data (database structure, API keys, user details, internal system information).
*   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical, depending on the information)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Generic Error Messages:** Display only user-friendly, generic error messages in toasts. Never show raw error details.
    *   **Centralized Error Handling:** Use a centralized error handling system to ensure consistent and secure error message generation.
    *   **Code Review:** Thoroughly review all code paths that generate toast messages.
    *   **Logging:** Log detailed error information server-side, not in client-side toasts.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Highly Unlikely, but Direct](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__-_highly_unlikely__but_direct.md)

*   **Description:** Untrusted user input is directly inserted into the toast *content* without sanitization, allowing for the execution of malicious JavaScript.
*   **How toast-swift contributes:** `toast-swift` is the *direct mechanism* that renders the potentially malicious HTML/JavaScript content within the toast. While the application is responsible for the lack of sanitization, `toast-swift` is the component that executes the unsanitized input.
*   **Example:** A user enters `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` into a form, and this is directly displayed in a toast without escaping. `toast-swift` renders this script, causing the alert to appear.
*   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or website defacement.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if present, but highly unlikely with proper input handling)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Sanitization:** **Always** sanitize and encode any user-supplied data before displaying it in a toast (or anywhere). Use HTML escaping.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a CSP to restrict script sources.
