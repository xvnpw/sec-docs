# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for scalessec/toast-swift

## Mitigation Strategy: [Timeout Configuration (via `toast-swift`)](./mitigation_strategies/timeout_configuration__via__toast-swift__.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Utilize Library Features:** Use `toast-swift`'s built-in timeout functionality.  This is typically done through a configuration option when creating the toast (e.g., a `duration` parameter).
2.  **Short Durations:** Set a short, reasonable display duration for each toast.  Generally, 3-5 seconds is sufficient for most notifications. Avoid excessively long durations.
3.  **Context-Specific Timeouts:** Consider slightly adjusting the timeout based on the context of the message.  More critical messages *might* warrant a slightly longer (but still short) duration, but avoid making any toast persistent.
4.  **Avoid `Indefinite` or Very Long Timeouts:** Do not use indefinite or extremely long timeouts, as this can contribute to UI clutter and potential DoS-like scenarios.
5. **Test Different Durations:** Test the application with various timeout durations to ensure the user experience is optimal and that messages are displayed for an appropriate amount of time.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Partial):** (Severity: Medium) - Shorter timeouts help mitigate DoS attacks by limiting the time each toast occupies the screen, reducing the impact of a flood of toasts.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Partial):** (Severity: Medium) - Shorter timeouts reduce the likelihood of a large number of toasts accumulating in memory (if they are queued).
    *   **UI Redressing (Minor):** (Severity: Low) - Shorter display times slightly reduce the window of opportunity for a UI redressing attack involving a deceptive toast overlay.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Risk partially reduced.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk partially reduced.
    *   **UI Redressing:** Risk slightly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: "Currently using the library's default timeout setting, which appears to be around 3 seconds.  No explicit configuration is done in the code."

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: "No context-specific timeouts are used. All toasts have the same duration, regardless of their content or importance.  We should review and potentially adjust the default timeout and add custom durations where appropriate."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Positioning and Styling Control (via `toast-swift`)](./mitigation_strategies/positioning_and_styling_control__via__toast-swift__.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Use Library's Positioning Options:** Utilize `toast-swift`'s positioning options (if available) to control where toasts appear on the screen (e.g., top, bottom, center).
2.  **Consistent Positioning:** Choose a consistent position for toasts to avoid confusing the user and to make it harder for an attacker to subtly manipulate the toast's location for malicious purposes.
3.  **Avoid Overlapping Critical UI:** Ensure that toasts, by default, do *not* overlap critical UI elements like buttons, input fields, or other interactive components. This is crucial to prevent accidental clicks or obscuring important information.
4.  **Opacity Control (If Available):** If the library allows for opacity control, avoid using fully transparent backgrounds. A slightly opaque background helps visually distinguish the toast from underlying content.
5.  **Z-Index Management (If Necessary):** If you need to manually manage the z-index of the toast (to ensure it appears above other elements), do so carefully to avoid creating layering issues.
6. **Test on Different Screen Sizes:** Test the toast positioning and styling on various screen sizes and device orientations to ensure it remains visible and doesn't overlap important UI elements.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **UI Redressing (Clickjacking):** (Severity: Low) - Proper positioning and opacity control make it more difficult for an attacker to create a deceptive toast that overlays other UI elements, tricking the user into clicking something unintended.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **UI Redressing:** Risk reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: "Using the library's default positioning (bottom of the screen). Opacity is also at the default setting."

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: "No explicit checks are in place to ensure toasts don't overlap critical UI elements, especially on smaller screen sizes. We need to test this thoroughly and potentially adjust the positioning logic."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Interaction Handling (If Applicable, via `toast-swift`)](./mitigation_strategies/interaction_handling__if_applicable__via__toast-swift__.md)

**Description:**
*This strategy only applies if you are using `toast-swift` features that allow user interaction with toasts (e.g., buttons or tap actions).*
1.  **Limit Interactive Elements:** Minimize the use of interactive elements within toasts.  Simple, informational toasts are generally safer.
2.  **Use Library's Callbacks:** If you *do* use interactive elements, use the library's provided callback mechanisms (e.g., completion handlers, button tap handlers) to handle user interactions.
3.  **Validate Actions Server-Side:** If a toast interaction triggers an action on the server-side, *always* validate that action on the server. Do *not* rely solely on client-side validation.
4.  **Avoid Sensitive Actions:** Avoid using toast interactions for sensitive actions (e.g., deleting data, making payments). These actions should require more explicit user confirmation through a dedicated UI element.
5. **Clear Visual Feedback:** Provide clear visual feedback to the user when they interact with a toast (e.g., a button press animation).
6. **Test Interaction Thoroughly:** Thoroughly test all toast interactions, including edge cases and error conditions.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **UI Redressing (Clickjacking):** (Severity: Low) - Secure handling of interactions prevents attackers from hijacking toast clicks to perform unintended actions.
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (If Server-Side Actions):** (Severity: Medium) - Server-side validation of actions triggered by toast interactions prevents CSRF attacks.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **UI Redressing:** Risk reduced.
    *   **CSRF:** Risk significantly reduced (if server-side validation is implemented correctly).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: "Toasts are currently non-interactive. No buttons or tap actions are used."

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: "N/A - No interactive toasts are currently used. If we add interactive toasts in the future, we need to implement these mitigations."
