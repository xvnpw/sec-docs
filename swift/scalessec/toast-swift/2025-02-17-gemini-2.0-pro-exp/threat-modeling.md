# Threat Model Analysis for scalessec/toast-swift

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Toast Content](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_toast_content.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript (or other client-side code) into a field that is later used as input for a toast message. If the `toast-swift` library *fails to properly sanitize this input* before rendering it, the injected script will execute within the application's context. The attacker could steal cookies, redirect the user, or deface the application. *This threat hinges on a potential lack of input sanitization within `toast-swift` itself.*
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of user accounts, data theft, session hijacking, application defacement, loss of user trust.
    *   **Affected Component:** The `ToastView`'s content rendering logic (e.g., a hypothetical `setContent()` or `updateText()` function within the `ToastView` class, or wherever the text/HTML is being set). Also, any custom view components used within a toast if they handle user input directly *and* `toast-swift` doesn't sanitize them.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (if user input is used in toasts) / Critical (if user input is used *and* the application handles sensitive data).  The severity is high because even if the *application developer* intends to sanitize, a bug in `toast-swift` could bypass that.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Primary (Application Developer):** *Always sanitize and encode all user-provided input* before passing it to `toast-swift`, even if you believe the library handles it. This is defense-in-depth. Use appropriate output encoding (HTML encoding is most likely).
        *   **Secondary (Application Developer):** Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP).
        *   **Crucial (Library Maintainer - toast-swift):** The `toast-swift` library *must* internally sanitize any input provided to it before rendering it as HTML or displaying it in a way that could execute script. This sanitization should be robust and well-tested.  The library should clearly document its sanitization behavior.
        * **Verification (Application Developer):** If possible, review the source code of `toast-swift` to verify the presence and effectiveness of its input sanitization. If unsure, assume it's *not* safe and sanitize externally.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Dependency (If Critical/High Vulnerability Exists)](./threats/vulnerable_dependency__if_criticalhigh_vulnerability_exists_.md)

*   **Description:** A dependency of `toast-swift` contains a *known, critical or high severity* vulnerability that can be exploited. This is not a vulnerability *in* `toast-swift` code, but a vulnerability in code that `toast-swift` relies on.
    *   **Impact:** Varies widely depending on the specific vulnerability in the dependency, but could include remote code execution, data breaches, etc. (High/Critical impact by definition).
    *   **Affected Component:** The entire `toast-swift` library, due to its reliance on the vulnerable dependency.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High or Critical (depending on the dependency's vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Immediate (Application Developer & Library Maintainer):** Update `toast-swift` to a version that uses a patched version of the vulnerable dependency. If no such version exists, consider:
            *   **Temporary Workaround (Application Developer):** If possible, temporarily disable the use of `toast-swift` or the specific feature that relies on the vulnerable dependency.
            *   **Forking (Library Maintainer):** If the dependency is unmaintained, consider forking the dependency and applying the patch directly, then updating `toast-swift` to use the forked version.
            *   **Alternative Library (Application Developer):** As a last resort, consider switching to a different toast notification library that does not have the vulnerable dependency.
        *   **Ongoing (Application Developer & Library Maintainer):** Use dependency scanning tools and regularly update all dependencies.

## Threat: [Undiscovered Vulnerability within `toast-swift` (Potentially High/Critical)](./threats/undiscovered_vulnerability_within__toast-swift___potentially_highcritical_.md)

*   **Description:** `toast-swift` itself contains an *undiscovered* vulnerability (e.g., in its rendering logic, event handling, or custom view support) that could allow for code injection, denial of service, or other exploits. This is a hypothetical threat, but a realistic possibility for any software.
    *   **Impact:** Unknown, but potentially High or Critical, depending on the nature of the undiscovered vulnerability.
    *   **Affected Component:** Potentially any part of the `toast-swift` library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Unknown, but potentially High or Critical. We include it here because it *could* be high/critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Code Review (Library Maintainer):** Conduct regular security-focused code reviews of the `toast-swift` codebase.
        *   **Security Testing (Library Maintainer & Application Developer):** Perform security testing (e.g., fuzzing, penetration testing) on `toast-swift` and the application that uses it.
        *   **Bug Bounty Program (Library Maintainer):** Consider establishing a bug bounty program to incentivize security researchers to find and report vulnerabilities.
        *   **Stay Updated (Application Developer):** Keep `toast-swift` updated to the latest version, as updates often include security fixes.
