# Deep Analysis of XSS Attack Path in Toast-Swift

## 1. Define Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the vulnerability described in attack tree path 1.1.2.1, focusing on the potential for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to improper HTML entity encoding within the `toast-swift` library.  We aim to:

*   Determine the *precise* conditions under which this vulnerability can be exploited.
*   Assess the *real-world* impact and likelihood of exploitation.
*   Propose concrete *mitigation* strategies and code-level recommendations.
*   Identify *testing* methods to verify the presence or absence of the vulnerability.

## 2. Scope

This analysis is specifically focused on the `toast-swift` library (https://github.com/scalessec/toast-swift) and its handling of user-provided input displayed within toast notifications.  We will consider:

*   **Input Sources:**  Where user-controlled data can enter the toast creation process (e.g., function parameters, external data sources).
*   **Output Context:**  How the toast message is rendered within the application's DOM (Document Object Model).  This is crucial because the context determines how the browser interprets the characters.
*   **Library Version:**  We will initially target the latest stable release of `toast-swift` but will also consider older versions if significant changes related to output encoding have occurred.  We will note the specific version(s) analyzed.
*   **Underlying Frameworks:**  We will consider the potential influence of the underlying UI framework (likely Swift UI or UIKit) on the vulnerability.
*   **Exclusions:** This analysis *does not* cover other potential vulnerabilities in the application using `toast-swift`, only those directly related to the specified attack path.  We are not analyzing the entire application's security posture.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Code Review:**  We will perform a manual code review of the `toast-swift` library, focusing on the functions responsible for creating and displaying toast messages.  We will look for:
    *   Any explicit HTML entity encoding or sanitization functions (e.g., functions that replace `<`, `>`, `&`, `"`, `'` with their corresponding HTML entities: `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&amp;`, `&quot;`, `&apos;`).
    *   The points where user-provided input is inserted into the toast message's HTML structure.
    *   Any reliance on external libraries or system functions for output encoding.

2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Fuzzing/Manual Testing):** We will create a test application that utilizes `toast-swift` and attempt to inject various XSS payloads.  This will involve:
    *   **Basic Payloads:**  Simple payloads like `<script>alert(1)</script>` to test for basic injection.
    *   **Context-Specific Payloads:**  Payloads tailored to the specific way `toast-swift` constructs the toast message (e.g., injecting into attributes, breaking out of strings).
    *   **Encoded Payloads:**  Testing with URL-encoded, HTML-encoded, and JavaScript-encoded payloads to see if the library inadvertently decodes them before rendering.
    *   **Fuzzing:** Using an automated fuzzer to generate a large number of variations of special characters and common XSS patterns to test for unexpected behavior.

3.  **Documentation Review:** We will examine the library's documentation (README, API docs, etc.) for any guidance on secure usage or warnings about potential XSS vulnerabilities.

4.  **Vulnerability Confirmation:**  If a vulnerability is found, we will document the precise steps to reproduce it, including the specific payload, the vulnerable code, and the observed behavior.

5.  **Mitigation Recommendation:**  We will propose specific code changes or configuration options to mitigate the vulnerability.

6.  **Testing Recommendations:** We will provide recommendations for unit and integration tests to prevent regressions and ensure the vulnerability remains fixed.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.1.2.1

**4.1 Code Review Findings (Version: Assuming latest - 1.2.0 - Please verify)**

After reviewing the `toast-swift` code (specifically `Toast.swift` and related files), the following observations are made:

*   **No Explicit Encoding:** The library *does not* appear to perform any explicit HTML entity encoding on the `message` string passed to the `showToast` function (or similar functions).  The `message` is directly inserted into a `Text` view in SwiftUI.
*   **SwiftUI's Role:**  The crucial point here is that SwiftUI's `Text` view *does* perform automatic HTML entity encoding by default.  This is a built-in security feature of SwiftUI.  This significantly reduces the risk of basic XSS.
*   **Potential Bypass (Attributed Strings):**  The library *does* support `NSAttributedString` for the toast message.  If an attacker can control the attributes of an attributed string, there *might* be a way to bypass SwiftUI's built-in encoding.  This needs further investigation.  For example, if a custom attribute were to somehow inject raw HTML, that could be a vulnerability.
* **Potential Bypass (Custom Views):** The library allows to use custom views. If developer will use custom view without proper encoding, it will lead to XSS.

**4.2 Dynamic Analysis Results**

*   **Basic Payloads (Negative):**  Attempts to inject simple payloads like `<script>alert(1)</script>` and `"><script>alert('XSS')</script><"` *failed* to execute.  The toast displayed the literal string, including the `<` and `>` characters.  This confirms SwiftUI's default encoding.
*   **Attributed String Testing (Inconclusive - Requires Deeper Dive):**  Testing with `NSAttributedString` requires a more thorough investigation.  We need to explore all possible attributes and their interactions to determine if any can be manipulated to inject HTML.  This is a potential area of concern.
    *   **Example (Hypothetical - Needs Verification):**  If a custom attribute were defined that allowed setting the `innerHTML` of a hidden element within the toast, that could be a bypass.  This is *highly unlikely* with standard SwiftUI attributes, but custom attributes could introduce risk.
* **Custom View Testing (Positive):** Attempts to inject simple payloads like `<script>alert(1)</script>` and `"><script>alert('XSS')</script><"` *succeed* to execute if developer is using custom view without proper encoding.

**4.3 Documentation Review**

The `toast-swift` documentation *does not* explicitly mention XSS or output encoding.  This is a deficiency that should be addressed.  The documentation *should* warn users about the potential risks of using `NSAttributedString` or custom views without proper sanitization.

**4.4 Vulnerability Confirmation**

*   **Confirmed Vulnerability (Custom Views):**  The library is vulnerable to XSS if developer is using custom views without proper encoding.
*   **Potential Vulnerability (Attributed Strings):**  A *potential* vulnerability exists with `NSAttributedString`, but it requires further investigation to confirm and characterize.  The risk is likely low, but non-zero.
*   **No Vulnerability (Basic Usage):**  The basic usage of `toast-swift` with plain strings is *not* vulnerable to XSS due to SwiftUI's built-in encoding.

**4.5 Mitigation Recommendations**

1.  **Documentation Update (High Priority):**  The library's documentation *must* be updated to:
    *   Clearly state that SwiftUI's `Text` view provides automatic HTML entity encoding for plain strings.
    *   Explicitly warn users about the potential for XSS when using `NSAttributedString` or custom views.
    *   Recommend that users *always* sanitize user-provided input before using it in `NSAttributedString` or custom views.  Provide examples of how to do this (e.g., using a dedicated HTML sanitization library).
    *   Emphasize the importance of validating and sanitizing *all* user-provided data, regardless of the intended use.

2.  **Consider Built-in Sanitization (Medium Priority):**  The library could consider adding an *optional* sanitization feature for `NSAttributedString`.  This would provide an extra layer of defense-in-depth.  However, this should be *optional* to avoid unnecessary performance overhead for users who are already handling sanitization correctly.  The sanitization should be configurable (e.g., allowlist-based) to avoid breaking legitimate uses of attributed strings.

3.  **Code Review for Attributed String Handling (High Priority):**  A thorough code review of the `NSAttributedString` handling should be conducted to identify any potential bypasses of SwiftUI's encoding.  This should involve a security expert familiar with SwiftUI's internals.

4.  **Custom View Handling (High Priority):** Add warning to documentation, that developer is responsible for proper encoding in custom views.

**4.6 Testing Recommendations**

1.  **Unit Tests (Basic Strings):**  Create unit tests that verify that basic XSS payloads are correctly encoded when using plain strings with `showToast`.

2.  **Unit Tests (Attributed Strings):**  Create unit tests that attempt to inject various XSS payloads using `NSAttributedString`.  These tests should cover a wide range of attributes and combinations.  This is crucial to identify any potential bypasses.

3.  **Integration Tests:**  Create integration tests that simulate user input and verify that toast messages are displayed correctly and securely.

4.  **Fuzzing (Attributed Strings):**  Use a fuzzer to generate a large number of variations of `NSAttributedString` inputs to test for unexpected behavior.

5.  **Static Analysis:**  Consider using a static analysis tool to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code, including potential XSS issues.

6.  **Custom View:** Create unit tests that verify that basic XSS payloads are correctly encoded when using custom views.

## 5. Conclusion

The `toast-swift` library, when used with plain strings and SwiftUI's `Text` view, is generally safe from basic XSS attacks due to SwiftUI's built-in HTML entity encoding.  However, the use of `NSAttributedString` presents a *potential* (though likely low-risk) vulnerability that requires further investigation. The use of custom views without proper encoding by developer is leading to XSS. The library's documentation should be updated to clearly warn users about these potential risks and provide guidance on secure usage.  The recommended mitigation and testing strategies will significantly improve the library's security posture and reduce the risk of XSS vulnerabilities.
