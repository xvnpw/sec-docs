# Attack Surface Analysis for scalessec/toast-swift

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Toast Flooding](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_toast_flooding.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker or uncontrolled application logic can exploit the toast display functionality provided by `toast-swift` to trigger a rapid and excessive display of toast notifications. This can overwhelm the application's UI thread, leading to significant performance degradation or unresponsiveness, effectively denying service to legitimate users.
*   **How toast-swift contributes to the attack surface:** `toast-swift` offers straightforward APIs for developers to programmatically create and display toast notifications. This ease of use, without careful implementation in the application, directly enables the possibility of toast flooding attacks. The library itself does not inherently limit the rate or quantity of toasts that can be displayed.
*   **Example:**  Imagine an application where a network event, processed without proper rate limiting, triggers a toast notification for each event. An attacker could flood the application with malicious network events, each causing `toast-swift` to display a toast. This rapid creation and display of toasts could freeze the UI, making the application unusable.
*   **Impact:** Application becomes significantly slow or completely unresponsive. Users are unable to use the application's features. In severe cases, the application might crash due to resource exhaustion. This can lead to user frustration, negative user experience, and potential business disruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Implement Rate Limiting:**  Introduce application-level rate limiting to control the frequency of toast displays, regardless of the triggering event. Ensure that toasts are not generated and displayed in rapid succession, especially based on potentially uncontrolled external inputs.
        *   **Use Toast Queuing with Limits:** Implement a queue for toast requests with a maximum size. When the queue is full, new toast requests should be dropped or handled with a back-off mechanism. This prevents unbounded accumulation of toast requests from overwhelming the UI.
        *   **Throttling Mechanisms:**  Employ throttling techniques to limit the rate at which toast display functions of `toast-swift` are called, especially in response to external events or user actions that could be manipulated by an attacker.

## Attack Surface: [UI Obscuration and User Confusion via Toast Abuse](./attack_surfaces/ui_obscuration_and_user_confusion_via_toast_abuse.md)

*   **Description:** While not a direct code execution vulnerability in `toast-swift`, the library's features for customizing toast appearance, position, and duration can be misused to create UI overlays that obscure critical parts of the application interface. This can lead to user confusion, accidental actions, or create opportunities for social engineering attacks within the application's context.
*   **How toast-swift contributes to the attack surface:** `toast-swift` provides developers with significant control over toast presentation, including positioning toasts at various locations on the screen and setting their display duration. This flexibility, if not used responsibly from a UI/UX security perspective, directly enables the potential for creating misleading or obscuring UI elements using toasts.
*   **Example:** A poorly designed or malicious application could position a persistent toast at the bottom of the screen using `toast-swift`'s customization options, such that it persistently covers important buttons or input fields. This could trick users into tapping on obscured elements unintentionally or miss critical information hidden behind the toast. In a more malicious scenario, a deceptive toast could mimic a legitimate system dialog, misleading users into providing sensitive information or performing unintended actions within the application based on the deceptive toast content and positioning.
*   **Impact:** User confusion and frustration. Degraded user experience. Potential for users to perform unintended actions due to obscured UI elements. Increased risk of social engineering attacks within the application's context, where users might be tricked by misleading toast overlays.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Adhere to Secure UI/UX Design Principles:** Follow established UI/UX best practices that prioritize clarity and avoid obscuring interactive elements. Ensure toasts are informative and non-intrusive, and their positioning and duration are carefully considered to prevent UI interference.
        *   **Restrict Toast Positioning for Critical UI Areas:**  Avoid positioning toasts in areas of the screen where critical interactive elements (buttons, input fields, important information displays) are located. Design toast placement to minimize any potential for obscuring or interfering with core application functionality.
        *   **Thorough UI/UX Testing with Security in Mind:** Conduct rigorous UI testing, specifically focusing on how toasts interact with other UI elements and whether they could be misused to mislead or confuse users. Include security considerations in UI/UX reviews to identify and mitigate potential abuse scenarios related to toast display.
        *   **Avoid Persistent or Overly Long Toasts:** Limit the duration of toast displays to be brief and informative. Avoid using toasts for persistent messages or critical warnings that require user interaction. Use more prominent and appropriate UI elements for such scenarios.
