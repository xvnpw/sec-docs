# Threat Model Analysis for scalessec/toast-swift

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) due to Inefficient Toast Handling in `Toast-Swift`](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__due_to_inefficient_toast_handling_in__toast-swift_.md)

*   **Description:**  `Toast-Swift`'s internal components, specifically `ToastManager` and `ToastView`, might not be designed to efficiently handle a large volume of concurrent toast requests. An attacker or a flaw in the application logic could exploit this by triggering a rapid succession of toast displays. This flood of requests could overwhelm the library's processing capabilities, leading to UI freezes, application unresponsiveness, or even crashes due to resource exhaustion within `toast-swift` or the application's main thread. This vulnerability stems from a potential lack of built-in rate limiting or efficient queue management within the `toast-swift` library itself.
    *   **Impact:** Application becomes unusable or severely degraded, causing significant user frustration and potential service disruption. Device performance may be severely impacted. In critical scenarios, the application might crash, leading to data loss or requiring a restart.
    *   **Affected Component:** `ToastManager`, `ToastView` (specifically their toast queue management and rendering processes under high load).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Library Vendor Mitigation (Ideal):**  Request or contribute to the `scalessec/toast-swift` project to implement internal rate limiting or efficient toast queue management within the library. This would involve changes within the `ToastManager` to control the rate at which toasts are processed and displayed, preventing overload.
        *   **Developer Mitigation (Application-Level Rate Limiting):** Implement rate limiting in the application code *before* calling `Toast.showText()` or similar functions. This involves controlling the frequency of toast requests originating from the application logic. For example, use a timer or queue to limit how often toast messages are triggered, especially in response to rapid events or user actions.
        *   **Performance Testing and Monitoring:** Conduct thorough performance testing, specifically simulating scenarios with high toast message volume, to identify potential bottlenecks related to `toast-swift`. Monitor application performance metrics (CPU usage, memory consumption, UI responsiveness) under stress to detect and address DoS vulnerabilities proactively. Consider using alternative UI feedback mechanisms for high-frequency events if toasts prove to be a performance bottleneck.
