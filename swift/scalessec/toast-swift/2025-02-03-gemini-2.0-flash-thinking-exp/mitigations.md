## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Toast Rate Limiting and Queuing within `toast-swift` Usage](./mitigation_strategies/implement_toast_rate_limiting_and_queuing_within__toast-swift__usage.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Leverage application logic to control the frequency of calls to `toast-swift` display functions.**  Instead of directly calling `Toast.show()` every time a notification is needed, introduce a controlling layer.
    2.  **Implement rate limiting *before* invoking `toast-swift`.**  This can be done by:
        *   Using a timer or timestamp to track the last toast display time.  Only allow a new toast to be displayed if a certain time interval has passed since the last one.
        *   Counting the number of toast requests within a specific time window and rejecting new requests if a threshold is reached.
    3.  **Implement a toast queue *before* invoking `toast-swift`.**  When a toast needs to be displayed, add it to a queue.  A separate process or timer can then dequeue and display toasts using `toast-swift` at a controlled pace.
    4.  **Configure `toast-swift`'s display duration appropriately.** Use the library's options to set a reasonable `duration` for toasts to automatically dismiss. Avoid relying on persistent toasts unless absolutely necessary and carefully managed.
    5.  **Test the rate limiting and queuing mechanisms in conjunction with `toast-swift` under various load conditions.** Ensure that the application logic effectively controls the toast display rate and prevents excessive toast generation when using `toast-swift`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **UI Obscuring:** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents excessive toasts, triggered through application logic flaws or malicious input, from obscuring important UI elements when using `toast-swift`.
    *   **UI-level Denial of Service (DoS) via Toast Overload:** (Severity: Low) - Reduces the risk of overwhelming the UI with toasts by controlling the rate at which `toast-swift` is invoked, mitigating potential DoS scenarios related to toast spam.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **UI Obscuring:** High - Effectively prevents UI obscuring caused by uncontrolled `toast-swift` usage.
    *   **UI-level Denial of Service (DoS) via Toast Overload:** Medium - Significantly reduces the likelihood of UI-level DoS attacks related to abusing `toast-swift` to flood the UI with notifications.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic `toast-swift` display duration configuration is likely used in [Toast Utility Class/Base View Controller] by setting the `duration` parameter when calling `Toast.show()`.
    *   Implicit rate limiting might exist due to the natural flow of application events that trigger `toast-swift` in [Specific Modules], but no explicit control is in place for `toast-swift` usage.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Explicit rate limiting logic *before* calling `toast-swift` display functions is missing in [Toast Manager/Utility Class/Application Logic Layer].
    *   Toast queuing mechanism *before* invoking `toast-swift` is not implemented in [Toast Manager/Utility Class/Application Logic Layer].
    *   No dedicated component or module exists to specifically manage and control the rate and queue of `toast-swift` displays.
    *   Stress testing focused on `toast-swift` rate limiting and queuing is not part of the regular testing process.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict `toast-swift` Interactivity and Maintain Default Non-Interactive Usage](./mitigation_strategies/restrict__toast-swift__interactivity_and_maintain_default_non-interactive_usage.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize `toast-swift` in its default, non-interactive configuration.**  Avoid modifying or extending `toast-swift` to add interactive elements (buttons, links, input fields) directly within the toast view.
    2.  **If custom views are used with `toast-swift`, ensure they remain non-interactive.** When using `toast-swift`'s ability to display custom views, carefully design these views to be purely for display purposes and avoid embedding interactive controls within them.
    3.  **Maintain clear visual distinction between `toast-swift` notifications and interactive UI elements in the application.** Ensure that the visual style of toasts, as rendered by `toast-swift`, is distinct from buttons, links, and other interactive components to prevent user confusion.  This is achieved through consistent UI design and styling *around* the use of `toast-swift`.
    4.  **Avoid making `toast-swift` notifications persistent or requiring manual dismissal unless absolutely necessary.** Stick to the transient nature of toasts as intended by `toast-swift`'s design. If persistence is needed, consider alternative UI elements outside of `toast-swift`.
    5.  **During code reviews, specifically verify that `toast-swift` is used in a non-interactive manner and that no accidental interactivity is introduced through custom views or configurations.**

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Clickjacking/UI Redressing (related to potential misuse of `toast-swift`):** (Severity: Low) - By ensuring `toast-swift` remains non-interactive, this strategy mitigates the already low risk of clickjacking or UI redressing attacks that could theoretically arise if `toast-swift` were modified to include interactive elements.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Clickjacking/UI Redressing (related to potential misuse of `toast-swift`):** Low - Further reduces the already low probability of clickjacking or UI redressing risks specifically related to how `toast-swift` is used.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `toast-swift` is currently used in its default non-interactive mode throughout [Project Name].  Standard usage patterns are followed in [Toast Utility Class/Base View Controller].
    *   Visual distinction between toasts and interactive elements is generally maintained by the existing UI style guidelines in [UI Style Guide/Design System], which implicitly affects how `toast-swift` is presented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Explicit code review guidelines to specifically check for non-interactive usage of `toast-swift` and custom views within toasts.
    *   No automated checks or linters to enforce non-interactivity in `toast-swift` usage or custom toast views.
    *   Developer documentation could be enhanced to explicitly emphasize the importance of using `toast-swift` non-interactively from a security perspective.
