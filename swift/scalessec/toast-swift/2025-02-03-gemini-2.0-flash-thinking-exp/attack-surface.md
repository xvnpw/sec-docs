## Attack Surface: [UI Redress/Overlay Attacks via Toast Presentation (High Severity)](./attack_surfaces/ui_redressoverlay_attacks_via_toast_presentation__high_severity_.md)

**Description:**  The inherent nature of `toast-swift` to display messages as overlays on top of the application's UI can be directly exploited to create UI redress attacks. This occurs when malicious toasts are crafted to visually obscure or mimic legitimate UI elements, potentially deceiving users into performing unintended actions.
**How toast-swift contributes to the attack surface:** `toast-swift`'s core functionality *is* the presentation of overlaying toast messages. This mechanism, provided directly by the library, is the foundation for this attack surface. The library's ease of use in displaying toasts makes it straightforward for developers to inadvertently create scenarios vulnerable to overlay attacks if not carefully considered.
**Example:** A malicious actor could trigger a toast message with styling and text designed to visually resemble a legitimate system prompt or application dialog. This fake toast could be positioned to overlay a sensitive button (e.g., "Confirm Payment") in the actual application UI. A user, believing the toast is legitimate, might interact with the underlying button, unknowingly confirming a malicious action.
**Impact:**  High - Potential for tricking users into performing unintended and potentially harmful actions within the application. This could lead to financial loss, unauthorized data access, or other security breaches depending on the obscured UI elements and application functionality.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Minimize Persistent Toasts: Reduce the use of long-lasting or persistent toasts that have a greater window to be exploited for overlay attacks. Prefer short, informative toasts.
*   Distinct Visual Styling: Ensure toast messages have a distinct visual style that clearly differentiates them from critical interactive UI elements and system prompts. Avoid styling toasts to mimic system dialogs or important buttons.
*   Careful Positioning and Z-Order:  Precisely control the positioning and z-order of toasts. Ensure they do not obscure or visually interfere with critical interactive elements, especially during sensitive operations.
*   User Awareness Training (Application Context):  Educate users (within the application's context, e.g., through in-app help or tutorials) about the appearance of legitimate toasts and how to distinguish them from potentially misleading overlays, although this is a less technical control and more of a supplementary measure.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Excessive Toast Display (High Severity)](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__through_excessive_toast_display__high_severity_.md)

**Description:**  The programmatic toast display functionality offered by `toast-swift` can be directly abused to create a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. By triggering an excessive number of toast messages in rapid succession, attackers can overwhelm the application's UI rendering, making it unresponsive and unusable.
**How toast-swift contributes to the attack surface:** `toast-swift` provides the API to programmatically display toasts. This direct programmatic control, while intended for legitimate use, becomes the vector for a DoS attack if the application logic or external inputs allow for uncontrolled or malicious triggering of toast displays. The simplicity of displaying toasts with `toast-swift` makes it easy to unintentionally create pathways for this DoS attack.
**Example:** A vulnerability in the application's error handling or event processing logic could be exploited to repeatedly trigger toast messages in a loop.  An attacker might manipulate external inputs (e.g., network requests, push notifications if they can be influenced) to force the application into this toast display loop, rapidly generating and displaying toasts until the UI becomes unresponsive and the application effectively becomes unusable.
**Impact:** High - Application becomes unresponsive and unusable, disrupting user experience and potentially impacting business operations if the application is critical.  While not a data breach, it represents a significant disruption of service.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement Rate Limiting on Toast Display:  Introduce robust rate limiting or throttling mechanisms to control the frequency of toast displays.  Restrict the number of toasts that can be displayed within a given time period.
*   Control Toast Triggering Logic:  Thoroughly review and secure the application logic that triggers toast messages. Ensure that external inputs or events cannot be easily manipulated to trigger excessive toast displays. Validate and sanitize any inputs that influence toast display decisions.
*   Queueing and Debouncing for Toasts: Implement a queue or debouncing mechanism for toast display requests. This prevents a flood of rapid requests from immediately overwhelming the UI and allows for controlled processing of toast display events.
*   Circuit Breaker Pattern (for Toast Display): Consider implementing a circuit breaker pattern for toast display. If a certain threshold of toast display requests is exceeded within a short timeframe, temporarily disable or throttle toast displays to prevent a complete UI freeze.
