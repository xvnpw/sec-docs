## Attack Tree Path: [Root: Compromise Application via Toast-Swift [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/root_compromise_application_via_toast-swift__critical_node_.md)

Description: The ultimate goal of the attacker is to compromise the application using the Toast-Swift library. This node is critical as it represents the overall objective of the threat model.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Toast Display for Malicious Purposes [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_toast_display_for_malicious_purposes__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

Description: Attackers aim to leverage the toast display functionality for malicious actions. This path is high-risk because it encompasses several easily exploitable vulnerabilities related to toast content and presentation.

Attack Vectors:
*   Controlling Toast Content (leading to phishing, drive-by downloads, social engineering, UI spoofing).
*   Manipulating Toast Presentation (leading to Denial of Service).

## Attack Tree Path: [Control Toast Content [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/control_toast_content__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

Description: Attackers attempt to influence the text or links displayed within the toast message. This node is critical and part of a high-risk path because it directly enables content-based attacks.

Attack Vectors:
*   **Inject Malicious URL in Toast Message [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   Description: Injecting malicious URLs into toast messages if the application displays unsanitized data.
    *   Leads to: Phishing Attacks and Drive-by Downloads.
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: Major
    *   Effort: Low
    *   Skill Level: Low
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
    *   Mitigation: Strict input sanitization and validation of URLs displayed in toasts.
*   **Inject Deceptive Text in Toast Message [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   Description: Injecting misleading or false text into toast messages if the application displays unsanitized data.
    *   Leads to: Social Engineering and UI Spoofing/Confusion.
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: Moderate
    *   Effort: Low
    *   Skill Level: Low
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium-Hard
    *   Mitigation: Strict input sanitization and validation of text displayed in toasts, clear and consistent UI design.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious URL in Toast Message [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_url_in_toast_message__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

Description: This node represents the vulnerability of displaying unsanitized URLs in toast messages. It is critical and part of a high-risk path as it directly enables phishing and drive-by download attacks.

Attack Vectors:
*   **Phishing Attack via Toast Link [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   Description: Toast contains a link to a phishing website.
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: Major
    *   Effort: Low
    *   Skill Level: Low
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
    *   Mitigation: Input sanitization, URL whitelisting, user education.
*   **Drive-by Download via Toast Link:**
    *   Description: Toast contains a link that initiates a drive-by download of malware.
    *   Likelihood: Low-Medium
    *   Impact: Major
    *   Effort: Low-Medium
    *   Skill Level: Low-Medium
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
    *   Mitigation: Input sanitization, URL whitelisting, user education, robust app sandboxing.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Deceptive Text in Toast Message [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_deceptive_text_in_toast_message__high-risk_path_.md)

Description: This node represents the vulnerability of displaying unsanitized text in toast messages. It is part of a high-risk path as it enables social engineering and UI spoofing attacks.

Attack Vectors:
*   **Social Engineering via False Information [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   Description: Toast displays false information to manipulate user behavior.
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: Moderate
    *   Effort: Low
    *   Skill Level: Low
    *   Detection Difficulty: Hard
    *   Mitigation: Data integrity, contextual clarity, rate limiting of toasts.
*   **UI Spoofing/Confusion via Misleading Text [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   Description: Toast displays text mimicking system messages to confuse users.
    *   Likelihood: Medium-Hard
    *   Impact: Moderate
    *   Effort: Low
    *   Skill Level: Low
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium-Hard
    *   Mitigation: Consistent UI design, limited toast customization, user awareness.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Toast Flooding [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos__via_toast_flooding__high-risk_path_.md)

Description: Attackers flood the application with toasts to cause a Denial of Service. This path is high-risk due to the ease of execution and potential impact on application usability.

Attack Vectors:
*   **Exhaust UI Resources by Displaying Excessive Toasts [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   Description: Flooding the UI with toasts to consume excessive resources and cause crashes.
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: Moderate
    *   Effort: Low
    *   Skill Level: Low
    *   Detection Difficulty: Easy
    *   Mitigation: Rate limiting toast display, toast queue management, resource monitoring.
*   **Degrade Application Performance by Overwhelming UI Thread [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   Description: Flooding the UI thread with toast display operations to cause lag and unresponsiveness.
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: Moderate
    *   Effort: Low
    *   Skill Level: Low
    *   Detection Difficulty: Easy
    *   Mitigation: Asynchronous toast display, UI thread optimization, rate limiting.
