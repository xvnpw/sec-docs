# Threat Model Analysis for scalessec/toast-swift

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Sensitive Data in Toasts](./threats/information_disclosure_via_sensitive_data_in_toasts.md)

**Description:** An attacker might observe sensitive information displayed within a toast message. This occurs because the `toast-swift` library is used to render and display the provided message content directly on the screen. If the application developers pass sensitive data to the library's display functions, it becomes visible. An attacker could be a bystander physically observing the screen or someone who has gained unauthorized access to screenshots or screen recordings.

**Impact:** Breach of confidentiality. Sensitive data could be exposed, potentially leading to identity theft, account compromise, or further attacks.

**Affected Component:** Toast Display Mechanism (functions within `toast-swift` responsible for rendering and displaying the toast message).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Conduct thorough code reviews to ensure no sensitive data is being passed as arguments to `toast-swift` display functions.
* Implement strict data handling practices and avoid displaying raw sensitive information in the UI using any mechanism, including toast messages.
* Consider using generic messages or logging sensitive information only for debugging purposes (and ensure these logs are secured).

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities within the `toast-swift` Library Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_within_the__toast-swift__library_itself.md)

**Description:** The `toast-swift` library, like any software, could contain undiscovered security vulnerabilities in its code. An attacker could potentially exploit these vulnerabilities if the application uses a vulnerable version of the library. The impact would depend on the nature of the vulnerability.

**Impact:** Depends on the nature of the vulnerability within the library. Could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution within the application's context, UI manipulation, or other security breaches.

**Affected Component:** Entire `toast-swift` Library Codebase.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the specific vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update the `toast-swift` library to the latest stable version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
* Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for any reported issues related to `toast-swift`.
* Consider using dependency management tools to track and manage library updates.
