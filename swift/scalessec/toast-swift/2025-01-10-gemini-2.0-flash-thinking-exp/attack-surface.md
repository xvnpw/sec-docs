# Attack Surface Analysis for scalessec/toast-swift

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Toast Content Injection](./attack_surfaces/malicious_toast_content_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious content (e.g., HTML, special characters) into the toast message, leading to unintended behavior or potential security issues.

**How toast-swift Contributes:** `toast-swift` is responsible for rendering and displaying the provided string content as a visible toast message. If this content is not sanitized before being passed to the library, it can lead to injection issues.

**Example:** An application displays a toast with a username retrieved from an external source without sanitization. If the username is crafted as `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, `toast-swift` might render this, potentially executing the script depending on the underlying view rendering mechanism.

**Impact:** UI manipulation, potential for cross-site scripting (XSS) if the rendering context allows, social engineering attacks by displaying misleading or harmful information.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developer:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization on any data that will be displayed within toast messages. This includes escaping HTML characters and other potentially harmful content. Utilize context-aware output encoding based on how the toast content is rendered.
*   **Developer:** If using custom views for toasts, ensure these views are not vulnerable to rendering malicious content.
