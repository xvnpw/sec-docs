## Attack Tree Path: [1. [C] Compromise Application via Toast-Swift (Attacker Goal)](./attack_tree_paths/1___c__compromise_application_via_toast-swift__attacker_goal_.md)

This is the ultimate objective of the attacker. By exploiting vulnerabilities within the `toast-swift` library, the attacker aims to gain control or access to the application and its resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. [C] Influence Displayed Toast Content](./attack_tree_paths/2___c__influence_displayed_toast_content.md)

This critical node represents the attacker's ability to manipulate what is displayed within the toast messages. This manipulation can be used for various malicious purposes.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. [HR] Inject Malicious Content into Toast Message](./attack_tree_paths/3___hr__inject_malicious_content_into_toast_message.md)

This high-risk path involves the attacker successfully inserting harmful content into the toast message. This is a significant threat because it can directly lead to code execution or phishing attacks.

    *   **[HR] Inject Malicious Script (if WebView used in Toast):**
        *   If the application uses a `WebView` to render toast content, the attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code.
        *   **[HR] Exploit XSS-like Vulnerability in Toast Content Rendering:**
            *   The injected script can then be executed within the context of the `WebView`, potentially accessing application data or performing actions on behalf of the user.
            *   **[HR] Input Sanitization Failure in Toast Message Handling:**
                *   The root cause of this vulnerability is the failure of the application to properly sanitize or encode user-provided or external data before displaying it in the toast message. This allows the malicious script to be injected in the first place.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. [C] Manipulate Toast Behavior](./attack_tree_paths/4___c__manipulate_toast_behavior.md)

This critical node signifies the attacker's ability to control how the toast messages function, leading to potential disruptions or unintended actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. [HR] Cause Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/5___hr__cause_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

This high-risk path focuses on making the application unusable by overwhelming the user interface with toast messages.

    *   **[HR] Spam Toasts to Overwhelm UI:**
        *   The attacker floods the application with a large number of toast messages in a short period.
        *   **[HR] Rapidly Triggering Toast Presentations:**
            *   This involves repeatedly and quickly calling the functions responsible for displaying toasts.
            *   **[HR] Lack of Rate Limiting on Toast Display:**
                *   The underlying vulnerability enabling this attack is the absence of mechanisms to limit the frequency at which toast messages can be displayed. This allows the attacker to easily overwhelm the UI.
