# Attack Surface Analysis for reactivex/rxswift

## Attack Surface: [Uncontrolled Recursion in Operators](./attack_surfaces/uncontrolled_recursion_in_operators.md)

**Description:**  Certain RxSwift operators, particularly those that transform or flatten streams (e.g., `flatMap`, `concatMap`, custom operators), can lead to infinite recursion if not implemented with proper termination conditions. This can consume excessive resources and lead to a denial of service.

**How RxSwift Contributes:** RxSwift's reactive nature and the chaining of operators make it easy to inadvertently create recursive loops within data streams. If an operator's logic triggers the same operator or a preceding one in the chain without a clear exit condition, it can result in unbounded recursion.

**Example:** A custom operator within a `flatMap` might emit a new observable that triggers the same `flatMap` again based on the emitted value, creating an infinite loop of observable emissions and processing.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to stack overflow errors or excessive CPU and memory consumption.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement proper termination conditions: Ensure operators have clear logic to stop the recursion based on data or external signals (e.g., using `take`, `takeUntil`, conditional logic).
* Set recursion limits:  While not a direct RxSwift feature, consider implementing safeguards in custom operators to prevent excessively deep recursion.
* Thorough testing:  Test complex operator chains with various inputs to identify potential recursion issues.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion through Unbounded Observables](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_through_unbounded_observables.md)

**Description:** Observables that emit an indefinite or very large number of items without proper handling can lead to memory leaks and resource exhaustion. Subscribers might retain references to these items, consuming memory over time.

**How RxSwift Contributes:** RxSwift's core concept revolves around streams of data (Observables). If an Observable continuously emits data without mechanisms to limit or manage the flow (e.g., backpressure, completion signals), it can overwhelm subscribers.

**Example:** An Observable connected to a sensor that continuously streams data without any filtering or aggregation, and a subscriber keeps accumulating this data in memory.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to memory exhaustion, application crashes, or performance degradation.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement backpressure: Use RxSwift operators like `buffer`, `window`, `sample`, or custom backpressure mechanisms to manage the rate of data consumption.
* Use finite Observables:** Where appropriate, design Observables to complete after a certain number of emissions or a specific event.
* Properly dispose of subscriptions: Ensure all subscriptions to long-lived Observables are disposed of when they are no longer needed to release resources.
* Use operators for limiting emissions: Employ operators like `take`, `takeUntil`, `throttle`, or `debounce` to control the number or frequency of emitted items.

## Attack Surface: [Subject Misuse as a Backdoor or Control Point](./attack_surfaces/subject_misuse_as_a_backdoor_or_control_point.md)

**Description:** `PublishSubject`, `BehaviorSubject`, `ReplaySubject`, and `AsyncSubject` can act as both observers and observables. If not carefully managed, especially in shared contexts, they could be exploited as unintended control points to inject malicious data or trigger actions.

**How RxSwift Contributes:** Subjects provide a bridge between imperative and reactive code. If a Subject is exposed or accessible to untrusted components, an attacker could push arbitrary values into the stream, potentially bypassing intended logic or triggering unintended side effects.

**Example:** A `PublishSubject` used to signal events is exposed through an API. An attacker could send crafted events through this Subject to manipulate the application's state.

**Impact:** Code injection, unauthorized state changes, triggering unintended application behavior.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Restrict Subject access: Limit the scope and accessibility of Subjects, especially those used for critical control flow.
* Validate input to Subjects: If external input is used to publish to a Subject, rigorously validate and sanitize the data.
* Consider using read-only interfaces:  Where appropriate, provide read-only interfaces (e.g., `asObservable()`) to prevent external entities from directly publishing to a Subject.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization of Observable Data Streams](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_of_observable_data_streams.md)

**Description:** If observable streams receive data from external sources (e.g., network, file) that requires deserialization, vulnerabilities related to insecure deserialization could be introduced.

**How RxSwift Contributes:** RxSwift facilitates the processing of data streams, including those originating from external sources. If the deserialization of this external data is not handled securely, it can lead to code execution or other vulnerabilities.

**Example:** An Observable receiving JSON data from a remote server. If the JSON deserialization process is vulnerable, a malicious server could send crafted JSON payloads to execute arbitrary code on the client.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), data corruption, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use secure deserialization libraries: Employ well-vetted and secure deserialization libraries.
* Validate deserialized data: After deserialization, thoroughly validate the structure and content of the data before using it.
* Implement input sanitization: Sanitize data received from external sources before deserialization if possible.
* Consider alternative data formats: If possible, use safer data formats that are less prone to deserialization vulnerabilities.
