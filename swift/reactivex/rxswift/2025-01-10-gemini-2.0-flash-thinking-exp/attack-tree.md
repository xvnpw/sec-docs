## Attack Tree Path: [1. HIGH-RISK PATH: Exploit Improper Error Handling (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/1__high-risk_path_exploit_improper_error_handling__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Leak Sensitive Information via Error Messages (CRITICAL NODE)
    * **Description:** The application fails to sanitize error messages generated by RxSwift operations before logging or displaying them. These messages might inadvertently contain sensitive information such as file paths, database connection strings, API keys used in retry mechanisms, or internal system details.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** Medium (Information Disclosure)
    * **Effort:** Low
    * **Skill Level:** Low
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires log analysis)
* **Attack Vector:** Cause Denial of Service via Error Propagation (CRITICAL NODE)
    * **Description:** Unhandled or poorly handled errors within RxSwift streams propagate up the chain, leading to application crashes, infinite loops in retry mechanisms, or excessive resource consumption. This can result in a denial of service.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** High (Service Disruption)
    * **Effort:** Low
    * **Skill Level:** Low
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (Application crashes, resource spikes)

## Attack Tree Path: [2. CRITICAL NODE: Inject Malicious Data into a Subject/Relay (if successful)](./attack_tree_paths/2__critical_node_inject_malicious_data_into_a_subjectrelay__if_successful_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Inject Malicious Data into a Subject/Relay
    * **Description:** The application exposes an RxSwift `Subject` or `Relay` without proper access control or input validation. An attacker gains access to this component and injects malicious data that the application subsequently processes, leading to unintended behavior, data manipulation, or potentially arbitrary code execution.
    * **Likelihood:** Low
    * **Impact:** High (Potentially arbitrary code execution or data manipulation)
    * **Effort:** Medium (Requires finding the exposed Subject/Relay)
    * **Skill Level:** Medium
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Depends on logging and input validation)

## Attack Tree Path: [3. HIGH-RISK PATH: Exploit Resource Management Issues (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/3__high-risk_path_exploit_resource_management_issues__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Cause Memory Leaks via Unmanaged Subscriptions
    * **Description:** The application fails to properly dispose of subscriptions to RxSwift `Observables` when they are no longer needed. This leads to memory leaks, where allocated memory is not released, eventually causing performance degradation and application crashes.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** Medium (Performance degradation, eventual crash)
    * **Effort:** Low (Often unintentional developer error)
    * **Skill Level:** Low
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires memory profiling)

## Attack Tree Path: [4. CRITICAL NODE: Introduce Race Conditions in Shared State (if successful)](./attack_tree_paths/4__critical_node_introduce_race_conditions_in_shared_state__if_successful_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Introduce Race Conditions in Shared State
    * **Description:** Multiple RxSwift streams concurrently access and modify shared mutable state without proper synchronization mechanisms. This can lead to race conditions, where the outcome of the operations depends on the unpredictable order of execution, resulting in data corruption or unexpected application behavior.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** Medium to High (Data corruption, unpredictable behavior)
    * **Effort:** High (Requires understanding complex interactions)
    * **Skill Level:** High
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (Intermittent and difficult to reproduce)

## Attack Tree Path: [5. CRITICAL NODE: Exploit External Dependencies Called within Operators (if dependency is vulnerable)](./attack_tree_paths/5__critical_node_exploit_external_dependencies_called_within_operators__if_dependency_is_vulnerable_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Exploit External Dependencies Called within Operators
    * **Description:** RxSwift operators within the application interact with external systems or libraries that have their own vulnerabilities. An attacker can manipulate input to trigger these vulnerabilities through the RxSwift stream, potentially compromising the application or the external system.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on the security of external dependencies)
    * **Impact:** High (Depends on the vulnerability in the dependency)
    * **Effort:** Varies (Depends on the specific vulnerability)
    * **Skill Level:** Medium to High
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires monitoring interactions with external systems)

## Attack Tree Path: [6. CRITICAL NODE: Retrieve Cached Sensitive Data (if sensitive data is cached)](./attack_tree_paths/6__critical_node_retrieve_cached_sensitive_data__if_sensitive_data_is_cached_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Retrieve Cached Sensitive Data
    * **Description:** The application uses RxSwift caching mechanisms like `ReplaySubject` or `cache()` to store sensitive data. An attacker finds a way to access this cached data at an unexpected time or through an unintended access point, leading to information disclosure.
    * **Likelihood:** Low
    * **Impact:** High (Sensitive data disclosure)
    * **Effort:** Medium (Requires understanding application data flow and potential vulnerabilities in caching logic)
    * **Skill Level:** Medium
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (Requires monitoring internal state and data access patterns)

## Attack Tree Path: [7. CRITICAL NODE: Poison the Cache with Malicious Data](./attack_tree_paths/7__critical_node_poison_the_cache_with_malicious_data.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Poison the Cache with Malicious Data
    * **Description:** An attacker finds a vulnerability that allows them to inject malicious data into an RxSwift caching mechanism (`ReplaySubject`, etc.). This poisoned data is then used by the application as valid input, potentially leading to application compromise or data corruption.
    * **Likelihood:** Very Low
    * **Impact:** Critical (Application compromise, data corruption)
    * **Effort:** High
    * **Skill Level:** High
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (Requires robust input validation and data integrity checks)
