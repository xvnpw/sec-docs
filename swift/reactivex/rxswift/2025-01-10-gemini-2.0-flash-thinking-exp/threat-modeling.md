# Threat Model Analysis for reactivex/rxswift

## Threat: [Malicious Data Injection into Observables](./threats/malicious_data_injection_into_observables.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious or unexpected data directly into an observable stream if the source of the data feeding the observable is untrusted and lacks proper validation. This could be achieved by compromising data sources or manipulating external inputs that are then pushed into the RxSwift stream.

**Impact:**  Critical: This can lead to arbitrary code execution if the malicious data is processed in a vulnerable way downstream (e.g., used in a web view or executed dynamically), data corruption, or significant application malfunction. High: Depending on the application's logic, it could lead to unauthorized actions or information disclosure.

**Affected RxSwift Component:** `Observable.create`, `PublishSubject`, `BehaviorSubject`, `ReplaySubject`, operators that process external input without sanitization.

**Risk Severity:** Critical / High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization *before* data enters the RxSwift stream.
*   Use RxSwift's `filter` operator early in the stream to discard invalid or suspicious data.
*   Employ type-safe observables and operators to enforce data integrity.
*   Secure the sources of observable data to prevent tampering.

## Threat: [Race Conditions and Inconsistent State due to Asynchronous Operations](./threats/race_conditions_and_inconsistent_state_due_to_asynchronous_operations.md)

**Description:** RxSwift's asynchronous nature can lead to race conditions if multiple observables or operators interact with shared mutable state without proper synchronization. Attackers could exploit timing vulnerabilities to force the application into an inconsistent and potentially vulnerable state by manipulating the order of events within the reactive stream.

**Impact:** Critical: Inconsistent state can lead to critical security flaws, such as authorization bypasses or data breaches. High: Data corruption, incorrect application behavior leading to financial loss or service disruption.

**Affected RxSwift Component:** Schedulers, operators like `combineLatest`, `zip`, `withLatestFrom` when used with shared mutable state, custom operators with concurrency issues.

**Risk Severity:** Critical / High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Minimize the use of shared mutable state. Favor immutable data structures and functional reactive programming principles.
*   Utilize RxSwift's concurrency control operators (`debounce`, `throttle`, `sample`) and appropriate schedulers to manage asynchronous operations and prevent race conditions.
*   Employ synchronization mechanisms (e.g., locks, serial dispatch queues, reactive primitives for synchronization) when accessing and modifying shared mutable state within RxSwift flows.
*   Thoroughly test concurrent code paths for race conditions.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion through Unmanaged Subscriptions](./threats/resource_exhaustion_through_unmanaged_subscriptions.md)

**Description:** Failure to properly dispose of subscriptions in RxSwift can lead to resource leaks (e.g., memory leaks). An attacker could exploit this by triggering the creation of numerous unmanaged subscriptions, eventually exhausting system resources and causing a denial of service. This is directly related to how RxSwift manages the lifecycle of observable sequences.

**Impact:** High: Denial of service, application instability, significant performance degradation making the application unusable.

**Affected RxSwift Component:** `subscribe()`, operators that create internal subscriptions if not managed correctly.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Consistently use `DisposeBag` or `CompositeDisposable` to manage the lifecycle of RxSwift subscriptions.
*   Ensure that subscriptions are disposed of when the associated component or task is completed or no longer needed.
*   Utilize operators like `takeUntil`, `takeWhile`, or `take(1)` to automatically unsubscribe after a specific condition is met.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Operators or Subjects](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_custom_operators_or_subjects.md)

**Description:** Developers creating custom RxSwift operators or subjects might introduce security vulnerabilities due to flawed logic, improper handling of data, or concurrency issues within their custom components. This directly impacts the security of the RxSwift stream.

**Impact:** Critical: Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to arbitrary code execution, data breaches, or complete application compromise. High: Information disclosure, denial of service, or significant application malfunction.

**Affected RxSwift Component:** Custom operators, custom subjects.

**Risk Severity:** Critical / High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Follow secure coding practices meticulously when developing custom RxSwift operators and subjects.
*   Conduct thorough security testing and code reviews of all custom RxSwift extensions.
*   Ensure proper input validation and sanitization within custom components.
*   Carefully manage concurrency and potential race conditions in custom code.
