## Attack Tree Path: [1. Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/1__denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **1.1 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption [HIGH RISK]**

    *   **1.1.1 Memory Leaks [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **Description:**  Memory leaks occur when objects are no longer needed but are still held in memory, preventing them from being deallocated.  Over time, this can lead to excessive memory consumption, performance degradation, and eventually, application crashes.
        *   **1.1.1.1 Missing `disposeBag` or `dispose(by:)` *CRITICAL***
            *   **Description:**  RxSwift subscriptions create strong references to the observer and the observable.  If these subscriptions are not explicitly disposed of when they are no longer needed, the associated objects will remain in memory, even if they are no longer reachable.  The `DisposeBag` is a convenient mechanism for managing multiple subscriptions and ensuring they are disposed of together.
            *   **Likelihood:** High
            *   **Impact:** Medium (Gradual degradation, eventual crash)
            *   **Effort:** Very Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Novice
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
            *   **Mitigation:**
                *   Always add subscriptions to a `DisposeBag`.
                *   Ensure the `DisposeBag` is deallocated when the owning object is deallocated (e.g., in the `deinit` method).
                *   Use `dispose(by:)` to explicitly dispose of individual subscriptions when needed.
                *   Employ linting rules to enforce `DisposeBag` usage.
        *   **1.1.1.2 Retain Cycles with Closures *CRITICAL***
            *   **Description:**  Closures used within observable chains can create retain cycles if they capture `self` strongly.  This happens when the observable is also held by `self` (directly or indirectly), creating a circular dependency that prevents either object from being deallocated.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** Medium (Similar to missing `disposeBag`)
            *   **Effort:** Very Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
            *   **Mitigation:**
                *   Use `[weak self]` or `[unowned self]` in the closure's capture list to break the retain cycle.
                *   `[weak self]` creates an optional reference to `self`, which will be `nil` if `self` is deallocated.
                *   `[unowned self]` creates an unowned reference, which assumes that `self` will always be valid during the closure's execution.  Use with caution, as it can lead to crashes if `self` is deallocated prematurely.
                *   Carefully analyze the scope and lifetime of closures and objects to identify potential retain cycles.

*   **1.2 Application Hang/Freeze [HIGH RISK]**

    *   **1.2.1 Deadlocks on Main Thread *CRITICAL***
        *   **Description:**  Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are blocked indefinitely, waiting for each other to release resources.  In the context of RxSwift and UI applications, this often happens when long-running operations or blocking calls are performed on the main thread, which is responsible for updating the user interface.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High (Complete UI freeze)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Use `subscribeOn` to offload long-running operations to a background thread.
            *   Use `observeOn(MainScheduler.instance)` to ensure that UI updates are performed on the main thread.
            *   Avoid making any blocking calls (e.g., synchronous network requests, file I/O) on the main thread.
            *   Use asynchronous APIs whenever possible.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Unintended Application Behavior](./attack_tree_paths/2__unintended_application_behavior.md)

*   **2.1 Race Conditions [HIGH RISK]**

    *   **2.1.1 Concurrent Updates to Shared State *CRITICAL***
        *   **Description:**  Race conditions occur when multiple threads or observable sequences access and modify shared mutable state concurrently, without proper synchronization.  This can lead to unpredictable results, data corruption, and inconsistent application state.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High (Data corruption, inconsistent state)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Use thread-safe data structures (e.g., atomic variables, concurrent collections) when accessing shared state from multiple observables.
            *   Use synchronization mechanisms (e.g., locks, mutexes, semaphores) to protect critical sections of code that modify shared state.
            *   Prefer immutable data structures and data transformations over mutable state.  This eliminates the possibility of race conditions by design.
            *   Use RxSwift operators like `serialize` to ensure that events from a single observable are processed sequentially, even if they are generated on different threads.

*   **2.4 Error Handling Failures [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **2.4.1 Unhandled Errors Terminating Streams *CRITICAL***
        *   **Description:** In RxSwift, if an error occurs within an observable sequence and is not handled, the sequence will terminate. This means that no further events (including `onNext`, `onCompleted`) will be emitted. This can lead to unexpected behavior if parts of the application rely on the continued operation of that sequence.
        *   **Likelihood:** High
        *   **Impact:** Medium (Unexpected termination of functionality)
        *   **Effort:** Very Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Use `catchError`, `catchErrorJustReturn`, or related operators to handle errors within the observable chain.
            *   `catchError` allows you to intercept the error and potentially recover by returning a new observable sequence.
            *   `catchErrorJustReturn` allows you to replace the error with a default value.
            *   Use `retry` to automatically resubscribe to the observable sequence if an error occurs, potentially with a delay or a limited number of retries.
            *   Implement a global error handling strategy to catch any unhandled errors that might escape the observable chains.
            *   Log errors appropriately for debugging and monitoring.
