# Threat Model Analysis for reactivex/rxswift

## Threat: [Uncontrolled Observable Lifetime (Memory Leak)](./threats/uncontrolled_observable_lifetime__memory_leak_.md)

*   **Threat:** Uncontrolled Observable Lifetime (Memory Leak)

    *   **Description:** An attacker could trigger actions (e.g., repeated user interactions, network requests) that cause the application to create numerous Observables and subscriptions without proper disposal. The attacker doesn't need direct access to the code; they just need to interact with the application in a way that exploits the vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Gradual memory consumption increase, leading to application slowdown, eventual unresponsiveness (denial of service), and potential crashes. Long-term, this could lead to device instability.
    *   **Affected RxSwift Component:** `Observable` creation (any method that creates an `Observable`), `subscribe` method, and lack of proper use of `DisposeBag` or other disposal mechanisms (`takeUntil`, `take(n)`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mandatory `DisposeBag`:** Enforce the use of `DisposeBag` for *every* subscription. Use linting rules to detect missing `DisposeBag` usage.
        *   **`takeUntil`:** Prefer `takeUntil` to tie Observable lifetimes to the lifecycle of UI components (e.g., ViewControllers) or other relevant events.
        *   **`take(n)`:** When appropriate, limit the number of emitted values using `take(n)`.
        *   **Memory Profiling:** Regularly profile the application's memory usage to detect leaks early.
        *   **Code Reviews:** Mandatory code reviews focusing on proper Observable disposal.

## Threat: [Main Thread Blocking (UI Freeze)](./threats/main_thread_blocking__ui_freeze_.md)

*   **Threat:** Main Thread Blocking (UI Freeze)

    *   **Description:** An attacker could trigger an action (e.g., submitting a large form, initiating a complex network request) that results in a long-running operation being executed within an Observable pipeline *on the main thread*. The attacker exploits a developer oversight in not offloading work to a background thread.
    *   **Impact:** The application's UI becomes unresponsive (frozen) for the duration of the long-running operation. This degrades the user experience and can be considered a form of denial of service.
    *   **Affected RxSwift Component:** `subscribe` method, any operator that performs work (e.g., `map`, `flatMap`), and incorrect or missing use of `observeOn` and `subscribeOn`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **`observeOn` (Background Scheduler):** Use `observeOn` with a background scheduler (e.g., `ConcurrentDispatchQueueScheduler`) to offload computationally expensive operations from the main thread.
        *   **`subscribeOn` (Background Scheduler):** Use `subscribeOn` to specify where the subscription work itself should happen, especially if the subscription process is heavy.
        *   **Code Reviews:** Carefully review Observable pipelines to identify any potentially blocking operations.
        *   **Performance Profiling:** Use profiling tools to identify long-running operations on the main thread.

## Threat: [Race Condition (Data Corruption)](./threats/race_condition__data_corruption_.md)

*   **Threat:** Race Condition (Data Corruption)

    *   **Description:** An attacker might trigger concurrent actions that interact with shared mutable state through multiple Observables or subscribers. Without proper synchronization, this can lead to race conditions.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, inconsistent application state, unpredictable behavior, and potentially crashes.
    *   **Affected RxSwift Component:** Multiple `Observable` instances interacting with shared mutable state, `subscribe` method, and lack of synchronization mechanisms.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Immutability:** Prioritize immutable data structures to eliminate shared mutable state.
        *   **`observeOn` (Serial Scheduler):** Use `observeOn` with a *serial* scheduler (e.g., `SerialDispatchQueueScheduler`) to ensure that all operations on shared state are performed sequentially.
        *   **Avoid Shared Mutable State:** Redesign the architecture to minimize or eliminate shared mutable state within Observable pipelines.
        *   **Atomic Operations:** If shared mutable state is unavoidable, use appropriate synchronization primitives (but be *extremely* cautious about deadlocks).

## Threat: [Retain Cycle with `self` (Memory Leak)](./threats/retain_cycle_with__self___memory_leak_.md)

* **Threat:** Retain Cycle with `self` (Memory Leak)
    * **Description:** An attacker triggers actions that cause the application to create Observables within a class, where the closures capture `self` strongly, leading to a retain cycle. The attacker doesn't need direct code access.
    * **Impact:** The class instance is never deallocated, leading to a memory leak. This can eventually cause performance degradation and crashes.
    * **Affected RxSwift Component:** `Observable` creation within a class, `subscribe` method, and closures used within the Observable pipeline.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **`[weak self]`:** Use `[weak self]` in closures to break the retain cycle.
        * **`[unowned self]`:** Use `[unowned self]` only when you are absolutely certain that the closure will *always* execute while `self` is still alive (use with caution).
        * **Code Reviews:** Carefully review closures within Observable pipelines for proper `self` capture.
        * **Linting Rules:** Use linting rules to detect potential retain cycles.
