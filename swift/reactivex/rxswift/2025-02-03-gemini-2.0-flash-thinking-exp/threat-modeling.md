# Threat Model Analysis for reactivex/rxswift

## Threat: [Unbounded Observable Denial of Service (DoS)](./threats/unbounded_observable_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Threat:** Unbounded Observable DoS
*   **Description:** An attacker exploits an RxSwift `Observable` that emits data without proper backpressure handling, leading to resource exhaustion. The attacker can trigger events causing a rapid stream of emissions, overwhelming consumers. This is possible if the application uses observables for high-volume data sources (like network streams or sensors) without implementing backpressure operators or rate limiting within the RxSwift chain. The application's RxSwift components struggle to process the uncontrolled data flow, consuming excessive memory and CPU.
*   **Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive or crashes due to memory exhaustion or CPU overload. Service disruption for users. Potential system-wide instability.
*   **RxSwift Component Affected:** `Observable`, RxSwift backpressure operators (or lack thereof), Schedulers involved in processing the observable stream.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement Backpressure:**  Utilize RxSwift backpressure operators like `throttle`, `debounce`, `sample`, `buffer`, `window`, and `背圧 (backpressure)` operators to control the rate of data consumption. Choose operators appropriate for the data stream and consumer capabilities.
    *   **Rate Limiting in Observable Chain:** Design the RxSwift observable chain to incorporate rate limiting mechanisms. This can be achieved using operators or custom logic within operators to regulate data flow.
    *   **Resource Monitoring and Circuit Breakers:** Monitor application resource usage (CPU, memory). Implement circuit breaker patterns within the RxSwift flow to halt processing if resource thresholds are exceeded, preventing cascading failures.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Validate and sanitize data sources feeding RxSwift observables to prevent malicious input from triggering unbounded emissions.

## Threat: [Subscription Leak Memory Exhaustion](./threats/subscription_leak_memory_exhaustion.md)

*   **Threat:** Subscription Leak Memory Exhaustion
*   **Description:** Developers fail to properly dispose of RxSwift subscriptions, leading to a gradual memory leak.  This is a vulnerability introduced by improper RxSwift usage.  Each active subscription holds references within RxSwift's internal structures. If subscriptions are not explicitly disposed of when no longer needed (e.g., when a view is dismissed or a component is deallocated), these references persist. Over time, repeated creation and subscription without disposal in RxSwift components leads to accumulated memory usage, eventually causing application crashes.
*   **Impact:** Application performance degrades over time. Application crashes due to out-of-memory errors. Long-running sessions or applications with frequent UI transitions are highly susceptible.
*   **RxSwift Component Affected:** `Disposable` protocol, `DisposeBag` class, RxSwift subscription management mechanisms. The core issue is improper use of these RxSwift components by developers.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Utilize `DisposeBag`:**  Consistently use `DisposeBag` to manage subscriptions within the lifecycle of RxSwift components (like ViewControllers, ViewModels, or custom reactive components). Add subscriptions to a `DisposeBag` associated with the component's lifecycle.
    *   **Employ Lifecycle-Aware Operators:** Use RxSwift operators like `takeUntil(disposeBagDeallocated)` (if available in custom extensions or similar patterns) or `takeUntil(triggerObservable)` to automatically unsubscribe when a specific event occurs (e.g., component deallocation, user action).
    *   **Code Reviews and Static Analysis:** Implement code reviews specifically focused on RxSwift subscription management. Use static analysis tools that can detect potential subscription leak patterns in RxSwift code.
    *   **Memory Profiling:** Regularly use memory profiling tools to identify and diagnose memory leaks in RxSwift applications during development and testing. Focus on tracking RxSwift `Disposable` objects and subscription counts.
    *   **Developer Education:** Ensure developers are thoroughly trained on proper RxSwift subscription disposal techniques and the importance of memory management in reactive programming.

## Threat: [Scheduler Abuse Denial of Service (DoS)](./threats/scheduler_abuse_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Threat:** Scheduler Abuse DoS
*   **Description:**  Incorrect or malicious use of RxSwift Schedulers can lead to DoS. Developers might unintentionally perform long-blocking operations on the `MainScheduler` or overuse concurrent schedulers without proper thread pooling. An attacker could exploit this by triggering actions that exacerbate scheduler misuse, for example, initiating numerous concurrent operations that overwhelm the available threads managed by RxSwift schedulers. This leads to thread starvation, blocking the main thread, or excessive context switching within RxSwift's scheduling system.
*   **Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive or slow. UI freezes. Users experience significant performance degradation or service unavailability. In severe cases, the application might become completely blocked or crash.
*   **RxSwift Component Affected:** RxSwift Schedulers (`MainScheduler`, `BackgroundScheduler`, `IOScheduler`, `ConcurrentDispatchQueueScheduler`, etc.), RxSwift concurrency model. The threat arises from misuse or abuse of these core RxSwift scheduling components.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Scheduler Best Practices:** Adhere to RxSwift scheduler best practices. Offload long-running or blocking operations *always* to background schedulers (e.g., `backgroundScheduler`, `ioScheduler`). Keep `MainScheduler` strictly for UI updates and short, non-blocking tasks.
    *   **Thread Pool Management:**  If using custom concurrent schedulers, carefully manage thread pool sizes to prevent resource exhaustion. Avoid creating unbounded numbers of threads.
    *   **Asynchronous Operations:** Ensure that operations within RxSwift chains are truly asynchronous and non-blocking, especially when using concurrent schedulers. Avoid accidentally introducing synchronous blocking calls within reactive flows.
    *   **Scheduler Monitoring:** Monitor scheduler performance and thread usage. Identify bottlenecks or excessive thread contention related to RxSwift schedulers.
    *   **Developer Training on Schedulers:** Provide comprehensive training to developers on the RxSwift threading model, scheduler types, and best practices for scheduler selection and usage to prevent misuse and performance issues.
