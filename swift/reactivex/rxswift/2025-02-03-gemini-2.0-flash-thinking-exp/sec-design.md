# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project is focused on providing and maintaining the RxSwift library, an open-source project for reactive programming in Swift.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a stable, performant, and well-documented reactive programming library for Swift developers.
  - Foster a strong community around the library to encourage adoption and contribution.
  - Ensure the library remains compatible with evolving Swift language and platform changes.
  - Maintain the library's quality and reliability to support developers building robust applications.

- Business Risks:
  - Risk of vulnerabilities in the library code that could be exploited by malicious actors in applications using RxSwift.
  - Risk of performance regressions or instability introduced in new versions, impacting applications relying on RxSwift.
  - Risk of decreased developer trust and adoption if the library is perceived as unreliable or insecure.
  - Risk of community fragmentation or lack of contributions, hindering the library's development and maintenance.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Code reviews are performed by maintainers before merging pull requests. (Observed in typical open-source project workflows and contribution guidelines).
  - security control: Unit and integration tests are in place to ensure code quality and prevent regressions. (Inferred from standard software development practices and project structure).
  - security control: Public vulnerability reporting process via GitHub issues. (Standard practice for open-source projects).
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions, which may introduce vulnerabilities if not thoroughly vetted.
  - accepted risk: Open-source nature means the codebase is publicly accessible, potentially revealing vulnerabilities to attackers.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated static application security testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential vulnerabilities in code changes.
  - security control: Integrate dependency scanning to identify and manage vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
  - security control: Conduct periodic security audits or penetration testing, especially before major releases.
  - security control: Establish a clear security policy and incident response plan for handling reported vulnerabilities.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to a library. However, authentication is relevant for:
    - Access to the GitHub repository for maintainers and contributors (GitHub authentication).
    - Access to package registries (e.g., Swift Package Registry, CocoaPods) for publishing and downloading the library (Registry authentication).
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to the library's runtime. However, authorization is relevant for:
    - Access control within the GitHub repository to manage code changes and releases (GitHub permissions).
    - Permissions for publishing to package registries (Registry permissions).
  - Input Validation: While RxSwift itself doesn't directly handle user input in the traditional sense, it processes events and data streams. Input validation should be considered in the context of:
    - Validating the structure and types of events and data streams processed by RxSwift operators to prevent unexpected behavior or crashes in applications using the library.
    - Ensuring operators handle edge cases and potentially malicious data within streams gracefully without causing vulnerabilities in consuming applications.
  - Cryptography: Not a primary requirement for RxSwift as a reactive programming library. However, consider if cryptography is relevant for:
    - Secure communication if RxSwift is extended to handle network events or data streams (e.g., using HTTPS for network requests within reactive streams).
    - Secure storage of any configuration or sensitive data, if applicable in future extensions of the library (though unlikely for a core reactive library).

  - Community contributions (pull requests): Medium sensitivity - Integrity is important to ensure contributions are vetted and safe to merge.
  - Documentation and examples: Low to Medium sensitivity - Integrity is important to ensure accurate and safe guidance for developers.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:

  - Are there specific compliance requirements or industry standards that RxSwift needs to adhere to? (Assumed to be general best practices for open-source software).
  - What is the process for handling security vulnerability reports and incident response for RxSwift? (Assumed to be standard open-source vulnerability reporting via GitHub issues and maintainer response).
  - Are there any specific third-party dependencies that are considered high risk or require special attention? (Assumed to be standard dependency management practices are followed).

- Assumptions:
  - RxSwift is maintained by a responsible community or organization committed to security best practices.
  - Standard open-source development practices are followed, including code reviews and testing.
  - GitHub and package registries provide a reasonable level of security for hosting and distributing the library.
  - Developers using RxSwift are responsible for the security of their own applications and how they integrate RxSwift.
  - The focus of security for RxSwift is primarily on preventing vulnerabilities in the library code itself and ensuring the integrity of its distribution.
