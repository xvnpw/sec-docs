# Attack Surface Analysis for reactivex/rxswift

## Attack Surface: [Unvalidated Data in Observables](./attack_surfaces/unvalidated_data_in_observables.md)

**Description:**  When external, untrusted data is directly fed into RxSwift Observables *without prior validation*, it creates a critical vulnerability. RxSwift's reactive streams efficiently propagate this unvalidated data throughout the application.

*   **RxSwift Contribution:** RxSwift's core functionality of data stream propagation amplifies the risk.  Unvalidated data entering an Observable can quickly reach and impact multiple parts of the application due to the reactive nature of the system.
*   **Example:** An iOS application uses RxSwift to handle user input from a search bar. This input is directly used in a network request Observable without sanitization. An attacker injects malicious code into the search bar, which is then sent to the backend, potentially leading to a server-side vulnerability (e.g., command injection if the backend is also vulnerable).
*   **Impact:** Critical vulnerabilities like Injection Attacks (SQL, Command, XSS depending on context), Data Corruption, and potential for full system compromise if the unvalidated data reaches critical components.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Mandatory Input Validation:** Implement *strict* input validation and sanitization *immediately* before any external data is pushed into an Observable. Treat all external data sources as inherently untrusted.
        *   **Secure Reactive Pipelines:** Design reactive chains to explicitly handle data validation as the *first step* in processing external inputs.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure components receiving data from Observables operate with the least privilege necessary to minimize the impact of potential exploits.

## Attack Surface: [Error Handling in Reactive Chains (Information Leakage & Instability)](./attack_surfaces/error_handling_in_reactive_chains__information_leakage_&_instability_.md)

**Description:**  Inadequate error handling within RxSwift reactive chains can lead to *high-severity* information leaks and application instability. RxSwift's error propagation mechanism, if misused, can inadvertently expose sensitive details.

*   **RxSwift Contribution:** RxSwift's error handling operators (`onError`, `catchError`, etc.) are powerful but require careful implementation.  If error handling is not robust, sensitive information can be exposed through error channels or unhandled errors can crash the application.
*   **Example:** An Android application using RxJava (conceptually similar to RxSwift) makes an API call within a reactive stream. If the API call fails, the `onError` handler simply logs the raw error response, which includes sensitive authentication tokens or internal server paths, to a publicly accessible log file.
*   **Impact:** High risk of Information Disclosure (sensitive API keys, internal system details, user data in error messages), Application Instability leading to Denial of Service, and potential for further exploitation based on leaked information.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Secure Error Handling Design:** Design error handling strategies to *prevent* information leakage. Sanitize error messages before logging or displaying them.
        *   **Centralized Error Handling:** Implement centralized error handling mechanisms within reactive chains to ensure consistent and secure error processing.
        *   **Avoid Raw Error Exposure:** Never expose raw error responses directly. Log detailed errors securely for debugging, but provide only generic, safe error messages to users or external systems.
        *   **Graceful Degradation:** Implement error handling to ensure the application degrades gracefully in case of errors, preventing crashes and maintaining a secure state.

## Attack Surface: [Race Conditions and Concurrency Issues in Reactive Streams](./attack_surfaces/race_conditions_and_concurrency_issues_in_reactive_streams.md)

**Description:**  Incorrect management of concurrency within RxSwift, particularly with Schedulers, can introduce *high-risk* race conditions. RxSwift's asynchronous nature, if not carefully controlled, can lead to unpredictable and exploitable states.

*   **RxSwift Contribution:** RxSwift's reliance on Schedulers for managing concurrency is central to its functionality. Misunderstanding or misusing Schedulers can directly lead to race conditions within reactive streams, especially when dealing with shared mutable state (though discouraged in reactive programming).
*   **Example:** Two concurrent Observables in a macOS application using RxSwift attempt to update a shared, non-thread-safe data structure. Due to a race condition, the data structure becomes corrupted, leading to incorrect application behavior and potentially exploitable logic flaws. For instance, user permissions might be incorrectly updated, leading to unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:** High risk of Data Corruption, Inconsistent Application State, Logic Exploitation (e.g., privilege escalation, bypassing security checks), and potentially Denial of Service due to application malfunction.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Scheduler Expertise:** Develop a deep understanding of RxSwift Schedulers and their implications for concurrency. Choose appropriate Schedulers based on the specific needs of each reactive chain.
        *   **Immutable Data Practices:**  Prioritize immutable data structures to minimize shared mutable state and drastically reduce the risk of race conditions in reactive streams.
        *   **Reactive Design Principles:** Adhere to reactive programming principles that minimize side effects and shared mutable state. Design reactive flows to be inherently thread-safe.
        *   **Concurrency Testing:** Implement rigorous concurrency testing, including stress testing and race condition detection techniques, to identify and eliminate potential race conditions in RxSwift-based applications.

## Attack Surface: [Custom Operator Vulnerabilities (High Impact Potential)](./attack_surfaces/custom_operator_vulnerabilities__high_impact_potential_.md)

**Description:**  Vulnerabilities introduced within *custom* RxSwift operators pose a *high* attack surface.  As extensions to RxSwift, these operators inherit the power of reactive streams, and flaws within them can have significant consequences.

*   **RxSwift Contribution:** RxSwift's extensibility through custom operators allows developers to add specialized logic. However, this extensibility also introduces risk if custom operators are not developed with security in mind. Vulnerabilities in custom operators are directly within the RxSwift processing pipeline.
*   **Example:** A developer creates a custom RxSwift operator in an iOS app to decrypt data within a reactive stream. The decryption logic in the custom operator contains a buffer overflow vulnerability. If an attacker can control the encrypted data stream, they could exploit this buffer overflow to achieve code execution within the application's context.
*   **Impact:** High potential for Code Execution, Buffer Overflows, Memory Corruption, Denial of Service, and other severe vulnerabilities depending on the nature of the flaw in the custom operator.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (can escalate to Critical depending on the exploitability and impact of the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Secure Custom Operator Development:** Apply *rigorous* secure coding practices when developing custom RxSwift operators. Treat custom operators as security-sensitive components.
        *   **Security Code Review for Operators:** Subject all custom operators to mandatory security-focused code reviews by experienced developers.
        *   **Thorough Operator Testing:** Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests for custom operators, specifically targeting potential security vulnerabilities (e.g., fuzzing, boundary condition testing).
        *   **Minimize Custom Operators:**  Whenever feasible, utilize standard, well-vetted RxSwift operators or established community operators instead of creating new custom operators to reduce the attack surface.
