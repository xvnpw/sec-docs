## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Data Stream Manipulation (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_data_stream_manipulation__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers aim to manipulate the data flowing through RxSwift streams to compromise the application's logic or data integrity. This targets the fundamental principle of reactive programming – data streams.
*   **Exploitation of RxSwift:** RxSwift's core is built around Observables and Subjects that emit and process data. If these streams are not properly secured or validated, they become vulnerable.
*   **Potential Impact:** Data corruption, logic bypass, denial of service, information leakage, and potentially more severe impacts depending on the application's functionality.
*   **Mitigations:**
    *   Robust input validation and sanitization at the point where data enters Rx streams.
    *   Secure external data sources feeding Observables.
    *   Implement data integrity checks throughout Rx chains.
    *   Use appropriate Subjects and Observables based on security requirements (e.g., avoid `ReplaySubject` if replay is not essential and could be exploited).

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. Data Injection into Observables/Subjects (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__data_injection_into_observablessubjects__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious or unexpected data directly into Subjects or Observables. This can be achieved by manipulating input sources that feed these streams.
*   **Exploitation of RxSwift:** Subjects like `PublishSubject` and `BehaviorSubject` are designed to allow external entities to push data into the stream. If these entry points are not secured, attackers can inject arbitrary data.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   **Logic Bypass:** Injecting data that bypasses intended application logic or validation checks.
    *   **Data Corruption:** Injecting malicious data that corrupts application state or stored data.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** If injected data is displayed in the UI without proper sanitization, it can lead to XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Denial of Service:** Injecting large volumes of data to overload the application.
*   **Mitigations:**
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization (Crucial):**  Validate and sanitize all data *before* it is pushed into Subjects or used to create Observables. This should be done on the server-side and client-side if applicable.
    *   Secure access control to data sources that feed Observables.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1. Inject Malicious Data into Subject (e.g., `PublishSubject`, `BehaviorSubject`) (High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1__inject_malicious_data_into_subject__e_g____publishsubject____behaviorsubject____high-risk_pat_c308e41e.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Specifically targeting Subjects (like `PublishSubject`, `BehaviorSubject`) to inject malicious data. This is a direct sub-path of Data Injection.
*   **Exploitation of RxSwift:** Subjects are explicitly designed for external data input. If the application relies on Subjects to receive data from untrusted sources without validation, it's vulnerable.
*   **Potential Impact:** Same as 1.1 Data Injection - Logic bypass, data corruption, XSS, DoS.
*   **Mitigations:**
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization (Primary Mitigation):**  Validate and sanitize all data received by Subjects.
    *   Restrict access to Subjects if possible, ensuring only trusted components can push data.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3. Denial of Service (DoS) via Stream Overload (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/1_3__denial_of_service__dos__via_stream_overload__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Overwhelming the application with a flood of events in RxSwift streams, leading to resource exhaustion and denial of service.
*   **Exploitation of RxSwift:** RxSwift is designed to handle asynchronous event streams. However, if not properly managed, an excessive number of events can overwhelm the application's processing capacity.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   Application slowdown and unresponsiveness.
    *   Resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, network).
    *   Temporary or prolonged application unavailability.
    *   Potential crashes due to resource exhaustion.
*   **Mitigations:**
    *   **Backpressure Mechanisms:** Implement backpressure operators like `throttle`, `debounce`, `sample`, `buffer`, `window` to control the rate of event processing.
    *   **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting at the source of events or within Rx chains to restrict the number of events processed within a given time frame.
    *   **Resource Management:** Optimize Rx chain logic to minimize resource consumption per event.
    *   Proper disposal of subscriptions to prevent resource leaks from long-running streams.

*   **Mitigations:**
    *   **Backpressure Operators (Primary Mitigation):** Use operators like `throttle`, `debounce`, `sample`, `buffer` to manage event flow.
    *   Rate limiting at the event source.

*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   Memory leaks.
    *   Resource exhaustion (gradual over time).
    *   Application instability and eventual crash.
    *   DoS due to resource depletion.
*   **Mitigations:**
    *   **Proper Subscription Disposal (Crucial):**  Always ensure proper disposal of subscriptions using `disposeBag`, `takeUntil`, or other disposal mechanisms.
    *   Code reviews to identify potential long-running or infinite Observables without proper disposal.
    *   Memory leak detection tools and monitoring.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.3. Trigger computationally expensive operations within Rx chains repeatedly (High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_3__trigger_computationally_expensive_operations_within_rx_chains_repeatedly__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Triggering computationally intensive operations within Rx chains repeatedly to consume excessive CPU resources and cause DoS.
*   **Exploitation of RxSwift:**  If Rx chains perform complex or resource-intensive operations synchronously, repeatedly triggering these chains can overload the application's CPU.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   Application slowdown.
    *   CPU resource exhaustion.
    *   DoS due to CPU overload.
*   **Mitigations:**
    *   **Optimize Rx Chain Logic:**  Optimize computationally expensive operations within Rx chains.
    *   **Offload Heavy Tasks to Background Schedulers:** Use `subscribeOn` and `observeOn` to offload heavy computations to background threads or schedulers, preventing main thread blocking and improving responsiveness.
    *   Rate limiting on features that trigger computationally expensive Rx chains.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Scheduler Misconfiguration or Abuse (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_scheduler_misconfiguration_or_abuse__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Exploiting misconfigurations or abusing the scheduler system in RxSwift to cause performance degradation, race conditions, or other vulnerabilities. Schedulers control concurrency and thread execution in RxSwift.
*   **Exploitation of RxSwift:**  Incorrect scheduler usage or overloading specific schedulers can disrupt the intended concurrency model of the application.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   Application slowdown and unresponsiveness.
    *   Race conditions and data corruption.
    *   Denial of service due to scheduler starvation.
    *   Unexpected application behavior due to incorrect thread execution.
*   **Mitigations:**
    *   Proper scheduler selection for different types of tasks.
    *   Avoid overloading single schedulers.
    *   Implement task prioritization if needed.
    *   Thoroughly understand and test scheduler behavior in complex Rx chains.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.2. Blocking Operations on Main Thread Scheduler (High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_2__blocking_operations_on_main_thread_scheduler__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Performing blocking operations on the main thread scheduler, leading to UI freezes and application unresponsiveness.
*   **Exploitation of RxSwift:**  While not directly an RxSwift vulnerability, improper use of schedulers in RxSwift can lead to blocking the main thread if developers don't correctly offload blocking operations.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   UI freezes and application unresponsiveness.
    *   Poor user experience.
    *   Application Not Responding (ANR) errors and potential crashes.
*   **Mitigations:**
    *   **Offload Blocking Operations to Background Schedulers (Primary Mitigation):**  Use `subscribeOn` and `observeOn` to ensure blocking operations are performed on background schedulers, keeping the main thread free for UI updates.
    *   Code reviews to identify potential blocking operations on the main thread.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2. Race Conditions due to Incorrect Scheduler Usage (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/2_2__race_conditions_due_to_incorrect_scheduler_usage__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Introducing race conditions by incorrectly managing concurrency and scheduler usage in RxSwift, especially when dealing with shared mutable state.
*   **Exploitation of RxSwift:**  RxSwift's concurrency model, while powerful, requires careful management. Incorrect use of `subscribeOn` and `observeOn` or improper handling of shared mutable state in concurrent streams can lead to race conditions.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   Data corruption and inconsistent application state.
    *   Unpredictable application behavior.
    *   Potential security vulnerabilities if race conditions lead to logic bypass or data exposure.
*   **Mitigations:**
    *   **Avoid Shared Mutable State in Rx Streams (Best Practice):**  Favor immutable data structures and functional programming principles within Rx chains to minimize the risk of race conditions.
    *   **Careful Scheduler Usage:**  Thoroughly understand and test the behavior of `subscribeOn` and `observeOn` in complex Rx chains. Use explicit scheduler specification where concurrency control is critical.
    *   Synchronization mechanisms (if absolutely necessary and unavoidable shared mutable state exists, use appropriate synchronization primitives, but this should be a last resort).

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.1. Shared Mutable State Accessed Concurrently in Rx Streams (High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_1__shared_mutable_state_accessed_concurrently_in_rx_streams__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Specifically targeting shared mutable state that is accessed concurrently by different parts of an RxSwift stream due to incorrect scheduler usage, leading to race conditions.
*   **Exploitation of RxSwift:**  If multiple parts of an Rx stream, potentially running on different schedulers, access and modify the same mutable state without proper synchronization, race conditions are highly likely.
*   **Potential Impact:** Same as 2.2 Race Conditions - Data corruption, inconsistent state, unpredictable behavior, potential security vulnerabilities.
*   **Mitigations:**
    *   **Avoid Shared Mutable State (Primary Mitigation):**  Design Rx streams to be stateless or use immutable data structures.
    *   If shared mutable state is unavoidable, use appropriate synchronization mechanisms (with caution and as a last resort).
    *   Careful scheduler management and testing for concurrency issues.

*   **Attack Vector:**  Logic errors in `filter` or `map` operators (or similar transformation operators) that unintentionally expose sensitive data that should have been filtered out or masked.
*   **Exploitation of RxSwift:**  If filtering or mapping logic is flawed, sensitive data might not be properly removed or masked before being passed down the Rx stream, potentially leading to exposure.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   Exposure of sensitive data (PII, credentials, confidential information).
    *   Privacy breaches.
    *   Unauthorized access to sensitive information.
*   **Mitigations:**
    *   **Careful Review of Filtering and Mapping Logic (Primary Mitigation):**  Thoroughly review and test `filter` and `map` operators to ensure they correctly handle sensitive data and prevent unintended exposure.
    *   Data masking and anonymization techniques within Rx chains.
    *   Principle of least privilege – only process and expose data that is absolutely necessary.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1.2. Improper Error Handling in Operators Leading to Unhandled Exceptions or Crashes (High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_2__improper_error_handling_in_operators_leading_to_unhandled_exceptions_or_crashes__high-risk_pa_f16ad87a.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Lack of or improper error handling in Rx operators, leading to unhandled exceptions, application crashes, or information leakage through error messages.
*   **Exploitation of RxSwift:**  If errors are not properly caught and handled within Rx chains using operators like `catchError`, `retry`, `onErrorResumeNext`, unhandled exceptions can propagate and crash the application. Error messages might also leak sensitive information.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   Application crashes and denial of service.
    *   Information leakage through error messages (stack traces, internal data).
    *   Poor user experience due to crashes.
*   **Mitigations:**
    *   **Robust Error Handling (Primary Mitigation):**  Implement comprehensive error handling using operators like `catchError`, `retry`, and `onErrorResumeNext` throughout Rx chains.
    *   Log errors appropriately for debugging and monitoring, but avoid logging sensitive information in error messages.
    *   Graceful error recovery and user-friendly error messages.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2. Resource Leaks due to Improper Operator Usage (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/3_2__resource_leaks_due_to_improper_operator_usage__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Improper usage of RxSwift operators leading to resource leaks, such as memory leaks or unclosed resources (file handles, network connections).
*   **Exploitation of RxSwift:**  Certain Rx operator patterns, especially those involving closures and long-lived subscriptions, can inadvertently create retain cycles and memory leaks. Improper resource management within Rx streams can also lead to leaks.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   Memory leaks and gradual memory exhaustion.
    *   Resource exhaustion (file handles, network connections).
    *   Application instability and eventual crash.
    *   Denial of service due to resource depletion.
*   **Mitigations:**
    *   **Memory Management Awareness (Crucial):**  Be mindful of retain cycles, especially when using closures within Rx operators. Use `weak self` or `unowned self` appropriately to break retain cycles.
    *   **Resource Management within Rx Streams:**  Ensure proper resource management within Rx streams. Use operators like `using` or implement custom resource management to guarantee resource cleanup (e.g., closing file handles, network connections) when Observables complete or error.
    *   Memory leak detection tools and monitoring.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2.1. Retain Cycles in Rx Chains Leading to Memory Leaks (High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_1__retain_cycles_in_rx_chains_leading_to_memory_leaks__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Specifically targeting retain cycles within Rx chains as a source of memory leaks.
*   **Exploitation of RxSwift:**  Closures used within Rx operators can capture `self` strongly, leading to retain cycles if the Observable or subscription also holds a strong reference back to `self`. This is a common issue in Swift and can be exacerbated by Rx.
*   **Potential Impact:** Same as 3.2 Resource Leaks - Memory leaks, resource exhaustion, application instability, crashes.
*   **Mitigations:**
    *   **Use `weak self` or `unowned self` in Closures (Primary Mitigation):**  When capturing `self` in closures within Rx operators, use `weak self` or `unowned self` to avoid creating retain cycles. Choose `weak self` for optional capture and `unowned self` when you are certain `self` will outlive the closure's execution (use with caution).
    *   Memory leak detection tools and profiling.
    *   Code reviews focused on closure usage in Rx operators.
