# Threat Model Analysis for reactivex/rxswift

## Threat: [Race Conditions due to Unintended Concurrency in Reactive Streams](./threats/race_conditions_due_to_unintended_concurrency_in_reactive_streams.md)

- **Description:** An attacker can exploit race conditions arising from the asynchronous and concurrent nature of RxSwift streams when developers incorrectly manage shared mutable state. By manipulating timing or input, an attacker can trigger concurrent operations on Observables that lead to data corruption or inconsistent application state. For example, in a stream processing user authentication, a race condition could allow an attacker to bypass authentication checks if concurrent requests are not properly synchronized when updating session state.
- **Impact:** Data corruption, inconsistent application state leading to authorization bypass, privilege escalation, or information leakage. In critical systems, this could lead to complete system compromise or significant financial loss.
- **Affected RxSwift Component:** Schedulers, `Observable.subscribe(on:)`, `Observable.observe(on:)`, operators enabling concurrency (e.g., `flatMap`, `merge`), Subjects used as shared mutable state.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Rigorously manage schedulers, ensuring operations requiring sequential consistency are executed on appropriate, single-threaded schedulers or using operators that enforce sequential processing.
    - Avoid shared mutable state wherever possible. Favor immutable data structures and functional reactive programming principles.
    - When shared mutable state is unavoidable, use thread-safe data structures or explicit synchronization mechanisms (though less idiomatic in RxSwift).
    - Employ RxSwift operators designed for managing concurrency safely, such as `concatMap` for sequential processing of asynchronous operations, or operators from reactive extensions for concurrency control if needed.
    - Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests specifically designed to detect race conditions in concurrent RxSwift streams, using tools to simulate concurrent execution and timing variations.
    - Conduct thorough code reviews focusing on concurrency management in RxSwift streams, paying close attention to shared state and scheduler usage.

## Threat: [Deadlocks or Livelocks due to Improper Concurrency Management in Reactive Flows](./threats/deadlocks_or_livelocks_due_to_improper_concurrency_management_in_reactive_flows.md)

- **Description:**  An attacker can induce deadlocks or livelocks by exploiting complex or poorly designed concurrent reactive flows built with RxSwift. This can occur when developers incorrectly use schedulers or concurrency operators, leading to situations where Observables are waiting for each other in a circular dependency (deadlock) or are continuously yielding without making progress (livelock). An attacker might craft specific input sequences or trigger application states that exacerbate these concurrency issues, leading to a denial of service. For example, if a complex chain of `flatMap` and `zip` operators is incorrectly scheduled, it could create a deadlock under specific load conditions.
- **Impact:** Application hangs, unresponsiveness, complete denial of service. For critical applications, this can lead to significant downtime, service disruption, and potential financial or reputational damage.
- **Affected RxSwift Component:** Schedulers, concurrency operators (`zip`, `combineLatest`, `merge`, `flatMap` with concurrency control), complex reactive flows involving multiple asynchronous operations.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Carefully design concurrent reactive flows, prioritizing simplicity and avoiding overly complex nested concurrency patterns.
    - Thoroughly understand the behavior of different RxSwift schedulers and concurrency operators, and choose them appropriately for the intended concurrency model.
    - Avoid creating circular dependencies in reactive flows that could lead to deadlocks.
    - Implement timeouts and circuit breaker patterns to mitigate the impact of potential deadlocks or livelocks and allow for recovery.
    - Conduct rigorous testing of concurrent reactive flows under various load conditions to identify and resolve potential deadlock or livelock scenarios. Use debugging tools and thread analysis to diagnose concurrency issues.
    - Simplify complex reactive flows where possible, breaking them down into smaller, more manageable and less error-prone components.
    - Employ code review by experienced RxSwift developers to identify potential concurrency mismanagement issues and design flaws in reactive flows.
