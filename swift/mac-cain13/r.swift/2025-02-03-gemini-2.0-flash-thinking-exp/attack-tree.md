## Attack Tree Path: [1. [1.1.1] Crafted Storyboard/XIB with Malicious Custom Classes - High-Risk Path & Critical Node](./attack_tree_paths/1___1_1_1__crafted_storyboardxib_with_malicious_custom_classes_-_high-risk_path_&_critical_node.md)

* **Attack Vector:**
    * An attacker modifies a storyboard or XIB file (or introduces a new one).
    * Within the storyboard/XIB, the attacker defines a custom class name for a UI element (e.g., a `UIView`).
    * This custom class name points to a class controlled by the attacker, containing malicious code.
    * r.swift generates code referencing this custom class name.
    * When the application instantiates the view from the storyboard, it attempts to load and instantiate the attacker's malicious class.

* **Risk Assessment:**
    * Likelihood: Medium - Requires codebase access, but storyboard manipulation is common in development.
    * Impact: High - Full code execution within the application's context.
    * Effort: Low - Modifying XML files is relatively easy.
    * Skill Level: Low-Medium - Basic iOS development and XML knowledge are sufficient.
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium - Code review can detect, static analysis might flag suspicious class names, but requires vigilance.

* **Mitigation Recommendations:**
    * Implement strict code review processes for all storyboard and XIB changes, specifically scrutinizing custom class names.
    * Utilize static analysis tools capable of scanning project resources for suspicious patterns, including unusual custom class definitions in storyboards.
    * Enforce the principle of least privilege to limit the impact of potential code execution vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. [1.1.4] Inject Malicious Strings in Localizable.strings files (Indirect) - High-Risk Path & Critical Node (1.1.4.1 Include format string vulnerabilities or XSS payloads in strings)](./attack_tree_paths/2___1_1_4__inject_malicious_strings_in_localizable_strings_files__indirect__-_high-risk_path_&_criti_c7336b3b.md)

* **Attack Vector:**
    * An attacker injects malicious content (e.g., format string specifiers like `%@`, `%x`, or XSS payloads like `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`) into `Localizable.strings` files.
    * r.swift generates code to access these strings, but is not directly involved in exploiting the vulnerability.
    * If the application uses these strings insecurely in later code (e.g., with `String(format:)` without proper sanitization, or displays them in web views without encoding), vulnerabilities are triggered.

* **Risk Assessment:**
    * Likelihood: Medium - Format string and XSS vulnerabilities are common, and injecting strings into resource files is trivial.
    * Impact: Medium-High - Exploitable format string bugs can lead to crashes or information disclosure. XSS can lead to session hijacking, data theft, and UI manipulation if strings are used in web views.
    * Effort: Low - Modifying strings files is very easy.
    * Skill Level: Low - Basic understanding of format strings and XSS is needed.
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium - Static analysis can detect basic `String(format:)` usage, but detecting all XSS scenarios statically is more challenging.

* **Mitigation Recommendations:**
    * Implement secure string handling practices throughout the application.
    * Avoid using `String(format:)` with user-controlled or resource-file-derived strings. Use safer alternatives like string interpolation or parameterized logging.
    * Sanitize and validate all strings retrieved from resource files before using them in security-sensitive contexts (logging, UI display, web views).
    * If strings are used in web views, implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS risks.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. [3.1] Compromise Resource Repository/Source - High-Risk Path & Critical Node (3.1.1 Gain access to source code repository and modify resource files)](./attack_tree_paths/3___3_1__compromise_resource_repositorysource_-_high-risk_path_&_critical_node__3_1_1_gain_access_to_c7a8843a.md)

* **Attack Vector:**
    * An attacker gains unauthorized access to the source code repository (e.g., through compromised credentials, social engineering, or exploiting repository vulnerabilities).
    * Once inside, the attacker modifies resource files (storyboards, XIBs, strings files, images, fonts) to inject malicious content as described in other attack vectors.
    * The attacker commits these malicious resource files to the repository.
    * All developers and users who pull from the compromised repository will receive the malicious resources in their builds.

* **Risk Assessment:**
    * Likelihood: Low-Medium - Depends heavily on the security posture of the source code repository and the organization's security awareness. Insider threats and credential compromise are common attack vectors.
    * Impact: High - Widespread impact, as all users of the application built from the compromised repository will be affected. This can lead to large-scale compromise.
    * Effort: Medium - Gaining repository access can require social engineering, phishing, or exploiting vulnerabilities, which can take moderate effort.
    * Skill Level: Medium - Social engineering or basic hacking skills to gain repository access.
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium - Code review processes and repository monitoring can detect malicious changes, but rely on vigilance and effective processes.

* **Mitigation Recommendations:**
    * Implement robust security measures for the source code repository:
        * Enforce strong access controls and the principle of least privilege for repository access.
        * Mandate multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all repository accounts.
        * Implement comprehensive activity logging and monitoring for the repository to detect suspicious actions.
    * Establish mandatory code and resource review processes before merging any changes to the main branch, especially for resource file modifications.
    * Conduct regular security awareness training for developers on supply chain security risks and best practices.
