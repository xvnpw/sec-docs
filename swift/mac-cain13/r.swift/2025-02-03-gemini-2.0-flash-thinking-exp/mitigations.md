# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for mac-cain13/r.swift

## Mitigation Strategy: [Verify r.swift Binary Integrity](./mitigation_strategies/verify_r_swift_binary_integrity.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Download r.swift:** Obtain the `r.swift` binary from the official and trusted source (e.g., GitHub releases page).
    2.  **Locate Checksum:** Find the official checksum (SHA256 or similar) provided alongside the binary download on the official source.
    3.  **Calculate Checksum:** Use a checksum utility (e.g., `shasum -a 256` on Linux/macOS) to calculate the checksum of the downloaded `r.swift` binary file.
    4.  **Compare Checksums:** Compare the calculated checksum with the official checksum. A match confirms integrity. Mismatch indicates potential tampering or corruption.
    5.  **Automate (Optional):** Integrate checksum verification into build scripts to automatically verify integrity upon usage or updates.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Supply Chain Attack (High Severity):** Mitigates the risk of using a compromised `r.swift` binary altered to inject malicious code during the build process.
    *   **Download Corruption (Low Severity):** Reduces the risk of using a corrupted binary leading to unpredictable behavior.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Supply Chain Attack:** Significantly reduces risk by ensuring an authentic `r.swift` binary.
    *   **Download Corruption:** Minimally reduces risk of build failures from corrupted binaries.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Manual checksum verification may occur during initial setup, but automation is often missing.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Automation of checksum verification in build scripts and CI/CD pipelines.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Pin r.swift Version](./mitigation_strategies/pin_r_swift_version.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Dependency Management:** Determine how `r.swift` is managed (manual binary, Brew, Mint, etc.).
    2.  **Pin Version:** Explicitly specify the exact `r.swift` version in your dependency configuration (e.g., `Brewfile`, `Mintfile`). Example: `brew "rswift", version: "6.2.0"`. Document version if manually managed.
    3.  **Version Control:** Commit the configuration file (or version documentation) to Git.
    4.  **Controlled Updates:** Update `r.swift` versions intentionally, after reviewing release notes and testing in a development environment.
