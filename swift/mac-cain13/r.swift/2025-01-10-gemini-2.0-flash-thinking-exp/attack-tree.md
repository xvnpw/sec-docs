# Attack Tree Analysis for mac-cain13/r.swift

Objective: Compromise the application by injecting malicious code or data through the R.swift resource generation process, focusing on high-risk areas.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
Compromise Application via R.swift
*   AND Inject Malicious Code/Data via R.swift
    *   OR **Exploit Vulnerable String File Parsing**  **(High-Risk Path)**
        *   ***Inject format string vulnerabilities or malicious scripts within string resources that R.swift includes verbatim in generated code, leading to code execution during string formatting or display.*** **(Critical Node)**
    *   OR **Exploit Vulnerable Data File Parsing (e.g., JSON, Plist)** **(High-Risk Path)**
        *   ***Inject malicious data structures or scripts within data files referenced by R.swift, leading to unexpected behavior or code execution when the application uses these resources.*** **(Critical Node)**
    *   OR **Compromise the Build Environment** **(High-Risk Path)**
        *   ***Modify Resource Files Before R.swift Processing*** **(Critical Node)**
    *   OR Exploit Vulnerabilities in R.swift Itself
        *   ***Code Injection via Unsafe Code Generation*** **(Critical Node)**
    *   OR **Exploit Weaknesses in Generated Code Usage** **(High-Risk Path)**
        *   ***Rely on Implicit Assumptions in Generated Code*** **(Critical Node)**
