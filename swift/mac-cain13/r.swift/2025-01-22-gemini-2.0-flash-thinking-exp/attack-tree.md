Objective: Compromise application using r.swift by exploiting vulnerabilities in resource handling and code generation.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
* Root Goal: Gain Unauthorized Control/Impact on Application via r.swift Exploitation
    * [1.0] Exploit Malicious Resource Files
        * [1.1] Inject Malicious Code via Storyboard/XIB **[HIGH RISK PATH]**
            * [1.1.1] Crafted Storyboard/XIB with Malicious Custom Classes **[HIGH RISK PATH]** **[CRITICAL NODE]**
                * [1.1.1.1] Define Custom Class Name in Storyboard pointing to Malicious Code **[CRITICAL NODE]**
                    * [Action] r.swift generates code referencing malicious class name
                    * [Impact] Application attempts to instantiate malicious class, executing attacker code
        * [1.1.4] Inject Malicious Strings in Localizable.strings files (Indirect) **[HIGH RISK PATH]**
            * [1.1.4.1] Include format string vulnerabilities or XSS payloads in strings **[CRITICAL NODE]**
                * [Action] r.swift generates code to access these strings
                * [Impact]  If strings are used in insecure contexts (e.g., `String(format:)`, web views), attacker can exploit format string bugs or XSS. (Indirect, but resource-related)
    * [3.0] Supply Chain Attacks Targeting Resource Files **[HIGH RISK PATH]**
        * [3.1] Compromise Resource Repository/Source **[HIGH RISK PATH]** **[CRITICAL NODE]**
            * [3.1.1] Gain access to source code repository and modify resource files **[CRITICAL NODE]**
                * [Action] Commit malicious resource files to the repository
                * [Impact]  All developers and users pulling from the compromised repository will receive malicious resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [1. [HIGH RISK PATH] - 1.1 Inject Malicious Code via Storyboard/XIB](./attack_tree_paths/1___high_risk_path__-_1_1_inject_malicious_code_via_storyboardxib.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting the XML structure of Storyboard/XIB files to inject malicious code that will be executed by the application.
* **Breakdown:**
    * **Likelihood:** Medium - Requires codebase access, but storyboard manipulation is a common development task.
    * **Impact:** High - Full code execution within the application's context.
    * **Effort:** Low - Modifying XML files is relatively easy.
    * **Skill Level:** Low-Medium - Requires basic iOS development knowledge and understanding of XML structure.
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Code review can detect suspicious changes, static analysis tools might flag unusual class names.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. [HIGH RISK PATH] - 1.1.1 Crafted Storyboard/XIB with Malicious Custom Classes & [CRITICAL NODE] - 1.1.1 Crafted Storyboard/XIB with Malicious Custom Classes & [CRITICAL NODE] - 1.1.1.1 Define Custom Class Name in Storyboard pointing to Malicious Code](./attack_tree_paths/2___high_risk_path__-_1_1_1_crafted_storyboardxib_with_malicious_custom_classes_&__critical_node__-__5f76a455.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Specifically targeting the custom class definition feature in Storyboard/XIB files. An attacker defines a custom class name for a UI element that points to a class containing malicious code.
* **Breakdown:**
    * **Action:** Attacker modifies a Storyboard/XIB file to include a custom class name for a UI element (e.g., UIView). This class name is under the attacker's control and contains malicious code. r.swift generates code referencing this custom class name.
    * **Impact:** When the application instantiates the view from the storyboard, it attempts to load and instantiate the attacker-controlled class, leading to code execution.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** High
    * **Effort:** Low
    * **Skill Level:** Low-Medium
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [3. [HIGH RISK PATH] - 1.1.4 Inject Malicious Strings in Localizable.strings files (Indirect) & [CRITICAL NODE] - 1.1.4.1 Include format string vulnerabilities or XSS payloads in strings](./attack_tree_paths/3___high_risk_path__-_1_1_4_inject_malicious_strings_in_localizable_strings_files__indirect__&__crit_8acb9846.md)

**Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious payloads (format string specifiers, XSS code) into `Localizable.strings` files. This is an indirect attack as the vulnerability is exploited when the application *uses* these strings insecurely.
* **Breakdown:**
    * **Action:** Attacker modifies `Localizable.strings` files to include format string specifiers (e.g., `%@`, `%x`) or XSS payloads (e.g., `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`). r.swift generates code to access these strings.
    * **Impact:** If the application uses these strings in vulnerable contexts (e.g., `String(format:)` without sanitization, displaying in web views without proper CSP), it leads to format string vulnerabilities or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** Medium-High
    * **Effort:** Low
    * **Skill Level:** Low
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Static analysis can detect `String(format:)` usage, XSS detection is more complex statically.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. [HIGH RISK PATH] - 3.0 Supply Chain Attacks Targeting Resource Files & [HIGH RISK PATH] - 3.1 Compromise Resource Repository/Source & [CRITICAL NODE] - 3.1 Compromise Resource Repository/Source & [CRITICAL NODE] - 3.1.1 Gain access to source code repository and modify resource files](./attack_tree_paths/4___high_risk_path__-_3_0_supply_chain_attacks_targeting_resource_files_&__high_risk_path__-_3_1_com_0acfe9d1.md)

**Attack Vector:** Compromising the source code repository to inject malicious resource files into the development pipeline.
* **Breakdown:**
    * **Action:** Attacker gains unauthorized access to the source code repository (e.g., through compromised credentials, social engineering, or exploiting repository vulnerabilities). They then modify resource files (storyboards, strings, images, etc.) or add new malicious resource files and commit these changes to the repository.
    * **Impact:** All developers who pull from the compromised repository will receive the malicious resources. When the application is built and distributed, it will contain the malicious resources, potentially affecting all users.
    * **Likelihood:** Low-Medium - Depends on the security posture of the source code repository and development practices.
    * **Impact:** High - Widespread impact on developers and application users.
    * **Effort:** Medium - Requires gaining access to the repository, which can vary in difficulty.
    * **Skill Level:** Medium - Social engineering, basic hacking skills, or insider knowledge.
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Code review and repository monitoring can detect suspicious changes, but relies on vigilance and proactive security measures.
