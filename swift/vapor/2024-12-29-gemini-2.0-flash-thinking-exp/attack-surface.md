*   **Attack Surface:** Route Parameter Injection
    *   **Description:**  Attackers manipulate URL parameters defined in Vapor routes to inject unexpected values, potentially leading to unauthorized access or actions.
    *   **How Vapor Contributes:** Vapor's routing system allows defining dynamic parameters within route paths (e.g., `/users/:id`). If these parameters are not properly validated and sanitized before being used in database queries or other operations, they become injection points.
    *   **Example:** A route defined as `/users/:id` might be accessed with `/users/1 OR 1=1 --`. If the `id` parameter is directly used in a database query without sanitization, it could lead to SQL injection.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized data access, data modification, potential command execution (depending on how the parameter is used).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate all route parameters against expected types and formats using Vapor's built-in validation mechanisms or custom validation logic.
        *   **Parameterized Queries (with Fluent):**  Utilize Fluent's query builder, which automatically escapes parameters, preventing SQL injection. Avoid using raw SQL queries where possible.

*   **Attack Surface:** Insecure Deserialization (with Custom Decoders)
    *   **Description:**  If custom decoders are implemented to handle request bodies (e.g., for specific data formats), vulnerabilities in the deserialization logic can allow attackers to inject malicious data that, when deserialized, executes arbitrary code or causes other security issues.
    *   **How Vapor Contributes:** Vapor provides flexibility in handling request data, allowing developers to implement custom decoders for various content types. If these decoders are not implemented securely, they can become an attack vector.
    *   **Example:** A custom decoder for a binary format might have a vulnerability that allows an attacker to craft a malicious binary payload that, upon deserialization, triggers a buffer overflow leading to code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use Well-Vetted Libraries:**  Prefer using established and well-vetted libraries for deserialization whenever possible.
        *   **Careful Implementation:**  If custom decoders are necessary, implement them with extreme caution, paying close attention to potential vulnerabilities like buffer overflows or type confusion.
        *   **Input Validation:**  Validate the structure and content of the data *before* deserialization if possible.

*   **Attack Surface:** Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) with Leaf
    *   **Description:**  Attackers inject malicious code into Leaf templates, which is then executed on the server, potentially leading to remote code execution or access to sensitive information.
    *   **How Vapor Contributes:** Vapor's default templating engine, Leaf, allows embedding dynamic content within templates. If user-provided data is directly embedded into templates without proper escaping, it can create an SSTI vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** A Leaf template might include `<h1>#(userInput)</h1>`. If `userInput` comes directly from a user without sanitization and contains `#{system("rm -rf /")}`, this command could be executed on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, information disclosure, server compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Context-Aware Output Encoding:**  Always escape user-provided data before embedding it into Leaf templates. Leaf provides mechanisms for this.
        *   **Avoid Direct Embedding of Untrusted Data:**  Minimize the direct embedding of user input into templates.

*   **Attack Surface:**  Middleware Bypass
    *   **Description:**  Attackers find ways to circumvent security middleware, such as authentication or authorization checks, gaining unauthorized access to protected resources.
    *   **How Vapor Contributes:**  Vapor's middleware system allows developers to intercept and process requests. Incorrectly configured or implemented middleware can create vulnerabilities that allow bypassing these checks.
    *   **Example:**  A middleware intended to authenticate users based on a session cookie might be bypassed if a specific route is incorrectly configured to not use the middleware or if a vulnerability exists in the middleware's logic.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Ensure Middleware is Applied Correctly:**  Carefully configure middleware to apply to all relevant routes. Use route groups effectively to manage middleware application.
        *   **Thoroughly Test Middleware Logic:**  Unit test middleware to ensure it functions as expected and cannot be easily bypassed.

*   **Attack Surface:**  Exposed Debug Endpoints/Information
    *   **Description:**  Development or debugging endpoints that expose sensitive information or allow administrative actions are unintentionally left enabled in production environments.
    *   **How Vapor Contributes:** Vapor's development mode might include helpful debugging tools or endpoints that are not intended for public access. If these are not properly disabled or protected before deployment, they become a significant vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** A debug route might expose internal server state, database connection details, or allow triggering administrative tasks without authentication.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential server compromise, unauthorized administrative actions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Disable Debug Features in Production:**  Ensure all development and debugging features are disabled or properly protected in production environments. Use environment variables or configuration settings to control this.
        *   **Secure Debug Endpoints (if necessary):** If debug endpoints are absolutely necessary in production (which is generally discouraged), implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for them.

*   **Attack Surface:**  Raw SQL Queries in Fluent
    *   **Description:**  Developers use raw SQL queries within Fluent, bypassing the framework's built-in protection against SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Vapor Contributes:** While Fluent provides an abstraction layer to prevent SQL injection, it also allows developers to execute raw SQL queries for more complex scenarios. This flexibility introduces the risk of SQL injection if these raw queries are not carefully constructed and parameters are not properly sanitized.
    *   **Example:** Instead of using Fluent's query builder, a developer might write `database.raw("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '\(unsafeInput)'")`, making the application vulnerable to SQL injection.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data modification, potential command execution on the database server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Prefer Fluent's Query Builder:**  Utilize Fluent's query builder as much as possible, as it automatically handles parameter escaping.
        *   **Parameterize Raw Queries:** If raw SQL queries are absolutely necessary, use parameterized queries with proper escaping mechanisms provided by the database driver.
