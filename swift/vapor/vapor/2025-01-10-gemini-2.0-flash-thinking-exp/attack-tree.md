## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Security Controls](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_security_controls.md)

**Goal:** To circumvent the mechanisms designed to protect the application from unauthorized access and actions.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Authentication/Authorization Weaknesses:**
        * **[HIGH-RISK NODE] Exploit Misconfigured Authentication Middleware:**
            * **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts requests that bypass authentication checks due to incorrect or incomplete setup of Vapor's middleware responsible for verifying user identity. This could involve missing middleware on certain routes, incorrect ordering of middleware, or flaws in the middleware logic itself.
        * **[HIGH-RISK NODE] Exploit Insecure Session Management:**
            * **Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in how the application manages user sessions. This could involve stealing session tokens through Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or network interception, predicting session tokens due to weak generation, or manipulating session IDs to gain unauthorized access to other users' accounts. This often involves weaknesses in how Vapor's session features are used or configured.
        * **[HIGH-RISK NODE] Exploit Insecure API Key Handling (if applicable):**
            * **Attack Vector:** If the application uses API keys for authentication or authorization, an attacker might gain access to these keys due to insecure storage (e.g., hardcoded in the application), insecure transmission (e.g., over HTTP), or access control vulnerabilities in configuration files. Vapor's configuration mechanisms might be involved in how these keys are managed.
    * **[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Routing Vulnerabilities:**
        * **Attack Vector:** While individual routing vulnerabilities might have a medium impact, the ability to manipulate routing can lead to bypassing security middleware or accessing unintended functionalities, making it a critical area. This could involve crafting URLs to skip authentication checks, accessing administrative routes without proper authorization, or exploiting flaws in how Vapor parses route parameters.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

**Goal:** To manipulate the application's behavior or gain unauthorized access by providing malicious input.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Insecure Deserialization (if used by application with Vapor):**
        * **Attack Vector:** If the application uses Vapor to deserialize data (e.g., from cookies, request bodies), an attacker can craft malicious serialized data. When this data is processed, it can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server, allowing the attacker to gain full control. This is a critical vulnerability due to its potential impact.
    * **[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Template Injection (if using Vapor's Leaf templating engine):**
        * **Attack Vector:** If the application uses Vapor's Leaf templating engine and incorporates user-provided data into templates without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious code into the template input. When the template is rendered, this code is executed on the server, potentially leading to remote code execution.
    * **[HIGH-RISK NODE] Exploit Inadequate Input Validation/Sanitization (related to Vapor's input handling):**
        * **Attack Vector:** The application fails to properly validate or sanitize user input received through Vapor's request handling mechanisms. This can lead to various vulnerabilities, including:
            * **SQL Injection:** If the input is used in database queries without proper escaping.
            * **Command Injection:** If the input is used to construct system commands.
            * **Path Traversal:** If the input is used to access files outside the intended directory.
            * This is a high-risk area because it's a common vulnerability with a wide range of potential impacts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities.md)

**Goal:** To leverage weaknesses in the application's configuration to gain unauthorized access or compromise security.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **[HIGH-RISK NODE] Exploit Misconfigured Security Headers (handled by Vapor):**
        * **Attack Vector:**  Vapor allows setting security-related HTTP headers. If these headers are missing or misconfigured, it can weaken the application's security posture, making it vulnerable to attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (due to missing Content Security Policy), or man-in-the-middle attacks (due to missing HTTP Strict Transport Security). This is high-risk because it's often a simple misconfiguration with significant security implications.
    * **[HIGH-RISK NODE] Exploit Exposure of Sensitive Information in Configuration Files (related to Vapor setup):**
        * **Attack Vector:** Sensitive information, such as database credentials, API keys, or other secrets, is stored insecurely in configuration files accessible to attackers. This could be due to the files being located in the web root, having incorrect permissions, or being committed to version control systems. Vapor's configuration file handling might be a factor in this exposure.
