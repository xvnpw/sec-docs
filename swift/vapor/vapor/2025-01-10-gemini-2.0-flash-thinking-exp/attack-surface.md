# Attack Surface Analysis for vapor/vapor

## Attack Surface: [Parameter Injection via Route Parameters](./attack_surfaces/parameter_injection_via_route_parameters.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can manipulate data passed through URL route parameters to inject malicious code or unexpected values, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or data access.
    *   **How Vapor Contributes:** Vapor's routing system makes it easy to define routes with parameters (e.g., `/users/:id`). If developers don't implement proper input validation and sanitization within the route handler, these parameters become a direct entry point for malicious input.
    *   **Example:** A route like `/items/:id` where `id` is used directly in a database query without validation. An attacker could send a request like `/items/1 OR 1=1; --` to potentially bypass intended logic.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access, modification of data, denial of service depending on the backend logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Use Vapor's built-in validation features (`Request.content.decode(User.self, using: .json, on: req)`) or custom validation logic to ensure route parameters conform to expected types and formats.
        *   **Parameterized Queries:** When interacting with databases, always use parameterized queries provided by Fluent (Vapor's ORM) to prevent SQL injection. Avoid string interpolation of route parameters directly into queries.
        *   **Type Safety:** Leverage Swift's strong typing to enforce expected data types for route parameters.

## Attack Surface: [Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/mass_assignment_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can manipulate request payloads to modify model properties that were not intended to be directly updated, potentially leading to unauthorized data manipulation.
    *   **How Vapor Contributes:** Vapor's model binding features can automatically populate model properties from request data. If not configured carefully, attackers can include unexpected fields in the request body and modify sensitive attributes.
    *   **Example:** A `User` model with an `isAdmin` property. If the handler directly decodes the request into the `User` model without specifying allowed fields, an attacker could send a request with `{"name": "attacker", "isAdmin": true}` to elevate their privileges.
    *   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, data corruption, unauthorized modification of user accounts or other entities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Explicit Field Selection (`FieldKey`):**  Use `FieldKey` in your models to explicitly define which properties can be updated via mass assignment. Avoid using `@Field` without `FieldKey` for sensitive properties.
        *   **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs):** Create separate DTOs for request payloads that only contain the fields intended to be updated. Map these DTOs to your model after applying necessary business logic and authorization checks.
        *   **Manual Property Assignment:**  Instead of relying solely on automatic decoding, manually assign properties after performing validation and authorization checks.

## Attack Surface: [Unintended Route Exposure](./attack_surfaces/unintended_route_exposure.md)

*   **Description:**  Internal functionalities or sensitive endpoints are inadvertently exposed due to misconfigured or overly permissive route definitions.
    *   **How Vapor Contributes:** Vapor's flexible routing system allows developers to define complex route structures. Mistakes in route definitions, incorrect use of route groups, or forgetting to apply necessary middleware can lead to unintended public access.
    *   **Example:** A route like `/admin/delete-user/:id` being accessible without proper authentication middleware applied, allowing anyone to potentially delete users.
    *   **Impact:** Access to sensitive data, unauthorized administrative actions, information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Only expose necessary endpoints publicly. Keep internal or administrative functionalities behind authentication and authorization middleware.
        *   **Middleware for Authentication and Authorization:**  Utilize Vapor's middleware system to enforce authentication (verifying identity) and authorization (verifying permissions) for sensitive routes.
        *   **Regular Route Review:** Periodically review your application's route definitions to ensure they align with intended access controls.
        *   **Route Grouping:** Use route groups to logically organize routes and apply middleware consistently to groups of related endpoints.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via HTTP Client](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_http_client.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can induce the server to make requests to arbitrary external or internal resources, potentially exposing internal services or performing actions on behalf of the server.
    *   **How Vapor Contributes:** Vapor provides a convenient HTTP client (`client.get()`, `client.post()`, etc.) for making outbound requests. If the target URL for these requests is based on user-provided input without proper validation, it can lead to SSRF.
    *   **Example:** An application that allows users to provide a URL to fetch an image. An attacker could provide a URL to an internal service (e.g., `http://localhost:8081/admin`) which the server would then unknowingly access.
    *   **Impact:** Access to internal resources, information disclosure, potential for further attacks on internal systems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize any user-provided input that is used to construct URLs for outbound requests.
        *   **URL Whitelisting:** Maintain a whitelist of allowed domains or protocols that the application is permitted to access.
        *   **Avoid User-Controlled URLs:** If possible, avoid allowing users to directly specify URLs for outbound requests. Use predefined options or identifiers that map to internal resources.
        *   **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate the application server from sensitive internal networks if possible.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Information via Environment Variables](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_information_via_environment_variables.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive data like API keys, database credentials, or encryption keys stored in environment variables can be inadvertently exposed through logging, error messages, or insecure deployment practices.
    *   **How Vapor Contributes:** Vapor applications often rely on environment variables for configuration. Improper handling or exposure of these variables can lead to security breaches.
    *   **Example:** Logging environment variables during application startup or in error messages that are accessible to attackers.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application and associated resources, access to sensitive data, ability to impersonate the application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Secrets Management:**  Use dedicated secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) instead of directly embedding secrets in environment variables or code.
        *   **Minimize Logging of Sensitive Data:**  Avoid logging environment variables or other sensitive information.
        *   **Secure Deployment Practices:** Ensure that environment variables are not exposed through deployment configurations or version control systems.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Access:** Restrict access to systems where environment variables are stored.
