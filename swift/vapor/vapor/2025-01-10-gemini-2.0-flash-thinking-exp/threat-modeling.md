### Threat: Route Parameter Injection
    - **Description:**
        - **Attacker Action:** An attacker manipulates URL route parameters by injecting unexpected or malicious values. This allows bypassing authorization checks or accessing unintended resources due to improper validation within Vapor's routing mechanism.
        - **How:** By directly modifying the URL in the browser, through crafted links, or via API requests.
    - **Impact:**
        - Unauthorized access to resources.
        - Data breaches by accessing or modifying data belonging to other users or entities.
    - **Affected Vapor Component:**
        - `Vapor/Routing`: The `Router` component responsible for matching incoming requests to handlers and extracting parameters.
        - `Vapor/Request`: The `Request` object where route parameters are accessible.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - **Input Validation:** Implement strict validation rules for all route parameters, ensuring they conform to expected data types and formats. Utilize Vapor's built-in parameter decoding and validation features.
        - **Avoid Direct Database Queries with Route Parameters:** Use Fluent ORM's query builder with parameter binding instead of constructing raw SQL queries directly from route parameters.
        - **Authorization Checks:** Implement robust authorization middleware that verifies the user's permissions based on the accessed resource and the provided parameters.

## Threat: [Middleware Bypass due to Improper Ordering or Logic](./threats/middleware_bypass_due_to_improper_ordering_or_logic.md)

### Threat: Middleware Bypass due to Improper Ordering or Logic
    - **Description:**

    - **Description:**
        - **Attacker Action:** An attacker manipulates user input that is used to construct Fluent ORM queries, potentially leading to unintended database operations. While Fluent aims to prevent direct SQL injection, vulnerabilities can arise if raw queries are used carelessly or if input is not properly sanitized before being used in Fluent's query builder.
        - **How:** By providing malicious input through forms, API requests, or other data sources that are incorporated into Fluent queries.
    - **Impact:**
        - Data breaches by accessing or modifying sensitive data managed by Fluent.
        - Data corruption or deletion within the database accessed through Fluent.
    - **Affected Vapor Component:**
        - `FluentKit`: The Fluent ORM framework used for database interaction within Vapor applications.
        - Specific Fluent query builder methods or raw query functionalities.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - **Parameter Binding:** Always use parameter binding when constructing Fluent queries with user-provided input. This leverages Fluent's built-in protection against SQL injection.
        - **Avoid Raw Queries:** Minimize the use of raw SQL queries in Fluent. If necessary, exercise extreme caution and implement robust input sanitization.
        - **Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize all user input before using it in Fluent queries.

## Threat: [Leaf Template Injection (Client-Side)](./threats/leaf_template_injection__client-side_.md)

### Threat: Leaf Template Injection (Client-Side)
    - **Description:**
        - **Attacker Action:** An attacker injects malicious code into user-provided data that is then rendered by the Leaf templating engine without proper escaping. This allows execution of arbitrary code in the victim's browser, a vulnerability directly related to how Leaf handles and renders dynamic content.
        - **How:** By submitting malicious input through forms, comments, or other user-generated content fields that are processed by Leaf.
    - **Impact:**
        - Execution of malicious JavaScript in the victim's browser.
        - Session hijacking.
        - Redirection to malicious websites.
    - **Affected Vapor Component:**
        - `Leaf`: The Leaf templating engine responsible for rendering dynamic content within Vapor.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - **Automatic Output Escaping:** Ensure Leaf's automatic output escaping is enabled for user-provided data. This is a core security feature of Leaf.
        - **Manual Escaping:** Use Leaf's escaping functions (e.g., `escape()`) when rendering data that might contain HTML or JavaScript.
        - **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to mitigate the impact of successful client-side template injection attacks within the context of the Vapor application.
