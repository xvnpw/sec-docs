# Attack Surface Analysis for vapor/vapor

## Attack Surface: [Route Parameter Injection](./attack_surfaces/route_parameter_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in how route parameters are handled, allowing attackers to manipulate data or access unintended resources by injecting malicious input into URL parameters.
*   **Vapor Contribution:** Vapor's routing system uses parameters defined in route paths (e.g., `/users/:userID`). If developers directly use these parameters in database queries or logic without proper validation and sanitization, injection vulnerabilities can arise due to how Vapor facilitates parameter extraction and usage within route handlers.
*   **Example:** A route `/items/:itemID` uses `itemID` directly in a database query like `SELECT * FROM items WHERE id = :itemID`. An attacker could inject `' OR 1=1 -- ` as `itemID` resulting in `SELECT * FROM items WHERE id = ' OR 1=1 -- '`, potentially bypassing access controls and retrieving all items. Vapor's routing mechanism makes it easy to access these parameters, increasing the risk if not handled securely.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access, data manipulation, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all route parameters *obtained through Vapor's request parameter access methods* before using them in any logic, especially database queries. Use Fluent's query builder with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
        *   **Type Safety:** Leverage Swift's strong typing and Vapor's features to ensure route parameters *processed by Vapor's routing* are of the expected type and format.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Grant minimal necessary permissions based on validated parameters.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in Leaf](./attack_surfaces/server-side_template_injection__ssti__in_leaf.md)

*   **Description:** Injecting malicious code into Leaf templates that gets executed on the server, allowing attackers to gain control over the server or access sensitive data.
*   **Vapor Contribution:** Vapor *integrates and recommends* Leaf as its templating engine. If developers directly embed user-controlled input into Leaf templates without proper escaping, SSTI vulnerabilities can occur because Vapor's ecosystem encourages Leaf usage and its features.
*   **Example:** A Leaf template might use `<h1>Hello, #(name)!</h1>` where `name` is user input. An attacker could provide `#{exec("rm -rf /")} ` as `name`, potentially executing arbitrary commands on the server if not properly handled. Vapor's default template engine being Leaf directly contributes to this attack surface if developers are not aware of SSTI risks in Leaf.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise, data breach, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Input Sanitization and Escaping:** Always sanitize and escape user input before embedding it in Leaf templates. Use Leaf's built-in escaping mechanisms (e.g., `#(raw(userInput))`, context-aware escaping) appropriately.
        *   **Avoid Dynamic Template Construction:** Minimize or avoid dynamically constructing templates based on user input within Leaf.
        *   **Secure Template Design:** Design templates to minimize the need for raw output and dynamic code execution in Leaf.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of templates to identify potential SSTI vulnerabilities in Leaf templates.

## Attack Surface: [Middleware Misconfiguration](./attack_surfaces/middleware_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrectly configured or implemented middleware can introduce vulnerabilities, bypassing security controls or exposing unintended functionalities.
*   **Vapor Contribution:** Vapor's middleware system is a core feature for request processing. Misconfiguration of *Vapor's built-in middleware* or custom middleware with flaws, facilitated by Vapor's middleware registration and execution pipeline, can create attack surfaces.
*   **Example:** A rate-limiting middleware *provided by Vapor or easily integrated within Vapor's middleware system* is configured with a very high limit or is easily bypassed due to incorrect logic, rendering it ineffective against brute-force attacks. Or, an authentication middleware *implemented using Vapor's middleware interfaces* has a bypassable condition due to a logical error in its implementation.
*   **Impact:** Authentication bypass, authorization bypass, denial of service, information disclosure.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Medium (depending on the middleware and misconfiguration - considering only High for this list based on request) - *Let's consider this High for this refined list as misconfigured security middleware can be critical.*
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Thorough Testing:** Rigorously test all middleware configurations and custom middleware implementations *within the Vapor application context*.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Configure middleware with the minimum necessary permissions and scope *within Vapor's middleware pipeline*.
        *   **Regular Review:** Regularly review middleware configurations and code for potential misconfigurations or vulnerabilities *in the Vapor application*.
        *   **Use Established Middleware:** Prefer using well-established and vetted middleware components *compatible with Vapor* whenever possible.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Using vulnerable dependencies in the Vapor project can introduce security flaws inherited from those dependencies.
*   **Vapor Contribution:** Vapor *ecosystem* relies on a set of dependencies managed by Swift Package Manager (SPM). Vulnerabilities in these dependencies (SwiftNIO, Swift Crypto, etc.) can indirectly affect Vapor applications. *Vapor's dependency management through SPM is a direct aspect of its framework.*
*   **Example:** A vulnerability is discovered in a specific version of SwiftNIO *used by Vapor applications*. This vulnerability could be exploited to cause a denial of service or other security issues in the Vapor application.
*   **Impact:** Various impacts depending on the vulnerability, including denial of service, remote code execution, data breach.
*   **Risk Severity:** Medium to High (depending on the vulnerability severity) - *Let's consider this High for this refined list as dependency vulnerabilities can be critical.*
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Dependency Management:** Regularly update Vapor and all its dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities. *Vapor's `Package.swift` and SPM workflow should be actively managed.*
        *   **Dependency Scanning:** Use dependency scanning tools (e.g., vulnerability scanners integrated into CI/CD pipelines) to identify and track known vulnerabilities in dependencies *used in the Vapor project*.
        *   **Dependency Auditing:** Periodically audit project dependencies to ensure they are from trusted sources and actively maintained *within the Vapor project's dependency graph*.
