# Threat Model Analysis for vapor/vapor

## Threat: [Middleware Bypass due to Misconfiguration](./threats/middleware_bypass_due_to_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could craft requests that bypass intended middleware checks (e.g., authentication, authorization) due to incorrect middleware ordering or flawed middleware logic in Vapor. This allows unauthorized access to protected resources.
*   **Impact:** Authentication bypass, authorization bypass, unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality.
*   **Vapor Component Affected:** Middleware system, request pipeline, `app.middleware.use()` configuration.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully review and test middleware ordering to ensure correct execution flow in Vapor.
    *   Write comprehensive unit tests specifically for Vapor middleware to verify intended behavior and prevent bypasses.
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege when designing authorization middleware within Vapor.
    *   Utilize Vapor's built-in middleware components where possible and thoroughly understand their configuration.

## Threat: [Routing Vulnerabilities - Unintended Access to Sensitive Routes](./threats/routing_vulnerabilities_-_unintended_access_to_sensitive_routes.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could discover or guess routes that are not intended to be publicly accessible, such as administrative or internal API endpoints, due to overly permissive route definitions or lack of proper access control within Vapor's routing system.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to administrative functions, information disclosure of sensitive data, potential for further exploitation of backend systems.
*   **Vapor Component Affected:** Routing system, `app.routes` configuration, route handlers in Vapor.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Explicitly define and document all intended public routes in your Vapor application.
    *   Implement robust authentication and authorization middleware for **all** routes requiring access control in Vapor.
    *   Avoid exposing debugging or administrative routes in production environments of your Vapor application.
    *   Use Vapor's route groups and middleware to enforce access control policies consistently across related routes.

## Threat: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in Leaf](./threats/server-side_template_injection__ssti__in_leaf.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious Leaf template code through user-controlled input if the Vapor application dynamically constructs Leaf templates without proper sanitization or escaping. This can lead to remote code execution on the server hosting the Vapor application.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution, complete server compromise, information disclosure, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **Vapor Component Affected:** Leaf templating engine, template rendering process in Vapor, handling of user input within Leaf templates.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never** directly embed unsanitized user input into Leaf templates within your Vapor application.
    *   Use Leaf's built-in escaping mechanisms to sanitize user input before rendering templates in Vapor.
    *   Prefer using template parameters and data context to pass data to Leaf templates instead of dynamic template construction in Vapor.
    *   Regularly audit Leaf templates for potential SSTI vulnerabilities, especially when handling user-provided data.

## Threat: [Fluent ORM Misuse leading to SQL Injection (Indirect)](./threats/fluent_orm_misuse_leading_to_sql_injection__indirect_.md)

*   **Description:** While Fluent (Vapor's ORM) is designed to prevent SQL injection, developers might bypass these protections by constructing raw SQL queries or misusing Fluent's API in ways that introduce vulnerabilities, especially when dealing with complex or dynamic queries within a Vapor application.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, unauthorized access to the database connected to the Vapor application, potential for privilege escalation.
*   **Vapor Component Affected:** Fluent ORM, database interaction layer in Vapor, raw query execution features of Fluent.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Primarily use Fluent's query builder API, which provides built-in protection against SQL injection in Vapor.
    *   Avoid using raw SQL queries in Fluent unless absolutely necessary for specific complex operations.
    *   If raw SQL queries are unavoidable in Fluent, carefully sanitize and validate **all** user input used in the queries.
    *   Regularly review Fluent queries, especially those involving dynamic input, for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities. Consider using parameterized queries even when using raw SQL through Fluent if possible.
