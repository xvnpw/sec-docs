# Threat Model Analysis for vapor/vapor

## Threat: [Route Hijacking via Wildcard Misconfiguration](./threats/route_hijacking_via_wildcard_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a poorly configured wildcard route (e.g., `router.get("files", "**")`) to access files or directories outside the intended scope.  The attacker might try paths like `/files/../../etc/passwd` or `/files/../Secrets.swift` to traverse the directory structure.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, source code, configuration data, or even system files.  Potential for information disclosure, code execution, or system compromise.
*   **Affected Vapor Component:** `Routing` (specifically `router.get`, `router.post`, etc., when used with wildcard parameters `**` or overly permissive path components).
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the sensitivity of exposed files).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Wildcards:**  Prefer specific route definitions whenever possible.
    *   **Strict Path Validation:** Implement *server-side* validation to ensure that the requested path does *not* contain directory traversal sequences (`..`, etc.). Use Vapor's `PathComponent` and related APIs.
    *   **Sanitize Input:** Sanitize any user-provided input used to construct file paths.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Run the Vapor application with the least necessary privileges.
    *   **Content Root Restriction:** Configure restricted file access permissions.

## Threat: [Middleware Bypass via Header Manipulation](./threats/middleware_bypass_via_header_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious request with specific HTTP headers designed to bypass or disable Vapor middleware responsible for authentication or authorization. They might spoof a `User-Agent` or send unexpected headers that cause the middleware to short-circuit.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to protected resources, bypassing authentication and authorization checks. Potential for data breaches, privilege escalation.
*   **Affected Vapor Component:** `Middleware` (any custom or built-in middleware that relies on request headers, especially authentication and authorization middleware).
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the protected resources).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Order Matters:** Ensure middleware is applied in the correct order (Authentication *before* authorization).
    *   **Don't Trust Headers:**  Do *not* rely solely on client-supplied headers for security decisions. Always validate and use server-side checks.
    *   **Robust Header Parsing:** Use Vapor's header parsing mechanisms and validate values carefully.
    *   **Test for Bypass:**  Specifically test for middleware bypass attempts.
    *   **Session Management:** Use secure, server-side session management.

## Threat: [Dependency Poisoning via Malicious Package](./threats/dependency_poisoning_via_malicious_package.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker publishes a malicious Swift package (typosquatting) or compromises an existing package. The developer unknowingly includes this in their Vapor project. The malicious package could contain code that steals credentials or opens a backdoor.
*   **Impact:** Complete application compromise. Data theft, code execution, denial of service.
*   **Affected Vapor Component:** `Swift Package Manager (SPM)` (the dependency management system), and any part of the Vapor application using the compromised package.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Pinning:** Use precise version numbers in `Package.swift`.
    *   **Dependency Auditing:** Regularly audit dependencies for vulnerabilities.
    *   **SCA Tools:** Employ Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools.
    *   **Package Verification:** Consider additional verification steps (e.g., checksums).
    *   **Private Repositories:** Consider using a private package repository.

## Threat: [Environment Variable Leakage via Debug Information](./threats/environment_variable_leakage_via_debug_information.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker triggers an error or accesses a debugging endpoint while the Vapor application is in debug mode (or with excessive logging). The error message or debug output might reveal sensitive environment variables (e.g., database credentials).
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure. Exposure of sensitive credentials.
*   **Affected Vapor Component:** `Application.environment`, error handling, and logging.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable Debug Mode in Production:**  *Never* run a production application in debug mode.
    *   **Environment Variable Control:** Use environment variables to control debug mode and logging.
    *   **Custom Error Handlers:** Implement custom error handlers that provide generic messages.
    *   **Log Sanitization:** Sanitize logs to remove sensitive information.
    *   **Secrets Management:** Consider using a secrets management solution.
