# Attack Surface Analysis for vapor/vapor

## Attack Surface: [Route Parameter Injection](./attack_surfaces/route_parameter_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious data through URL route parameters, aiming to manipulate database queries, file system operations, or external service calls.
*   **How Vapor Contributes:** Vapor's flexible routing system, specifically its use of dynamic route parameters (e.g., `:id`, `:username`), creates the *direct mechanism* for this attack. The framework provides the *means* by which untrusted input can be easily passed into application logic.
*   **Example:**
    ```swift
    // Vulnerable code:
    app.get("files", ":filename") { req -> EventLoopFuture<Response> in
        let filename = req.parameters.get("filename")! // Untrusted input
        return req.fileio.readFile(at: "/path/to/files/\(filename)") // Direct use, vulnerable to path traversal
    }
    // Attacker uses: /files/../../etc/passwd
    ```
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, data modification, data deletion, denial of service, potentially remote code execution (depending on context).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Parameterized Queries:** *Always* use Fluent's query builder with parameterized queries. Fluent's design *directly* addresses this vulnerability when used correctly.
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate the format, type, and range of route parameters *before* using them. Use Vapor's `Validatable` protocol or custom validation *within the Vapor route handler*.
    *   **Type-Safe Parameters:** Define route parameters with specific types (e.g., `Int`, `UUID`) directly in the Vapor route definition to enforce type checking at the framework level.

## Attack Surface: [Middleware Bypass/Misconfiguration](./attack_surfaces/middleware_bypassmisconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit incorrectly configured or ordered middleware to bypass security controls (authentication, authorization).
*   **How Vapor Contributes:** Vapor's middleware system is a *core framework feature*. The vulnerability arises from the *misuse* of this Vapor-provided feature. The framework provides the mechanism (middleware), and the developer's configuration of that mechanism creates the vulnerability.
*   **Example:**
    ```swift
    // Vulnerable: Authentication middleware is optional based on a header
    app.grouped(MyOptionalAuthMiddleware()).get("protected") { ... }

    // MyOptionalAuthMiddleware might check for a "skip-auth" header,
    // allowing an attacker to bypass authentication entirely.
    ```
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality, privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Correct Middleware Order:** Ensure authentication *always* precedes authorization within Vapor's middleware pipeline. This is a direct configuration issue within Vapor.
    *   **Unconditional Application:** Avoid conditionally applying security middleware based on *any* untrusted input. This is a best practice enforced through correct use of Vapor's middleware.
    *   **Thorough Testing:** Extensively test Vapor's middleware configurations, specifically focusing on bypass attempts.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Leaf Templates (using `#raw()`)](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_leaf_templates__using__#raw____.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious JavaScript via Leaf templates, targeting other users.
*   **How Vapor Contributes:**  Vapor's chosen templating engine, Leaf, *provides the `#raw()` tag*. This tag, a *direct feature of Leaf within Vapor*, is the *specific mechanism* that enables this XSS vulnerability if misused.  The automatic escaping is a Vapor/Leaf feature; the *bypass* of that feature is the vulnerability.
*   **Example:**  (Same as previous example, but the key is that `#raw()` is a *Leaf/Vapor feature*).
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking, defacement, redirection, arbitrary code execution in the user's browser.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid `#raw()`:** The primary mitigation is to *avoid using the Vapor/Leaf-provided `#raw()` tag* with untrusted data.
    *   **HTML Sanitization:** If `#raw()` *must* be used, sanitize the input *before* passing it to the Leaf template (which is part of Vapor). This is a mitigation *because of* the existence of `#raw()`.

## Attack Surface: [Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/mass_assignment_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers inject extra fields into model creation/updates, modifying sensitive data.
*   **How Vapor Contributes:** Vapor's `Content` protocol and Fluent ORM, *when used incorrectly*, facilitate this. The ease of decoding request data directly into models (a Vapor/Fluent feature) is the *enabling factor*.
*   **Example:** (Same as previous example, highlighting that `req.content.decode(User.self)` is a *Vapor feature* that, without proper DTOs, enables the vulnerability).
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data modification, privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects):** Define separate `Codable` structs (DTOs) for request payloads. This is a best practice *directly related to how Vapor handles content decoding*.
    *   **Explicit Field Mapping:** Manually map allowed fields from the request to the model, avoiding direct use of `req.content.decode(Model.self)`. This is a mitigation *because of* Vapor's easy decoding.

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected Administrative/Internal Routes](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_administrativeinternal_routes.md)

*    **Description:** Administrative or internal routes are exposed publicly without authentication.
*   **How Vapor Contributes:** Vapor's routing system allows for the creation of *any* route. The vulnerability is the *failure to protect* these routes using Vapor's middleware and grouping features.
*   **Example:** An `/admin/delete-all-data` route exists and is not protected by any Vapor authentication middleware.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, data breaches, data loss, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Route Groups:** Use Vapor's route groups to apply authentication middleware to *all* administrative routes. This is a direct use of a Vapor feature for mitigation.
    *   **Authentication Middleware:** Utilize Vapor's built-in or custom authentication middleware to protect sensitive routes. This is a core Vapor security mechanism.
