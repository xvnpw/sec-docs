## Attack Tree Path: [[*** Gain Unauthorized Access to Application Data/Functionality via Vapor ***] (Critical Node - Root)](./attack_tree_paths/__gain_unauthorized_access_to_application_datafunctionality_via_vapor____critical_node_-_root_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the ultimate goal of the attacker â€“ to gain control over the application's data or functionality by exploiting vulnerabilities specific to the Vapor framework.
*   **Impact:** Very High - Complete compromise of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [[Bypass Middleware] (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/_bypass_middleware___critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** Vapor's middleware system is designed to handle cross-cutting concerns like authentication, authorization, and request modification. Bypassing this system allows an attacker to circumvent security controls.
    *   **Impact:** Very High - Can lead to complete application compromise.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (Assuming well-vetted middleware and proper configuration)
    *   **Effort:** High
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

    *   **(HIGH RISK) Authentication Bypass:**
        *   **Description:** The attacker successfully bypasses the authentication middleware, allowing them to impersonate a legitimate user or access resources without proper credentials. This could be due to a flaw in the middleware itself, a misconfiguration, or a vulnerability in a custom authentication implementation.
        *   **Impact:** Very High - Full access to user accounts and potentially administrative privileges.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (If using well-vetted middleware and proper configuration)
        *   **Effort:** High (Requires finding a flaw in the authentication logic or middleware)
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (Might be detected by intrusion detection systems or unusual login patterns)
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
            *   Use well-vetted and actively maintained authentication middleware.
            *   Thoroughly test authentication flows, including edge cases.
            *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA).
            *   Regularly review and update authentication-related code and configurations.
            *   Monitor for unusual login activity.

## Attack Tree Path: [[Improper Error Handling] (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/_improper_error_handling___critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:**  How the application handles errors can inadvertently expose sensitive information or create new vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Variable, but can be Very High (e.g., if secrets are leaked)
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Common mistake, especially during development)
    *   **Effort:** Very Low to Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Very Easy

    *   **(HIGH RISK) Leaked Secrets:**
        *   **Description:**  The application accidentally reveals sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, or encryption keys in error messages, logs, or other outputs. This is often due to improper error handling or logging configurations.
        *   **Impact:** Very High - Direct access to sensitive data or systems, potentially leading to complete compromise.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (Requires a significant oversight)
        *   **Effort:** Very Low (Simply observing error messages or logs)
        *   **Skill Level:** Beginner
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (If secrets are visible in logs or error messages)
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
            *   *Never* hardcode secrets in the codebase.
            *   Use environment variables or a secure configuration management system.
            *   Sanitize logs and error messages to prevent accidental disclosure.
            *   Implement strict access controls to logs and error reporting systems.
            *   Regularly audit code and configurations for potential secret exposure.
        * **Verbose Errors:**
            * **Description:** Displaying overly detailed error messages to users, including stack traces or internal implementation details.
            * **Impact:** Low to Medium (Information disclosure, potentially aiding further attacks)
            * **Effort:** Very Low (Simply observing error messages)
            * **Skill Level:** Beginner
            * **Detection Difficulty:** Very Easy (Visible in the browser or application logs)
            * **Mitigation Strategies:**
                * Implement custom error handling that provides generic error messages to users.
                * Log detailed error information securely (e.g., to a file or a logging service) for debugging purposes.
                * Use Vapor's `Abort` error type appropriately.

## Attack Tree Path: [[Exploit Routing Issues]](./attack_tree_paths/_exploit_routing_issues_.md)

*   **(HIGH RISK) Path Traversal:**
        *   **Description:**  The attacker manipulates the URL path to access files or directories outside the intended web root. This could be due to a vulnerability in Vapor's routing logic or a misconfiguration in custom route handlers.
        *   **Impact:** High (Access to arbitrary files, potentially including configuration files with secrets)
        *   **Effort:** Medium (Requires finding a vulnerable route and crafting a suitable payload)
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Might be detected by intrusion detection systems or file integrity monitoring)
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
            *   Rigorously review all custom route handlers.
            *   Use Vapor's built-in path sanitization features.
            *   Ensure routes are defined as specifically as possible.
            *   Avoid overly broad wildcard matches.
            *   Use parameterized routes instead of string concatenation for path construction.
            *   Regularly audit route configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [[Misuse of Features]](./attack_tree_paths/_misuse_of_features_.md)

*   **(HIGH RISK) Crypto Misuse:**
        *   **Description:** Incorrectly using Vapor's cryptographic libraries or implementing custom cryptography with flaws. This could involve using weak algorithms, improper key management, or incorrect implementation of cryptographic protocols.
        *   **Impact:** Very High (Could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of data, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized access)
        *   **Effort:** Medium to High (Depends on the specific misuse; could involve breaking weak encryption)
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (Requires analyzing cryptographic implementations and detecting weaknesses)
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
            *   Use strong cryptographic algorithms and key lengths.
            *   Follow best practices for key management (e.g., use a hardware security module (HSM) if possible).
            *   Use Vapor's built-in cryptographic functions correctly and consult cryptographic experts if necessary.
            *   Regularly review and update cryptographic implementations.
            *   Avoid implementing custom cryptography unless absolutely necessary and with expert review.
