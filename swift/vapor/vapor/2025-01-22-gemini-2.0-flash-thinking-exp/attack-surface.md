# Attack Surface Analysis for vapor/vapor

## Attack Surface: [Route Parameter Injection](./attack_surfaces/route_parameter_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities arising from improper handling of route parameters. Attackers inject malicious code or data through route parameters, leading to unintended actions.
*   **Vapor Contribution:** Vapor's routing system allows defining routes with parameters. If handlers directly use these parameters in database queries, system commands, or other sensitive operations without sanitization, it creates an attack surface. Vapor provides the mechanism for parameter extraction, but doesn't enforce sanitization.
*   **Example:** A route `/users/:id` where `:id` is directly used in a database query like `User.find(req.parameters.get("id")!)`. An attacker could inject SQL code in the `id` parameter if raw SQL queries are used or if Fluent's query builder is misused by directly embedding unsanitized parameters.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access, data manipulation, server-side code execution (depending on the context of parameter usage).
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation:**  Validate and sanitize all route parameters before using them in any operation. Use type-safe parameter extraction provided by Vapor and validate against expected formats and values.
    *   **Prepared Statements/Fluent Query Builder:** Utilize Fluent ORM's query builder which inherently prevents SQL injection in most cases. Avoid raw SQL queries unless absolutely necessary and sanitize inputs rigorously if used.

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected Routes](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_routes.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive application endpoints are accessible without proper authentication or authorization, allowing unauthorized users to access functionality or data they shouldn't.
*   **Vapor Contribution:** Vapor's routing system requires developers to explicitly apply middleware for authentication and authorization to routes. Failure to do so leaves routes unprotected. Vapor provides the framework for middleware application, but doesn't enforce default protection.
*   **Example:** An admin panel route `/admin/dashboard` is defined but no authentication middleware is applied. Any user can access this route without logging in.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, administrative functions, or critical application features.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Authentication Middleware:** Implement and apply authentication middleware to all routes requiring user authentication. Vapor provides mechanisms for custom middleware and integration with authentication libraries.
    *   **Authorization Middleware:** Implement and apply authorization middleware to routes requiring specific user roles or permissions. Check user roles or permissions within middleware before allowing access to the route handler.
    *   **Route Grouping and Middleware Application:** Utilize Vapor's route grouping feature to apply middleware to groups of routes efficiently, ensuring consistent protection across related endpoints.

## Attack Surface: [Middleware Bypass](./attack_surfaces/middleware_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers find ways to circumvent or bypass security middleware, gaining unauthorized access or performing actions that should be blocked by the middleware.
*   **Vapor Contribution:**  Vapor's middleware system relies on correct implementation and ordering. Vulnerabilities in custom middleware or misconfiguration of middleware order within Vapor's application setup can lead to bypasses. Vapor provides the middleware framework, but the security depends on developer implementation and configuration.
*   **Example:** A custom authentication middleware checks for a specific header. An attacker discovers that by sending a malformed header or a request without the header, the middleware logic fails to execute correctly, allowing bypass. Or, incorrect middleware ordering in Vapor's configuration allows logging of sensitive information before authentication.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, data breaches, circumvention of security controls.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Thorough Middleware Testing:**  Rigorous testing of custom middleware to ensure it functions as intended and cannot be bypassed through various input manipulations or request conditions.
    *   **Middleware Ordering Review:** Carefully review the order of middleware in the application's configuration within Vapor's setup to ensure logical flow and prevent unintended bypasses due to ordering issues.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in Leaf](./attack_surfaces/server-side_template_injection__ssti__in_leaf.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in the templating engine (Leaf in this case) by injecting malicious code into templates through user-controlled input. This can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.
*   **Vapor Contribution:** If Leaf is used as the templating engine, and developers directly embed user input into templates without proper escaping or sanitization, SSTI vulnerabilities can arise. Vapor integrates Leaf as a templating option, and the risk arises from improper usage within Vapor applications.
*   **Example:** A Leaf template renders a variable `{{ userInput }}` directly. If `userInput` is derived from user input and not sanitized, an attacker could inject Leaf code like `{{ process.env.SECRET_KEY }}` to access server-side environment variables or even more dangerous code for remote code execution.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise, data breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Direct User Input in Templates:**  Minimize or eliminate the direct embedding of user-controlled input into Leaf templates.
    *   **Context-Aware Output Encoding:**  Use Leaf's built-in escaping mechanisms to properly encode output based on the context (HTML, JavaScript, etc.). Ensure variables are escaped appropriately when rendered in templates.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (Vapor Core)](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities__vapor_core_.md)

*   **Description:** Using outdated or vulnerable Vapor core dependencies that contain known security flaws.
*   **Vapor Contribution:** Vapor applications rely on Vapor core libraries. Vulnerabilities in these core dependencies directly impact the application's security.  The framework itself is a dependency.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability is discovered in SwiftNIO, a core dependency of Vapor.  Using an outdated version of Vapor that relies on the vulnerable SwiftNIO version exposes the application to this vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Various, depending on the vulnerability. Could range from information disclosure to remote code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Dependency Audits:**  Periodically audit Vapor core dependencies for known vulnerabilities by checking Vapor release notes and security advisories.
    *   **Keep Vapor Updated:**  Regularly update Vapor to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities in its core dependencies. Follow Vapor release notes and update promptly when security vulnerabilities are addressed.
