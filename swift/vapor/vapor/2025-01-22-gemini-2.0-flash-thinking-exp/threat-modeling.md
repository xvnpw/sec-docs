# Threat Model Analysis for vapor/vapor

## Threat: [Vulnerable Dependencies](./threats/vulnerable_dependencies.md)

* **Description:** Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in Vapor dependencies (including Vapor itself or SwiftNIO) to compromise the application. This can be achieved by targeting publicly known vulnerabilities or through supply chain attacks.
    * **Impact:**  Remote Code Execution, Data Breach, Denial of Service, Application Instability.
    * **Vapor Component Affected:** Swift Package Manager (SPM) integration, Dependency Management.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical to High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly audit and update dependencies using `swift package update`.
        * Utilize dependency vulnerability scanning tools.
        * Pin dependency versions in `Package.swift`.
        * Subscribe to security advisories for Vapor and its dependencies.

## Threat: [Dependency Confusion / Typosquatting](./threats/dependency_confusion__typosquatting.md)

* **Description:** Attackers publish malicious packages with names similar to legitimate Vapor dependencies on public package registries. Developers might mistakenly include these malicious packages in `Package.swift`. Upon installation, the malicious package executes attacker-controlled code.
    * **Impact:** Remote Code Execution, Supply Chain Compromise, Data Exfiltration, Backdoor Installation.
    * **Vapor Component Affected:** Swift Package Manager (SPM) integration, Dependency Resolution.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Carefully review package names and sources before adding dependencies.
        * Use reputable and well-maintained package sources.
        * Implement code review processes for dependencies.
        * Consider using private package registries for internal dependencies.

## Threat: [Route Parameter Injection](./threats/route_parameter_injection.md)

* **Description:** Attackers manipulate route parameters in HTTP requests to inject malicious code or commands. If these parameters are not properly sanitized and validated before being used in backend operations, the injected code is executed by the application.
    * **Impact:** Data Breach, Data Manipulation, Remote Code Execution (in some scenarios), Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
    * **Vapor Component Affected:** Routing (`app.get`, `app.post`, etc.), Request Handling (`Request` object, route parameters).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical to High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Always validate and sanitize route parameters using Vapor's validation features.
        * Utilize parameterized queries or Fluent ORM to interact with databases.
        * Avoid directly constructing commands or queries using unsanitized route parameters.
        * Implement input validation middleware.

## Threat: [Misconfigured Routes and Exposed Endpoints](./threats/misconfigured_routes_and_exposed_endpoints.md)

* **Description:** Developers unintentionally expose sensitive endpoints (debug routes, admin panels, internal APIs) due to incorrect route configurations in Vapor. Attackers can discover and access these exposed endpoints to gain unauthorized access or information.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized Access, Information Disclosure, Privilege Escalation, Data Breach.
    * **Vapor Component Affected:** Routing (`app.routes`), Middleware configuration.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Thoroughly review route definitions and ensure only intended endpoints are publicly accessible.
        * Utilize middleware to restrict access to sensitive routes based on authentication and authorization.
        * Follow the principle of least privilege when defining routes and access controls.
        * Regularly audit route configurations.

## Threat: [Middleware Bypass or Misconfiguration](./threats/middleware_bypass_or_misconfiguration.md)

* **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in custom or third-party middleware within Vapor to bypass security controls like authentication or authorization. This allows unauthorized access to protected resources or functionalities.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized Access, Privilege Escalation, Data Breach, Security Control Bypass.
    * **Vapor Component Affected:** Middleware system (`app.middleware`), Custom Middleware.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical to High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Carefully design and test custom middleware.
        * Thoroughly review middleware configurations and ordering.
        * Utilize well-tested and established middleware libraries for security tasks.
        * Ensure proper error handling within middleware.

## Threat: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) (Leaf Templating)](./threats/server-side_template_injection__ssti___leaf_templating_.md)

* **Description:** If using Leaf templating engine, attackers inject malicious template code through user-controlled input that is directly embedded into templates without proper sanitization. This allows execution of arbitrary code on the server.
    * **Impact:** Remote Code Execution, Server Compromise, Data Breach, Information Disclosure.
    * **Vapor Component Affected:** Leaf Templating Engine (`app.leaf`), Template Rendering.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Never directly embed user-controlled input into raw templates.**
        * Utilize Leaf's features for safe output encoding and escaping (`#raw`, `#escape`).
        * Employ Content Security Policy (CSP) headers.
        * Regularly audit templates for injection points.

## Threat: [ORM Injection Vulnerabilities (Fluent ORM)](./threats/orm_injection_vulnerabilities__fluent_orm_.md)

* **Description:** While Fluent aims to prevent SQL injection, improper use of Fluent's API or dynamically constructed complex queries based on unsanitized user input can still introduce ORM injection vulnerabilities. Attackers can manipulate database queries to bypass access controls or extract data.
    * **Impact:** Data Breach, Data Manipulation, Unauthorized Data Access.
    * **Vapor Component Affected:** Fluent ORM (`app.db`, `Model` queries), Database Interaction.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Thoroughly understand Fluent's query building API and best practices.
        * Avoid constructing complex queries dynamically based on unsanitized user input.
        * Utilize Fluent's query builder features and parameterized queries.
        * Regularly review Fluent queries for potential injection points.

## Threat: [Exposed Secrets in Configuration Files or Environment Variables](./threats/exposed_secrets_in_configuration_files_or_environment_variables.md)

* **Description:** Attackers gain access to sensitive information (database credentials, API keys, encryption keys) if these are stored insecurely in Vapor's configuration files or easily accessible environment variables.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized Access, Data Breach, System Compromise.
    * **Vapor Component Affected:** Configuration system (`app.environment`, `app.configuration`), Environment Variable access.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Never store secrets directly in code or configuration files committed to version control.**
        * Utilize secure secret management solutions (environment variables managed by deployment platforms, secret management services).
        * Encrypt sensitive configuration data at rest and in transit.
        * Regularly rotate secrets and API keys.

## Threat: [Insecure Default Configurations](./threats/insecure_default_configurations.md)

* **Description:** Vapor applications deployed with insecure default configurations (default API keys, weak encryption, exposed debug endpoints) are vulnerable to exploitation. Attackers can leverage these default settings to gain unauthorized access or compromise the application.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized Access, Data Breach, System Compromise.
    * **Vapor Component Affected:** Default application configuration, Server configuration.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Review and harden default configurations before deploying to production.
        * Disable debug mode and unnecessary development features in production.
        * Enforce strong password policies and secure default credentials.
        * Regularly audit configurations for security weaknesses.
