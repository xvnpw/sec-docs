# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for vapor/vapor

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation using Vapor's `Validatable`](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_using_vapor's__validatable_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Input Validation with `Validatable`
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Validation Rules using `Validatable`:** Leverage Vapor's `Validatable` protocol within your models or request structures. Implement the `validations(_ validations: inout Validations)` method to define validation rules using Vapor's built-in `Validators` (e.g., `.count(...)`, `.email`, `.url`, `.range(...)`, `.alphanumeric`).
    2.  **Apply Validation in Route Handlers:** In your Vapor route handlers, use `try request.content.validate(ContentModel.self)` to automatically execute the defined validation rules on incoming request data.
    3.  **Handle Validation Errors:** Catch `ValidationError` exceptions thrown by `validate(...)` and return user-friendly error responses using Vapor's error handling mechanisms, informing users about invalid input.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **SQL Injection (High Severity):** By ensuring data conforms to expected formats *before* database interaction via Fluent, `Validatable` reduces the attack surface for SQL injection.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Medium Severity):** Validating input fields that might be rendered in Leaf templates helps prevent injection of malicious scripts, contributing to XSS mitigation.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues (Medium Severity):** Enforces data consistency and validity within the application, preventing logic errors and data corruption.
    *   **Parameter Tampering (Medium Severity):** Makes it harder to manipulate request parameters for malicious purposes by enforcing expected data structures.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** High reduction (in conjunction with parameterized queries).
    *   **XSS:** Medium reduction (as part of a broader XSS prevention strategy).
    *   **Data Integrity Issues:** High reduction.
    *   **Parameter Tampering:** Medium reduction.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. `Validatable` is used for user registration and login forms, specifically for email and password formats.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Missing in several API endpoints that accept user input, particularly in profile updates and data submission routes. File upload validation using `Validatable` and Vapor's file handling features needs to be expanded beyond basic MIME type checks.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Parameterized Queries with Fluent ORM](./mitigation_strategies/parameterized_queries_with_fluent_orm.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Parameterized Queries with Fluent
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize Fluent's Query Builder:**  Construct all database queries exclusively using Vapor's Fluent ORM query builder methods (e.g., `Model.query(on: req.db).filter(...)`, `.create(...)`, `.update(...)`). Fluent inherently uses parameterized queries.
    2.  **Avoid Raw SQL:**  Strictly avoid constructing raw SQL queries directly within your Vapor application. Rely solely on Fluent's API for database interactions.
    3.  **Code Reviews for Fluent Usage:** Implement code reviews to ensure developers are consistently using Fluent's query builder and not resorting to raw SQL, especially in complex data retrieval or manipulation scenarios.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **SQL Injection (High Severity):** Fluent's parameterized queries directly and effectively prevent SQL injection attacks.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** High reduction. Fluent is the primary defense against SQL injection in Vapor applications.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Fully implemented. The project exclusively uses Fluent for database interactions, and code reviews reinforce this practice.
*   **Missing Implementation:** None. Parameterized queries via Fluent are consistently used throughout the application.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Password Hashing with Vapor's Hashing APIs](./mitigation_strategies/secure_password_hashing_with_vapor's_hashing_apis.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Password Hashing with Vapor's Hashing APIs
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use Vapor's Hashing APIs:** Employ Vapor's built-in hashing APIs (e.g., `app.hasher.hash(...)`) or dedicated packages like `Bcrypt` provided within the Vapor ecosystem for password hashing.
    2.  **Leverage Bcrypt or Argon2:**  Utilize strong hashing algorithms like bcrypt (via `Bcrypt`) or Argon2, which are readily available and recommended within the Vapor community.
    3.  **Configure Hashing Cost (if applicable):**  If using algorithms like bcrypt, consider adjusting the hashing cost/rounds through Vapor's configuration to balance security and performance.
    4.  **Password Reset Procedures with Vapor:** Implement secure password reset mechanisms using Vapor's features, ensuring secure token generation and verification without exposing old passwords.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Password Cracking (High Severity):** Strong hashing algorithms provided by Vapor make password cracking significantly more difficult.
    *   **Credential Stuffing (Medium Severity):** Reduces the effectiveness of credential stuffing attacks by making stolen password hashes less useful.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Password Cracking:** High reduction.
    *   **Credential Stuffing:** Medium reduction.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Fully implemented. Vapor's `Bcrypt` package is used for password hashing during user registration and password updates.
*   **Missing Implementation:** None. Secure password hashing using Vapor's tools is consistently applied.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Output Encoding in Leaf Templates](./mitigation_strategies/output_encoding_in_leaf_templates.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Output Encoding in Leaf Templates
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Rely on Leaf's Default Encoding:**  Utilize Leaf's default HTML encoding by using `#(...)` syntax for rendering variables in templates. This is the primary and recommended way to output user-provided data in Leaf.
    2.  **Context-Specific Encoding (if needed):** If you need to output data in contexts other than HTML (e.g., JavaScript strings), explore Leaf's custom tags or consider creating custom Leaf tags/functions for context-aware encoding.
    3.  **Minimize Raw Output (`!{...}`):**  Avoid using raw output tags (`!{...}`) in Leaf templates unless absolutely necessary and you are certain the data is safe. If raw output is required, implement rigorous sanitization *before* passing data to the template.
    4.  **Content Security Policy (CSP) Headers (Vapor Middleware):** Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers using Vapor's middleware to further mitigate XSS risks by controlling resource loading in the browser.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):** Leaf's default encoding and CSP headers (when implemented via Vapor) are key defenses against XSS vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** High reduction. Leaf's encoding and CSP are crucial for XSS prevention in Vapor applications using Leaf.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Mostly implemented. Leaf's default encoding is used in most templates. CSP headers are not yet implemented.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Review and replace instances of raw output (`!{...}`) in older templates with encoded output or proper sanitization and encoding.
    *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers using Vapor middleware to enhance XSS protection. Context-specific encoding in Leaf templates needs to be reviewed and applied where necessary.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Vapor Middleware for Security Headers and Rate Limiting](./mitigation_strategies/vapor_middleware_for_security_headers_and_rate_limiting.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Vapor Middleware for Security Headers and Rate Limiting
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement HTTP Security Headers Middleware:** Utilize Vapor's middleware system to add HTTP security headers (e.g., `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `X-XSS-Protection`, `Referrer-Policy`) to all responses. Create custom middleware or use existing community packages for this purpose.
    2.  **Implement Rate Limiting Middleware:**  Use or develop Vapor middleware to implement rate limiting for API endpoints and sensitive routes. This can protect against brute-force attacks and denial-of-service attempts. Configure rate limits appropriately for different routes and user types.
    3.  **Customize Middleware Configuration:**  Configure middleware settings (e.g., HSTS max-age, rate limit thresholds) based on your application's specific security requirements and risk tolerance.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Medium Severity):**  Security headers like `X-XSS-Protection` and CSP (as mentioned above) contribute to XSS mitigation.
    *   **Clickjacking (Medium Severity):** `X-Frame-Options` header mitigates clickjacking attacks.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks (Medium Severity):** `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS) header enhances HTTPS security and reduces MITM risks.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (Medium Severity):** Rate limiting middleware protects against brute-force login attempts and other attacks.
    *   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks (Medium Severity):** Rate limiting can help mitigate certain types of DoS attacks by limiting request frequency.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Medium reduction (as part of a layered defense).
    *   **Clickjacking:** Medium reduction.
    *   **MITM Attacks:** Medium reduction (enhances HTTPS security).
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Medium reduction.
    *   **DoS Attacks:** Medium reduction (for certain types of DoS).
*   **Currently Implemented:** Rate limiting middleware is partially implemented for login routes. Security headers middleware is not yet implemented.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Implement security headers middleware to add `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `X-XSS-Protection`, and `Referrer-Policy` headers to all responses.
    *   Expand rate limiting middleware to protect other sensitive API endpoints beyond login routes. Fine-tune rate limit configurations based on traffic patterns and security needs.
