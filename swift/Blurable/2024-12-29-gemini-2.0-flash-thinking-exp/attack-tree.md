**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**1. High-Risk Path: Supply Malicious Image URL -> Trigger Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) -> Read Internal Resources/Interact with Internal Services**

*   **Supply Malicious Image URL [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Description:** The attacker provides a malicious URL as input to the application, intending for Blurable to fetch an image from this URL.
    *   **Why Critical:** This is a critical entry point because successful exploitation directly leads to SSRF, bypassing network security boundaries.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on application's URL handling)
    *   **Impact:** High (Potential for accessing internal resources and services)
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Requires identifying vulnerable endpoints and crafting URLs)
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium (Understanding of web requests and internal network structure)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (Can be masked as legitimate internal traffic)

*   **Trigger Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) [HIGH-RISK PATH START]:**
    *   **Description:** Blurable, when fetching the image from the attacker-controlled URL, makes a request to a resource within the internal network or an external service controlled by the attacker.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (If the previous step is successful)
    *   **Impact:** High (Access to internal resources, potential network compromise)
    *   **Effort:** Low (Once the malicious URL is provided)
    *   **Skill Level:** Low (Leveraging the application's functionality)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (Requires monitoring outbound requests and correlating them with user input)

*   **Read Internal Resources:**
    *   **Description:** The attacker leverages the SSRF vulnerability to force the server to read sensitive internal files or access internal APIs.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (If SSRF is successful)
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High (Exposure of sensitive configuration, data)
    *   **Effort:** Low (Once SSRF is achieved)
    *   **Skill Level:** Low (Basic understanding of file paths or API endpoints)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Depends on logging and monitoring of internal requests)

*   **Interact with Internal Services [HIGH-RISK PATH END]:**
    *   **Description:** The attacker uses the SSRF vulnerability to interact with internal services, potentially performing actions they are not authorized to do.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on accessible internal services)
    *   **Impact:** High (Potential for further exploitation, data modification)
    *   **Effort:** Medium (Requires understanding of internal service APIs)
