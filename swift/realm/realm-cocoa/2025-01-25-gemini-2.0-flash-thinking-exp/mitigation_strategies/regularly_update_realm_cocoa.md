    *   **Impact:**  **High.**  Mitigation is highly impactful as it directly reduces the risk of severe security breaches that could lead to data loss, unauthorized access, or system compromise.
*   **Dependency Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  **Medium to High.**  Updating Realm Cocoa often includes updates to its own dependencies. While this strategy primarily focuses on Realm Cocoa itself, it indirectly contributes to mitigating dependency vulnerabilities by bringing in newer versions of dependencies that may contain security fixes. Integrating dependency vulnerability scanning (as suggested in 4.1.5 and addressing "Missing Implementation") would significantly enhance the effectiveness against this threat.
    *   **Impact:**  **Medium.**  Mitigation is moderately impactful as dependency vulnerabilities can still be exploited, but updating Realm Cocoa provides a degree of protection and creates opportunities to update transitive dependencies.

#### 4.3. Contextual Analysis (Currently Implemented & Missing Implementation)

*   **Currently Implemented:** The project's use of a dependency manager is a strong foundation. Developer awareness of updates is also positive, but informal awareness is insufficient for consistent security.
*   **Missing Implementation:** The lack of a formal process and automated vulnerability scanning are significant gaps.  The "Regularly Update Realm Cocoa" strategy directly addresses these missing implementations by:
    *   **Formal Process:**  The "Establish update process" component directly addresses the missing formal process.
    *   **Automated Scanning:**  The "Use dependency management tools" component, when combined with dependency vulnerability scanning tools, addresses the missing automated scanning.
