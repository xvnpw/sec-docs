# Attack Surface Analysis for realm/realm-cocoa

## Attack Surface: [Unencrypted Local Data Storage](./attack_surfaces/unencrypted_local_data_storage.md)

*   **Description:** Realm data stored on the device without encryption is vulnerable to unauthorized access.
    *   **How Realm-Cocoa Contributes:** Realm provides the *option* for encryption, but it's not enabled by default.  Developers must explicitly configure it.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains physical access to a lost device and extracts the unencrypted `.realm` file, revealing all stored user data.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of all data stored in the Realm, including sensitive user information, application data, etc.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** *Always* enable Realm encryption using a 64-byte cryptographically secure random key. Store the key securely using the iOS Keychain or Secure Enclave.  Never hardcode the key.

## Attack Surface: [Weak or Compromised Encryption Key](./attack_surfaces/weak_or_compromised_encryption_key.md)

*   **Description:**  Using a weak, predictable, or exposed encryption key renders Realm's encryption ineffective.
    *   **How Realm-Cocoa Contributes:** Realm relies on the developer to provide a strong and securely managed encryption key.
    *   **Example:** A developer uses a short, easily guessable password as the encryption key. An attacker uses a dictionary attack to crack the key and decrypt the Realm file.  Alternatively, the key is accidentally logged to a console or stored in an insecure location.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of all data stored in the encrypted Realm, similar to having no encryption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Generate a 64-byte cryptographically secure random key.  Store the key *exclusively* in the iOS Keychain or Secure Enclave.  Implement key rotation policies.  Thoroughly audit code to ensure the key is never logged, exposed in debug output, or transmitted insecurely.

## Attack Surface: [Realm Sync Authentication Bypass](./attack_surfaces/realm_sync_authentication_bypass.md)

*   **Description:**  Weaknesses in the authentication process for Realm Sync allow unauthorized access to synchronized data.
    *   **How Realm-Cocoa Contributes:** Realm Sync relies on a separate authentication system (often Realm Object Server's built-in authentication or a custom provider). The Realm-Cocoa SDK interacts with this system, and vulnerabilities in the *interaction* or the authentication system itself are relevant.
    *   **Example:**  An attacker exploits a weak password policy or a vulnerability in the OAuth flow to gain access to a user's Realm Sync account, allowing them to read or modify all synchronized data.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to, modification of, or deletion of all data synchronized through Realm Sync for the compromised account.  Potentially impacts multiple users if an administrator account is compromised.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Implement strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., multi-factor authentication, robust password policies, secure OAuth implementations).  Use HTTPS for all communication with the Realm Object Server.  Regularly audit and update authentication protocols. Ensure the Realm-Cocoa SDK is correctly configured to interact securely with the authentication provider.

## Attack Surface: [Insufficient Realm Sync Authorization (Permissions)](./attack_surfaces/insufficient_realm_sync_authorization__permissions_.md)

*   **Description:**  Poorly configured Realm Sync permissions allow users to access data they shouldn't.
    *   **How Realm-Cocoa Contributes:** Realm Sync provides a permission system, and the Realm-Cocoa SDK is used to *define and enforce* these permissions.  Misconfiguration within the SDK usage is the direct contributor.
    *   **Example:**  A developer grants all users read/write access to all objects in a Realm, allowing a regular user to modify or delete data belonging to other users or the application itself.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to, modification of, or deletion of data by users who should not have those privileges.  Data integrity and confidentiality breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Implement the principle of least privilege.  Define granular permissions *using the Realm-Cocoa SDK* that grant users only the minimum necessary access to data.  Regularly review and audit permissions.  Use Realm's query-based permissions for fine-grained control.

## Attack Surface: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack on Realm Sync](./attack_surfaces/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_realm_sync.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker intercepts the communication between the client (using Realm-Cocoa) and the Realm Object Server, potentially stealing or modifying data.
    *   **How Realm-Cocoa Contributes:** The Realm-Cocoa SDK handles the network communication with the Realm Object Server.  Failure to properly secure this communication within the SDK usage is the direct issue.
    *   **Example:**  An attacker on the same Wi-Fi network uses ARP spoofing to intercept the traffic between the app (using Realm-Cocoa) and the Realm Object Server, capturing sensitive data or injecting malicious data.
    *   **Impact:**  Data theft, data modification, potential compromise of the user's Realm Sync account.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** *Always* use HTTPS for communication with the Realm Object Server. Ensure the Realm-Cocoa SDK is configured to use HTTPS. Implement certificate pinning within the application code using the Realm-Cocoa SDK's configuration options to prevent attackers from using forged certificates.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Realm-Cocoa or its Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_realm-cocoa_or_its_dependencies.md)

* **Description:** Security flaws within the Realm-Cocoa library itself or its underlying dependencies could be exploited.
    * **How Realm-Cocoa Contributes:** As with any software, Realm-Cocoa and its dependencies are not immune to vulnerabilities.
    * **Example:** A newly discovered vulnerability in a cryptographic library used by Realm-Cocoa allows an attacker to bypass encryption.
    * **Impact:** Varies widely depending on the specific vulnerability, potentially ranging from data leaks to arbitrary code execution.
    * **Risk Severity:** Varies (High to Critical, depending on the vulnerability)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developer:** Keep Realm-Cocoa and all project dependencies updated to the latest versions. Use dependency scanning tools (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check) to identify and address known vulnerabilities. Monitor security advisories for Realm and related libraries.
