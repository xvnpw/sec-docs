## Project Design Document: Realm Cocoa (Improved)

### 1. Introduction

*   **Project Name:** Realm Cocoa
*   **Project Repository:** [https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa](https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa)
*   **Project Description:** Realm Cocoa is the official Objective-C and Swift SDK for Realm, a mobile-first database solution designed for offline-first applications on Apple platforms (iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS). It provides a local, embedded database that offers features like object persistence, querying, relationships, and change notifications.  Optionally, it integrates with Realm Sync for data synchronization with a backend server. This document focuses primarily on the local database functionality of Realm Cocoa, but will also address Realm Sync aspects where they impact the security context of Realm Cocoa itself.
*   **Purpose of this Document:** This document serves as a detailed design specification for Realm Cocoa, intended to be used as the basis for threat modeling activities. It outlines the system's architecture, data flows, key components, and technology stack, providing the necessary context to identify potential security vulnerabilities and inform mitigation strategies. This document is designed for security architects, developers, and anyone involved in the security assessment of applications using Realm Cocoa.

*   **Component Descriptions:**
    *   **"'Application Code (Swift/Objective-C)'":** This is the application-specific code developed by users of Realm Cocoa. It interacts with the Realm database through the provided SDK APIs to perform data operations, manage application logic, and present data to the user. This code resides within the application's process and is the primary interface for interacting with Realm.
    *   **"'Realm Cocoa Bindings (Objective-C/Swift)'":** This layer acts as the public API surface of Realm Cocoa. It provides idiomatic Objective-C and Swift interfaces for developers. It translates API calls from the application code into corresponding operations in Realm Core. This layer handles object lifecycle management, type conversions between Swift/Objective-C and Realm's internal representation, and error handling. It is crucial for API security and input validation at the SDK level.
    *   **"'Realm Core (C++)'":** This is the core database engine, implemented in C++. It is responsible for the fundamental database functionalities: transaction management (ACID properties), concurrency control, query processing and optimization, schema management and enforcement, and data persistence. Realm Core is designed for performance and cross-platform compatibility across all Realm SDKs. It is the central component for data integrity and security within the Realm ecosystem.
    *   **"'Object Store (Storage Engine)'":**  A sub-component within Realm Core, the Object Store is responsible for the low-level management of data on disk. It handles the physical storage format, indexing strategies, data file management (including file creation, access, and modification), and implements features like data at rest encryption. The efficiency and security of the Object Store are critical for overall database performance and data protection. Realm uses a custom storage engine optimized for mobile and embedded environments.
    *   **"'File System'":** This represents the underlying operating system's file system where Realm database files are physically stored. File system permissions and security policies enforced by the OS directly impact the security of the Realm database files.
    *   **"'Realm Sync Client (within Realm Cocoa)'":**  An optional component integrated into Realm Cocoa when using Realm Sync. It manages the client-side synchronization logic, including establishing connections with the Realm Sync Server, transmitting local changes, receiving remote updates, and handling conflict resolution. It is responsible for secure communication and data integrity during synchronization.
    *   **"'Realm Sync Server (Realm Cloud/Self-hosted)'":** The backend server component of Realm Sync, responsible for managing user accounts, permissions, data synchronization across multiple clients, conflict resolution at the server level, and persistent storage of synchronized data in the cloud or a self-hosted environment. While outside the scope of Realm Cocoa itself, its interaction is crucial for understanding the complete security landscape when using Realm Sync.
    *   **"'Network'":** Represents the network infrastructure used for communication between the Realm Sync Client and the Realm Sync Server. Network security (TLS/HTTPS, VPNs, etc.) is essential for protecting data in transit during synchronization.

### 3. Data Flow

*   **Data Read Path (Local Database):**
    1.  **Application Request:** Application code initiates a data read operation through the Realm Cocoa API (e.g., `realm.objects(MyClass).filter(...)`).
    2.  **Bindings Processing:** Realm Cocoa Bindings receive the request, validate parameters, and translate it into an internal representation understood by Realm Core.
    3.  **Query Execution (Realm Core):** Realm Core's Query Engine receives the query, optimizes it, and executes it against the Object Store.
    4.  **Data Retrieval (Object Store):** The Object Store retrieves the requested data blocks from the database file on the File System, potentially utilizing indexes for efficient lookup.
    5.  **Data Assembly (Realm Core):** Realm Core assembles the retrieved data into Realm objects and returns them to the Bindings layer.
    6.  **Bindings Conversion & Return:** Realm Cocoa Bindings convert the internal Realm objects into corresponding Swift/Objective-C objects and return them to the application code.

*   **Data Write Path (Local Database):**
    1.  **Application Modification:** Application code initiates a data modification operation within a write transaction using the Realm Cocoa API (e.g., `realm.write { realm.add(myObject) }`).
    2.  **Bindings Processing:** Realm Cocoa Bindings receive the write request, validate data, and translate it into operations for Realm Core. Transaction boundaries are managed at this level.
    3.  **Transaction Management & Write Operations (Realm Core):** Realm Core starts a transaction (if not already started by the Bindings), performs data validation and schema enforcement, and executes the write operations against the Object Store.
    4.  **Data Persistence (Object Store):** The Object Store updates the database file on the File System with the modified data within the ongoing transaction. This may involve writing to write-ahead logs and updating data files.
    5.  **Transaction Commit/Rollback (Realm Core):** Upon successful completion of write operations, Realm Core commits the transaction, making the changes durable. In case of errors, the transaction is rolled back, reverting to the previous state.
    6.  **Bindings Confirmation:** Realm Cocoa Bindings notify the application code about the success or failure of the write operation and transaction.

*   **Data Synchronization Path (with Realm Sync enabled):**
    1.  **Local Data Change Detection:** When local data is modified (via the Data Write Path), the Realm Sync Client within Realm Cocoa detects these changes.
    2.  **Change Set Preparation:** The Sync Client prepares a changeset representing the local modifications to be synchronized.
    3.  **Network Communication (Sync Client to Server):** The Sync Client establishes a secure connection (typically using WebSocket over TLS/HTTPS) with the Realm Sync Server and transmits the changeset.
    4.  **Server Processing & Conflict Resolution (Sync Server):** The Sync Server receives the changeset, authenticates the client (if necessary), applies the changes to the server-side data, and performs conflict resolution if concurrent modifications have occurred from other clients.
    5.  **Server-Side Updates & Push Notifications (Sync Server):** The Sync Server may also initiate updates based on changes from other clients or backend processes. It pushes these updates to connected Sync Clients.
    6.  **Client-Side Update Application (Sync Client):** The Sync Client receives updates from the Sync Server, applies them to the local Realm database, and triggers change notifications to the application code, ensuring data consistency across devices.
