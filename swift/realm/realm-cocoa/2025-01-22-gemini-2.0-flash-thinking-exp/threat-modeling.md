# Threat Model Analysis for realm/realm-cocoa

## Threat: [Unencrypted Data at Rest](./threats/unencrypted_data_at_rest.md)

*   **Threat:** Unencrypted Data at Rest
*   **Description:** An attacker who gains physical access to a device (lost, stolen, or seized) or unauthorized access to the device's file system (e.g., through malware or vulnerabilities) can directly read the unencrypted Realm database file. This allows the attacker to access all sensitive data stored within the Realm database.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, sensitive data exposure, potential identity theft, financial loss, reputational damage.
*   **Affected Realm Cocoa Component:** Realm Core (Storage Engine), Realm File
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable Realm database encryption using `encryptionKey`.
    *   Enforce device-level encryption provided by the operating system.

## Threat: [Weak Encryption Key Management](./threats/weak_encryption_key_management.md)

*   **Threat:** Weak Encryption Key Management
*   **Description:** An attacker who can discover or compromise the Realm encryption key can decrypt the Realm database, even if encryption is enabled. This can happen if the key is hardcoded in the application, stored in insecure locations (e.g., shared preferences, easily accessible files), transmitted insecurely, or derived from weak sources.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, sensitive data exposure, circumvention of encryption, potential identity theft, financial loss, reputational damage.
*   **Affected Realm Cocoa Component:** Realm Encryption, Key Management
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Store the encryption key in the operating system's secure keychain or secure enclave.
    *   Derive the encryption key from a strong, unpredictable source, potentially combined with user credentials or device-specific secrets using key derivation functions.
    *   Avoid hardcoding the encryption key in the application code.
    *   Do not store the encryption key in easily accessible storage locations.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Realm Cocoa Library](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_realm_cocoa_library.md)

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Realm Cocoa Library
*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the Realm Cocoa library itself. These vulnerabilities could range from memory corruption issues to logic flaws, potentially allowing for remote code execution, denial of service, or data breaches.
*   **Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, including remote code execution, denial of service, data breaches, application crashes.
*   **Affected Realm Cocoa Component:** Realm Cocoa Library (various modules depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies from Critical to High depending on the specific vulnerability.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Realm Cocoa updated to the latest stable version.
    *   Monitor Realm's security advisories and release notes for vulnerability information.
    *   Conduct regular code reviews and security audits of the application and its usage of Realm Cocoa.

## Threat: [SQL Injection-like Vulnerabilities (Realm Query Language)](./threats/sql_injection-like_vulnerabilities__realm_query_language_.md)

*   **Threat:** SQL Injection-like Vulnerabilities (Realm Query Language)
*   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate user input to craft malicious Realm queries. If the application doesn't properly sanitize or parameterize queries, an attacker might be able to bypass access controls, retrieve unauthorized data, or potentially cause unexpected application behavior.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data integrity compromise (in some scenarios), potential application logic bypass.
*   **Affected Realm Cocoa Component:** Realm Query Language, Query Execution
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize Realm's mechanisms for parameterized queries or safe query construction.
    *   Avoid directly concatenating user input into query strings.
    *   Validate and sanitize user input before using it in Realm queries.
