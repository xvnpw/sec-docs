# Attack Surface Analysis for realm/realm-cocoa

## Attack Surface: [Realm File Access Vulnerability](./attack_surfaces/realm_file_access_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized access to the Realm database file, leading to potential data breaches. This arises from insecure file storage location or insufficient file permissions, directly impacting the confidentiality of data managed by Realm.
*   **Realm-Cocoa Contribution:** Realm Cocoa stores persistent data in a file on the device's file system. The default storage location and permissions, if not explicitly secured by the developer, can be vulnerable.
*   **Example:** A malicious application installed on the same device, or malware gaining elevated privileges, could bypass application sandboxing and directly read the Realm file. This allows extraction of sensitive user data, such as credentials, personal information, or financial details stored within the Realm database.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, data theft, privacy violation, potential identity theft or financial loss for users.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Application-Side:**
        *   **Secure Storage Location:** Store the Realm file in the most secure directory within the application's sandbox, minimizing accessibility from other processes.
        *   **Restrictive File Permissions:**  Set the most restrictive file permissions possible on the Realm file and its containing directory, ensuring only the application's user and process have access.
        *   **Realm Encryption:** Utilize Realm's built-in encryption feature to encrypt the Realm file at rest. This adds a significant layer of protection even if unauthorized file access occurs.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Periodically audit file permissions and storage configurations to ensure they remain secure and aligned with security best practices.

## Attack Surface: [Realm Query Language (RQL) Injection](./attack_surfaces/realm_query_language__rql__injection.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities through the injection of malicious code into Realm queries. This occurs when user-supplied input is directly incorporated into Realm queries without proper sanitization, allowing attackers to manipulate query logic and access or modify data beyond intended permissions.
*   **Realm-Cocoa Contribution:** Realm Cocoa's query mechanism, using `NSPredicate` and string-based query languages, becomes vulnerable if user input is directly embedded in query strings without adequate sanitization or parameterization.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious input string into a search field within the application. This string is then directly used to construct a Realm query. By injecting carefully crafted RQL syntax, the attacker can bypass intended query filters, retrieve unauthorized data records, or potentially even modify or delete data within the Realm database. For instance, injecting predicates that always evaluate to true to bypass access controls or retrieve all data regardless of intended filters.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized data access, data manipulation, data corruption, potential application compromise, privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Application-Side:**
        *   **Parameterized Queries:**  Always use parameterized queries or query builder methods provided by Realm Cocoa. These methods prevent direct string concatenation and ensure user input is treated as data, not code.
        *   **Input Sanitization and Validation:** Sanitize and rigorously validate all user input before incorporating it into Realm queries. Implement allow-lists for expected input formats and reject or escape any unexpected or potentially malicious characters or syntax.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege in Queries:** Design queries to access only the minimum data required for the application's functionality. Avoid overly broad queries that could expose more data than necessary if an injection vulnerability is exploited.
        *   **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews to identify and eliminate any instances of unsanitized user input being directly used in Realm query construction.

## Attack Surface: [Data Exposure through Logging of Realm Data](./attack_surfaces/data_exposure_through_logging_of_realm_data.md)

*   **Description:** Unintentional exposure of sensitive data stored in Realm through insecure or excessive logging practices. While logging is a general development practice, logging data retrieved from Realm directly increases the risk of exposing sensitive information managed by Realm.
*   **Realm-Cocoa Contribution:** Developers working with Realm Cocoa might inadvertently log Realm objects or query results during development and debugging. If these logs contain sensitive data managed by Realm and are not properly secured or removed in production, they can become an attack vector.
*   **Example:** During development, logs are generated that include user authentication tokens or personal details retrieved directly from Realm objects. These logs are mistakenly left enabled in a production build or are accessible through device logs, crash reports, or insecure log management systems. An attacker gaining access to these logs can then extract sensitive user data initially secured within Realm.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, data theft, privacy violation, potential misuse of exposed credentials or personal information.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Application-Side:**
        *   **Minimize Logging of Sensitive Realm Data:** Avoid logging sensitive data retrieved from Realm objects in production environments. If logging is necessary for debugging, ensure it is strictly controlled and temporary.
        *   **Conditional Logging:** Implement conditional compilation or feature flags to completely disable or significantly reduce logging in production builds.
        *   **Log Redaction and Masking:** If logging sensitive Realm data is unavoidable, implement robust redaction or masking techniques to remove or obscure sensitive information before it is written to logs.
        *   **Secure Log Storage and Access Control:** Ensure that any logs generated, especially during development or testing, are stored securely and access is strictly controlled to authorized personnel only. Regularly purge or rotate logs to minimize the window of exposure.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Realm Cocoa Library Itself](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_realm_cocoa_library_itself.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of undiscovered security vulnerabilities or bugs within the Realm Cocoa library's code. As a complex software library, Realm Cocoa, like any other software, may contain vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.
*   **Realm-Cocoa Contribution:** The security of applications relying on Realm Cocoa is directly dependent on the security of the Realm Cocoa library itself. Undiscovered vulnerabilities within Realm Cocoa's codebase can directly impact the security posture of applications using it.
*   **Example:** A critical buffer overflow vulnerability is discovered in Realm Cocoa's core data handling or query processing logic. An attacker crafts a specific malicious input or triggers a particular sequence of operations that exploits this overflow, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution within the application's context, data corruption, or application crash.
*   **Impact:** Application crash, data corruption, arbitrary code execution, complete application compromise, potential for remote code execution depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Realm-Side:** Realm developers are responsible for employing secure coding practices, conducting thorough security testing, and promptly addressing and patching any discovered vulnerabilities in the Realm Cocoa library.
    *   **Application-Side:**
        *   **Stay Updated with Realm Cocoa Releases:**  Keep Realm Cocoa updated to the latest stable version. Regularly monitor for and promptly apply security patches and bug fixes released by the Realm team.
        *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Subscribe to Realm's security advisories and vulnerability disclosure channels to stay informed about any reported vulnerabilities and recommended mitigation steps.
        *   **Security Testing and Code Audits:** Incorporate security testing and code audits into the application development lifecycle, specifically focusing on interactions with Realm Cocoa and potential vulnerability points.
        *   **Report Suspected Vulnerabilities:** If you discover or suspect a potential security vulnerability in Realm Cocoa, responsibly report it to the Realm team through their designated security channels.
