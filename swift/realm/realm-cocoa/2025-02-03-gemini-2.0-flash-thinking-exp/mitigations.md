# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for realm/realm-cocoa

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable Realm Encryption](./mitigation_strategies/enable_realm_encryption.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  During Realm configuration, when creating a `Realm.Configuration` object, set the `encryptionKey` property. This is a Realm Cocoa specific configuration option.
    2.  Generate a strong, random encryption key (e.g., 64 bytes) to be used with Realm's encryption feature.
    3.  Securely store this key using the operating system's Keychain (iOS/macOS), as improper key storage negates Realm's encryption benefits.
    4.  Retrieve the key from the Keychain when configuring Realm.
    5.  Ensure the key is passed to the `encryptionKey` property of the `Realm.Configuration` to activate Realm's built-in encryption.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Data Breach at Rest (High Severity):**  If a device is lost, stolen, or compromised, the Realm database file, managed by Realm Cocoa, is encrypted, making the data unreadable without the encryption key.
        *   **Unauthorized File System Access (Medium Severity):**  Even if an attacker gains access to the device's file system, they cannot directly read the contents of the encrypted Realm file, which is a core component of Realm Cocoa.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Data Breach at Rest:** High risk reduction. Makes Realm data practically inaccessible without the key.
        *   **Unauthorized File System Access:** Medium risk reduction. Prevents direct access to Realm data but doesn't prevent all potential attacks.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, implemented in the `AppDelegate.swift` (or equivalent) during Realm initialization. The encryption key for Realm is generated and stored in the Keychain.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** N/A - Realm encryption is enabled for the primary Realm database. Consider extending encryption to any secondary or temporary Realm databases if used within the application.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Encryption Key Management using Keychain (for Realm Encryption)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_encryption_key_management_using_keychain__for_realm_encryption_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Key Generation for Realm:** Generate a cryptographically secure random key specifically for Realm encryption using `SecRandomCopyBytes` (iOS/macOS).
    2.  **Keychain Storage for Realm Key:** Use the Security framework's Keychain Services (`SecItemAdd`, `SecItemCopyMatching`, `SecItemUpdate`) to store the encryption key used by Realm Cocoa.
    3.  **Keychain Access Control for Realm Key:** Configure Keychain access control attributes to restrict access to the Realm encryption key to only the application itself.
    4.  **Key Retrieval for Realm Configuration:** Retrieve the Realm encryption key from the Keychain using `SecItemCopyMatching` when needed to configure Realm.
    5.  **Avoid Hardcoding Realm Key:** Never hardcode the Realm encryption key directly in the application code.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Encryption Key Compromise (Critical Severity):**  If the Realm encryption key is compromised, the entire Realm encryption is broken, and data becomes accessible. Keychain protects the Realm key.
        *   **Reverse Engineering Key Extraction (High Severity):**  Hardcoded Realm keys can be extracted through reverse engineering. Keychain storage makes Realm key extraction significantly harder.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Encryption Key Compromise:** High risk reduction for Realm data. Keychain is a robust system for secure key storage.
        *   **Reverse Engineering Key Extraction:** High risk reduction for Realm key. Makes key extraction significantly more difficult.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, implemented in a dedicated `KeyManager` class. This class specifically manages the Realm encryption key generation, Keychain storage, and retrieval. Used during Realm initialization.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Consider implementing key rotation strategy for the Realm encryption key in the future.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Realm File Permission Review](./mitigation_strategies/realm_file_permission_review.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Default Realm Permissions:** Understand the default file permissions applied by Realm Cocoa when creating database files. Realm typically sets permissions that restrict access to the application's user.
    2.  **Verification of Realm File Permissions:**  Programmatically verify the file permissions of the Realm database file after creation, ensuring they align with Realm's intended security model.
    3.  **Avoid Broad Permissions for Realm Files:** Ensure permissions for Realm files are not overly permissive.
    4.  **Restrict Access to Realm Files:** Confirm that only the application process has read and write access to the Realm file, preventing unauthorized access to the Realm database.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Local Access to Realm Data (Medium Severity):**  If file permissions for Realm files are too broad, other applications could potentially access or modify the Realm database.
        *   **Data Tampering of Realm Data (Medium Severity):**  If unauthorized write access is granted to Realm files, malicious applications could tamper with the Realm database.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Local Access to Realm Data:** Medium risk reduction. Restricts access to Realm data to the intended application.
        *   **Data Tampering of Realm Data:** Medium risk reduction. Prevents unauthorized modification of the Realm database.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Default Realm file permissions are relied upon. No explicit permission verification for Realm files is currently in place.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Implement a check during application startup to programmatically verify the Realm file permissions and potentially correct them if they are found to be overly permissive.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Realm Schema Definition and Data Validation](./mitigation_strategies/strict_realm_schema_definition_and_data_validation.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Realm Schema:** Clearly define the Realm schema using Realm Cocoa's object modeling capabilities. Specify data types, required properties, and relationships for all Realm objects.
    2.  **Data Validation Logic for Realm Objects:** Implement validation logic in your application code *before* writing data to Realm. This ensures data conforms to the defined Realm schema.
    3.  **Input Sanitization for Realm Data:** Sanitize user inputs before storing them in Realm to prevent injection-style attacks or storage of unexpected data within the Realm database.
    4.  **Realm Schema Migrations:** Manage schema changes carefully using Realm Cocoa's migration mechanism.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Data Integrity Issues within Realm (Medium Severity):**  Lack of schema and validation can lead to inconsistent or corrupted data in the Realm database.
        *   **Injection Vulnerabilities related to Realm Queries (Low to Medium Severity):**  Improper data handling could potentially lead to injection-style attacks if queries are dynamically constructed based on unsanitized input intended for Realm.
        *   **Unexpected Application Behavior due to Realm Data (Medium Severity):**  Storing unexpected data types or structures in Realm can lead to application errors when interacting with the Realm database.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Data Integrity Issues within Realm:** High risk reduction. Enforces data consistency within the Realm database.
        *   **Injection Vulnerabilities related to Realm Queries:** Low to Medium risk reduction. Reduces attack surface related to Realm queries.
        *   **Unexpected Application Behavior due to Realm Data:** High risk reduction. Improves application stability when working with Realm data.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, Realm schema is defined for all Realm objects. Basic data validation is implemented in some areas, but not consistently applied to all Realm data writes.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Implement comprehensive data validation for all Realm object properties, especially for user-provided data that will be stored in Realm.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Parameterized Realm Queries](./mitigation_strategies/parameterized_realm_queries.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use Realm Query Parameters:** Utilize Realm Cocoa's query builder or parameterized query features instead of directly concatenating user input into query strings when querying Realm.
    2.  **Avoid String Interpolation in Realm Queries:**  Do not use string interpolation or concatenation to build queries for Realm with user-provided values.
    3.  **Realm Query Language Best Practices:** Follow Realm's documentation for constructing secure queries in Realm Cocoa.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Realm Query Injection (Low to Medium Severity):**  Constructing Realm queries by directly embedding user input can potentially lead to unintended query behavior or data exposure from Realm if malicious input is crafted to alter the query logic.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Realm Query Injection:** Medium risk reduction. Prevents malicious users from manipulating Realm query logic through input.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Most Realm queries are constructed using Realm's query builder, but some instances of string interpolation might exist.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Conduct a code review to identify and eliminate all instances of Realm query construction using string interpolation or concatenation with user input.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep Realm Cocoa Updated](./mitigation_strategies/keep_realm_cocoa_updated.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Regular Realm Updates:**  Monitor Realm Cocoa releases and security advisories specifically.
    2.  **Dependency Management for Realm:** Use a dependency manager (like CocoaPods or Swift Package Manager) to manage Realm Cocoa and its dependencies, facilitating updates.
    3.  **Update Process for Realm:**  Establish a process for regularly updating dependencies, specifically including Realm Cocoa, to the latest stable versions.
    4.  **Testing After Realm Updates:**  Thoroughly test the application after updating Realm Cocoa to ensure compatibility and identify any regressions related to Realm functionality.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Known Vulnerabilities in Realm Cocoa (Variable Severity):**  Outdated versions of Realm Cocoa may contain known security vulnerabilities that are specific to Realm and have been patched in newer versions.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Known Vulnerabilities in Realm Cocoa:** High risk reduction. Patching Realm-specific vulnerabilities is crucial.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Dependency management is in place. Realm Cocoa updates are performed periodically but not on a strict schedule.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Establish a more proactive and regular schedule for checking for and applying Realm Cocoa updates.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Code Reviews Focusing on Realm Cocoa Usage](./mitigation_strategies/code_reviews_focusing_on_realm_cocoa_usage.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Security-Focused Realm Reviews:** Conduct code reviews with a specific focus on how Realm Cocoa is used in the application, including encryption, query construction, data validation, and schema management.
    2.  **Trained Reviewers for Realm:** Ensure reviewers are familiar with Realm Cocoa security best practices and common pitfalls related to its usage.
    3.  **Automated Code Analysis for Realm:**  Consider using static analysis tools to automatically detect potential security issues specifically related to Realm Cocoa usage patterns.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Implementation Errors in Realm Usage (Variable Severity):**  Human errors in implementing Realm features, especially security-sensitive ones, can introduce vulnerabilities specific to the Realm integration.
        *   **Logical Flaws in Realm Integration (Variable Severity):**  Design flaws in how Realm is integrated into the application logic can lead to security weaknesses related to data handling within Realm.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Implementation Errors in Realm Usage:** Medium to High risk reduction. Code reviews can catch Realm-specific errors.
        *   **Logical Flaws in Realm Integration:** Medium risk reduction. Reviews can identify design weaknesses in Realm integration.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, code reviews are standard. However, security-focused reviews *specifically* targeting Realm Cocoa usage are not consistently performed.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Incorporate security-focused code review checklists and guidelines specifically for Realm Cocoa. Train developers on Realm security best practices and ensure these are applied during code reviews.
