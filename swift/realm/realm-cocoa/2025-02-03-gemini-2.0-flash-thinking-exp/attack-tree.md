## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using Realm-Cocoa (If Realm Encryption Not Used)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_realm-cocoa__if_realm_encryption_not_used_.md)

**Attack Vectors:** This is the overarching high-risk path. It encompasses all attacks that become significantly easier and more impactful if Realm's encryption at rest feature is not enabled.
**Vulnerability/Weakness Exploited:** Lack of Realm encryption at rest. This makes the Realm database file directly readable if accessed.
**Impact:**  If successful, any of the sub-attacks can lead to unauthorized data access, data manipulation, or denial of service, ultimately compromising the application's confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
**Mitigation:**
    * **Enable Realm Encryption at Rest:** This is the *primary and most critical mitigation*. Configure Realm with an encryption key during initialization.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Data Access (If Realm Encryption Not Used)](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_data_access__if_realm_encryption_not_used_.md)

**Attack Vectors:** This path focuses on obtaining unauthorized access to the data stored within Realm. It becomes high-risk when encryption is absent.
**Vulnerability/Weakness Exploited:** Lack of Realm encryption combined with potential weaknesses in device security, application code, or backup practices.
**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data stored in Realm, leading to privacy violations, identity theft, financial loss, or reputational damage.
**Mitigation:**
    * **Enable Realm Encryption at Rest.**
    * **Implement strong device security practices.**
    * **Secure application code to prevent API misuse.**
    * **Secure backup processes.**

## Attack Tree Path: [Direct Realm File Access (Physical/Logical) (If Realm Encryption Not Used)](./attack_tree_paths/direct_realm_file_access__physicallogical___if_realm_encryption_not_used_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**  Directly accessing the Realm database file from the device's file system, either through physical access or logical access (e.g., malware).
**Vulnerability/Weakness Exploited:** Lack of Realm encryption at rest, combined with insufficient device security or malware infection.
**Impact:** Full access to the unencrypted Realm database, allowing the attacker to read, modify, or delete all data.
**Mitigation:**
    * **Enable Realm Encryption at Rest.**
    * **Enforce strong device passcodes/biometrics.**
    * **Educate users about device security and malware risks.**
    * **Consider application-level file integrity checks (as a secondary defense).**

## Attack Tree Path: [Physical Device Access (If User Device Security Weak)](./attack_tree_paths/physical_device_access__if_user_device_security_weak_.md)

**Attack Vectors:** Gaining physical possession of the user's device and exploiting weak device security to access the file system.
**Vulnerability/Weakness Exploited:** Weak device passcode, lack of biometric authentication, or jailbroken/rooted devices.
**Impact:**  Direct access to the device's file system, potentially leading to access to the Realm database file (if unencrypted).
**Mitigation:**
    * **Educate users about the importance of strong device passcodes and enabling biometric authentication.**
    * **Discourage users from jailbreaking/rooting their devices.**
    * **Implement remote wipe capabilities (if applicable and appropriate for the application).**

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Device Security Flaws (e.g., weak passcode, jailbreak)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_device_security_flaws__e_g___weak_passcode__jailbreak_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**  Actively bypassing or circumventing device security measures like passcodes or exploiting vulnerabilities introduced by jailbreaking/rooting.
**Vulnerability/Weakness Exploited:** Weak device passcodes, vulnerabilities in device security mechanisms, or security compromises introduced by jailbreaking/rooting.
**Impact:**  Gaining unauthorized access to the device and its file system, potentially leading to Realm data compromise (if unencrypted).
**Mitigation:**
    * **Educate users about strong passcodes and biometric authentication.**
    * **Encourage users to keep their devices updated with the latest security patches.**
    * **Application-level detection of jailbreaking/rooting and appropriate security responses (e.g., reduced functionality, warnings).**

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Realm File System Location (Known path or brute-force)](./attack_tree_paths/access_realm_file_system_location__known_path_or_brute-force_.md)

**Attack Vectors:** Once physical or logical access to the device is gained, locating the Realm database file within the application's sandbox. The path is often predictable or can be brute-forced.
**Vulnerability/Weakness Exploited:** Predictable or discoverable file system location of the Realm database within the application's sandbox.
**Impact:** Direct access to the Realm database file, enabling data extraction, modification, or deletion (if unencrypted).
**Mitigation:**
    * **Enable Realm Encryption at Rest (primary mitigation).**
    * **While less effective, consider obfuscating the Realm file path (though security by obscurity is not a strong defense).**
    * **Focus on preventing physical and logical device access in the first place.**

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit API Misuse in Application Code (Data Leakage, Data Manipulation, DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_api_misuse_in_application_code__data_leakage__data_manipulation__dos_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**  Exploiting flaws in the application's code that incorrectly uses Realm APIs, leading to unintended data exposure, manipulation, or denial of service. This is not a vulnerability in Realm itself, but in how the application *uses* Realm.
**Vulnerability/Weakness Exploited:**  Developer errors in application code when interacting with Realm APIs. Examples include:
    * **Data Leakage:** Unintentionally exposing sensitive data through poorly designed queries or data handling logic.
    * **Data Manipulation:** Allowing unauthorized modification of data due to insufficient input validation or access control in application logic.
    * **DoS:**  Creating queries or operations that consume excessive resources or trigger crashes in Realm due to improper handling of user input or application logic.
**Impact:**
    * **Data Leakage:** Exposure of sensitive information.
    * **Data Manipulation:** Corruption of data integrity, application logic bypass, potential privilege escalation.
    * **DoS:** Application becomes unavailable or unresponsive.
**Mitigation:**
    * **Secure Code Reviews:** Thoroughly review application code that interacts with Realm, focusing on data handling, query construction, and error handling.
    * **Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST):** Use SAST tools to identify potential code vulnerabilities related to Realm API usage.
    * **Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation in the application to prevent malicious or unexpected data from being processed by Realm.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant Realm access only to the necessary parts of the application and with the minimum required permissions.
    * **Resource Limits and Error Handling:** Implement application-level resource limits for Realm operations and robust error handling to prevent DoS and gracefully handle unexpected situations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Backup/Cloud Leakage of Realm Data (If User Backup Security Weak)](./attack_tree_paths/backupcloud_leakage_of_realm_data__if_user_backup_security_weak_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**  Compromising user backup accounts (e.g., iCloud, Google Drive) or intercepting backup traffic to access Realm data stored in backups.
**Vulnerability/Weakness Exploited:** Insecure user backup account credentials, lack of encryption for backups (less common now with default OS encryption), or vulnerabilities in backup mechanisms.
**Impact:** Exposure of Realm data stored in backups, even if the Realm database on the device is encrypted.
**Mitigation:**
    * **Educate users about securing their backup accounts with strong passwords and multi-factor authentication.**
    * **Ensure device backups are encrypted (OS-level setting).**
    * **Consider excluding highly sensitive Realm data from backups if absolutely necessary and feasible (with careful consideration of data recovery implications).**

## Attack Tree Path: [Application Backs Up Realm Data Insecurely (Default OS Backups)](./attack_tree_paths/application_backs_up_realm_data_insecurely__default_os_backups_.md)
