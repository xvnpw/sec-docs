# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a fast, efficient, and developer-friendly mobile database solution for iOS and macOS applications.
  - Enable offline data storage and synchronization capabilities for mobile applications.
  - Offer a robust and reliable database solution that simplifies data management in mobile development.
  - Support a wide range of data types and complex data relationships.
  - Maintain compatibility with the latest iOS and macOS versions and development tools.
- Business Risks:
  - Data corruption or loss due to software bugs or unexpected application termination.
  - Performance bottlenecks impacting application responsiveness and user experience.
  - Security vulnerabilities leading to unauthorized data access or modification.
  - Compatibility issues with future operating system updates or development tool changes.
  - Difficulty in attracting and retaining users if the database solution is unreliable or hard to use.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Code reviews are likely performed as part of the development process, although not explicitly documented in the provided repository. (Location: Assumed based on standard software development practices)
  - security control: Unit and integration tests are present in the repository. (Location: `Tests` directory in the repository)
  - security control: Publicly available source code allows for community security review. (Location: GitHub repository)
  - security control: Issue tracking system (GitHub Issues) is used for reporting and addressing bugs, including potential security vulnerabilities. (Location: GitHub repository)
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability identification and patching.
  - accepted risk: Limited formal security testing or penetration testing documentation available in the public repository.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code.
  - security control: Introduce Dependency Check tools to identify and manage known vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
  - security control: Conduct regular security code reviews with a focus on identifying and mitigating potential security risks.
  - security control: Establish a clear process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities, including a security policy and contact information.
  - security control: Consider performing penetration testing or security audits by external security experts.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Not directly applicable to a database library itself, as authentication is typically handled by the application using the library.
    - The library should provide mechanisms to integrate with application-level authentication schemes if needed (e.g., for data synchronization with backend services).
  - Authorization:
    - The library should enforce access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized application components can access and modify data.
    - Consider role-based access control within the application using the library's features.
  - Input Validation:
    - The library must perform robust input validation to prevent injection attacks and data corruption.
    - All data inputs from the application should be validated to ensure they conform to expected formats and constraints.
    - The library should handle invalid or malicious input gracefully and securely, without crashing or exposing sensitive information.
  - Cryptography:
    - If data encryption at rest is required, the library should provide or integrate with secure cryptographic mechanisms.
    - Consider using platform-provided encryption APIs for data protection.
    - Ensure proper key management practices if encryption is implemented.
    - For data synchronization, ensure secure communication channels (e.g., TLS/HTTPS) are used to protect data in transit.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Secure and reliable data storage and retrieval within mobile applications.
  - Maintaining data integrity and preventing data corruption.
  - Ensuring application performance and responsiveness when interacting with the database.
  - Protecting user data privacy and confidentiality.
  - Smooth application operation and preventing crashes or unexpected behavior due to database issues.

- Data Sensitivity:
  - Data stored by applications using Realm Cocoa can vary greatly in sensitivity depending on the application's purpose.
