# Attack Surface Analysis for realm/realm-cocoa

## Attack Surface: [Unencrypted or Weakly Encrypted Realm Files](./attack_surfaces/unencrypted_or_weakly_encrypted_realm_files.md)

**Description:** Realm database files are stored locally on the device. If encryption is not enabled or is implemented with weak keys or insecure key storage, the data within the Realm is vulnerable to unauthorized access if the device is compromised.

**How Realm Cocoa Contributes:** Realm Cocoa is responsible for creating and managing these local database files. The developer's choice to enable encryption (using Realm's API) and how they manage the encryption key (also influenced by Realm's design) directly impacts this attack surface.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to a user's unlocked device or extracts the file system contents. If the Realm file is unencrypted, they can directly read sensitive data. If the encryption key is easily guessable or stored insecurely (due to developer misuse of Realm's key handling), they can decrypt the file.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive user data, potential regulatory violations.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Always enable Realm encryption using `Realm.Configuration(encryptionKey: ...)` for sensitive data.**
*   **Generate and securely store strong, randomly generated encryption keys, leveraging platform-specific keychains or secure enclaves (not directly managed by Realm, but the need is driven by Realm's encryption requirement).**
*   **Avoid hardcoding encryption keys or deriving them from easily guessable information within the application.**

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Realm Synchronization](./attack_surfaces/insecure_realm_synchronization.md)

**Description:** When using Realm Sync, data is transmitted between the client application (using Realm Cocoa) and the Realm Object Server. If this communication is not properly secured, it's vulnerable to interception and manipulation.

**How Realm Cocoa Contributes:** Realm Cocoa handles the client-side of the synchronization process, including establishing connections and transmitting data to the Realm Object Server. The configuration of the `SyncConfiguration` in Realm Cocoa is crucial for security.

**Example:** An attacker performs a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack on the network traffic between the application (using Realm Cocoa's sync features) and the Realm Object Server, intercepting and potentially modifying synchronized data.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach, data integrity compromise, potential for unauthorized data modification, leading to inconsistencies across synced devices.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Always use HTTPS (TLS/SSL) for communication with the Realm Object Server (enforced through proper `SyncConfiguration`).**
*   **Implement certificate pinning within the application (using mechanisms outside of Realm Cocoa but essential for secure sync) to prevent MITM attacks by validating the server's certificate.**
*   **Ensure the Realm Object Server is properly configured with strong security settings (server-side configuration, but the need is driven by using Realm Sync).**
*   **Utilize strong authentication mechanisms for Realm Sync users, as enforced by the Realm Object Server and integrated with Realm Cocoa.**

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Realm Cocoa Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_realm_cocoa_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Realm Cocoa relies on other libraries and frameworks. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could indirectly affect the security of applications using Realm.

**How Realm Cocoa Contributes:** The inclusion of these dependencies is a direct part of the Realm Cocoa framework. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies become part of the application's attack surface by virtue of using Realm Cocoa.

**Example:** A third-party library used by Realm Cocoa has a known security vulnerability that allows for remote code execution. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability through the application using Realm.

**Impact:** Range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, including remote code execution on the user's device, denial of service, and information disclosure.

**Risk Severity:** Can range from Medium to Critical depending on the specific vulnerability, but considered High for this filtered list due to potential impact.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Regularly update the Realm Cocoa SDK to benefit from security patches in its dependencies.**
*   **Monitor security advisories for vulnerabilities in Realm Cocoa and its dependencies.**
*   **Consider using dependency scanning tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in the Realm Cocoa framework and its transitive dependencies.**
