# Threat Model Analysis for realm/realm-cocoa

## Threat: [Unencrypted Local Storage](./threats/unencrypted_local_storage.md)

**Description:** An attacker with physical access to the device could bypass application security and directly access the Realm database file on the file system. They could then read, modify, or exfiltrate sensitive data stored within the Realm. This is possible because Realm Cocoa, by default, stores data in an unencrypted format on the device's storage.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach, data integrity compromise, potential for identity theft or financial loss depending on the data stored.

**Affected Realm Cocoa Component:** Local Realm file storage.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Encourage users to enable strong device-level encryption (e.g., FileVault on macOS, full disk encryption on Android).
* Consider implementing application-level encryption for highly sensitive data stored within Realm, being mindful of secure key management practices.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack During Synchronization](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_during_synchronization.md)

**Description:** If using Realm Mobile Platform or Realm Cloud for synchronization and the communication channel used by the Realm Cocoa SDK is not properly secured (e.g., inadvertently configured to use HTTP instead of HTTPS), an attacker on the network could intercept communication between the device and the server. They could eavesdrop on the Realm data being synchronized, potentially stealing sensitive information, or even manipulate the data in transit, affecting the local Realm database.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach, data integrity compromise, potential for unauthorized data modification within the local Realm.

**Affected Realm Cocoa Component:** Realm synchronization mechanisms, specifically the network communication handled by the SDK.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure all communication with Realm Mobile Platform or Realm Cloud is configured to use HTTPS within the application's Realm configuration.
* Implement certificate pinning within the application to prevent attackers from using forged certificates when communicating with the Realm backend.

## Threat: [Bugs in the Realm Cocoa SDK](./threats/bugs_in_the_realm_cocoa_sdk.md)

**Description:** The Realm Cocoa SDK, like any software, might contain security vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to achieve various malicious outcomes, such as arbitrary code execution within the application's context, denial of service by crashing the application, or unauthorized access to Realm data.

**Impact:** Varies depending on the nature of the bug, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or data breaches affecting the local Realm database.

**Affected Realm Cocoa Component:** Various modules and functions within the Realm Cocoa SDK.

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific bug (can be Critical).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep the Realm Cocoa SDK updated to the latest stable version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
* Monitor Realm's release notes and security advisories for known vulnerabilities and updates.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Excessive Data Write](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_excessive_data_write.md)

**Description:** A malicious actor or a compromised part of the application could intentionally write a massive amount of data to the local Realm database using the Realm Cocoa SDK. This could fill up the device's storage, leading to performance issues, application crashes, or even rendering the device unusable.

**Impact:** Denial of service, application instability, potential device instability.

**Affected Realm Cocoa Component:** Realm write operations, local file storage managed by the SDK.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement limits on the amount of data that can be written to the Realm database within a specific timeframe or operation.
* Monitor storage usage and implement alerts if it exceeds predefined thresholds.
* Validate and sanitize data before writing it to Realm to prevent excessively large or malicious data from being stored.
