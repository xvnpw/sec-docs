## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Data via Realm Cocoa (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_data_via_realm_cocoa__critical_node_.md)

This represents the attacker's ultimate goal, which is to successfully breach the application's security and gain access to, manipulate, or disrupt the data stored within the Realm database.

## Attack Tree Path: [Unauthorized Data Access (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/unauthorized_data_access__critical_node_.md)

This category encompasses all methods by which an attacker can gain access to data stored in Realm without having the proper authorization. This is a critical node as it directly violates data confidentiality.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Permissions (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_permissions__critical_node_.md)

This attack vector involves leveraging misconfigured or weak permission settings within Realm (especially relevant for Realm Sync) to gain unauthorized access to data or functionalities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Encryption (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_encryption__critical_node_.md)

This refers to any method used to circumvent Realm's encryption mechanisms, allowing the attacker to access the underlying data in plaintext. Successful bypass of encryption has critical impact on data confidentiality.

## Attack Tree Path: [Obtain Encryption Keys from Insecure Storage (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/obtain_encryption_keys_from_insecure_storage__high-risk_path_.md)

**Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Critical
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low
*   Attackers can exploit developer errors in storing encryption keys insecurely (e.g., hardcoded, easily accessible files). If successful, they gain the ability to decrypt the entire Realm database.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Data Export/Import Functionality](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_data_exportimport_functionality.md)

This category focuses on vulnerabilities within the application's features for exporting and importing Realm data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Exported Data for Later Import (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_exported_data_for_later_import__high-risk_path_.md)

**Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium to High
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   Attackers modify exported data (e.g., JSON, CSV) and then import it back into the Realm database to inject malicious information or gain unauthorized access, exploiting weak validation on import.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Exported Data Stored Insecurely (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/access_exported_data_stored_insecurely__high-risk_path_.md)

**Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium to High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low
*   Attackers gain access to exported Realm data if it is stored in insecure locations (e.g., world-readable files), potentially exposing sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Manipulation (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/data_manipulation__critical_node_.md)

This involves any action where an attacker alters the data stored within the Realm database without proper authorization. This is a critical node as it compromises data integrity.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Write Access Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_write_access_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

This category encompasses methods used to gain unauthorized write access to the Realm database, which is a prerequisite for data manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Permissions (leading to write access) (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_permissions__leading_to_write_access___high-risk_path_.md)

**Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   Similar to the unauthorized access scenario, but specifically focusing on gaining write privileges through misconfigured permissions, enabling data modification.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Data through Input Validation Flaws (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_data_through_input_validation_flaws__high-risk_path_.md)

**Likelihood:** Medium to High
*   **Impact:** Medium to High
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   Attackers exploit the application's failure to properly validate data before writing it to the Realm database, allowing them to inject malicious content that can disrupt application logic or compromise other users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Realm SDK Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_realm_sdk_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

This involves leveraging known or unknown vulnerabilities within the Realm Cocoa SDK itself to compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Utilize Known CVEs in Realm Cocoa (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/utilize_known_cves_in_realm_cocoa__high-risk_path_.md)

**Likelihood:** Low to Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   Attackers exploit publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) in the specific version of Realm Cocoa being used, if the application is not patched against these vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Misuse of Realm Features](./attack_tree_paths/misuse_of_realm_features.md)

This category involves exploiting the intended features of Realm in unintended or malicious ways.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weaknesses in Local-Only Realm Usage (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weaknesses_in_local-only_realm_usage__high-risk_path_.md)

**Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low
*   Attackers with local access to the device can directly access and potentially manipulate the Realm database file if file system permissions are not properly configured, bypassing application-level security.
