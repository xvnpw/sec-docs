* **Threat:** Input Interception
    * **Description:** An attacker could exploit a vulnerability in IQKeyboardManager's event handling to intercept keyboard events before they reach the intended text field. This could involve hooking into the event loop or manipulating internal data structures within IQKeyboardManager.
    * **Impact:** Sensitive data like passwords, credit card details, or personal information could be stolen. Malicious commands could be injected if the input is used in a vulnerable way.
    * **Affected Component:** Input Handling Module
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep IQKeyboardManager updated to the latest version with security patches.
        * Implement end-to-end encryption for sensitive data.
        * Avoid relying solely on client-side input validation. Implement server-side validation as well.
        * Consider using secure input fields provided by the operating system where possible.

* **Threat:** Malicious Library Injection/Compromise
    * **Description:** The IQKeyboardManager library itself could be compromised (e.g., through a supply chain attack targeting the library's distribution) and contain malicious code. This malicious code would then be executed within the application using the library.
    * **Impact:** The entire application could be compromised, leading to data theft, malware installation, or complete control of the application and potentially the user's device.
    * **Affected Component:** Entire Library
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Verify the integrity of the library source and distribution channels.
        * Use reputable package managers and verify package signatures.
        * Implement code signing and integrity checks for the application.
