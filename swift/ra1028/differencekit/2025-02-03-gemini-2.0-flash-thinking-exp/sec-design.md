# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, `differencekit`, is a Swift library focused on providing efficient and correct algorithms for calculating differences between collections and applying those differences as patches.

*   Business Priorities:
    *   Improve developer productivity by providing a reusable and reliable solution for diffing and patching collections in Swift applications.
    *   Enhance the performance and user experience of Swift applications by enabling efficient UI updates based on data changes.
    *   Reduce development costs and time associated with implementing custom diffing logic.

*   Business Goals:
    *   Establish `differencekit` as a widely adopted and trusted library within the Swift development community.
    *   Provide a robust and well-documented API that is easy to integrate into various Swift projects.
    *   Maintain and improve the library based on community feedback and evolving needs of Swift developers.

*   Business Risks:
    *   Risk of bugs or performance issues in the library impacting the stability and performance of applications that depend on it.
    *   Risk of security vulnerabilities in the library that could be exploited by malicious actors through applications using the library.
    *   Risk of lack of adoption if the library is not perceived as reliable, performant, or easy to use compared to alternative solutions.

# SECURITY POSTURE

*   Security Controls:
    *   security control: Open Source Code - The source code is publicly available on GitHub, allowing for community review and scrutiny. Implemented: GitHub repository.
    *   security control: Unit Tests - The repository includes unit tests to verify the correctness of the algorithms. Implemented: `Tests` directory in the GitHub repository.

*   Accepted Risks:
    *   accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability identification and patching.
    *   accepted risk: Potential for undiscovered vulnerabilities in the code due to the complexity of diffing algorithms.

*   Recommended Security Controls:
    *   security control: Static Analysis - Implement static code analysis tools in the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect potential code quality and security issues.
    *   security control: Dependency Scanning - If the project introduces external dependencies, implement dependency scanning to identify and manage known vulnerabilities in those dependencies.
    *   security control: Code Signing for Releases - Sign the released artifacts (e.g., Swift packages) to ensure integrity and authenticity.
    *   security control: Security Audits - Consider periodic security audits by external experts to identify potential vulnerabilities that might be missed by standard development practices.

*   Security Requirements:
    *   Authentication: Not directly applicable to a library. Authentication is the responsibility of the applications that use this library.
    *   Authorization: Not directly applicable to a library. Authorization is the responsibility of the applications that use this library.
    *   Input Validation: The library should perform input validation to ensure that the collections provided for diffing are in the expected format and within reasonable size limits to prevent potential denial-of-service attacks or unexpected behavior. Input validation should be implemented within the library's algorithms.
    *   Cryptography: Cryptography is not a core requirement for this library as it primarily deals with diffing and patching data structures. However, if the library were to be extended to handle sensitive data in the future, cryptographic considerations would become relevant in the applications using it, not necessarily within the library itself.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

*   Critical Business Processes:
    *   For the `differencekit` library itself, the critical process is maintaining the integrity and availability of the library for Swift developers.
    *   For applications using `differencekit`, the critical processes are those that rely on correct and efficient UI updates driven by the library. Incorrect diffing or patching could lead to data corruption or UI inconsistencies, impacting user experience and potentially application functionality.

*   Data Sensitivity:
    *   The `differencekit` library itself does not directly handle sensitive data. It operates on collections provided by the applications using it.
    *   The sensitivity of the data being processed depends entirely on the applications that integrate `differencekit`. If an application uses `differencekit` to update UI elements displaying sensitive user data, then that data is considered sensitive in the context of that application.
    *   The primary data to protect in the context of the library itself is the source code and the integrity of the released packages to prevent supply chain attacks.
