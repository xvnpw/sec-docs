# Threat Model Analysis for ra1028/differencekit

## Threat: [Excessive Computation Leading to Denial of Service](./threats/excessive_computation_leading_to_denial_of_service.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides extremely large or complex collections as input to `differencekit`. The library's diffing algorithms consume excessive CPU resources trying to calculate the difference. This can lead to the application becoming unresponsive or crashing, effectively denying service to legitimate users.

**Impact:** Application slowdown, service unavailability, resource exhaustion on the server.

**Affected Component:** Core diffing algorithms within `differencekit` (specifically functions involved in comparing and processing the collections).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement input validation to limit the size and complexity of collections passed to `differencekit`.
* Set timeouts for `differencekit` operations to prevent indefinite processing.
* Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory) and implement alerts for abnormal spikes.
* Consider using pagination or other techniques to process large datasets in smaller chunks.

## Threat: [Memory Exhaustion Leading to Denial of Service](./threats/memory_exhaustion_leading_to_denial_of_service.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides input collections containing a very large number of items or deeply nested objects. This can cause `differencekit` to allocate excessive memory during the diffing process, potentially leading to out-of-memory errors and application crashes.

**Impact:** Application crash, service unavailability, potential for other processes on the same server to be affected.

**Affected Component:** Internal data structures and memory allocation within `differencekit`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement input validation to limit the size and complexity of collections.
* Set limits on the depth of nested objects within the collections.
* Monitor memory usage and implement alerts for excessive consumption.
* Consider the memory footprint of the data being compared and optimize data structures if necessary.

## Threat: [Incorrect Difference Calculation due to Bugs](./threats/incorrect_difference_calculation_due_to_bugs.md)

**Description:** A bug within `differencekit`'s code causes it to calculate an incorrect difference between two collections. This can lead to the application performing unintended actions based on the flawed difference, potentially corrupting data or displaying incorrect information.

**Impact:** Data inconsistency, incorrect application behavior, potential security vulnerabilities if the difference is used to control access or permissions.

**Affected Component:** Core diffing logic and comparison functions within `differencekit`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep `differencekit` updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes.
* Thoroughly test the application's functionality that relies on `differencekit` with a wide range of data and scenarios.
* Consider implementing sanity checks on the calculated difference before using it to perform critical actions.
