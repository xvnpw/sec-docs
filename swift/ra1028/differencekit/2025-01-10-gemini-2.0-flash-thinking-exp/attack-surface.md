# Attack Surface Analysis for ra1028/differencekit

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Large Input Data](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__through_large_input_data.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides exceptionally large collections as input to the `difference(from:to:)` function, overwhelming the application's resources.
*   **How DifferenceKit Contributes:** The core functionality of the library involves comparing these potentially massive collections, consuming significant CPU and memory during the diffing process.
*   **Example:** A malicious user sends a request to an API endpoint that uses DifferenceKit to calculate changes in a user list, but the request contains millions of user entries.
*   **Impact:** The application becomes unresponsive, crashes, or consumes excessive resources, potentially affecting other users or services.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement size limits on input collections *before* passing them to DifferenceKit.
    *   Use pagination or streaming techniques to process large datasets in chunks, avoiding the need to diff extremely large collections at once.
    *   Implement timeouts for diffing operations to prevent indefinite processing by DifferenceKit.
