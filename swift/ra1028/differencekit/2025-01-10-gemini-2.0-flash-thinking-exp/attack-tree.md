## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via DifferenceKit Exploitation [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_differencekit_exploitation__critical_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Successful exploitation of any of the underlying vulnerabilities can lead to the compromise of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Malicious Input to DifferenceKit [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_malicious_input_to_differencekit__critical_.md)

This represents a broad category of attacks where the attacker provides crafted or manipulated input data to DifferenceKit to trigger unintended behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Large or Complex Datasets](./attack_tree_paths/supply_large_or_complex_datasets.md)

An attacker provides exceptionally large or deeply nested data collections to DifferenceKit.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cause Denial of Service (DoS) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/cause_denial_of_service__dos___critical_.md)

By supplying large or complex datasets, the attacker aims to overload the application's resources (CPU, memory) during the diff calculation process, leading to slowdowns or complete unavailability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Identifiable Properties](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_identifiable_properties.md)

The attacker focuses on exploiting how DifferenceKit identifies items within the collections being compared.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Inconsistent or Predictable Identifiers](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_inconsistent_or_predictable_identifiers.md)

If the application uses predictable or easily guessable identifiers for data items, an attacker can exploit this to forge identifiers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Forge identifiers to trick the diffing algorithm](./attack_tree_paths/forge_identifiers_to_trick_the_diffing_algorithm.md)

By creating items with forged identifiers, the attacker can trick DifferenceKit into incorrectly associating old and new items, potentially leading to data manipulation or incorrect UI updates.

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce Collisions in Identifiers](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_collisions_in_identifiers.md)

The attacker crafts input data where multiple items have the same identifier.

## Attack Tree Path: [Create items with identical identifiers](./attack_tree_paths/create_items_with_identical_identifiers.md)

This can confuse DifferenceKit's diffing algorithm, leading to unexpected merge or update behavior, potentially corrupting data or the UI.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Application Logic Applying Diff Results [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_application_logic_applying_diff_results__critical_.md)

This category focuses on vulnerabilities in how the application interprets and applies the changes calculated by DifferenceKit.

## Attack Tree Path: [Race Conditions During Updates](./attack_tree_paths/race_conditions_during_updates.md)

The attacker attempts to interfere with the UI update process after DifferenceKit has calculated the differences.

## Attack Tree Path: [Interfere with UI updates after diff calculation](./attack_tree_paths/interfere_with_ui_updates_after_diff_calculation.md)

This involves manipulating the application state or UI elements between the diff calculation and the actual application of those changes to the UI.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify data or UI state between diff calculation and application](./attack_tree_paths/modify_data_or_ui_state_between_diff_calculation_and_application.md)

By modifying the data or UI state during this window, the attacker can create inconsistencies, leading to data corruption or an incorrect UI state.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Handling of Diff Operations [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_handling_of_diff_operations__critical_.md)

This highlights vulnerabilities in how the application processes the individual insert, delete, and move operations returned by DifferenceKit.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Insert/Delete/Move Operations [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_insertdeletemove_operations__critical_.md)

The attacker aims to influence the specific insert, delete, and move operations to achieve a malicious outcome.

## Attack Tree Path: [Reorder elements to mislead the user [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/reorder_elements_to_mislead_the_user__critical_.md)

By manipulating the move operations, the attacker can reorder UI elements in a way that misleads the user, potentially for phishing-like attacks within the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Lack of Validation on Diff Results [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/lack_of_validation_on_diff_results__critical_.md)

This represents a critical security flaw where the application blindly trusts and applies all changes suggested by DifferenceKit without proper validation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application blindly applies all changes [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/application_blindly_applies_all_changes__critical_.md)

The application's logic directly applies the diff results without any checks or sanitization.

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce malicious data through "update" operations [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_malicious_data_through_update_operations__critical_.md)

By manipulating the input data, the attacker can trigger "update" operations that introduce malicious or unexpected data into the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify sensitive data displayed in the UI [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/modify_sensitive_data_displayed_in_the_ui__critical_.md)

Through the lack of validation, an attacker can manipulate the diff results to alter sensitive information displayed to the user.
