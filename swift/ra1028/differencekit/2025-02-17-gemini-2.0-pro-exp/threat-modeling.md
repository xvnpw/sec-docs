# Threat Model Analysis for ra1028/differencekit

## Threat: [Incorrect `differenceIdentifier` Implementation](./threats/incorrect__differenceidentifier__implementation.md)

*   **Threat:** Incorrect `differenceIdentifier` Implementation

    *   **Description:** An attacker provides data where the `differenceIdentifier` is either not unique or is easily manipulated.  For example, if the `differenceIdentifier` is based on a user-supplied string without proper validation, the attacker could provide two different data items with the same identifier.  `DifferenceKit` would then treat these as the same item, potentially skipping updates or applying updates to the wrong item.
    *   **Impact:** Data inconsistency in the UI.  The UI might not reflect the true state of the underlying data, potentially leading to incorrect user actions or display of outdated/incorrect information.  This could lead to data corruption if the UI is used to modify the underlying data based on the incorrect display.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Differentiable` protocol, specifically the `differenceIdentifier` property.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use a system-generated, universally unique identifier (UUID) for `differenceIdentifier` whenever possible.
        *   If a user-provided value *must* be used, thoroughly validate and sanitize it to ensure uniqueness and prevent manipulation.  Consider hashing the user-provided value to create a more robust identifier.
        *   Implement robust unit tests that specifically test the `differenceIdentifier` implementation with various inputs, including edge cases and potential collisions.

## Threat: [Incorrect `isContentEqual(to:)` Implementation](./threats/incorrect__iscontentequal_to___implementation.md)

*   **Threat:** Incorrect `isContentEqual(to:)` Implementation

    *   **Description:** An attacker provides data where the content has changed, but the `isContentEqual(to:)` method incorrectly returns `true`.  This could happen if the comparison is shallow (only checks references) or omits certain fields.  `DifferenceKit` would then believe the items are identical and skip the necessary UI update.  Conversely, if `isContentEqual(to:)` incorrectly returns `false`, unnecessary UI updates will occur.
    *   **Impact:**  Similar to the incorrect `differenceIdentifier` threat: data inconsistency in the UI, potential data corruption, and unnecessary UI updates (performance impact).  The attacker might be able to hide malicious changes from the user.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Differentiable` protocol, specifically the `isContentEqual(to:)` method.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure `isContentEqual(to:)` performs a *deep* comparison of all relevant data fields.  Do not rely on reference equality alone.
        *   If the data structure is complex, consider using a dedicated equality-checking library or code generation to ensure correctness.
        *   Thoroughly unit test the `isContentEqual(to:)` implementation with a wide variety of inputs, including cases where only specific fields have changed.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Crafted Input (Staged Changeset)](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_crafted_input__staged_changeset_.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) via Crafted Input (Staged Changeset)

    *   **Description:** An attacker provides a very large or specifically crafted sequence of data changes designed to maximize the computational complexity of `DifferenceKit`'s diffing algorithm, specifically when using `StagedChangeset`.  This could involve a large number of insertions, deletions, moves, and updates in a pattern that triggers worst-case performance.
    *   **Impact:** Application freeze or crash due to excessive CPU usage.  The UI becomes unresponsive, preventing legitimate users from interacting with the application.
    *   **Affected Component:** `StagedChangeset` and the underlying diffing algorithms (e.g., `Heckel`, `Myers`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Limit the size of the collections being diffed.  Implement input validation to reject excessively large or complex data sets.
        *   Perform diffing operations on a background thread to avoid blocking the main UI thread.
        *   Implement timeouts for diffing operations.  If a diff takes too long, abort the operation and potentially display an error message to the user.
        *   Monitor the performance of `DifferenceKit` operations in production to detect potential DoS attacks.  Use profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks.
        *   Consider using a simpler diffing algorithm (if appropriate for the use case) that might be less susceptible to worst-case performance scenarios.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Crafted Input (Changeset)](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_crafted_input__changeset_.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) via Crafted Input (Changeset)

    *   **Description:** Similar to the `StagedChangeset` DoS, but targeting the `Changeset` type. An attacker provides crafted input to cause excessive computation during the diffing process.
    *   **Impact:** Application freeze or crash, UI unresponsiveness.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Changeset` and the underlying diffing algorithms.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Same as for `StagedChangeset` DoS.
