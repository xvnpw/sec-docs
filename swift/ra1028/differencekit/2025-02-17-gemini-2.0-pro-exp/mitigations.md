## Mitigation Strategy: [Thorough Unit Testing of `Differentiable` and `Equatable`](./mitigation_strategies/thorough_unit_testing_of__differentiable__and__equatable_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Data Models:** Identify all data models that implement the `Differentiable` and `Equatable` protocols *for use with DifferenceKit*.
    2.  **Create Test Targets:** Ensure your Xcode project has a dedicated unit testing target.
    3.  **Write Test Cases:** For each data model:
        *   Create a new test class (subclass of `XCTestCase`).
        *   Write individual test methods (`test...`) for each aspect of `differenceIdentifier` and equality.
        *   **Equality Tests:**
            *   Test cases where objects *should* be equal (same `differenceIdentifier` and other relevant properties).
            *   Test cases where objects *should not* be equal (different `differenceIdentifier` or other relevant properties).
            *   Test edge cases: empty strings, nil values, zero values, maximum/minimum values, special characters, etc.
            *   Test boundary conditions: values just above/below thresholds, etc.
        *   **`differenceIdentifier` Tests:**
            *   Verify that objects intended to be treated as the "same" item across updates have the *same* `differenceIdentifier`.
            *   Verify that objects intended to be treated as *different* items have *different* `differenceIdentifiers`.
            *   Test cases with slight variations in data to ensure the `differenceIdentifier` behaves as expected.  This is *crucial* for `DifferenceKit`.
    4.  **Use Assertions:** Within each test method, use `XCTAssertEqual`, `XCTAssertNotEqual`, `XCTAssertTrue`, `XCTAssertFalse`, etc., to verify the expected behavior.
    5.  **Run Tests Regularly:** Integrate these tests into your continuous integration (CI) pipeline to run them automatically on every code change.
    6.  **Code Coverage:** Aim for high code coverage (ideally 100%) for your `Differentiable` and `Equatable` implementations. Use Xcode's code coverage tools to identify any untested code paths.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Incorrect Diffing Logic Leading to Data Corruption (Severity: High):** Flawed `Equatable` or `Differentiable` implementations are the *direct* cause of incorrect diffs, leading to data loss, UI inconsistencies, or crashes. This is the core threat.
    *   **Unexpected Behavior with Custom `Algorithm` Implementations (Severity: High):** If custom algorithms rely on incorrect `Differentiable` implementations, the same data corruption risks apply.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Incorrect Diffing Logic:** Reduces risk significantly (80-90%). Thorough testing catches most logic errors before they reach production. This is the primary defense.
    *   **Unexpected Behavior with Custom Algorithms:** Reduces risk significantly (80-90%), *if* the custom algorithm relies on the tested `Differentiable` implementations.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Example:** Partially implemented. Unit tests exist for `Product` and `Category` models, but code coverage is only at 60%. Tests are run as part of the CI pipeline. Located in `ProjectNameTests/DataModelTests`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Example:** Missing comprehensive tests for the `Order` model, especially around edge cases with optional properties. Code coverage needs to be improved for `Product` and `Category` models to reach at least 90%.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Property-Based Testing (of `Differentiable` and `Equatable`)](./mitigation_strategies/property-based_testing__of__differentiable__and__equatable__.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Install SwiftCheck:** Add `SwiftCheck` (or a similar property-based testing library) as a dependency.
    2.  **Define Arbitrary Instances:** For each data model implementing `Differentiable`, create an `Arbitrary` instance. This tells `SwiftCheck` how to generate *random* instances of your data model, covering a wide range of possible values.
    3.  **Write Properties:** Define properties that should hold true for *all* valid instances, focusing *specifically* on the `Differentiable` and `Equatable` implementations. Examples (these are *crucial* for `DifferenceKit` correctness):
        *   `property("Two objects with the same differenceIdentifier are equal") <- ...`
        *   `property("Two objects with different differenceIdentifiers are not equal") <- ...`
        *   `property("Reflexivity: An object is equal to itself") <- ...`
        *   `property("Symmetry: If a == b, then b == a") <- ...`
        *   `property("Transitivity: If a == b and b == c, then a == c") <- ...` (Careful implementation needed).
    4.  **Run Tests:** `SwiftCheck` will generate hundreds of random inputs and check your properties.
    5.  **Investigate Failures:** `SwiftCheck` provides minimal failing examples to help debug.
    6.  **Integrate with CI:** Include these tests in your CI pipeline.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Incorrect Diffing Logic Leading to Data Corruption (Severity: High):** Catches subtle logic errors in `Differentiable` and `Equatable` that manual unit tests might miss.
    *   **Unexpected Behavior with Custom `Algorithm` Implementations (Severity: High):** Similar to unit testing.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Incorrect Diffing Logic:** Further reduces risk (adds 5-10% on top of unit testing), especially for complex data.
    *   **Unexpected Behavior with Custom Algorithms:** Similar impact.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Example:** Not implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Example:** Property-based testing is not currently used. Implement for all data models, starting with the most critical (`Order`, `Product`).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Optimize `Differentiable` Implementation (Performance)](./mitigation_strategies/optimize__differentiable__implementation__performance_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Profile:** Use Instruments (Time Profiler) to identify performance bottlenecks *specifically within your `Differentiable` and `Equatable` implementations*. This is key â€“ we're focusing on the code that `DifferenceKit` calls.
    2.  **Analyze Code:** Examine the code within `differenceIdentifier` and the equality check (`==`). Look for:
        *   Expensive operations.
        *   Unnecessary computations.
        *   Large allocations.
    3.  **Optimize:**
        *   Use efficient data structures/algorithms.
        *   Cache intermediate results (memoization).
        *   Avoid unnecessary object creation.
        *   Efficient string comparisons (if applicable).
        *   `lazy` evaluation or filtering for large collections (if applicable).
    4.  **Re-Profile:** Verify optimizations.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Performance Issues with Large or Complex Data Sets (Severity: Medium):** Improves performance, reducing UI freezes *caused by slow `DifferenceKit` calculations*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Performance Issues:** Impact varies (10-50%+ reduction in diffing time).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Example:** Not systematically implemented. Some ad-hoc optimizations exist, but no formal process.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Example:** Thorough profiling and optimization pass for all `Differentiable` implementations, starting with bottlenecks.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Consider using `Heckel` algorithm](./mitigation_strategies/consider_using__heckel__algorithm.md)

* **Description:**
    1. **Identify current algorithm:** Check which algorithm is currently used for diffing.
    2. **Experiment with `Heckel`:** If the default algorithm is slow, change algorithm to `Heckel`.
    3. **Profile:** Use Instruments (Time Profiler) to check if performance is improved.
    4. **Test:** Run unit and property-based tests to ensure that change of algorithm didn't introduce any regressions.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Performance Issues with Large or Complex Data Sets (Severity: Medium):** Improves performance, reducing UI freezes *caused by slow `DifferenceKit` calculations*.

* **Impact:**
    *   **Performance Issues:** Impact varies. Can significantly improve performance for certain types of data changes.

* **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Example:** Not implemented.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Example:** Should be implemented if performance is critical and default algorithm is slow.
