## Attack Tree Path: [Incorrect Difference Calculation (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/incorrect_difference_calculation__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the root of the most critical vulnerabilities. If the core differencing process produces incorrect results, the entire application state based on those differences is unreliable. This is a fundamental failure point.
    *   **Why Critical:** `DifferenceKit`'s *primary function* is to calculate differences. If this is flawed, the entire library is compromised.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Extensive code review of the core algorithm.
        *   Comprehensive unit testing, including edge cases and boundary conditions.
        *   Fuzz testing (see below).
        *   Performance testing and resource limits (to prevent DoS).
        *   Consider formal verification techniques (if feasible).

## Attack Tree Path: [Input Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/input_manipulation.md)

This is the parent node for several high-risk attack vectors. The attacker tries to provide crafted input to cause incorrect diff calculations.

## Attack Tree Path: [DoS (HIGH RISK)](./attack_tree_paths/dos__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker crafts input data designed to cause excessive resource consumption (CPU, memory) during the differencing process, leading to a denial of service.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium (Application downtime)
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
            *   Implement performance benchmarks.
            *   Set resource limits (e.g., maximum memory usage, maximum execution time).
            *   Test with large and complex datasets to identify performance bottlenecks.
            *   Consider adding timeouts to differencing operations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Fuzzing (HIGH RISK)](./attack_tree_paths/fuzzing__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker uses automated tools to generate a large number of random or mutated inputs to `DifferenceKit`, attempting to trigger crashes, unexpected behavior, or incorrect diff calculations.
        *   **Likelihood:** High
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice/Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
            *   Integrate fuzz testing into the CI/CD pipeline.
            *   Use a fuzzer that understands the structure of the data `DifferenceKit` expects.
            *   Monitor for crashes and unexpected behavior during fuzzing.

## Attack Tree Path: [Edge Cases (HIGH RISK)](./attack_tree_paths/edge_cases__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker crafts specific inputs that target known or suspected edge cases and boundary conditions in the differencing algorithm or data handling. This requires more knowledge than fuzzing but can be more targeted.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
            *   Create a comprehensive suite of unit tests that specifically target:
                *   Empty arrays.
                *   Arrays with duplicate elements.
                *   Very large arrays.
                *   Arrays with elements at the boundaries of their allowed values.
                *   Arrays with specific ordering patterns.
                *   Other data structure-specific edge cases.

## Attack Tree Path: [Type Confusion](./attack_tree_paths/type_confusion.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Equatable/Hashable Conformance Issues (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/equatablehashable_conformance_issues__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** `DifferenceKit` relies on the `Equatable` and `Hashable` protocols for comparing elements. If user-provided types have incorrect or inconsistent implementations of these protocols, it can lead to incorrect diff calculations. This is a critical dependency.
        *   **Why Critical:** The correctness of the differencing algorithm *depends* on the correctness of these implementations. It's a foundational assumption.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
            *   Provide *very clear* documentation on the requirements for `Equatable` and `Hashable` conformance. Include examples and common pitfalls.
            *   Encourage users to use automatic synthesis of `Equatable` and `Hashable` whenever possible (Swift provides this for many types).
            *   Consider adding runtime checks (if performance allows) to detect inconsistencies. For example, in a debug build, you could check that `a == b` implies `a.hashValue == b.hashValue`.
            *   Provide helper functions or guidance for testing `Equatable` and `Hashable` implementations.
