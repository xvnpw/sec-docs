# Threat Model Analysis for ra1028/differencekit

## Threat: [Algorithmic Complexity Exploitation leading to Denial of Service (DoS)](./threats/algorithmic_complexity_exploitation_leading_to_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker crafts specific input data (collections) that exploits vulnerabilities in `differencekit`'s diffing algorithm's time complexity. By providing carefully designed input, the attacker can force `differencekit` to perform extremely slow computations, leading to excessive CPU usage and memory consumption. This can effectively freeze or crash the application on the client device. The vulnerability lies in the potential for predictable worst-case performance scenarios within the core diffing algorithm of `differencekit`.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Client-side Denial of Service (DoS), rendering the application unresponsive and unusable.
    *   Significant performance degradation, making the application extremely slow and frustrating for users.
    *   Battery depletion on mobile devices due to prolonged high CPU usage caused by `differencekit`'s inefficient processing.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   `differencekit`'s core diffing algorithms, specifically functions responsible for calculating `Changeset` from `Differentiable` collections.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Sanitization and Complexity Limits (within Application):** While the vulnerability is in `differencekit`'s algorithm, applications using it should still implement input size limits and basic sanitization to reduce the attack surface.
    *   **Library Updates:** Monitor `differencekit` releases for performance improvements and algorithm optimizations that might address such complexity issues. Update the library to the latest version regularly.
    *   **Performance Testing with Malicious Input Patterns:**  During development, perform rigorous performance testing with various input data patterns, including those designed to potentially trigger worst-case algorithmic complexity in diffing algorithms. Identify and mitigate performance bottlenecks.
    *   **Consider Alternative Diffing Strategies (If Feasible):** If algorithmic DoS becomes a significant and unmitigable risk, explore alternative diffing libraries or strategies that might offer better performance guarantees or resilience to malicious input.

## Threat: [Logic Errors in Diff Calculation or Application leading to Critical Data Integrity Failures](./threats/logic_errors_in_diff_calculation_or_application_leading_to_critical_data_integrity_failures.md)

*   **Description:**  Bugs or flaws within `differencekit`'s core logic for calculating or applying diffs (changesets) could lead to critical logic errors. These errors could result in the generation of incorrect diffs or the improper application of diffs to collections. This can lead to severe data corruption within the application's data model, potentially causing application-wide failures, security bypasses, or incorrect data persistence. The vulnerability resides in the correctness and robustness of `differencekit`'s internal diffing and patching logic.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Critical data corruption within the application's data structures, leading to loss of data integrity and potentially application malfunction.
    *   Security bypasses if data corruption affects authorization checks, access control mechanisms, or other security-critical application logic.
    *   Application instability and unpredictable behavior due to inconsistent or invalid data states caused by incorrect diff application.
    *   Potential for persistent data corruption if incorrect diffs are applied to persistent storage.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   `differencekit`'s core diffing logic and changeset application functions.
    *   Specifically, functions responsible for generating `Changeset` and applying it to collections.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Thorough Unit and Integration Testing of `differencekit`:**  The `differencekit` library itself should have extensive unit and integration tests to ensure the correctness of its diffing and patching logic across a wide range of scenarios and data types. Report any discovered bugs to the library maintainers.
    *   **Application-Level Data Validation Post-Diff:** After applying diffs calculated by `differencekit`, implement robust data validation within the application to detect and handle any data inconsistencies or corruption that might have been introduced by `differencekit` logic errors.
    *   **Library Updates and Bug Fix Monitoring:**  Stay informed about bug reports and fixes for `differencekit`. Regularly update to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and improvements that address potential logic errors.
    *   **Code Reviews of `differencekit` Integration (and potentially library code if feasible):**  Conduct careful code reviews of the application's integration with `differencekit`. If possible and necessary, consider reviewing parts of the `differencekit` library's code itself to understand its logic and identify potential areas of concern.
