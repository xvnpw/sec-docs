## Attack Tree Path: [[G] Execute Arbitrary Code on Developer Machines/CI/CD [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/_g__execute_arbitrary_code_on_developer_machinescicd__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker's ultimate objective is to run their own code on the machines of developers using Tuist or on the CI/CD pipelines that build projects using Tuist. This could lead to stealing credentials, modifying code, injecting malware, or compromising the entire software supply chain.
*   **Likelihood:** High (as a consequence of successful lower-level attacks).
*   **Impact:** High (complete system compromise, data breaches, supply chain attacks).
*   **Effort:** Varies depending on the specific attack path.
*   **Skill Level:** Varies depending on the specific attack path.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Varies, but generally high once code execution is achieved.

## Attack Tree Path: [[A] Compromise Tuist Installation/Update Process [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/_a__compromise_tuist_installationupdate_process__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** This attack vector focuses on manipulating the process by which developers obtain and install Tuist.  If successful, the attacker doesn't need to exploit vulnerabilities in Tuist itself; they control the version being installed.
*   **Likelihood:** High (due to multiple potential attack surfaces).
*   **Impact:** High (attacker controls the entire Tuist installation).
*   **Effort:** Varies depending on the sub-node.
*   **Skill Level:** Varies depending on the sub-node.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** High (if the attacker is careful).

## Attack Tree Path: [[A1] Malicious Tuist Binary (e.g., on GitHub Releases, Homebrew Tap) [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/_a1__malicious_tuist_binary__e_g___on_github_releases__homebrew_tap___hr_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker replaces the legitimate Tuist binary with a modified version containing malicious code. This could be done by compromising the official release channels (GitHub, Homebrew) or by creating a convincing fake repository/tap.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High. Compromising official channels is difficult but possible. Creating fake repositories is easier.
*   **Impact:** High (complete control over the Tuist installation).
*   **Effort:** Medium to High (depending on the target).
*   **Skill Level:** High (requires advanced knowledge of software distribution and potentially compromising secure systems).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** High (especially if code signing keys are compromised).

## Attack Tree Path: [[A3] Compromise Tuist's Hosting Infrastructure [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/_a3__compromise_tuist's_hosting_infrastructure__cn_.md)

*   **Description:** This involves gaining unauthorized access to the servers or services where Tuist's source code, binaries, or build artifacts are stored. This is a critical node because it enables several other high-impact attacks.
*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (major platforms have strong security, but are still targets).
*   **Impact:** High (attacker can control the source of truth for Tuist).
*   **Effort:** High (requires significant resources and expertise).
*   **Skill Level:** High to Very High (requires advanced hacking skills).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High (intrusion detection systems exist, but can be evaded).

## Attack Tree Path: [[A3a] Compromise GitHub Account of Tuist Maintainer [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/_a3a__compromise_github_account_of_tuist_maintainer__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker gains control of a Tuist maintainer's GitHub account, allowing them to modify the repository, create malicious releases, or tamper with the build process.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (phishing and password reuse are common threats).
*   **Impact:** High (full control over the Tuist repository).
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium (phishing can be easy; password cracking is harder).
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium (depending on the attack method).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (GitHub provides audit logs, but attackers can try to cover their tracks).

## Attack Tree Path: [[B1] Logic Flaws in Project Generation/Caching Mechanisms [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/_b1__logic_flaws_in_project_generationcaching_mechanisms__cn_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities within the core logic of Tuist, particularly in how it processes project configurations (Project.swift) and manages its cache. This is a critical node due to the complexity of these operations.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium.
*   **Impact:** High (potential for arbitrary code execution).
*   **Effort:** Medium to High (requires in-depth code analysis).
*   **Skill Level:** Medium to High (requires software development and security expertise).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (code reviews and fuzzing can help).

## Attack Tree Path: [[B1a] Unsafe Template Expansion [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/_b1a__unsafe_template_expansion__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** If Tuist uses templates to generate project files and incorporates user-provided data into these templates without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious code that gets executed when the template is processed.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (common vulnerability in template engines).
*   **Impact:** High (direct code execution).
*   **Effort:** Medium (crafting a malicious Project.swift).
*   **Skill Level:** Medium (understanding of template injection).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (code review and security testing).

## Attack Tree Path: [[B1b] Incorrect Dependency Resolution (leading to use of malicious dependency) [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/_b1b__incorrect_dependency_resolution__leading_to_use_of_malicious_dependency___hr_.md)

*  **Description:**  Tuist's dependency resolution logic is flawed, causing it to download and use a malicious dependency instead of the intended one. This could be due to typosquatting, dependency confusion, or other supply chain attacks.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium.
*   **Impact:** High (execution of malicious code from the compromised dependency).
*   **Effort:** Medium to High (understanding Tuist's dependency resolution and potentially setting up a malicious package).
*   **Skill Level:** Medium to High (knowledge of package management and dependency resolution).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (monitoring of dependencies and their origins).

## Attack Tree Path: [[B1c] Template Injection Vulnerability [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/_b1c__template_injection_vulnerability__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** Similar to B1a, but specifically focusing on any templating engine used by Tuist. If user input is not properly sanitized before being used in a template, an attacker can inject code.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium.
*   **Impact:** High (direct code execution).
*   **Effort:** Medium (crafting malicious input).
*   **Skill Level:** Medium to High (understanding of template injection and the specific engine).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (code review, static analysis, fuzzing).
