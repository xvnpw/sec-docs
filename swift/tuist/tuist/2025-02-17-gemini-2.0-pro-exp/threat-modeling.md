# Threat Model Analysis for tuist/tuist

## Threat: [Malicious `Project.swift` Injection](./threats/malicious__project_swift__injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious `Project.swift` Injection

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the project repository and modifies the `Project.swift` file. They could add malicious build settings, include compromised frameworks, alter target configurations to point to malicious servers, or change build phases to execute arbitrary code during project generation or build. This is a *direct* threat to Tuist because `Project.swift` is the core configuration file that Tuist processes.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Compromised application binary: The generated Xcode project builds a malicious application.
        *   Code execution on developer machines: Malicious build scripts could execute arbitrary code when developers run `tuist generate` or build.
        *   Compromised CI/CD pipeline.
    *   **Affected Tuist Component:** `Project.swift` (and related manifest files), Project Generation logic (`tuist generate` command and underlying functions).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Code Review:** Mandatory, thorough code reviews for *all* changes to `Project.swift`.
        *   **Protected Branches:** Use protected branches in the source control system.
        *   **Commit Signing:** Enforce commit signing.
        *   **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools to scan `Project.swift` files.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Developers should not have write access to the main repository.

## Threat: [Spoofed Tuist Binary](./threats/spoofed_tuist_binary.md)

*   **Threat:** Spoofed Tuist Binary

    *   **Description:** An attacker replaces the legitimate Tuist binary on a developer's machine or in a CI/CD environment. The attacker's binary could then generate compromised projects, steal credentials, or perform other malicious actions. This is a *direct* threat because it targets the Tuist executable itself.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Complete system compromise: The attacker could gain full control.
        *   Compromised application binaries: All projects generated using the spoofed binary would be compromised.
        *   Data theft.
    *   **Affected Tuist Component:** The Tuist executable itself.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Checksum Verification:** Always verify the SHA-256 checksum of the downloaded Tuist binary.
        *   **Official Installation Channels:** Install Tuist *only* through official channels.
        *   **Code Signing (Future):** If Tuist adopts code signing, verify the signature.
        *   **CI/CD Security:** Use trusted base images and verify the binary's integrity within the CI/CD pipeline.

## Threat: [Tampered Cached Build Artifacts](./threats/tampered_cached_build_artifacts.md)

*   **Threat:** Tampered Cached Build Artifacts

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the Tuist cache directory (local or remote) and modifies or replaces cached build artifacts with malicious versions. When Tuist reuses these, the compromised code is incorporated. This is a *direct* threat because it targets Tuist's caching mechanism.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Compromised application binary: Contains malicious code injected through the tampered cache.
        *   Difficult to detect: The source code itself remains unchanged.
    *   **Affected Tuist Component:** Tuist's caching mechanism (`tuist cache warm`, `tuist cache print-hashes`, and the underlying logic). The cache directory itself.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Cache Location:** Use a secure, access-controlled location. Restrict write access.
        *   **Remote Cache Security:** Use strong authentication, encryption in transit/rest, and ACLs.
        *   **Cache Validation (Custom):** Implement a custom script to verify checksums *before* use.
        *   **Regular Cache Clearing:** Regularly clear the cache, especially in CI/CD.
        *   **Ephemeral CI/CD Runners:** Use runners that are destroyed after each build.

## Threat: [Malicious Tuist Plugin](./threats/malicious_tuist_plugin.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Tuist Plugin

    *   **Description:** An attacker creates or modifies a Tuist plugin to perform malicious actions (injecting code, stealing credentials, exfiltrating data). This is a *direct* threat because it targets Tuist's plugin system.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Compromised application binaries.
        *   Code execution on developer machines.
        *   Data theft.
        *   Compromised CI/CD pipeline.
    *   **Affected Tuist Component:** Tuist's plugin system (`tuist edit`, plugin loading, and the API exposed to plugins).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Plugin Source Control:** Store plugins in a trusted, version-controlled repository.
        *   **Plugin Code Review:** Thoroughly review the code of *all* Tuist plugins.
        *   **Plugin Sandboxing (Future):** Ideally, Tuist would implement sandboxing.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Run Tuist with the minimum necessary privileges.
        *   **Plugin Verification:** Verify integrity before loading (checksums/code signing).

## Threat: [Secrets Exposure in `Project.swift`](./threats/secrets_exposure_in__project_swift_.md)

*   **Threat:** Secrets Exposure in `Project.swift`
    *   **Description:** Developers include sensitive information (API keys, passwords) directly within the `Project.swift` file. This information is then committed to the source code repository. This is a direct threat, as Project.swift is a tuist component.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Compromised accounts and services.
        *   Data breaches.
        *   Reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Tuist Component:** `Project.swift` (and related manifest files).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables to store secrets.
        *   **Secrets Management System:** Use a dedicated secrets management system.
        *   **Pre-Commit Hooks:** Use pre-commit hooks to scan for potential secrets.
        *   **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools to scan `Project.swift` files.
        *   **Developer Education:** Train developers on secure coding practices.
