# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for tuist/tuist

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Code Review and Access Control for Tuist Configuration Files](./mitigation_strategies/strict_code_review_and_access_control_for_tuist_configuration_files.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish a Code Review Process:** Implement mandatory code reviews for *all* changes to files like `Project.swift`, `Workspace.swift`, `Config.swift`, and any other files that define the Tuist project structure and build process.  Require at least one (preferably two) independent reviewers familiar with Tuist and security.
    2.  **Define Review Guidelines:** Create specific guidelines for reviewers, focusing on:
        *   Unexpected changes to dependencies (additions, removals, version changes).
        *   Injection of malicious build steps or scripts within the Tuist configuration.
        *   Hardcoded secrets or credentials within the Tuist files.
        *   Unnecessary network access initiated by the Tuist configuration.
        *   Changes to code signing configurations managed by Tuist.
    3.  **Enforce Branch Protection:** Use branch protection rules (GitHub, GitLab, etc.) to prevent direct commits to the main/production branch for these configuration files. Require pull requests and approvals.
    4.  **Restrict Write Access:** Limit write access to these files to a small, trusted group of developers who need to modify the project structure. Use the principle of least privilege.
    5.  **Regular Access Audits:** Periodically (e.g., quarterly) review who has write access and remove unnecessary access.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious `Project.swift` Modification (Severity: Critical):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious code into the build process *via Tuist configuration*, leading to compromised builds, data exfiltration, or supply chain attacks.
    *   **Unauthorized Dependency Changes (within Tuist) (Severity: High):** Prevents attackers from adding malicious dependencies or altering existing ones *through Tuist's dependency management*, introducing vulnerabilities.
    *   **Accidental Misconfiguration (of Tuist) (Severity: Medium):** Reduces unintentional errors in the Tuist configuration that could weaken security or disrupt builds.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious `Project.swift` Modification:** Risk reduction: High. Primary defense.
    *   **Unauthorized Dependency Changes (within Tuist):** Risk reduction: High.
    *   **Accidental Misconfiguration (of Tuist):** Risk reduction: Medium.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Mandatory code reviews for files in the `Tuist/` directory.
    *   Branch protection on `main` and `develop` for `Project.swift` and `Workspace.swift`.
    *   Write access restricted to the "Build Team" group.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal review guidelines specifically for Tuist configuration files are missing.
    *   Regular access audits are not automated; they are manual and ad-hoc.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Careful Plugin Selection and Vetting (Tuist Plugins)](./mitigation_strategies/careful_plugin_selection_and_vetting__tuist_plugins_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Source Restriction:** Only install Tuist plugins from:
        *   The official Tuist organization on GitHub.
        *   Well-known, reputable developers in the Tuist community with a proven track record.
    2.  **Code Review:** Before integrating *any* third-party Tuist plugin, thoroughly review its source code. Look for:
        *   Suspicious code (obfuscation, dynamic code execution).
        *   Unnecessary network/file access.
        *   Hardcoded credentials.
        *   Code that doesn't align with the plugin's purpose.
    3.  **Version Pinning:** Pin the Tuist plugin to a specific version in your `Dependencies.swift` or `Package.swift`.  Do *not* use version ranges. Use `.exact("1.2.3")`.
    4.  **Regular Audits:** Periodically review installed Tuist plugins. Remove unneeded or unmaintained ones. Check for updates, but *always* review changes before updating.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Compromised Tuist Plugin (Severity: Critical):** Prevents installing malicious Tuist plugins that could compromise the build process, leading to code execution, data theft, or supply chain attacks.
    *   **Vulnerable Tuist Plugin (Severity: High):** Reduces the risk of using Tuist plugins with vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Compromised Tuist Plugin:** Risk reduction: High. Primary defense.
    *   **Vulnerable Tuist Plugin:** Risk reduction: Medium to High.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   We only use plugins from the official Tuist organization.
    *   We pin plugin versions using `.exact()`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No formal process for reviewing plugin source code *before* updates.
    *   No regular schedule for auditing installed Tuist plugins.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Explicit Dependency Pinning (Tuist and Project Dependencies *Managed by Tuist*)](./mitigation_strategies/explicit_dependency_pinning__tuist_and_project_dependencies_managed_by_tuist_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Tuist Version:** Pin the version of Tuist itself (e.g., in `.tuist-version` or via your installation method). Use an exact version number (e.g., `3.28.0`).
    2.  **Project Dependencies (Managed *by Tuist*):** In `Project.swift` and `Dependencies.swift`, pin *all* project dependencies managed by Tuist to specific versions. Avoid version ranges. Use exact versions whenever possible (e.g., `.exact("1.2.3")`).
    3.  **Regular Updates (with Review):** Regularly review and update these pinned versions. This involves:
        *   Checking for security updates and new releases.
        *   Reviewing changelogs for security-related changes.
        *   Testing updated dependencies in a non-production environment.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Dependency Confusion (targeting Tuist or its managed dependencies) (Severity: High):** Prevents injecting malicious packages with the same name as legitimate dependencies by ensuring you use the expected version.
    *   **Vulnerable Dependency (managed by Tuist) (Severity: High):** Reduces the risk of using a dependency with a known vulnerability.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Dependency Confusion:** Risk reduction: High. Primary defense.
    *   **Vulnerable Dependency:** Risk reduction: Medium.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   We pin the Tuist version in `.tuist-version`.
    *   We pin project dependencies in `Dependencies.swift` using `.exact()`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No formal, documented process for regularly reviewing and updating pinned dependency versions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Monitor for Security Advisories and Apply Updates (for Tuist)](./mitigation_strategies/monitor_for_security_advisories_and_apply_updates__for_tuist_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Subscribe to Notifications:** Subscribe to:
        *   The official Tuist GitHub repository (releases and issues).
        *   The Tuist Slack community.
        *   Tuist-related security mailing lists/forums.
    2.  **Establish a Monitoring Process:** Designate someone to regularly check these channels for Tuist security advisories.
    3.  **Prompt Update Procedure:** When a Tuist security update is released:
        *   Assess the severity and impact.
        *   Test the update in a non-production environment.
        *   Apply the update to production ASAP after successful testing.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Tuist (Severity: Variable, potentially High):** Reduces the window for attackers to exploit known Tuist vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduction: Medium to High.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Subscribed to the Tuist GitHub repository.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No designated person for monitoring security advisories.
    *   No documented procedure for promptly applying Tuist security updates.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Use of `Dependencies.swift` (and other Tuist features)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_use_of__dependencies_swift___and_other_tuist_features_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **HTTPS for External Resources:** When fetching external resources using `Dependencies.swift`, *always* use HTTPS URLs. Never HTTP.
    2.  **Checksum Validation (If Available):** If an external resource provides a checksum (e.g., SHA256), use it to verify integrity. Tuist may provide mechanisms, or you may need custom scripts *within your Tuist configuration*.
    3.  **Review Custom Scripts (within Tuist configuration):** Review any custom build scripts *defined within your Tuist configuration* (e.g., in `Project.swift`) for vulnerabilities:
        *   **Command Injection:** Avoid constructing shell commands with unsanitized input *within the Tuist context*.
        *   **Insecure File Handling:** Use secure temporary directories; avoid hardcoding file paths *within Tuist scripts*.
        *   **Exposure of Secrets:** Never hardcode secrets in Tuist scripts. Use environment variables or a secrets management system, *making sure Tuist accesses them securely*.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (during Tuist dependency fetching) (Severity: High):** HTTPS prevents interception/modification of resources fetched by Tuist.
    *   **Tampering with External Resources (fetched by Tuist) (Severity: High):** Checksum validation ensures integrity.
    *   **Command Injection (in Tuist custom scripts) (Severity: Critical):** Prevents injecting malicious commands *through Tuist*.
    *   **Insecure File Handling (in Tuist custom scripts) (Severity: Medium):** Reduces file-related vulnerabilities *within Tuist*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Risk reduction: High.
    *   **Tampering with External Resources:** Risk reduction: High.
    *   **Command Injection:** Risk reduction: High.
    *   **Insecure File Handling:** Risk reduction: Medium.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   We use HTTPS for all external resources in `Dependencies.swift`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No checksum validation for all downloaded resources within `Dependencies.swift`.
    *   No dedicated security review of custom build scripts *within our Tuist configuration*.
