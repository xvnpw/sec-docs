# Attack Surface Analysis for tuist/tuist

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Code Injection in Manifest Files](./attack_surfaces/malicious_code_injection_in_manifest_files.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious code directly into Tuist manifest files (e.g., `Project.swift`, `Workspace.swift`).

**How Tuist Contributes:** Tuist directly executes the code within these manifest files to generate the Xcode project structure. This execution is a core function of Tuist.

**Example:** An attacker modifies `Project.swift` to execute a shell script that steals credentials or compromises the developer's environment when `tuist generate` is run.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine, potentially leading to data theft, malware installation, or supply chain compromise.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict access control for the repository hosting the manifest files.
*   Conduct thorough code reviews of all changes to manifest files.
*   Use a Git signing mechanism to verify the authenticity of commits.
*   Employ static analysis tools on manifest files to detect suspicious code patterns.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Manipulation in Manifests](./attack_surfaces/dependency_manipulation_in_manifests.md)

**Description:** Attackers alter manifest files to point to malicious dependency repositories or compromised versions of legitimate dependencies.

**How Tuist Contributes:** Tuist uses the information in the manifest files to resolve and download dependencies. This dependency resolution is a key part of Tuist's project setup.

**Example:** An attacker changes the URL for a dependency in `Package.swift` to point to a malicious server hosting a backdoored version of the library.

**Impact:** Introduction of vulnerable or malicious code into the project, potentially leading to application compromise, data breaches, or unexpected behavior.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Utilize dependency locking mechanisms (e.g., `Package.resolved`) and regularly verify its integrity.
*   Implement Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation and analysis.
*   Use private dependency repositories with strict access controls and security scanning.
*   Monitor dependency advisories and promptly update to patched versions.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via Manifest Configuration](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_manifest_configuration.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious commands into manifest configurations that are later executed by Tuist or underlying tools.

**How Tuist Contributes:** Tuist might execute shell commands based on configurations defined in the manifest files (e.g., build scripts, code generation steps). Tuist's mechanism for executing these commands is the direct contributor.

**Example:** An attacker crafts a manifest with a build script that includes a command like `rm -rf /` if a specific environment variable is set.

**Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on the build machine or developer's machine, potentially leading to system compromise or data loss.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid using shell commands directly within manifest configurations where possible.
*   If shell commands are necessary, ensure proper input sanitization and validation to prevent command injection.
*   Use Tuist's built-in features and plugins instead of relying on custom shell scripts.
