## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Project.swift to Introduce Malicious Targets/Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/modify_project_swift_to_introduce_malicious_targetsdependencies.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker gains write access to the project's repository (e.g., through compromised credentials, exploiting repository vulnerabilities) and directly modifies the `Project.swift` file.
*   **Impact:** This allows the attacker to introduce malicious build targets, link against malicious local frameworks, or specify malicious dependencies that will be fetched and included in the build.
*   **Why High-Risk:** Relatively straightforward to execute once repository access is gained, and the impact is high, leading to direct code execution within the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce Malicious Code via Tuist Plugins/Generators](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_malicious_code_via_tuist_pluginsgenerators.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker develops a malicious Tuist plugin or generator and either tricks a developer into installing it or compromises a legitimate plugin's distribution mechanism.
*   **Impact:** Malicious plugins can execute arbitrary code during project generation or code modification, injecting backdoors, stealing secrets, or modifying the application's logic.
*   **Why High-Risk:** Social engineering or supply chain attacks targeting plugins are increasingly common, and the potential for widespread impact across projects using the plugin is significant.

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce Malicious Dependencies (Focus on Dependency Confusion and Typosquatting)](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_malicious_dependencies__focus_on_dependency_confusion_and_typosquatting_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   **Dependency Confusion:** The attacker publishes a package with the same name as an internal dependency on a public repository, hoping the build system will prioritize the public one.
    *   **Typosquatting:** The attacker publishes a package with a name very similar to a legitimate, popular dependency, hoping developers will make a typo.
*   **Impact:** When the application builds, it fetches and includes the attacker's malicious dependency, leading to code execution within the application.
*   **Why High-Risk:** These attacks are relatively easy to execute with low effort and can have a significant impact if successful.

## Attack Tree Path: [Poison Tuist's Local Cache](./attack_tree_paths/poison_tuist's_local_cache.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker gains write access to a developer's local machine and modifies files within Tuist's cache directory.
*   **Impact:** This can lead to the injection of malicious code or the replacement of legitimate build artifacts with malicious ones, which will be used in subsequent builds.
*   **Why High-Risk:** While requiring local access, the impact can be significant and persist across multiple builds if the cache is not cleared.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Build Settings](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_build_settings.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker with write access to the repository or control over a Tuist plugin modifies the build settings defined in `Project.swift` or through plugin logic.
*   **Impact:** Malicious build settings can alter the compilation process, disable security features, or introduce vulnerabilities into the final application binary.
*   **Why High-Risk:** Modifying build settings can have subtle but significant impacts on the application's security.

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce Malicious Build Scripts via Target Definitions](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_malicious_build_scripts_via_target_definitions.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker with write access to the repository or control over a Tuist plugin adds malicious scripts to the build phases of targets defined in `Project.swift`.
*   **Impact:** These scripts execute during the build process and can perform arbitrary actions, such as downloading and executing malware, exfiltrating data, or modifying the build output.
*   **Why High-Risk:** Build scripts offer a powerful mechanism for executing code during the build process, making them an attractive target for attackers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Tuist](./attack_tree_paths/remote_code_execution__rce__in_tuist.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker identifies and exploits a vulnerability within the Tuist application itself that allows them to execute arbitrary code on the developer's machine.
*   **Impact:** Successful RCE grants the attacker full control over the developer's machine, potentially leading to data theft, further compromise of the development environment, and access to sensitive credentials.
*   **Why High-Risk:** RCE vulnerabilities are critical and allow for immediate and significant compromise.
