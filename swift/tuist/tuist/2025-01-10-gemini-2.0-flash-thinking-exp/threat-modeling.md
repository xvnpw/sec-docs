# Threat Model Analysis for tuist/tuist

## Threat: [Compromised Tuist Release](./threats/compromised_tuist_release.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to Tuist's release infrastructure (e.g., GitHub repository write access, package signing keys) and injects malicious code into a released version of the Tuist binary. Developers unknowingly download and use this compromised version.
    *   **How:** The attacker might exploit vulnerabilities in the release process, use social engineering, or compromise developer accounts with release privileges.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Impact:** Developers using the compromised version will unknowingly introduce malware or vulnerabilities into their projects during the build process. This could lead to data breaches, unauthorized access to user devices, or other malicious activities in the final application. The attacker could gain control over the build environment and potentially exfiltrate sensitive data or inject backdoors.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   **Component:** `tuist` binary, potentially the `tuist upgrade` mechanism.
    *   **Risk Severity:**
        *   **Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Verify the integrity of downloaded Tuist releases using checksums or digital signatures provided by the Tuist maintainers.
        *   Monitor official Tuist communication channels (e.g., GitHub releases, blog) for announcements regarding compromised releases or security advisories.
        *   Implement security best practices for managing release infrastructure and developer accounts with release privileges, including multi-factor authentication.

## Threat: [Malicious `Project.swift` or Manifest Files](./threats/malicious__project_swift__or_manifest_files.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker with write access to the project repository (either an insider threat or through compromised developer credentials) modifies the `Project.swift` or other manifest files to introduce malicious elements that Tuist will process and act upon.
    *   **How:** This could involve adding malicious dependencies *that Tuist fetches and integrates*, defining build phases *that Tuist executes*, or misconfiguring build settings *that Tuist applies to the generated project*.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Impact:** This can lead to the inclusion of backdoors, data exfiltration capabilities, or other malicious functionalities in the built application. The attacker could gain control over the build process *through Tuist's actions* and inject code without the developers' explicit knowledge during normal development.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   **Component:** `Project.swift`, `Workspace.swift`, `Dependencies.swift`, and other manifest files *parsed and acted upon by Tuist*.
    *   **Risk Severity:**
        *   **Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access controls for the project repository and `Project.swift` files.
        *   Enforce code review processes for all changes to `Project.swift` and other manifest files.
        *   Utilize version control systems and track changes to these critical files.
        *   Consider using static analysis tools to scan `Project.swift` for suspicious configurations or code patterns.

## Threat: [Unsafe Script Execution in Build Phases](./threats/unsafe_script_execution_in_build_phases.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker injects malicious code into custom build scripts defined in the `Project.swift` *that Tuist will execute during the build process*.
    *   **How:** This could be done by modifying the `Project.swift` (as described above) or by compromising a dependency that includes malicious build scripts *that Tuist integrates and subsequently executes*.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Impact:** Malicious build scripts can execute arbitrary commands during the build process *initiated by Tuist*, potentially exfiltrating data, modifying files outside the project scope, or injecting backdoors into the built application.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   **Component:** Build phase execution logic *within Tuist*.
    *   **Risk Severity:**
        *   **Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review all custom build scripts and avoid executing untrusted or dynamically generated code.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization within build scripts.
        *   Restrict the permissions of build scripts to the minimum necessary.
        *   Consider using containerization for build environments to limit the impact of malicious scripts.

## Threat: [Compromised Tuist Update Mechanism](./threats/compromised_tuist_update_mechanism.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker compromises the infrastructure used to distribute Tuist updates, allowing them to push malicious updates to developers using the `tuist upgrade` command.
    *   **How:** This could involve compromising the server hosting the updates or the signing keys used to verify updates.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Impact:** Developers unknowingly download and install a compromised version of Tuist, leading to the same consequences as a compromised initial release (introducing malware into projects).
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   **Component:** `tuist upgrade` command, update server infrastructure.
    *   **Risk Severity:**
        *   **Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure that Tuist updates are downloaded from official and trusted sources over secure connections (HTTPS).
        *   Verify the integrity of updates using digital signatures if provided by the Tuist maintainers.
        *   Monitor official Tuist communication channels for announcements regarding update security.

## Threat: [File System Access Abuse](./threats/file_system_access_abuse.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** A malicious `Project.swift` or a compromised Tuist version could leverage *Tuist's* file system access to read or modify files outside the intended project scope *during its operation*.
    *   **How:** This could involve using file system APIs within build scripts *executed by Tuist* or through vulnerabilities in Tuist's core functionality *related to file system operations*.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Impact:** Attackers could read sensitive files on the developer's machine or in the CI/CD environment, or they could modify critical system files, leading to system compromise or data loss.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   **Component:** File system interaction logic *within Tuist and build scripts executed by Tuist*.
    *   **Risk Severity:**
        *   **Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Minimize the file system permissions required by Tuist and build scripts.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for file paths used within `Project.swift` and build scripts.
        *   Consider using containerization for build environments to isolate the build process and limit file system access.
