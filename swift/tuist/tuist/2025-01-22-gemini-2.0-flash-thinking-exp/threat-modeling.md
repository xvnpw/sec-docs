# Threat Model Analysis for tuist/tuist

## Threat: [Malicious Tuist Binary](./threats/malicious_tuist_binary.md)

**Description:** An attacker replaces the legitimate Tuist binary with a compromised version. Developers unknowingly download and execute this malicious binary. Upon execution, the attacker can gain control of the developer's machine, steal credentials, inject malicious code into generated projects, or perform other malicious actions.

**Impact:** Critical. Full compromise of developer machines, potential supply chain attack by injecting malware into projects built by affected developers.

**Affected Tuist Component:** Tuist Core Binary (distribution and execution)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Always download Tuist from the official GitHub Releases page: [https://github.com/tuist/tuist/releases](https://github.com/tuist/tuist/releases).
* Verify the integrity of downloaded binaries using checksums (if provided on the releases page).
* Use trusted package managers (like Homebrew if applicable and trusted) for installation, ensuring they point to the official Tuist repository.
* Implement software allowlisting to restrict execution of unauthorized binaries on developer machines.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Tuist Code](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_tuist_code.md)

**Description:** Tuist's codebase contains security vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, injection flaws). An attacker exploits these vulnerabilities by crafting malicious project manifests or plugins that trigger the vulnerability during Tuist processing. This could lead to arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine or denial of service.

**Impact:** High to Critical. Arbitrary code execution on developer machines, denial of service impacting development workflows, potential data breaches if vulnerabilities allow access to sensitive information.

**Affected Tuist Component:** Tuist Core Codebase (parsing logic, project generation, plugin handling)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep Tuist updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
* Monitor Tuist's GitHub repository for security advisories and vulnerability reports: [https://github.com/tuist/tuist](https://github.com/tuist/tuist).
* Report any suspected vulnerabilities to the Tuist maintainers through GitHub issues or security channels if provided.
* In critical environments, consider performing or commissioning security audits of the Tuist codebase.

## Threat: [Unintended Code Execution during Manifest Processing](./threats/unintended_code_execution_during_manifest_processing.md)

**Description:** Tuist's manifest parsing logic incorrectly handles user-provided input within `Project.swift` or other manifest files. An attacker crafts a malicious manifest that, when processed by Tuist, executes arbitrary code on the developer's machine. This could be achieved through injection flaws in manifest parsing or unsafe deserialization of manifest data.

**Impact:** High. Arbitrary code execution on developer machines, potential compromise of development environment and source code.

**Affected Tuist Component:** Manifest Parsing and Processing (Project.swift, etc.)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully review and control access to project manifests. Treat manifests as code and apply code review processes.
* Avoid using untrusted or externally sourced manifests without thorough inspection.
* Implement strict input validation and sanitization practices within manifest generation and processing workflows (if you are programmatically generating manifests).
* Report any suspicious behavior or potential code execution vulnerabilities observed during manifest processing to Tuist maintainers.

## Threat: [Malicious Tuist Plugin](./threats/malicious_tuist_plugin.md)

**Description:** A developer installs a malicious Tuist plugin from an untrusted source. The plugin, when executed by Tuist, performs malicious actions on the developer's machine, such as stealing code, credentials, or modifying project files to inject backdoors.

**Impact:** High to Critical. Full compromise of developer machines, potential supply chain attack by injecting malware into projects via plugin functionality.

**Affected Tuist Component:** Plugin System (plugin installation and execution)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Strictly** only use plugins from trusted and reputable sources. Prioritize plugins officially endorsed or maintained by the Tuist team or well-known and trusted developers/organizations.
* Carefully review plugin code before installation if the source code is available. Understand what permissions and actions the plugin performs.
* Implement a plugin allowlist to restrict plugin usage to only explicitly approved and vetted plugins within your organization.
* Monitor plugin activity and resource usage for any unexpected or suspicious behavior after installation.

## Threat: [Manifest Tampering](./threats/manifest_tampering.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to project manifest files (e.g., `Project.swift`) and modifies them maliciously. This could involve altering project settings, adding malicious dependencies, or changing build scripts to inject backdoors into generated Xcode projects.

**Impact:** High. Generation of compromised Xcode projects, potential supply chain attack by injecting malware into applications built from tampered manifests.

**Affected Tuist Component:** Project Manifest Files (Project.swift, etc.)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust access controls for project manifest files. Restrict write access to authorized personnel only.
* Store manifests in version control (e.g., Git) with proper access controls, branch protection, and audit logging enabled.
* Mandate code review processes for **all** changes to project manifests before they are merged or applied.
* Consider implementing file integrity monitoring for manifest files to detect unauthorized modifications outside of the approved workflow.

## Threat: [Compromised Tuist Repository](./threats/compromised_tuist_repository.md)

**Description:** The official Tuist GitHub repository is compromised by an attacker. Malicious code is injected into the Tuist codebase, and a backdoored version of Tuist is released to developers through official channels.

**Impact:** Critical. Wide-scale supply chain attack, distribution of backdoored Tuist versions to developers, potentially compromising numerous development environments and projects globally.

**Affected Tuist Component:** Tuist GitHub Repository (source code, release pipeline)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* While direct mitigation is limited for end-users, rely on the official Tuist repository and releases as the most trusted source.
* Monitor the Tuist repository for unusual activity, unexpected commits, or changes from unauthorized individuals. Subscribe to security advisories or announcements from the Tuist project.
* In extremely high-security environments, consider building Tuist from source and performing independent security audits of the codebase and build process. This is a complex and resource-intensive mitigation.
* Implement network egress filtering to restrict Tuist's access to external networks during build processes, limiting potential command-and-control communication if a compromise occurs (defense in depth).
