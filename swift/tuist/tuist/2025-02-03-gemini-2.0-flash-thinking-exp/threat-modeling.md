# Threat Model Analysis for tuist/tuist

## Threat: [Compromised Tuist Distribution](./threats/compromised_tuist_distribution.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises official Tuist distribution channels (GitHub, Homebrew) and replaces the legitimate Tuist binary with a malicious one. Developers unknowingly download and install this compromised version.
*   **Impact:**  Malicious Tuist can inject backdoors into generated projects, steal developer credentials, exfiltrate source code, or compromise the build environment.
*   **Tuist Component Affected:** Installation process, `tuist` binary distribution.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Verify download integrity using official checksums.
    *   Use trusted installation methods (Homebrew, official GitHub releases).
    *   Monitor official Tuist channels for security advisories.
    *   Consider using package pinning or dependency locking for Tuist version.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Tuist's Dependencies](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_tuist's_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Tuist relies on external dependencies (Swift packages, potentially Ruby gems/Node.js packages for plugins). Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in these dependencies.
*   **Impact:**  Exploiting dependency vulnerabilities can lead to arbitrary code execution during Tuist operations, denial of service, or information disclosure on the developer's machine.
*   **Tuist Component Affected:** Dependency management, internal libraries, plugin system dependencies.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Tuist updated to benefit from dependency updates.
    *   Monitor Tuist release notes for dependency vulnerability fixes.
    *   If using plugins, audit their dependencies as well.
    *   Consider using dependency scanning tools on the development environment.

## Threat: [Malicious Tuist Plugins](./threats/malicious_tuist_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker creates or compromises a Tuist plugin and distributes it through package managers or online repositories. Developers unknowingly install and use this malicious plugin.
*   **Impact:**  Malicious plugins can inject malicious code into projects, steal sensitive data, manipulate the build process, or gain unauthorized access to the developer's system.
*   **Tuist Component Affected:** Plugin system, plugin installation and execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Only use plugins from trusted sources.
    *   Review plugin code before installation.
    *   Implement a plugin vetting process within the team.
    *   Utilize plugin sandboxing or permission models if available.
    *   Minimize the number of plugins used.

## Threat: [Malicious Code Injection via Project Templates](./threats/malicious_code_injection_via_project_templates.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker modifies or creates malicious project templates used by Tuist. When developers generate projects using these templates, malicious code is injected into the generated codebase.
*   **Impact:**  Injected malicious code becomes part of the application, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, or application malfunction in production.
*   **Tuist Component Affected:** Project generation, template engine, `Project.swift` generation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Control and review project templates carefully.
    *   Implement code review for template changes.
    *   Use version control for templates and track changes.
    *   Prefer using built-in templates or templates from trusted sources.

## Threat: [Command Injection via Manifest Files](./threats/command_injection_via_manifest_files.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit the ability to execute arbitrary commands within `Project.swift` or manifest files. By injecting malicious input or manipulating external data sources used in manifest files, they can execute arbitrary commands on the developer's machine or build server.
*   **Impact:**  Command injection can lead to system compromise, data theft, or denial of service on developer machines or build infrastructure.
*   **Tuist Component Affected:** `Project.swift` execution, manifest file processing, shell command execution within manifest files.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid executing external commands in manifest files if possible.
    *   Sanitize and validate all external inputs used in command execution.
    *   Use parameterized commands or safer alternatives to shell execution.
    *   Apply principle of least privilege for Tuist execution.

## Threat: [Local Code Execution during Tuist Operations](./threats/local_code_execution_during_tuist_operations.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in Tuist or its dependencies are exploited to achieve local code execution when a developer runs Tuist commands (e.g., `tuist generate`, `tuist build`).
*   **Impact:**  Local code execution allows attackers to gain control of the developer's machine, steal credentials, exfiltrate code, or compromise the development environment.
*   **Tuist Component Affected:** Core Tuist runtime, command-line interface, dependency resolution, build process execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Tuist and dependencies updated.
    *   Run Tuist with least privilege.
    *   Be cautious with projects from untrusted sources.
    *   Use security software on development machines (antivirus, EDR).

## Threat: [Build Process Manipulation via Tuist](./threats/build_process_manipulation_via_tuist.md)

*   **Description:** A compromised Tuist or malicious `Project.swift` manipulates the Xcode project generation or build process to inject malicious code into the final application binary, bypassing standard code reviews.
*   **Impact:**  Malicious code injected during build can compromise the deployed application, leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, or application malfunction in production environments.
*   **Tuist Component Affected:** Xcode project generation, build system integration, `Project.swift` build phase configuration.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust build pipeline security measures (artifact verification, integrity checks).
    *   Regularly audit generated Xcode projects and build settings.
    *   Consider using more transparent and controlled build systems alongside Tuist.
    *   Perform security testing on final build artifacts.
