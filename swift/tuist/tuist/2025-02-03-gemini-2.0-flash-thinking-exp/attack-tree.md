## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise via Tuist Tooling [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_via_tuist_tooling__high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** This path focuses on compromising the Tuist tool itself, which is the foundation of the build process. Success here grants the attacker significant control.
*   **Critical Nodes within this path:**
    *   **Malicious Tuist Binary [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Description:**  Replacing the legitimate Tuist binary with a malicious version.
        *   **Impact:**  Complete control over the build process, allowing for arbitrary code injection, data exfiltration, or sabotage during application builds.
        *   **Example Attack:**  Distributing a trojanized Tuist binary through phishing emails or compromised websites, tricking developers into using it.
    *   **Supply Chain Attack on Tuist Distribution [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Description:** Compromising the official distribution channels of Tuist, such as GitHub releases, CDNs, or package managers (like Homebrew).
        *   **Impact:** Widespread compromise affecting all users who download Tuist from the compromised source. This is a highly impactful supply chain attack.
        *   **Example Attack:**  Gaining unauthorized access to Tuist's GitHub repository and replacing a legitimate release with a malicious one, or compromising a CDN to serve a malicious binary.
    *   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Tuist itself [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Description:** Exploiting security vulnerabilities within the Tuist application code itself.
        *   **Impact:**  Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to remote code execution, allowing an attacker to gain control over the developer's machine or the build process by crafting malicious project manifests.
        *   **Example Attack:**  Finding a code execution vulnerability in Tuist's manifest parsing logic and crafting a `Project.swift` file that, when processed by a vulnerable Tuist version, executes malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise via Project Configuration (Manifests) [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_via_project_configuration__manifests___high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Targeting the `Project.swift` and `Workspace.swift` manifest files, which are code and define the project's structure and build process.
*   **Critical Node within this path:**
    *   **Manifest Injection [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Description:** Injecting malicious code directly into the `Project.swift` or `Workspace.swift` files.
        *   **Impact:**  Allows the attacker to manipulate the build process, inject malicious code into the application, or exfiltrate data during builds.
        *   **Example Attack Paths:**
            *   **Compromise developer's machine and modify manifests directly [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Gaining access to a developer's machine (e.g., through malware or social engineering) and directly editing the manifest files to include malicious code.
            *   **Compromise Git repository and inject malicious code via Pull Request [HIGH RISK PATH]:**  Compromising a Git repository (e.g., through stolen credentials or exploiting repository vulnerabilities) and injecting malicious code into manifest files via a seemingly legitimate Pull Request that bypasses code review.

## Attack Tree Path: [Dependency Management Compromise (through Tuist) [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/dependency_management_compromise__through_tuist___high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting Tuist's dependency management features to introduce malicious dependencies into the project.
*   **Critical Node within this path:**
    *   **Dependency Confusion Attack [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Description:**  Leveraging the dependency resolution process to trick Tuist into downloading a malicious public dependency instead of a legitimate private or internal dependency with the same name.
        *   **Impact:**  Injection of malicious code from the attacker-controlled dependency into the application build.
        *   **Example Attack:**  Creating a public package with the same name as a private internal dependency used by the target application and ensuring it's available in a public repository that Tuist might check before private registries.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise via Generated Xcode Project Manipulation (Post-Tuist Generation) [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_via_generated_xcode_project_manipulation__post-tuist_generation___high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Modifying the Xcode project *after* it has been generated by Tuist, but before the application is built.
*   **High Risk Path within this path:**
    *   **Direct Modification of Generated Xcode Project [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Description:** Directly altering the Xcode project files (e.g., `.xcodeproj` directory) after Tuist generation to inject malicious build phases, modify build settings, or link against malicious libraries.
        *   **Impact:**  Allows for manipulation of the final build process, code injection, and potentially bypassing security measures.
        *   **Example Attack Path:**
            *   **Attacker gains access to developer's machine or CI/CD environment [HIGH RISK PATH]:**  Compromising a developer's machine or the CI/CD pipeline environment and then modifying the generated Xcode project files before the build process starts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise via Tuist Cache Poisoning [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_via_tuist_cache_poisoning__high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Corrupting or replacing cached build artifacts used by Tuist to speed up builds.
*   **High Risk Paths and Critical Nodes within this path:**
    *   **Poisoning Local Tuist Cache [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Description:**  Replacing cached build artifacts in the local Tuist cache directory on a developer's machine with malicious versions.
        *   **Impact:**  Subsequent builds might use the poisoned cache, leading to the inclusion of malicious code or artifacts in the final application.
        *   **Example Attack Path:**
            *   **Attacker gains access to developer's machine [HIGH RISK PATH]:**  Compromising a developer's machine and then directly replacing files within the Tuist cache directory.
    *   **Exploiting vulnerabilities in Tuist's caching mechanism [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Description:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in the logic of Tuist's caching system itself to inject malicious artifacts into the cache.
        *   **Impact:**  Cache corruption and potential for widespread injection of malicious artifacts if the vulnerability is exploitable across multiple projects or users.
    *   **Poisoning Shared/Remote Tuist Cache (if implemented) [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Description:**  Compromising a shared or remote Tuist cache (e.g., stored in cloud storage like S3) used by a team or organization.
        *   **Impact:**  Widespread cache poisoning affecting all users who rely on the shared cache, potentially compromising multiple builds and applications.
        *   **Critical Node within this path:**
            *   **Compromise shared cache storage (e.g., S3 bucket) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                *   **Attack Description:** Gaining unauthorized access to the storage location of the shared Tuist cache (e.g., by compromising cloud storage credentials).
                *   **Impact:**  Allows the attacker to replace cached artifacts, leading to widespread and potentially long-lasting compromise across the organization's builds.
