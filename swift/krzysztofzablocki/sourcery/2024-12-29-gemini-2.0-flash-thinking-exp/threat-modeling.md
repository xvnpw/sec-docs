### High and Critical Sourcery-Specific Threats

Here's an updated list of high and critical threats that directly involve the Sourcery tool:

*   **Threat:** Introduction of Vulnerabilities via Malicious Custom Rules
    *   **Description:** An attacker with access to the Sourcery rule configuration (e.g., through a compromised developer account or insecure rule repository) crafts custom rules designed to introduce security flaws. This could involve rules that weaken input validation, introduce logic errors leading to vulnerabilities, or even directly inject malicious code snippets during refactoring *performed by Sourcery*.
    *   **Impact:** Introduction of exploitable vulnerabilities in the codebase, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Sourcery Component:** Custom Rules Engine, Code Refactoring Module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access controls for Sourcery rule configuration.
        *   Enforce code review for all custom rules before deployment.
        *   Utilize a version control system for rule changes to track modifications and enable rollback.
        *   Employ static analysis tools to scan custom rules for potential security issues.

*   **Threat:** Tampering with Code During the Refactoring Process
    *   **Description:** If the environment where Sourcery runs is compromised, an attacker could potentially intercept and modify the code *during Sourcery's refactoring process*, injecting malicious code before it is committed or deployed.
    *   **Impact:** Introduction of malicious code into the codebase, potentially leading to severe security breaches, data exfiltration, or complete system compromise.
    *   **Affected Sourcery Component:** Code Refactoring Module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the development environment and CI/CD pipelines with strong access controls and security hardening.
        *   Implement integrity checks to verify the code before and after Sourcery execution.
        *   Utilize secure coding practices and code signing to ensure the authenticity and integrity of the codebase.
        *   Regularly scan development machines and CI/CD infrastructure for malware and vulnerabilities.

*   **Threat:** Compromised Sourcery Installation or Updates
    *   **Description:** If the official Sourcery repository or distribution channels are compromised, malicious versions of the tool could be distributed. Installing or updating to a compromised version could introduce backdoors or vulnerabilities *within the Sourcery tool itself*, potentially affecting all projects it analyzes.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the development environment, potential for supply chain attacks, and introduction of vulnerabilities into all projects using the compromised Sourcery version.
    *   **Affected Sourcery Component:** Entire Sourcery application and its dependencies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Download Sourcery only from trusted and official sources.
        *   Verify the integrity of downloaded packages using checksums or digital signatures.
        *   Be cautious about automatic updates and review update notes before applying them.
        *   Consider using dependency management tools that can verify the integrity of packages.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Sourcery's Dependencies
    *   **Description:** Sourcery relies on various third-party libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited to compromise *Sourcery's functionality* or the environment it runs in.
    *   **Impact:** Potential compromise of the development environment or the codebase being analyzed, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
    *   **Affected Sourcery Component:**  Various modules depending on the vulnerable dependency.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update Sourcery and its dependencies to the latest versions.
        *   Utilize dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in Sourcery's dependencies.
        *   Monitor security advisories for Sourcery and its dependencies.
