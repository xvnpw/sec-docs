**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

*   **Compromise Application Using Sourcery [CRITICAL]:**
    *   This is the ultimate goal of the attacker, representing the successful exploitation of Sourcery to compromise the application.

*   **Manipulate Sourcery's Output to Inject Malicious Code [CRITICAL]:**
    *   This high-risk path focuses on altering the code generated by Sourcery to introduce malicious functionality.

*   **Exploit Template Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]:**
    *   This critical node involves leveraging weaknesses within Sourcery's templating engine to inject malicious code.

*   **Inject Malicious Code into Templates [CRITICAL]:**
    *   This is the direct action of inserting harmful code snippets into Sourcery templates.

*   **Exploit Lack of Input Sanitization in Templates [CRITICAL]:**
    *   This critical vulnerability occurs when data used within templates is not properly sanitized, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary code through crafted inputs.

*   **Leverage Template Logic for Code Injection:**
    *   Attackers can exploit the inherent logic of templates (e.g., conditional statements, loops) by providing specific data inputs that cause the template to generate unintended or malicious code.

*   **Poison Data Models Used by Sourcery:**
    *   This high-risk path involves corrupting or manipulating the data models that Sourcery uses to generate code.

*   **Inject Malicious Data into Data Sources:**
    *   If Sourcery relies on external data sources (like YAML or JSON files), attackers can inject malicious data into these sources, which will then be incorporated into the generated code.

*   **Exploit Sourcery's Configuration or Execution Environment [CRITICAL]:**
    *   This high-risk path focuses on exploiting weaknesses in how Sourcery is configured or executed.

*   **Modify Configuration Files to Execute Malicious Scripts [CRITICAL]:**
    *   If Sourcery's configuration files are not properly protected, attackers can modify them to execute arbitrary scripts or point to malicious resources during Sourcery's execution.

*   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Sourcery's Dependencies [CRITICAL]:**
    *   This critical node highlights the risk of using third-party libraries with known vulnerabilities.

*   **Leverage Known Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Libraries [CRITICAL]:**
    *   Attackers can exploit publicly known vulnerabilities in the libraries that Sourcery depends on.

*   **Exploit Outdated or Vulnerable Dependencies [CRITICAL]:**
    *   This critical vulnerability arises when Sourcery uses outdated versions of its dependencies that contain known security flaws. Attackers can leverage these flaws to compromise the application during the code generation process.
