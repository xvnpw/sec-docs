# Threat Model Analysis for krzysztofzablocki/sourcery

## Threat: [Malicious Template Execution](./threats/malicious_template_execution.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious code into a Sourcery template (e.g., by compromising a template repository). When Sourcery processes this template, the malicious code executes during code generation, potentially granting the attacker control over the developer's machine or build server.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on developer machines or build servers, leading to potential data breaches, supply chain compromise, and disruption of development.
*   **Affected Sourcery Component:** Template Engine (template parsing and execution).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly control and review template sources using version control.
    *   Implement mandatory code review for all template changes.
    *   Investigate and utilize template sandboxing features if available.
    *   Run Sourcery processes with least privilege.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerability Exploitation leading to Template Manipulation](./threats/dependency_vulnerability_exploitation_leading_to_template_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability in a Sourcery dependency (specifically one used in template processing) is exploited. This allows an attacker to manipulate template execution or inject malicious code during the code generation process *through* Sourcery's template engine.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on developer machines or build servers, potentially leading to malicious code injection into generated application code.
*   **Affected Sourcery Component:** Dependency Management (specifically dependencies used for template processing) and Template Engine.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Maintain up-to-date Sourcery and its dependencies, prioritizing security patches.
    *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify vulnerabilities in Sourcery's dependencies.
    *   Pin dependency versions to ensure consistent and controlled environments.
    *   Regularly audit Sourcery's dependency tree for known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Generation of Critical Vulnerabilities in Code](./threats/generation_of_critical_vulnerabilities_in_code.md)

*   **Description:** Flaws in Sourcery templates or their logic result in the generation of application code containing critical security vulnerabilities (e.g., severe injection flaws, authentication bypasses). These vulnerabilities can be directly exploited in the deployed application.
*   **Impact:** Introduction of critical security vulnerabilities into the application codebase, leading to application compromise, data breaches, and potential system-wide impact after deployment.
*   **Affected Sourcery Component:** Template Logic and Code Generation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Design templates with a strong focus on secure coding practices.
    *   Conduct thorough security reviews of all Sourcery templates, especially those handling sensitive logic.
    *   Perform static and dynamic security analysis on the code generated by Sourcery to detect and fix vulnerabilities *before* deployment.
    *   Implement comprehensive unit and integration testing, including security-focused tests, for all generated code.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure of Critical Secrets via Templates or Generated Code](./threats/information_disclosure_of_critical_secrets_via_templates_or_generated_code.md)

*   **Description:** Sourcery templates or the code they generate inadvertently expose critical secrets (e.g., API keys, database credentials, encryption keys). This could occur due to hardcoded secrets in templates or insecure handling of sensitive data during code generation.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of critical secrets, leading to unauthorized access to systems, data breaches, and complete compromise of application security.
*   **Affected Sourcery Component:** Template Content and Code Generation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Absolutely avoid hardcoding secrets in Sourcery templates.
    *   Implement secure secret management practices to inject secrets at runtime or build time, *outside* of templates.
    *   Carefully review templates and generated code to ensure no unintentional exposure of sensitive information.
    *   Enforce secure logging practices in generated code to prevent logging of sensitive data.
