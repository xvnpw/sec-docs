### 2. Deep Analysis of Template Injection Vulnerabilities in Sourcery

#### 2.1. Understanding Template Injection in Sourcery Context

Template injection vulnerabilities arise when a template engine, like Stencil or Swift templates used by Sourcery, processes user-controlled input as part of the template itself. Instead of treating user input solely as data to be rendered within a template, the engine interprets it as template code, leading to potential execution of malicious instructions.

**How Sourcery Facilitates Template Injection:**

Sourcery's core function is to generate code based on templates and project metadata. This process inherently involves:

1.  **Template Loading:** Sourcery needs to locate and load template files. This can be configured through:
    *   **Static Paths:**  Predefined paths to template files within the project.
    *   **Dynamic Paths:** Paths constructed based on configuration files, command-line arguments, environment variables, or potentially even external data sources.
2.  **Template Processing:**  Once loaded, the template engine (Stencil or Swift templates) parses and executes the template code. This involves:
    *   **Variable Substitution:** Replacing placeholders in the template with data extracted from the project's source code or provided as input.
    *   **Logic Execution:**  Executing template logic (loops, conditionals, filters) defined within the template.

**The Vulnerability Point:**

The vulnerability emerges when the *template path* or the *template content itself* is influenced by untrusted input. If an attacker can control either of these aspects, they can inject malicious template code that Sourcery will then execute during the code generation process.

#### 2.2. Attack Vectors and Scenarios

Several attack vectors can lead to template injection in Sourcery:

*   **Configuration File Manipulation:**
    *   **Scenario:** Sourcery configuration (e.g., `.sourcery.yml` or similar) allows specifying template paths. If this configuration file is sourced from or modifiable by untrusted users (e.g., in a shared development environment, CI/CD pipeline with insufficient access controls, or if the configuration is derived from user-provided data), an attacker can modify the template paths to point to malicious templates.
    *   **Example:**  An attacker modifies `.sourcery.yml` to change `templates:` path to a URL hosting a malicious template or a local path they control.

*   **Command-Line Argument Injection:**
    *   **Scenario:** If Sourcery is invoked with command-line arguments that control template paths or template content (less likely but possible if custom scripts are used to invoke Sourcery), and these arguments are derived from untrusted sources, injection is possible.
    *   **Example:** A script takes user input and constructs a Sourcery command like `sourcery --templates <user_input_path>`.  A malicious user provides a path to a malicious template as `<user_input_path>`.

*   **Environment Variable Exploitation:**
    *   **Scenario:**  If Sourcery or scripts invoking Sourcery rely on environment variables to determine template paths, and these environment variables are controllable by an attacker (e.g., in a shared server environment or through compromised user accounts), template injection is possible.
    *   **Example:**  Sourcery reads `TEMPLATE_PATH` environment variable. An attacker sets `TEMPLATE_PATH` to point to a malicious template.

*   **Indirect Injection via Data Sources:**
    *   **Scenario:**  If Sourcery is configured to fetch template paths or even template content from external data sources (e.g., databases, APIs, remote repositories) without proper validation, and these data sources are compromised or contain attacker-controlled data, indirect template injection can occur.
    *   **Example:** Sourcery retrieves template paths from a database. An attacker compromises the database and modifies the template path entries to point to malicious templates.

*   **Template Content Injection (Less Likely in typical Sourcery usage but theoretically possible):**
    *   **Scenario:** In highly unusual configurations, if Sourcery were to dynamically construct template *content* based on untrusted input (e.g., fetching snippets from a database and assembling them into a template string), template injection within the content itself could be possible. This is less probable in standard Sourcery workflows but worth considering for highly customized setups.

#### 2.3. Exploitation Techniques

Once an attacker controls the template path or content, they can inject malicious code within the template. Exploitation techniques typically involve:

*   **System Command Execution:**  Template engines often provide mechanisms to execute system commands. Attackers can inject template code that leverages these mechanisms to execute arbitrary commands on the server running Sourcery.
    *   **Stencil Example (Hypothetical - depends on filters and extensions available):**  `{{ 'rm -rf /' | system_command }}` (This is a simplified example and actual syntax depends on available filters/extensions in Stencil within Sourcery's context).
    *   **Swift Template Example (Hypothetical - depends on available features):**  `<% import Foundation; system("rm -rf /") %>` (Again, syntax is illustrative and depends on Swift template capabilities within Sourcery).

*   **File System Access:**  Malicious templates can be crafted to read, write, or modify files on the file system accessible to the Sourcery process. This can lead to:
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Reading sensitive configuration files, source code, or generated code.
    *   **Code Modification:**  Modifying generated code to introduce backdoors or vulnerabilities into the application being built.
    *   **Denial of Service:**  Deleting critical files or filling up disk space.

*   **Information Disclosure:**  Templates can be used to extract sensitive information from the Sourcery environment, such as environment variables, system information, or internal application data.

#### 2.4. Detailed Impact Assessment

The impact of successful template injection in Sourcery is **Critical** due to the potential for severe consequences:

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** This is the most critical impact. RCE allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the system running Sourcery. This grants them complete control over the server, enabling them to:
    *   Install malware.
    *   Establish persistent access.
    *   Pivot to other systems on the network.
    *   Steal sensitive data.
    *   Disrupt operations.

*   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data:**  If Sourcery runs with elevated privileges or has access to sensitive data (e.g., API keys, database credentials, internal application secrets), template injection can be used to exfiltrate this data. This can lead to:
    *   Data breaches.
    *   Compromise of downstream systems that rely on the generated code or data.

*   **Malicious Modification of Generated Application Code:**  Attackers can modify the templates to inject malicious code directly into the application code generated by Sourcery. This is a particularly insidious attack as it can introduce vulnerabilities that are difficult to detect and can propagate to the deployed application, leading to:
    *   Backdoors in the application.
    *   Vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, or business logic flaws in the generated application.
    *   Supply chain attacks if the generated code is distributed to other parties.

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Malicious templates can be designed to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O), leading to denial of service for the Sourcery process and potentially impacting the entire system or build pipeline.

*   **Compromise of Build Pipeline and CI/CD:** If Sourcery is integrated into a CI/CD pipeline, template injection can compromise the entire pipeline. Attackers could:
    *   Modify build scripts.
    *   Inject malicious code into artifacts.
    *   Gain control over the deployment process.

#### 2.5. Comprehensive Mitigation Strategies

To effectively mitigate template injection vulnerabilities in Sourcery, a multi-layered approach is required, encompassing prevention, detection, and response strategies:

**2.5.1. Prevention Strategies (Prioritize these):**

*   **Prioritize Static Templates and Hardcoded Paths:**
    *   **Implementation:**  Whenever feasible, use static, pre-defined template paths that are hardcoded within the project's configuration or scripts. Avoid constructing template paths dynamically based on external or untrusted input.
    *   **Rationale:**  This eliminates the primary attack vector of manipulating template paths.

*   **Strict Input Sanitization and Validation (If Dynamic Paths are Unavoidable):**
    *   **Implementation:** If dynamic template path selection is absolutely necessary, rigorously sanitize and validate *all* input used to construct these paths.
        *   **Whitelisting:**  Use a whitelist approach to define allowed characters, path components, and formats for template paths. Reject any input that does not conform to the whitelist.
        *   **Path Canonicalization:**  Canonicalize paths to resolve symbolic links and relative paths to prevent path traversal attacks.
        *   **Input Encoding:**  Properly encode input to prevent injection of special characters that could be interpreted as template directives.
    *   **Rationale:**  Reduces the risk of attackers injecting malicious paths or manipulating path construction logic.

*   **Template Security Reviews and Audits:**
    *   **Implementation:** Treat templates as code and subject them to thorough security reviews and audits.
        *   **Code Review Process:**  Incorporate template reviews into the code review process.
        *   **Static Analysis:**  Explore using static analysis tools (if available for Stencil or Swift templates in this context) to identify potential vulnerabilities in templates.
        *   **Manual Inspection:**  Manually inspect templates for potentially dangerous constructs, especially those related to system command execution, file system access, or external data interaction.
    *   **Rationale:**  Proactively identify and eliminate potential injection points within templates themselves.

*   **Principle of Least Privilege for Templates and Sourcery Process:**
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   **Restrict Template File Access:**  Limit access to template files to only necessary users and processes. Use file system permissions to prevent unauthorized modification of templates.
        *   **Minimize Sourcery Process Privileges:**  Run the Sourcery process with the minimum privileges required for its operation. Avoid running it as root or with overly broad permissions.
    *   **Rationale:**  Limits the impact of a successful template injection by restricting what an attacker can do even if they gain code execution.

*   **Secure Configuration Management:**
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   **Secure Storage of Configuration:** Store Sourcery configuration files securely and protect them from unauthorized access and modification.
        *   **Configuration Version Control:**  Use version control for configuration files to track changes and facilitate rollback if necessary.
        *   **Automated Configuration Checks:**  Implement automated checks to verify the integrity and security of configuration files.
    *   **Rationale:**  Prevents attackers from easily modifying configuration to inject malicious template paths.

*   **Disable or Restrict Dangerous Template Features (If Possible and Applicable):**
    *   **Implementation:**  If the template engine (Stencil or Swift templates in Sourcery) offers features that are inherently risky (e.g., direct system command execution), explore options to disable or restrict these features if they are not essential for the intended code generation tasks.
    *   **Rationale:**  Reduces the attack surface by eliminating or limiting the availability of dangerous functionalities within templates.

**2.5.2. Detection Strategies:**

*   **Monitoring and Logging:**
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   **Log Template Processing:**  Log events related to template loading, processing, and any errors encountered. Include details like template paths used.
        *   **Monitor System Calls:**  Monitor system calls made by the Sourcery process for suspicious activity, especially execution of shell commands or file system modifications outside of expected code generation paths.
        *   **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**  Integrate Sourcery logs into a SIEM system for centralized monitoring and anomaly detection.
    *   **Rationale:**  Provides visibility into template processing activities and helps detect suspicious behavior that might indicate a template injection attack.

*   **Integrity Monitoring:**
    *   **Implementation:**  Implement file integrity monitoring for template files and Sourcery configuration files. Detect unauthorized modifications to these files.
    *   **Rationale:**  Alerts to tampering with templates or configuration that could be indicative of an attack.

**2.5.3. Response Strategies:**

*   **Incident Response Plan:**
    *   **Implementation:**  Develop and maintain an incident response plan specifically for template injection attacks in Sourcery. This plan should outline steps for:
        *   Detection and confirmation of an attack.
        *   Containment and isolation of the affected system.
        *   Eradication of the malicious template and any injected code.
        *   Recovery and restoration of systems and data.
        *   Post-incident analysis and lessons learned.
    *   **Rationale:**  Ensures a coordinated and effective response in the event of a successful template injection attack, minimizing damage and downtime.

*   **Regular Security Patching and Updates:**
    *   **Implementation:**  Keep Sourcery and its dependencies (including template engines) up-to-date with the latest security patches. Monitor for security advisories related to Sourcery and its components.
    *   **Rationale:**  Addresses known vulnerabilities in Sourcery and its dependencies, reducing the likelihood of exploitation.

**Conclusion:**

Template injection vulnerabilities in Sourcery pose a significant security risk due to their potential for Remote Code Execution and other severe impacts. By implementing the comprehensive mitigation strategies outlined above, focusing on prevention as the primary defense, and incorporating detection and response mechanisms, the development team can significantly reduce the attack surface and protect their systems and applications from these critical vulnerabilities. Continuous vigilance, security awareness, and adherence to secure development practices are essential for maintaining a secure Sourcery environment.
