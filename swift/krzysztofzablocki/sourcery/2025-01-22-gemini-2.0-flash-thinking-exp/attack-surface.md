# Attack Surface Analysis for krzysztofzablocki/sourcery

## Attack Surface: [Template Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/template_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of template engines (Stencil or Swift templates used by Sourcery) to inject malicious code. This occurs when Sourcery templates are dynamically constructed or process untrusted input, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code during Sourcery's code generation process.
*   **Sourcery Contribution:** Sourcery's core functionality relies on processing templates. If template paths or content are derived from untrusted sources, Sourcery directly facilitates template injection attacks by executing these potentially malicious templates.
*   **Example:** A developer configures Sourcery to use a template path derived from a user-provided configuration file. A malicious user modifies this configuration file to point to a template containing malicious code. When Sourcery runs, it processes this malicious template, leading to command execution on the system.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution on the system running Sourcery.
    *   Unauthorised access to sensitive data accessible to the Sourcery process.
    *   Malicious modification of generated application code, introducing vulnerabilities.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Prioritize Static Templates:**  Favor using static, pre-defined templates whenever possible to eliminate dynamic template path or content construction.
    *   **Strict Input Sanitization:** If dynamic template selection or content is unavoidable, rigorously sanitize and validate *all* input used to construct template paths or content before Sourcery processes them.
    *   **Template Security Reviews:** Treat templates as code and subject them to thorough security reviews to identify and eliminate potential injection points.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Templates:** Restrict access to template files to only necessary users and processes to prevent unauthorized modification.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitable vulnerabilities within Sourcery's external dependencies (e.g., Stencil, Yams, Commander). These vulnerabilities can be indirectly leveraged through Sourcery's execution environment, potentially leading to system compromise.
*   **Sourcery Contribution:** Sourcery depends on third-party libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies become part of the attack surface *of using Sourcery*. If an attacker can influence Sourcery's execution, they might exploit these dependency vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** A dependency used by Sourcery contains a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker, by controlling input to Sourcery or manipulating the environment where Sourcery runs, triggers the vulnerable code path in the dependency *via* Sourcery's process, achieving remote code execution on the development machine.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution on the system running Sourcery.
    *   Potential Denial of Service against the development process.
    *   Information Disclosure from the development environment.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Maintain Up-to-date Dependencies:** Regularly update Sourcery and *all* its dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Automated Dependency Scanning:** Implement automated dependency scanning tools in the development pipeline to continuously monitor and alert on known vulnerabilities in Sourcery's dependencies.
    *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA) Integration:** Utilize SCA tools to gain comprehensive visibility into Sourcery's dependency tree and proactively manage risks.
    *   **Dependency Version Pinning and Testing:** Pin dependency versions in project configuration to ensure build consistency and allow for thorough testing of dependency updates before wider adoption.

## Attack Surface: [Sourcery Toolchain Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/sourcery_toolchain_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities residing directly within Sourcery's core code, including its parsing, code generation, or processing logic. Exploiting these vulnerabilities could lead to unpredictable behavior, denial of service, or potentially code execution within the Sourcery process itself.
*   **Sourcery Contribution:** As a software tool, Sourcery's own codebase can contain vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are a direct attack surface when using Sourcery, as malicious inputs or crafted scenarios could trigger them during code generation.
*   **Example:** A specially crafted Swift file or template input, when processed by Sourcery, triggers a buffer overflow or another memory corruption vulnerability in Sourcery's parsing engine. This could lead to a crash of the Sourcery process, or in a more severe scenario, potentially arbitrary code execution within the Sourcery execution context.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (crashing Sourcery and disrupting development).
    *   Unexpected or incorrect code generation, potentially introducing subtle application vulnerabilities.
    *   In extreme cases, potential Remote Code Execution within the Sourcery process.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Utilize Official and Verified Releases:** Download and use Sourcery exclusively from official and trusted sources, such as GitHub releases or reputable package managers (e.g., Homebrew).
    *   **Proactive Security Monitoring:** Regularly monitor for security advisories and vulnerability reports related to Sourcery from the maintainers and the wider security community.
    *   **Responsible Vulnerability Reporting:** If you suspect or discover a vulnerability in Sourcery itself, follow responsible disclosure practices and report it to the Sourcery maintainers.
    *   **Limited Customization and Review:** If customizing or extending Sourcery's functionality, ensure rigorous code review and security testing of any custom code introduced.

## Attack Surface: [Generated Code Vulnerabilities (Indirectly Facilitated by Sourcery)](./attack_surfaces/generated_code_vulnerabilities__indirectly_facilitated_by_sourcery_.md)

*   **Description:** Introduction of vulnerabilities into the final application due to insecure code generated by Sourcery templates. While not a vulnerability *in* Sourcery itself, Sourcery facilitates the generation of this potentially vulnerable code through poorly designed templates.
*   **Sourcery Contribution:** Sourcery's purpose is code generation based on templates. If templates are designed without security considerations, Sourcery will faithfully generate insecure code, directly contributing to the application's attack surface.
*   **Example:** A Sourcery template designed to generate database interaction code directly concatenates user input into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization. When Sourcery generates code from this template, it introduces SQL injection vulnerabilities into the application.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Introduction of critical vulnerabilities into the final application (e.g., SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting, Path Traversal).
    *   Potential compromise of application data, functionality, and users due to vulnerabilities in generated code.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Security-First Template Design:** Design Sourcery templates with security as a paramount concern. Embed secure coding practices directly into templates to ensure generated code is inherently secure (e.g., input validation, output encoding, parameterized queries, secure API usage).
    *   **Rigorous Template Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough security-focused code reviews of *all* Sourcery templates to identify and remediate any potential for generating vulnerable code.
    *   **Static Analysis of Generated Code:** Implement static analysis tools to automatically scan the *generated* code for common vulnerability patterns. Treat generated code with the same security scrutiny as manually written code.
    *   **Security Training for Template Developers:** Ensure developers responsible for creating and maintaining Sourcery templates receive comprehensive security training, specifically focusing on secure coding practices within the context of code generation and the potential security implications of template design choices.
