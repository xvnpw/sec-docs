## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Configuration Manipulation for Sourcery Application

This document provides a deep analysis of the "Configuration Manipulation" attack tree path for an application utilizing Sourcery (https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/sourcery). This analysis aims to provide the development team with a comprehensive understanding of the attack vector, its potential impact, and actionable insights for mitigation.

### 1. Define Objective of Deep Analysis

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the "Configuration Manipulation" attack path within the context of a Sourcery-powered application. This includes:

*   **Understanding the Attack Vector:**  Gaining a detailed understanding of how an attacker could manipulate Sourcery's configuration to compromise the application.
*   **Assessing Potential Impact:**  Evaluating the range of potential damages and consequences resulting from successful configuration manipulation.
*   **Identifying Vulnerabilities:**  Pinpointing potential weaknesses in the application's design, implementation, or deployment that could facilitate this attack.
*   **Developing Mitigation Strategies:**  Formulating concrete and actionable recommendations to prevent, detect, and respond to configuration manipulation attempts.
*   **Raising Awareness:**  Educating the development team about the risks associated with insecure configuration management and promoting secure development practices.

Ultimately, the objective is to strengthen the security posture of the Sourcery-based application by proactively addressing the risks associated with configuration manipulation.

### 2. Scope of Analysis

This analysis focuses specifically on the "Configuration Manipulation" attack path as defined in the provided attack tree. The scope encompasses:

*   **Sourcery Configuration Files:**  Specifically targeting the configuration files used by Sourcery (e.g., `.sourcery.yml`, `.sourcery.yaml`) and their role in application behavior.

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Configuration Manipulation

**Attack Vector Name:** Configuration Manipulation

*   **Goal:** Compromise application by manipulating Sourcery configuration files.

    *   **Deep Dive:** The attacker's ultimate goal is to gain unauthorized control over the application. Manipulating Sourcery's configuration is seen as a means to achieve this broader objective. By altering how Sourcery operates, the attacker aims to inject malicious logic, disrupt functionality, or gain access to sensitive data processed by the application. This attack path is attractive because configuration files are often perceived as less critical than application code itself, potentially leading to weaker security controls.

*   **Description:** Attacker aims to modify Sourcery's configuration to alter its behavior maliciously.

    *   **Deep Dive:** Sourcery's behavior is heavily driven by its configuration files (typically `.sourcery.yml` or `.sourcery.yaml`). These files dictate:
        *   **Template Paths:**  Where Sourcery looks for code generation templates.
        *   **Output Paths:**  Where generated code is written.
        *   **Stencil Templates:**  The specific templates used for code generation.
        *   **Configuration Options:**  Various settings that control Sourcery's parsing, generation, and processing logic.
        By modifying these settings, an attacker can effectively reprogram Sourcery to perform actions unintended by the application developers. This could range from subtle changes to complete hijacking of the code generation process.

*   **Actions:** Direct Configuration Modification.

    *   **Deep Dive:**  "Direct Configuration Modification" implies the attacker gains access to the file system where the Sourcery configuration files are stored and directly alters their content. This could be achieved through various means:
        *   **Compromised Server/System:** If the server or system hosting the application (and its configuration files) is compromised through other vulnerabilities (e.g., OS vulnerabilities, web server exploits, insecure SSH access), the attacker can directly access and modify files.
        *   **Insider Threat:** A malicious insider with legitimate access to the system could intentionally modify the configuration files.
        *   **Misconfigured Permissions:**  If file system permissions are improperly configured, allowing unauthorized users or processes to write to the configuration files, an attacker could exploit this misconfiguration.
        *   **Supply Chain Attack (Less likely but possible):** In a complex supply chain, if a compromised tool or process is used to deploy or manage the application, it *could* potentially modify configuration files during deployment.

*   **Impact:** Control over Sourcery's behavior, potentially leading to malicious code generation, file overwriting, or application disruption.

    *   **Deep Dive:** The impact of configuration manipulation can be severe and multifaceted:
        *   **Malicious Code Generation:**  The attacker could modify template paths to point to malicious templates under their control. When Sourcery runs, it would use these malicious templates to generate code, effectively injecting malware into the application's codebase. This could lead to:
            *   **Backdoors:**  Creating hidden entry points for persistent access.
            *   **Data Exfiltration:**  Stealing sensitive data processed by the application.
            *   **Privilege Escalation:**  Gaining higher levels of access within the application or system.
        *   **File Overwriting:**  By manipulating output paths in the configuration, an attacker could redirect Sourcery to overwrite critical application files with malicious content. This could lead to:
            *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Disrupting application functionality by overwriting essential files.
            *   **Code Tampering:**  Modifying existing application code to introduce vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.
        *   **Application Disruption:**  Even without injecting malicious code, simply altering configuration settings can disrupt the intended behavior of Sourcery and the application. This could lead to:
            *   **Incorrect Code Generation:**  Causing the application to malfunction due to improperly generated code.
            *   **Build Failures:**  Preventing the application from being built or deployed correctly.
            *   **Unexpected Behavior:**  Leading to unpredictable and potentially harmful application behavior.

*   **Actionable Insights:** Secure Configuration Storage, Integrity Checks, Principle of Least Privilege.

    *   **Deep Dive:** These actionable insights provide a starting point for mitigation:
        *   **Secure Configuration Storage:**
            *   **Protected Directory:** Store configuration files in a directory with restricted access permissions, ensuring only authorized users and processes can read and write to them.
            *   **Encryption at Rest (Optional but Recommended for Sensitive Configurations):** If the configuration files contain sensitive information (e.g., API keys, database credentials - though ideally these should be externalized and not in Sourcery config), consider encrypting them at rest.
        *   **Integrity Checks:**
            *   **Hashing/Digital Signatures:** Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity of configuration files. This could involve:
                *   Generating a hash (e.g., SHA-256) of the configuration file and storing it securely. Regularly compare the current hash with the stored hash to detect unauthorized modifications.
                *   Digitally signing the configuration file to ensure authenticity and integrity.
            *   **Version Control:** Store configuration files in version control (e.g., Git) to track changes, audit modifications, and easily revert to previous versions if necessary.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**
            *   **Restrict Access:**  Grant only the necessary permissions to users and processes that require access to configuration files. Avoid granting broad write access to the configuration directory.
            *   **Separate User Accounts:**  Run the application and Sourcery processes under dedicated user accounts with minimal privileges, limiting the potential impact of a compromise.

*   **Likelihood:** Medium (If configuration file access is not properly controlled)

    *   **Justification:** The likelihood is rated as medium because while direct access to configuration files might not be trivial in all environments, it's a plausible scenario if basic security practices are not followed.  Factors increasing likelihood:
        *   **Shared Hosting Environments:**  Less isolation between applications can increase the risk of cross-application attacks.
        *   **Default Permissions:**  Overly permissive default file system permissions.
        *   **Lack of Monitoring:**  Absence of monitoring for configuration file changes.
        *   **Human Error:**  Accidental misconfiguration of permissions or access controls.

*   **Impact:** Medium to High

    *   **Justification:** The impact is rated as medium to high because, as detailed above, successful configuration manipulation can lead to significant consequences, ranging from application disruption to malicious code injection and data breaches. The severity depends on the specific application, the sensitivity of the data it processes, and the attacker's objectives. In scenarios where Sourcery is used to generate critical parts of the application or handle sensitive data, the impact can easily escalate to "High."

*   **Effort:** Low

    *   **Justification:** The effort is considered low because once an attacker gains access to the system, modifying a YAML or YAML configuration file is relatively straightforward. It requires basic text editing skills and a rudimentary understanding of Sourcery's configuration structure.  No complex exploitation techniques are necessarily required after initial access is gained.

*   **Skill Level:** Low (Basic YAML and Sourcery configuration knowledge)

    *   **Justification:**  The skill level required to execute this attack after gaining access is low.  An attacker needs to understand basic YAML syntax and have a general understanding of how Sourcery configuration works.  Detailed knowledge of Sourcery's internals is not required. This makes it accessible to a wider range of attackers.

*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires configuration change tracking and anomaly detection)

    *   **Justification:** Detection is rated as medium because simply monitoring application logs might not directly reveal configuration manipulation. Effective detection requires:
        *   **Configuration Change Tracking:** Implementing systems to monitor and log changes to configuration files. This could involve file integrity monitoring tools (FIM) or version control systems with auditing capabilities.
        *   **Anomaly Detection:**  Establishing baselines for normal configuration and application behavior. Detecting deviations from these baselines after configuration changes could indicate malicious manipulation.
        *   **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**  Aggregating logs from various sources (including configuration change logs) and using SIEM systems to correlate events and identify suspicious patterns.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Periodically reviewing configuration settings and access controls to identify and rectify potential vulnerabilities.
