## Mitigation Strategy: [Rigorous Template Review and Auditing](./mitigation_strategies/rigorous_template_review_and_auditing.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Establish a mandatory code review process specifically for all **Sourcery templates (stencils)** before they are used in development or production.
    2.  Designate experienced developers with security awareness or involve a dedicated security team in these reviews.
    3.  Reviews should focus on:
        *   Understanding the **template's logic** and how it generates code using **Sourcery**.
        *   Identifying any potential vulnerabilities within the **template's logic** itself that **Sourcery** might execute.
        *   Analyzing how the **template** handles input data and if it could lead to injection vulnerabilities in the code **Sourcery** generates.
        *   Ensuring the code **Sourcery** generates adheres to secure coding practices and project security guidelines, as dictated by the **template**.
    4.  Document the review process, including who reviewed the **template**, review findings, and approval status for each **Sourcery template**.
    5.  Use checklists or security guidelines tailored for **Sourcery template** reviews to ensure consistency and thoroughness.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Template Injection (High Severity):** Malicious or flawed **Sourcery templates** could introduce vulnerabilities directly into the code generation process, leading to arbitrary code execution or data breaches in applications using the **Sourcery-generated** code.
    *   **Code Injection in Generated Code (High Severity):** **Sourcery templates** might generate code susceptible to injection attacks (SQL Injection, Command Injection, etc.) if the **template logic** doesn't properly sanitize or validate inputs used in **Sourcery's** code generation.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Generated Code (Medium Severity):** **Sourcery templates** might generate code vulnerable to XSS if they don't correctly handle output encoding or sanitization in the **Sourcery-generated** front-end code.
    *   **Logic Errors in Generated Code (Medium Severity):** Flaws in **Sourcery template logic** can lead to functional vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior in the **Sourcery-generated** application, potentially exploitable by attackers.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Template Injection:** Significantly reduces risk by proactively identifying and preventing malicious or vulnerable **Sourcery templates** from being used.
    *   **Code Injection in Generated Code:** Significantly reduces risk by ensuring **Sourcery templates** are designed to generate secure code and handle inputs safely.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Generated Code:** Moderately reduces risk by catching potential XSS vulnerabilities early in the development process of **Sourcery templates**.
    *   **Logic Errors in Generated Code:** Moderately reduces risk by identifying and correcting flawed **Sourcery template logic** before it impacts the application.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Code reviews are mandatory for manually written code, but **Sourcery template** reviews are not formally integrated into the standard code review process.

    2.  Treat **Sourcery template** modifications as code changes and enforce standard version control practices (branching, pull requests, commit messages).
    3.  Implement a formal change management process for **Sourcery template** updates, requiring approvals from designated personnel (e.g., team lead, security representative) before changes are merged or deployed.
    4.  Track all **Sourcery template** changes, including who made the changes, when, and why.
    5.  Utilize version tagging or release management practices to manage different versions of **Sourcery templates** and ensure traceability.
