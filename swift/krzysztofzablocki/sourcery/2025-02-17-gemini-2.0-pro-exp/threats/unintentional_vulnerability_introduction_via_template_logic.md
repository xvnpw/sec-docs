Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Unintentional Vulnerability Introduction via Template Logic" threat, tailored for a development team using Sourcery:

# Deep Analysis: Unintentional Vulnerability Introduction via Template Logic

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to understand the nuances of how vulnerabilities can be introduced *indirectly* through Sourcery templates, and to develop concrete, actionable strategies to prevent, detect, and mitigate these vulnerabilities.  We aim to move beyond general recommendations and provide specific examples and testing approaches relevant to Sourcery.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on vulnerabilities introduced by errors in the logic of Sourcery templates (`.stencil` or `.swifttemplate` files).  It covers:

*   **Types of vulnerabilities:**  We'll examine how template logic errors can lead to common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), insecure deserialization, and others.
*   **Template logic constructs:** We'll analyze how loops, conditionals, filters, and custom tags within templates can be misused to create vulnerabilities.
*   **Generated code analysis:**  We'll emphasize the importance of analyzing the *output* of Sourcery, not just the templates themselves.
*   **Testing strategies:** We'll detail specific testing methods applicable to both the templates and the generated code.
* **Sourcery Version:** We assume a reasonably up-to-date version of Sourcery, but the principles apply broadly. We are not focusing on specific, known Sourcery bugs, but rather on the *misuse* of Sourcery.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Vulnerabilities in the Sourcery tool itself (e.g., a hypothetical vulnerability in Sourcery's parsing engine).
*   Vulnerabilities introduced by manually written code (code *not* generated by Sourcery).
*   General secure coding practices unrelated to code generation.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will follow a structured approach:

1.  **Vulnerability Categorization:**  We'll categorize common vulnerability types that can be introduced via template logic errors.
2.  **Template Logic Analysis:** We'll examine specific examples of how template logic constructs (loops, conditionals, filters) can be misused.
3.  **Generated Code Examples:**  We'll provide illustrative examples of vulnerable code generated from flawed templates.
4.  **Testing Strategy Breakdown:** We'll detail specific testing methods, including unit testing of templates, static analysis of generated code, and dynamic analysis (penetration testing).
5.  **Mitigation and Prevention:** We'll reinforce the mitigation strategies from the threat model, providing more concrete guidance.

## 4. Deep Analysis

### 4.1 Vulnerability Categorization

Template logic errors can lead to a variety of vulnerabilities.  Here are some key categories:

*   **Injection Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** If a template generates SQL queries and improperly handles user-provided input, it can lead to SQL injection.
    *   **Command Injection:**  Similar to SQL injection, but involving operating system commands.
    *   **NoSQL Injection:**  Relevant if the generated code interacts with NoSQL databases.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** If a template generates HTML or JavaScript and doesn't properly encode user-provided data, it can lead to XSS.  This is particularly relevant if Sourcery is used to generate UI code.
*   **Insecure Deserialization:** If a template generates code that deserializes data from untrusted sources without proper validation, it can lead to insecure deserialization vulnerabilities.
*   **Path Traversal:** If a template generates code that handles file paths, improper handling of user input can lead to path traversal vulnerabilities.
*   **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** A template might inadvertently expose sensitive information (e.g., API keys, database credentials) if it's not carefully designed.
*   **Logic Errors Leading to Security Flaws:**  Beyond specific vulnerability classes, general logic errors in templates can lead to unexpected behavior and security weaknesses.  For example, a template might generate code with incorrect authorization checks.

### 4.2 Template Logic Analysis (with Examples)

Let's examine how specific template constructs can be misused:

**Example 1: SQL Injection via a Loop**

```stencil
// BAD TEMPLATE (Vulnerable)
{% for user in users %}
    "INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('{{ user.name }}', '{{ user.email }}');"
{% endfor %}
```

If `user.name` or `user.email` contains malicious SQL code (e.g., `'; DROP TABLE users; --`), the generated SQL will be vulnerable.

**Example 2: XSS via a Filter (or Lack Thereof)**

```stencil
// BAD TEMPLATE (Vulnerable)
<div>
    {{ user.comment }}
</div>
```

If `user.comment` contains malicious JavaScript (e.g., `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`), it will be executed in the user's browser.  The correct approach would be to use an auto-escaping filter or a dedicated HTML encoding function.

```stencil
// GOOD TEMPLATE (Safer)
<div>
    {{ user.comment | escape }}
</div>
```
Or, even better, use a context-aware escaping filter if available.

**Example 3: Insecure Deserialization (Conceptual)**

Imagine a template that generates code to deserialize data from a JSON payload:

```stencil
// BAD TEMPLATE (Conceptual - Vulnerable)
let decodedData = try JSONDecoder().decode({{ modelName }}.self, from: jsonData)
```

If `jsonData` comes from an untrusted source and `{{ modelName }}.self` can be manipulated, an attacker might be able to trigger the deserialization of arbitrary objects, potentially leading to code execution.

**Example 4: Conditional Logic Leading to Authorization Bypass**

```stencil
// BAD TEMPLATE (Vulnerable)
{% if user.isAdmin %}
    // Code to grant administrative access
{% else %}
    // Code to grant regular user access
    // BUT:  What if user.isAdmin is not properly defined or checked?
{% endif %}
```

If the logic to determine `user.isAdmin` is flawed, or if the template doesn't handle the case where `user.isAdmin` is undefined, it could lead to an authorization bypass.

### 4.3 Generated Code Examples (Illustrative)

From the SQL injection example above, the generated code might look like this (if `user.name` is `'Robert'); DROP TABLE users; --'`):

```sql
INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('Robert'); DROP TABLE users; --', 'user@example.com');
```

This clearly demonstrates the SQL injection vulnerability.

From the XSS example, the generated HTML might look like this (if `user.comment` is `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`):

```html
<div>
    <script>alert('XSS')</script>
</div>
```

This demonstrates the XSS vulnerability.

### 4.4 Testing Strategy Breakdown

Testing is crucial for identifying vulnerabilities introduced by template logic.  We need a multi-layered approach:

*   **Unit Testing of Templates:**
    *   **Goal:**  Test the template logic *itself*, independent of the final generated code.
    *   **Method:**  Use a testing framework (like XCTest in Swift) to render the template with various inputs and assert the *expected output string*.  This is *not* about testing the generated code's functionality, but rather the template's correctness.
    *   **Example:**
        ```swift
        func testUserInsertionTemplate() {
            let template = ... // Load the template
            let context = ["users": [
                ["name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com"],
                ["name": "Bob", "email": "bob@example.com"],
                ["name": "'; DROP TABLE users; --", "email": "evil@example.com"] // Malicious input
            ]]
            let rendered = try! template.render(context)
            // Assert that the rendered output *contains* the malicious input,
            // but *doesn't* execute it.  This is a tricky assertion,
            // and might require careful string manipulation or even parsing
            // the generated SQL (if possible) to ensure it's not valid.
            XCTAssertTrue(rendered.contains("'; DROP TABLE users; --"))
            // ... further assertions to check for proper escaping/quoting ...
        }
        ```
    *   **Limitations:** Unit testing templates can be challenging, especially for complex logic.  It's difficult to fully simulate the runtime environment where the generated code will execute.

*   **Static Analysis of Generated Code:**
    *   **Goal:**  Identify potential vulnerabilities in the *generated code* using automated tools.
    *   **Method:**  Use static analysis tools (like SwiftLint, SonarQube, or commercial tools) to scan the generated code for common security issues (SQL injection, XSS, etc.).
    *   **Integration:**  Integrate static analysis into your build process (e.g., as a pre-commit hook or CI/CD step).  This ensures that generated code is automatically checked for vulnerabilities.
    *   **Configuration:**  Configure the static analysis tool to be aware of the context of the generated code.  For example, you might need to tell the tool that certain variables come from user input.
    *   **Limitations:** Static analysis can produce false positives and may not catch all vulnerabilities, especially those related to complex logic or data flow.

*   **Dynamic Analysis (Penetration Testing):**
    *   **Goal:**  Test the *running application* (including the generated code) for vulnerabilities by simulating real-world attacks.
    *   **Method:**  Perform penetration testing, either manually or using automated tools (like OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite).  Focus on areas of the application where generated code handles user input or interacts with external systems.
    *   **Input Fuzzing:**  Use fuzzing techniques to provide unexpected or malicious input to the application and observe its behavior.
    *   **Limitations:** Penetration testing is typically performed later in the development lifecycle and can be time-consuming.

*   **Code Review of Templates:**
    *   **Goal:** Manually inspect the template for potential security issues.
    *   **Method:** Conduct thorough code reviews of all Sourcery templates, paying close attention to how user input is handled and how the template logic might be misused.
    *   **Checklist:** Use a checklist of common template security issues (e.g., lack of escaping, improper input validation, potential for injection).
    *   **Pair Programming:** Consider using pair programming when developing complex templates to improve code quality and catch errors early.

### 4.5 Mitigation and Prevention

The original threat model provided good mitigation strategies. Here's a more detailed breakdown:

*   **Thorough Code Reviews of Templates (Emphasizing Security):**
    *   **Checklist:** Create a specific checklist for Sourcery template reviews, focusing on:
        *   Proper escaping of user input (context-aware escaping is best).
        *   Input validation (e.g., checking data types, lengths, and formats).
        *   Secure handling of file paths and URLs.
        *   Avoidance of hardcoded secrets.
        *   Correct use of loops and conditionals to prevent logic errors.
        *   Use of built-in filters and functions for security-sensitive operations.
    *   **Training:** Ensure developers understand the security implications of template logic.

*   **Extensive Security Testing of the *Generated* Code:** (See section 4.4)

*   **Unit Testing of the Template Logic Itself:** (See section 4.4)

*   **Developer Training on Secure Coding and Secure Sourcery Use:**
    *   **Secure Coding Principles:** Train developers on general secure coding practices (e.g., OWASP Top 10, input validation, output encoding).
    *   **Sourcery-Specific Training:** Provide training on how to use Sourcery securely, including best practices for template design and testing.
    *   **Examples:** Use real-world examples of vulnerable templates and how to fix them.

*   **"Least Privilege" Design for Templates:**
    *   **Minimize Template Scope:** Design templates to be as small and focused as possible.  Avoid creating large, monolithic templates that do too much.
    *   **Limit Template Access:** Restrict access to templates to only the developers who need to modify them.
    *   **Avoid Unnecessary Functionality:** Don't include unnecessary functionality in templates.  The less code a template generates, the less likely it is to contain vulnerabilities.

*   **Well-Defined Coding Style and Conventions for Templates:**
    *   **Consistency:** Establish clear coding style guidelines for templates to improve readability and maintainability.
    *   **Naming Conventions:** Use consistent naming conventions for variables and functions within templates.
    *   **Comments:** Encourage developers to add comments to templates to explain the logic and purpose of the code.

* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    * Although Sourcery itself doesn't directly handle user input, the *generated* code often will. Ensure that the generated code includes robust input validation and sanitization mechanisms. This is a critical defense-in-depth measure.

* **Regular Updates:** Keep Sourcery and its dependencies up-to-date to benefit from any security patches or improvements.
