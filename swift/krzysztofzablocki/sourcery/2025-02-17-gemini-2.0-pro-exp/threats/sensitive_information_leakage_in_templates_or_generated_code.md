# Deep Analysis: Sensitive Information Leakage in Sourcery Templates and Generated Code

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the risks associated with sensitive information leakage when using Sourcery, and to provide actionable guidance to the development team to prevent such leaks.  We aim to move beyond a superficial understanding of the threat and delve into specific scenarios, detection methods, and preventative measures.  This analysis will empower the team to proactively secure their Sourcery implementation.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the following areas:

*   **Sourcery Template Files:**  `.stencil` and `.swifttemplate` files, including any custom template formats used by the team.
*   **Sourcery Configuration Files:**  `.sourcery.yml` and any other configuration files that might influence template processing or output.
*   **Generated Code:**  The Swift code output produced by Sourcery based on the templates and input.
*   **Development Workflow:**  The processes used by the team to create, modify, review, and deploy Sourcery templates and generated code.
* **CI/CD pipeline:** How Sourcery is integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.

This analysis *excludes* general security best practices unrelated to Sourcery (e.g., securing the underlying operating system).  It also excludes vulnerabilities within Sourcery itself, focusing instead on *misuse* of Sourcery that could lead to information leakage.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodologies:

*   **Threat Modeling Review:**  Re-examining the original threat model entry in detail, expanding on potential attack vectors and scenarios.
*   **Code Review (Hypothetical and Actual):**  Analyzing example template code (both hypothetical and, if available, real-world examples from the project) for potential leakage points.
*   **Static Analysis Tooling Investigation:**  Exploring the use of static analysis tools to automatically detect sensitive information in templates and generated code.
*   **Best Practices Research:**  Compiling and adapting security best practices from similar code generation and templating systems.
*   **Scenario-Based Analysis:**  Developing specific scenarios where sensitive information could be leaked and outlining the steps to prevent them.
* **CI/CD Pipeline Integration Analysis:** Reviewing how Sourcery is integrated into the CI/CD pipeline and identifying potential security gaps.

## 4. Deep Analysis of the Threat

### 4.1. Attack Vectors and Scenarios

Here are several specific scenarios illustrating how sensitive information leakage could occur:

*   **Scenario 1: Hardcoded API Key in a Template:**
    *   A developer, while prototyping, hardcodes an API key directly into a `.stencil` template to quickly test functionality.  They forget to remove it before committing the template to the repository.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  An attacker with access to the source code repository (either through a breach or insider threat) gains access to the API key.
    *   **Consequence:**  The attacker can use the API key to access the associated service, potentially exfiltrating data or causing damage.

*   **Scenario 2:  Conditional Logic Exposing Secrets:**
    *   A template uses conditional logic (`{% if ... %}`) to include different code blocks based on build configurations (e.g., "debug" vs. "release").  The "debug" block contains sensitive information (e.g., a database connection string for a staging environment).  A misconfiguration in the build process or a developer error results in the "debug" block being included in a release build.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  An attacker reverse-engineering the released application discovers the database connection string.
    *   **Consequence:**  The attacker gains access to the staging database.

*   **Scenario 3:  Template Includes Sensitive Configuration Data:**
    *   A template uses the `include` tag to incorporate another file.  This included file, intended for internal use, contains sensitive configuration data (e.g., server addresses, usernames).
    *   **Attack Vector:**  An attacker gains access to the repository and discovers the included file.
    *   **Consequence:**  The attacker obtains sensitive configuration information, potentially enabling further attacks.

*   **Scenario 4:  Generated Code Contains Commented-Out Secrets:**
    *   A developer temporarily comments out a line of code in a template that contains a secret, intending to re-enable it later.  They forget to remove the commented-out line.  Sourcery generates code that includes the commented-out secret.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  An attacker examining the generated code (either in the repository or by reverse-engineering the application) finds the commented-out secret.
    *   **Consequence:**  The attacker obtains the secret.

*   **Scenario 5:  .sourcery.yml Misconfiguration:**
    *   The `.sourcery.yml` file, which configures Sourcery, accidentally includes a secret value (e.g., as part of an `args` setting).
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker with access to the repository can read the `.sourcery.yml` file.
    *   **Consequence:** The attacker obtains the secret.

* **Scenario 6: CI/CD Pipeline Leakage:**
    * Sourcery is used in the CI/CD pipeline to generate code. Environment variables containing secrets are used during this process, but are not properly masked or redacted in the pipeline logs.
    * **Attack Vector:** An attacker with access to the CI/CD pipeline logs can view the secrets.
    * **Consequence:** The attacker obtains the secrets.

### 4.2. Detection Methods

*   **Manual Code Review:**  Thoroughly review all template files (`.stencil`, `.swifttemplate`), configuration files (`.sourcery.yml`), and a representative sample of generated code.  Look for:
    *   Hardcoded strings that resemble API keys, passwords, or other secrets.
    *   Conditional logic that might expose secrets based on build configurations.
    *   `include` statements that might reference files containing sensitive data.
    *   Commented-out code containing secrets.

*   **Automated Static Analysis:**  Employ static analysis tools designed to detect secrets in code.  Examples include:
    *   **git-secrets:**  Prevents committing files that contain secrets.  Can be integrated into pre-commit hooks.
    *   **TruffleHog:**  Searches through git repositories for high entropy strings and secrets, digging deep into commit history.
    *   **Gitleaks:**  Another popular tool for auditing git repositories for secrets.
    *   **GitHub Advanced Security (Secret Scanning):** If using GitHub, enable secret scanning to automatically detect known secret formats.
    * **Custom Scripts:** Develop custom scripts using regular expressions to search for patterns that match known secret formats specific to the project.

*   **Regular Expression Search:** Use `grep` or similar tools to search for patterns that might indicate secrets (e.g., long alphanumeric strings, base64 encoded data).  This is a more manual approach but can be useful for identifying custom secret formats.

*   **Review of Generated Code:**  Don't just review the templates; also review the *output* of Sourcery.  Secrets might be introduced during the code generation process, even if they aren't directly present in the templates.

* **CI/CD Pipeline Log Inspection:** Regularly review CI/CD pipeline logs to ensure that secrets are not being printed or exposed.

### 4.3. Preventative Measures (Mitigation Strategies)

*   **Never Store Secrets in Templates or Configuration:**  This is the most crucial rule.  Secrets should *never* be hardcoded in `.stencil`, `.swifttemplate`, `.sourcery.yml`, or any other file within the repository.

*   **Use Environment Variables:**  Store secrets in environment variables.  Sourcery can access environment variables within templates using the `env` variable (e.g., `{{ env.MY_API_KEY }}`).  This keeps secrets out of the codebase.

*   **Use a Secure Configuration Management System:**  For more complex secret management, consider using a dedicated system like:
    *   **HashiCorp Vault:**  A robust solution for managing secrets and sensitive data.
    *   **AWS Secrets Manager:**  A managed service for storing and retrieving secrets in AWS.
    *   **Azure Key Vault:**  A similar service for Azure.
    *   **Google Cloud Secret Manager:**  A similar service for Google Cloud.
    * **.env files (with caution):** For local development, `.env` files can be used, but *never* commit them to the repository.  Ensure they are included in `.gitignore`.

*   **Template Design Best Practices:**
    *   **Minimize Logic in Templates:**  Keep templates as simple as possible.  Complex logic increases the risk of accidental exposure.
    *   **Use `include` Carefully:**  Avoid using `include` to reference files that might contain sensitive data.
    *   **Avoid Commenting Out Secrets:**  Never leave commented-out secrets in templates.

*   **Pre-Commit Hooks:**  Integrate tools like `git-secrets` into pre-commit hooks to prevent accidental commits of files containing secrets.

*   **Code Reviews:**  Mandatory code reviews for all changes to templates and configuration files.  Reviewers should specifically look for potential security issues.

*   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct periodic security audits of the codebase, including templates and generated code.

*   **CI/CD Pipeline Security:**
    *   **Use Secret Management Features:** Utilize the secret management features of your CI/CD platform (e.g., GitHub Actions secrets, GitLab CI/CD variables).
    *   **Mask Secrets in Logs:** Ensure that secrets are masked or redacted in CI/CD pipeline logs.
    *   **Limit Access:** Restrict access to the CI/CD pipeline and its configuration to authorized personnel only.

* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the credentials used by Sourcery in the CI/CD pipeline have the minimum necessary permissions.

### 4.4. Example: Securely Accessing an API Key

**Insecure (DO NOT USE):**

```stencil
// InsecureTemplate.stencil
let apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY" // NEVER DO THIS!
```

**Secure (Using Environment Variables):**

```stencil
// SecureTemplate.stencil
let apiKey = "{{ env.MY_API_KEY }}"
```

**Setting the Environment Variable (Bash):**

```bash
export MY_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key
```

**Setting the Environment Variable (CI/CD):**

Use the secret management features of your CI/CD platform (e.g., GitHub Actions secrets, GitLab CI/CD variables) to securely set the `MY_API_KEY` environment variable.

## 5. Conclusion

Sensitive information leakage in Sourcery templates and generated code is a serious threat that requires careful attention. By following the detection methods and preventative measures outlined in this analysis, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of exposing sensitive data.  Continuous vigilance, regular security audits, and a strong security-conscious culture are essential for maintaining a secure Sourcery implementation. The integration with CI/CD pipeline should be carefully reviewed and secured.
