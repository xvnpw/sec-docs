## Deep Analysis: RCE via Template Injection - Unsanitized Input

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the attack vector "1.1 Exploit Unsanitized Input in Template Variables" within the context of Sourcery-based code generation.  This understanding will enable us to:

*   Identify specific vulnerabilities in the application.
*   Develop effective mitigation strategies.
*   Provide clear guidance to the development team on secure coding practices related to Sourcery.
*   Establish robust testing procedures to prevent future occurrences.
*   Prioritize remediation efforts based on risk.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses *exclusively* on the attack path 1.1 and its sub-paths (1.1.1 to 1.1.4).  We are concerned with how user-supplied input can be manipulated to inject malicious code into Sourcery templates, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).  We will consider:

*   The application's use of Sourcery templates.
*   The specific templating engine used (assumed to be Stencil, as it's common with Sourcery).
*   Input validation and sanitization mechanisms (or lack thereof).
*   Data flow from user input to template rendering.
*   Potential attack payloads and their impact.
*   The application code that uses Sourcery.

We will *not* cover other attack vectors in the broader attack tree (e.g., 1.3, 1.4) in this specific analysis, although the general principles of secure coding will apply.

**Methodology:**

This analysis will employ a combination of the following techniques:

1.  **Static Code Analysis:**  We will manually review the application's source code, focusing on:
    *   Identification of Sourcery template files (`.stencil`, `.swifttemplate`, etc.).
    *   Identification of variables used within these templates.
    *   Tracing the data flow of user input to these variables.
    *   Examination of any input validation or sanitization logic.
    *   Use of automated static analysis tools (e.g., linters, security scanners) to identify potential vulnerabilities.

2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Fuzzing/Penetration Testing):**  We will use dynamic testing techniques to:
    *   Craft malicious inputs designed to exploit potential template injection vulnerabilities.
    *   Submit these inputs to the application through various input vectors (web forms, API endpoints, etc.).
    *   Monitor the application's behavior for signs of successful code execution (e.g., unexpected output, system commands being executed).
    *   Use debugging tools to trace the execution flow and identify the precise point of vulnerability.

3.  **Threat Modeling:** We will consider the attacker's perspective:
    *   What are the likely entry points for malicious input?
    *   What are the potential impacts of successful RCE?
    *   What are the attacker's motivations and capabilities?

4.  **Documentation Review:** We will review any existing documentation related to:
    *   The application's architecture.
    *   The use of Sourcery.
    *   Security policies and guidelines.

### 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.1

**1.1 Exploit Unsanitized Input in Template Variables [CRITICAL]**

This is the core vulnerability.  The attacker's goal is to inject code into a template variable that will be executed when the template is rendered.

**High-Risk Path (1.1.1 -> 1.1.2 -> 1.1.3 -> 1.1.4):**

*   **1.1.1 Identify Template Variables:**

    *   **Analysis:** This is a reconnaissance step.  The attacker needs to understand *how* the application uses Sourcery.  Key questions:
        *   **Where are the templates located?**  Are they in a standard directory (e.g., `Templates/`), or are they scattered throughout the project?
        *   **What naming conventions are used?**  This can help identify templates quickly.
        *   **What variables are used within the templates?**  The attacker will look for patterns like `{{ variableName }}`, `{% if variableName %}`, etc.  They'll pay close attention to variables that seem likely to come from user input (e.g., `user.name`, `post.title`, `comment.text`).
        *   **What templating engine is used?**  While Sourcery itself is a code generator, it often uses templating engines like Stencil or Swift's built-in string interpolation.  The attacker needs to know the syntax of the templating engine to craft effective payloads.
        *   **Are there any custom filters or tags?**  Sourcery allows for custom filters and tags, which could introduce additional vulnerabilities or provide ways to bypass sanitization.
        *   **How is Sourcery integrated into the build process?** Understanding how Sourcery is invoked (e.g., via a build script, a pre-commit hook) can help the attacker understand when templates are rendered and how changes might be detected.

    *   **Developer Guidance:**
        *   **Document template usage clearly.**  Maintain a list of all templates, the variables they use, and the source of those variables.
        *   **Use a consistent naming convention for templates and variables.**
        *   **Limit the scope of variables.**  Avoid passing large objects or entire data structures to templates.  Only pass the specific data needed.
        *   **Consider using a "view model" pattern.**  Create intermediate objects that contain only the data needed for the template, rather than passing raw data models.

*   **1.1.2 Craft Malicious Input:**

    *   **Analysis:** This is where the attacker creates the payload.  The payload's goal is to execute arbitrary code on the server.  The specific payload depends heavily on the templating engine.
        *   **Stencil:** Stencil is a popular choice with Sourcery.  It's relatively safe by default, but it *can* be vulnerable if certain features are enabled or if input is not sanitized.  Examples:
            *   `{{ system("id") }}` - If the `system` function is exposed (which it shouldn't be!), this would execute the `id` command.
            *   `{{ environment.PATH }}` - This might reveal sensitive environment variables.
            *   More complex payloads might involve exploiting custom filters or tags, or using Swift code within Stencil's `{% ... %}` blocks (if enabled).
        *   **Swift String Interpolation:** If Sourcery is using Swift's built-in string interpolation, the attacker might try to inject code directly into the string.  This is *highly* dangerous and should be avoided.  Example:
            *   If the template uses `"Hello, \(userName)!"`, and `userName` is taken directly from user input, an attacker could provide input like `userName = "World!\\(system(\"id\"))"`.

    *   **Developer Guidance:**
        *   **Never use raw string interpolation with user input.** This is a fundamental security principle.
        *   **Assume Stencil (or any templating engine) is potentially vulnerable.**  Even if it's designed to be safe, there might be edge cases or misconfigurations.
        *   **Sanitize all user input before passing it to a template.**  This is the most important defense.  Use a robust sanitization library that is specifically designed for the templating engine you are using.
        *   **Encode output appropriately.**  Even if input is sanitized, it's still good practice to encode the output to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.  Stencil provides built-in escaping filters (e.g., `{{ variable|escape }}`).
        *   **Consider using a Content Security Policy (CSP).**  CSP can help mitigate the impact of XSS vulnerabilities, even if template injection is successful.

*   **1.1.3 Deliver Malicious Input [CRITICAL]:**

    *   **Analysis:** The attacker needs to find a way to get their crafted input into the application's data flow.  This is highly application-specific.  Common attack vectors include:
        *   **Web Forms:**  Any form field that is not properly validated is a potential target.
        *   **API Endpoints:**  REST APIs, GraphQL APIs, etc., can all be vulnerable if they accept user input without sanitization.
        *   **URL Parameters:**  Data passed in the URL query string can be manipulated.
        *   **HTTP Headers:**  Some applications might use custom HTTP headers that are vulnerable.
        *   **Cookies:**  If cookie values are used in templates without sanitization, they can be exploited.
        *   **Database Input:**  If data stored in a database is not properly sanitized *before* being stored, it can lead to stored XSS or template injection vulnerabilities.
        *   **File Uploads:**  If the application allows users to upload files, and the contents of those files are used in templates, this is a high-risk vector.

    *   **Developer Guidance:**
        *   **Validate all input, on the server-side.**  Client-side validation is easily bypassed.
        *   **Use a whitelist approach to validation.**  Define exactly what characters and patterns are allowed, rather than trying to blacklist malicious input.
        *   **Validate input at the point of entry.**  Don't rely on validation happening later in the data flow.
        *   **Use a consistent validation strategy throughout the application.**
        *   **Log all validation failures.**  This can help detect and respond to attacks.
        *   **Consider using a web application firewall (WAF).**  A WAF can help block common attack patterns.

*   **1.1.4 Trigger Template Rendering:**

    *   **Analysis:**  The final step is to trigger the application to render the template with the malicious input.  This often happens automatically as part of the application's normal workflow.  For example:
        *   Viewing a user profile page.
        *   Displaying a list of comments.
        *   Generating a report.
        *   Sending an email.

    *   **Developer Guidance:**
        *   **Be aware of all the places where templates are rendered.**
        *   **Ensure that all data passed to templates is properly sanitized, even if it comes from a seemingly trusted source (e.g., the database).**
        *   **Regularly review and test the template rendering process.**

### 3. Mitigation Strategies (Summary)

The most effective mitigation strategies are:

1.  **Input Sanitization:**  This is the *primary* defense.  Use a robust sanitization library that is specifically designed for the templating engine you are using (e.g., Stencil).  Sanitize *all* user input before passing it to a template.
2.  **Output Encoding:**  Encode the output of the template to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.  Use the built-in escaping filters provided by the templating engine.
3.  **Secure Configuration:**  Ensure that the templating engine is configured securely.  Disable any features that are not needed, and avoid exposing dangerous functions (like `system`).
4.  **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Run the application with the minimum necessary privileges.  This will limit the damage that an attacker can do if they are successful in achieving RCE.
5.  **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
6.  **Dependency Management:** Keep Sourcery and any related libraries (like Stencil) up to date.  Security vulnerabilities are often patched in newer versions.
7. **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Use WAF as additional layer of defense.

### 4. Conclusion

The attack path "1.1 Exploit Unsanitized Input in Template Variables" represents a critical vulnerability that can lead to Remote Code Execution. By understanding the steps involved in this attack, and by implementing the mitigation strategies outlined above, developers can significantly reduce the risk of this type of attack.  The key takeaway is to **never trust user input** and to **always sanitize and encode data** before using it in templates. Continuous monitoring, testing, and updates are crucial for maintaining a secure application.
