# Threat Model Analysis for krzysztofzablocki/sourcery

## Threat: [Malicious Template Injection](./threats/malicious_template_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Template Injection

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the repository containing Sourcery templates and modifies a template to include malicious code. The attacker injects code that performs actions like exfiltrating data, installing backdoors, or modifying application behavior.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the application, leading to data breaches, system compromise, or other severe security incidents. Application integrity and confidentiality are compromised.
    *   **Affected Sourcery Component:** `.stencil` or `.swifttemplate` files (the template files themselves). The `Sourcery.parseTemplates` function and related parsing logic are directly affected.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access controls and multi-factor authentication for the template repository.
        *   Mandatory code reviews (with a security focus) for *all* template changes.
        *   Regular security audits of the repository and access controls.
        *   Consider using a separate, highly secured repository for templates.
        *   Implement code signing for templates (if feasible).
        *   Vulnerability scanning and dependency management for any libraries used *within* the templates.
        *   Template linting to detect common security issues.

## Threat: [Unintentional Vulnerability Introduction via Template Logic](./threats/unintentional_vulnerability_introduction_via_template_logic.md)

*   **Threat:** Unintentional Vulnerability Introduction via Template Logic

    *   **Description:** A developer makes an error in a Sourcery template's logic, leading to the generation of insecure code. This could result in vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, or insecure deserialization, depending on the generated code's purpose.
    *   **Impact:** The generated code contains exploitable vulnerabilities, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, or other security compromises.
    *   **Affected Sourcery Component:** `.stencil` or `.swifttemplate` files (the template files). The specific logic within the template (loops, conditionals, filters) is the source. `Sourcery.generate` is directly affected.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thorough code reviews of templates, emphasizing security.
        *   Extensive security testing (penetration testing, static analysis) of the *generated* code.
        *   Unit testing of the template logic itself.
        *   Developer training on secure coding and secure Sourcery use.
        *   "Least privilege" design for templates.
        *   Well-defined coding style and conventions for templates.

## Threat: [Sourcery Configuration Tampering](./threats/sourcery_configuration_tampering.md)

*   **Threat:** Sourcery Configuration Tampering

    *   **Description:** An attacker modifies the Sourcery configuration file (`.sourcery.yml`) or the environment in which Sourcery runs to alter code generation. The attacker might change output paths, disable checks, or inject malicious arguments.
    *   **Impact:** Generation of malicious code or disruption of the build process, potentially overwriting existing application code.
    *   **Affected Sourcery Component:** `.sourcery.yml` (the configuration file), and the `Sourcery.run` or equivalent command-line execution. Environment variables used by Sourcery are also targets.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Protect `.sourcery.yml` with the same security as templates (access control, code review).
        *   Secure the CI/CD pipeline and build environment.
        *   Monitor the execution environment for unauthorized changes.
        *   Use a checksum or hash of the configuration file.

## Threat: [Sensitive Information Leakage in Templates or Generated Code](./threats/sensitive_information_leakage_in_templates_or_generated_code.md)

*   **Threat:** Sensitive Information Leakage in Templates or Generated Code

    *   **Description:** A template inadvertently includes sensitive information (API keys, credentials) in the generated code, or the template itself contains secrets that are exposed if the repository is compromised.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, leading to unauthorized access or data breaches.
    *   **Affected Sourcery Component:** `.stencil` or `.swifttemplate` files (the template files), and the generated output files.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Never store secrets in templates or the configuration.
        *   Use environment variables or a secure configuration management system.
        *   Review templates for accidental inclusion of sensitive data.
        *   Use secrets scanning tools.

## Threat: [Sourcery Core Vulnerability (Less Likely, but Possible)](./threats/sourcery_core_vulnerability__less_likely__but_possible_.md)

* **Threat:**  Sourcery Core Vulnerability (Less Likely, but Possible)
    *   **Description:** A vulnerability exists within Sourcery's core code itself (e.g., in the parsing logic, template engine, or command-line interface). An attacker exploits this vulnerability to gain elevated privileges or execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Impact:**  Potentially arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running Sourcery, which could lead to system compromise.
    *   **Affected Sourcery Component:**  The core Sourcery codebase (e.g., `Sourcery.swift`, parsing logic, template engine).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Sourcery updated to the latest version.
        *   Run Sourcery with the least necessary privileges.
        *   Monitor for security advisories related to Sourcery.
        *   Consider running Sourcery in a sandboxed environment.
