# Deep Analysis: Secure Configuration of Sourcery

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of the "Secure Configuration of Sourcery" mitigation strategy in preventing security vulnerabilities related to template injection and overly permissive generated code.  We aim to identify potential weaknesses in the current implementation, propose concrete improvements, and assess the residual risk after implementing these improvements.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on the "Secure Configuration of Sourcery" mitigation strategy as described.  It covers the following aspects:

*   Configuration file (`.sourcery.yml`) analysis.
*   `sources`, `templates`, `output`, and `args` configuration parameters.
*   Validation and sanitization of `args`.
*   Disabling unnecessary features.
*   Threats of template injection and overly permissive generated code.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Vulnerabilities within the Sourcery codebase itself (we assume Sourcery is reasonably secure, but this is out of scope for *this* analysis).
*   Security of the templates themselves (this is a separate mitigation strategy).
*   Security of the build process or deployment environment beyond Sourcery's direct influence.

**Methodology:**

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Configuration Review:**  We will examine the existing `.sourcery.yml` file to assess the current configuration of `sources`, `templates`, and `output`.  We will look for overly broad paths, potential inclusion of unintended files, and any deviations from best practices.
2.  **`args` Analysis:** We will analyze how `args` are used in the templates and identify any potential injection vulnerabilities.  We will propose specific validation and sanitization techniques.
3.  **Feature Analysis:** We will identify any unused Sourcery features that can be disabled to reduce the attack surface.
4.  **Threat Modeling:** We will revisit the threat model for template injection and overly permissive generated code, considering the impact of the mitigation strategy and any remaining risks.
5.  **Recommendations:** We will provide concrete, actionable recommendations to improve the security of the Sourcery configuration.
6.  **Residual Risk Assessment:** We will estimate the residual risk after implementing the recommendations.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Mitigation Strategy

### 2.1 Configuration Review (`sources`, `templates`, `output`)

**Current Status:**  `sources`, `templates`, and `output` are defined in `.sourcery.yml`.  This is a good starting point, but we need to see the *actual* configuration to assess its effectiveness.

**Example (Hypothetical - Needs to be replaced with the real configuration):**

```yaml
sources:
  - ./Sources
templates:
  - ./Templates
output:
  ./Generated
```

**Analysis:**

*   **`sources: ./Sources`:**  This is generally good practice, assuming the `Sources` directory contains *only* the intended source files.  We need to verify:
    *   **No unintended files:**  Ensure that `Sources` doesn't contain test files, backups, or other files that shouldn't be processed by Sourcery.  Consider using more specific paths if possible (e.g., `Sources/Models`, `Sources/Views`).
    *   **No symbolic links:**  Check for symbolic links within `Sources` that might point to unintended locations outside the project.
    *   **Permissions:** Verify that the `Sources` directory has appropriate file permissions to prevent unauthorized modification.

*   **`templates: ./Templates`:** Similar to `sources`, this is good practice if the `Templates` directory is well-managed.  We need to verify the same points as above (no unintended files, no symbolic links, correct permissions).

*   **`output: ./Generated`:**  Using a dedicated `Generated` directory is excellent practice.  This helps prevent accidental overwriting of source files.  We need to verify:
    *   **Permissions:** Ensure that the `Generated` directory has appropriate permissions.  It should be writable by the user running Sourcery, but potentially read-only for other users.
    *   **Exclusion from version control (optional but recommended):**  The `Generated` directory should typically be added to `.gitignore` to prevent generated code from being committed to the repository.  This avoids merge conflicts and keeps the repository clean.

**Potential Weaknesses:**

*   Overly broad paths (even if they *seem* specific) could still include unintended files.
*   Symbolic links could bypass intended restrictions.
*   Incorrect file permissions could allow unauthorized modification of source files or templates.

### 2.2 `args` Analysis

**Current Status:**  Validation of `args` is not explicitly implemented. This is a significant potential vulnerability.

**Analysis:**

*   **Untrusted Input:**  `args` passed to Sourcery templates should be treated as *completely untrusted*.  An attacker could potentially inject malicious code through these arguments.
*   **Injection Vulnerabilities:**  Without validation, an attacker could inject code that:
    *   Executes arbitrary commands on the system.
    *   Reads sensitive files.
    *   Modifies the generated code in unexpected ways.
    *   Causes a denial-of-service.

**Example (Hypothetical):**

Let's say you have a template that generates a class based on a name provided in `args`:

```yaml
# .sourcery.yml
args:
  className: MyClass
```

```swift
// Template.stencil
class {{ args.className }} {
  // ...
}
```

If an attacker could control the `className` argument, they could inject malicious code:

```
className: "MyClass } \n /* Malicious code here */ \n class Foo {"
```

This would result in invalid (and potentially dangerous) generated code.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Strict Validation:** Implement strict validation of all `args` based on their expected type and format.  For example:
    *   **Whitelist allowed characters:**  For a class name, allow only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
    *   **Limit length:**  Set a reasonable maximum length for the input.
    *   **Type checking:**  Ensure that the input matches the expected data type (e.g., string, integer, boolean).
*   **Sanitization:**  Even after validation, consider sanitizing the input to remove any potentially dangerous characters.  This can be a fallback mechanism if validation is not perfect.  For example, you could escape special characters.
*   **Context-Specific Escaping:**  If you're using `args` in different contexts (e.g., within a string literal, as a variable name), use context-specific escaping to prevent injection vulnerabilities.  Stencil (the templating engine used by Sourcery) provides escaping filters (e.g., `| escape`).
* **Example Implementation (Conceptual):**
    *   Create a separate validation function or script that is run *before* Sourcery. This script would:
        1.  Read the `.sourcery.yml` file.
        2.  Validate each argument in the `args` section against a predefined schema (e.g., using a library like `yq` or a custom script).
        3.  If validation fails, exit with an error, preventing Sourcery from running.
    *   Alternatively, use a pre-commit hook to enforce validation.

### 2.3 Feature Analysis

**Current Status:**  Not specified.  We need to determine which Sourcery features are actually used.

**Analysis:**

*   **Identify Unused Features:**  Review the Sourcery documentation and your project's usage to identify any features that are not being used.  Examples might include:
    *   Custom types.
    *   Extensions.
    *   Annotations.
    *   Specific template filters or tags.
*   **Disable Unused Features:**  Disable these features in the `.sourcery.yml` configuration file.  This reduces the attack surface by removing potential entry points for vulnerabilities.  The exact method for disabling features depends on the feature itself; consult the Sourcery documentation.

**Example (Hypothetical):**

If you're not using custom types, you might be able to disable them (this is a hypothetical example; the actual configuration might be different):

```yaml
# .sourcery.yml
disable:
  - customTypes
```

### 2.4 Threat Modeling

**Threat:** Template Injection

*   **Original Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigated Severity:** Medium
*   **Residual Risk:** Medium.  While the mitigation strategy significantly reduces the risk, it doesn't eliminate it entirely.  The main residual risks are:
    *   **Bypass of validation:**  If the `args` validation is not comprehensive enough, an attacker might be able to craft an input that bypasses the checks.
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Sourcery itself:**  While we assume Sourcery is reasonably secure, there's always a possibility of undiscovered vulnerabilities.
    *   **Complex template logic:** Very complex templates with intricate logic might have subtle vulnerabilities that are difficult to detect.

**Threat:** Overly Permissive Generated Code

*   **Original Severity:** High
*   **Mitigated Severity:** Medium
*   **Residual Risk:** Medium. The main residual risks are:
    *   **Incorrect permissions:** If the `Generated` directory has overly permissive permissions, an attacker might be able to modify the generated code after it's created.
    *   **Unintended file overwrites:**  While unlikely with a dedicated `Generated` directory, there's still a small risk of misconfiguration leading to unintended file overwrites.

### 2.5 Recommendations

1.  **Review and Refine Paths:**  Thoroughly review the `sources`, `templates`, and `output` paths in `.sourcery.yml`.  Make them as specific as possible.  Avoid using wildcards or overly broad paths.  Explicitly list the files or directories to be included.
2.  **Implement Strict `args` Validation:**  Implement a robust validation mechanism for all `args` passed to Sourcery templates.  Use whitelisting, length limits, type checking, and context-specific escaping.  Consider using a separate validation script or a pre-commit hook.
3.  **Disable Unused Features:**  Identify and disable any unused Sourcery features in the `.sourcery.yml` configuration file.
4.  **Regularly Review Configuration:**  Periodically review the Sourcery configuration to ensure that it remains secure and up-to-date.
5.  **Monitor for Updates:**  Stay informed about updates to Sourcery and apply any security patches promptly.
6.  **File Permissions:** Double-check file and directory permissions to ensure they are as restrictive as possible.
7.  **Symbolic Link Check:** Verify that no symbolic links exist within the `sources` or `templates` directories that could point to unintended locations.

### 2.6 Residual Risk Assessment

After implementing the recommendations, the residual risk for both template injection and overly permissive generated code is estimated to be **Low to Medium**.  The most significant remaining risk is the possibility of a bypass of the `args` validation or an undiscovered vulnerability in Sourcery itself.  Continuous monitoring, regular security reviews, and staying up-to-date with security best practices are crucial to further mitigate these risks.

## Conclusion

The "Secure Configuration of Sourcery" mitigation strategy is a crucial step in securing your code generation process.  By carefully controlling the input sources, templates, output path, and arguments, you can significantly reduce the risk of template injection and overly permissive generated code.  However, it's essential to implement strict validation of `args`, disable unused features, and regularly review the configuration to ensure its ongoing effectiveness.  The recommendations provided in this analysis will help you achieve a more secure and robust Sourcery setup.
