# Deep Analysis: Indirect Information Disclosure via Sourcery Templates

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand and mitigate the risk of indirect information disclosure arising from the use of Sourcery for code generation.  We aim to identify specific vulnerabilities, assess their potential impact, and define concrete steps to reduce the attack surface.  This analysis focuses on the scenario where compromised or poorly designed Sourcery templates lead to the generation of code that inadvertently reveals sensitive information.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the **indirect information disclosure** attack surface related to Sourcery.  It encompasses:

*   **Sourcery Templates:**  The primary focus is on the templates themselves, their content, and how they are processed.
*   **Generated Code:**  The output of Sourcery – the generated Swift code – is analyzed for potential information leaks.
*   **Integration with Development Workflow:** How Sourcery is integrated into the CI/CD pipeline and the processes surrounding template management.
*   **Excludes:** Direct attacks on the Sourcery tool itself (e.g., exploiting vulnerabilities in the Sourcery binary) are out of scope.  This analysis assumes Sourcery itself is functioning as intended, but the *templates* are the source of the vulnerability.  General code security best practices (e.g., input validation in the application logic) are also out of scope, except where they directly relate to the generated code.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodologies:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  We will use a threat modeling approach to identify potential attack vectors and scenarios.  This includes considering attacker motivations, capabilities, and potential targets.
2.  **Template Code Review:**  A systematic review of existing and newly created Sourcery templates will be conducted, focusing on identifying patterns that could lead to information disclosure.
3.  **Generated Code Analysis (Static):**  Static analysis tools will be used to scan the *generated* code for potential vulnerabilities, such as hardcoded secrets, exposed internal structures, and insecure logging practices.
4.  **Generated Code Analysis (Dynamic - Optional):**  If feasible, dynamic analysis (e.g., running the generated code in a sandboxed environment and monitoring its behavior) may be used to complement static analysis.
5.  **Best Practices Review:**  We will review and reinforce best practices for secure coding and secrets management, specifically as they relate to code generation.
6.  **Documentation Review:**  Review Sourcery's documentation and community resources for any known vulnerabilities or recommended security practices.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface: Indirect Information Disclosure

This section details the specific attack surface and mitigation strategies.

**4.1. Threat Model & Attack Scenarios:**

*   **Attacker Profile:**  The attacker could be an external actor who gains access to the template repository, an insider with malicious intent, or even a developer who unintentionally introduces a vulnerability.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Template Repository Compromise:**  An attacker gains write access to the repository where Sourcery templates are stored (e.g., Git repository).
    *   **Malicious Pull Request:**  An attacker submits a seemingly benign pull request that modifies a template to introduce an information disclosure vulnerability.
    *   **Compromised Dependency:**  If templates include external files or rely on external data sources, a compromise of that dependency could lead to template injection.
    *   **Unintentional Error:** A developer makes a mistake in a template, inadvertently exposing sensitive information.

*   **Attack Scenarios:**
    *   **Scenario 1: Logging Secrets:** A modified template adds logging statements that output database credentials, API keys, or other sensitive environment variables to the console or a log file.
    *   **Scenario 2: Exposing Internal Structure:** A template generates code that serializes internal data structures (e.g., user objects with sensitive fields) in a way that exposes them to unauthorized access (e.g., through an API endpoint or a debugging interface).
    *   **Scenario 3:  Conditional Exposure:** A template includes conditional logic that, under certain circumstances (e.g., a specific build configuration), exposes sensitive information.  This might be intended for debugging but accidentally left enabled in production.
    *   **Scenario 4:  Template-Driven Configuration:**  A template generates configuration files (e.g., .plist, .json) that contain sensitive data.  If these files are not properly secured, they could be accessed by an attacker.

**4.2. Vulnerability Analysis:**

The core vulnerability lies in the *uncontrolled execution of potentially malicious template code*.  Sourcery, by design, executes the logic within the templates to generate code.  If the template contains instructions to output sensitive data, Sourcery will faithfully execute those instructions.  This is not a flaw in Sourcery itself, but rather a consequence of its intended functionality.

Key areas of concern within templates:

*   **Direct Output of Variables:**  Templates that directly output the values of variables without proper sanitization or context checking are highly vulnerable.  For example, `{{ databasePassword }}` in a template would directly expose the password if it's available in the template context.
*   **Complex Logic:**  Templates with complex conditional logic or loops can be harder to audit and may contain hidden vulnerabilities.
*   **External Data Sources:**  Templates that read data from external files or databases are vulnerable to injection attacks if the external source is compromised.
*   **Lack of Context Awareness:**  Templates may not be aware of the context in which the generated code will be used (e.g., development vs. production).  This can lead to information being exposed in inappropriate environments.

**4.3. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed):**

*   **4.3.1.  Template Security (Highest Priority):**

    *   **Strict Access Control:**  Implement strict access control to the template repository.  Only authorized developers should have write access.  Use branch protection rules (e.g., in Git) to require code reviews and approvals for all changes to templates.
    *   **Mandatory Code Reviews:**  All template changes *must* undergo thorough code reviews by at least two developers, with a specific focus on security implications.  Checklists should be used to ensure consistent review quality.
    *   **Template Sandboxing (Ideal, but potentially complex):**  Explore the possibility of running Sourcery in a sandboxed environment that restricts its access to sensitive data and system resources.  This could involve using containers or virtual machines.  This is a more advanced mitigation.
    *   **Input Validation (Template Context):**  If templates receive input from external sources (e.g., command-line arguments, configuration files), validate and sanitize that input *before* it is used in the template.  This helps prevent injection attacks.
    *   **Template Linting:** Develop or use a linter specifically for Sourcery templates. This linter should flag potentially dangerous patterns, such as direct output of sensitive-looking variable names (e.g., `password`, `secret`, `key`).
    *   **Version Control and Auditing:**  Maintain a complete history of all template changes, including who made the changes and when.  This allows for auditing and rollback in case of a security incident.

*   **4.3.2.  Secrets Management (Critical):**

    *   **Never Hardcode Secrets:**  Absolutely prohibit hardcoding secrets (passwords, API keys, etc.) in templates.  This is a fundamental security principle.
    *   **Environment Variables:**  Use environment variables to store secrets and access them within the generated code.  Sourcery can access environment variables during code generation.
    *   **Secrets Vault:**  For more sensitive secrets, use a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault).  The generated code should be designed to retrieve secrets from the vault at runtime.
    *   **Template Parameterization (Limited Use):**  In some cases, you might pass secrets as parameters to Sourcery.  However, this should be done with extreme caution and only if the secrets are already securely managed (e.g., retrieved from a secrets vault).  Avoid passing secrets directly on the command line.

*   **4.3.3.  Generated Code Review (Essential):**

    *   **Automated Scanning:**  Integrate static analysis tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan the *generated* code for potential information disclosure vulnerabilities.  Tools like SwiftLint (with custom rules), Semgrep, or commercial static analysis tools can be used.
    *   **Manual Review:**  Even with automated scanning, manual code reviews of the generated code are still crucial.  Developers should be trained to identify potential information leaks in the generated code.
    *   **Focus Areas:**  Pay close attention to logging statements, error messages, API responses, and any code that handles sensitive data.

*   **4.3.4.  Static Analysis of Generated Code (Automated):**

    *   **Tool Selection:**  Choose static analysis tools that are specifically designed for Swift and can detect information disclosure vulnerabilities.
    *   **Custom Rules:**  Develop custom rules for the static analysis tools to flag specific patterns that are relevant to your application and the way you use Sourcery.  For example, create rules to detect the use of specific API calls that might expose sensitive data.
    *   **Integration with CI/CD:**  Integrate the static analysis tools into your CI/CD pipeline so that the generated code is automatically scanned on every build.

*   **4.3.5 Dynamic Analysis of Generated Code (Optional):**
    *  Run generated code in sandboxed environment.
    *  Monitor for suspicious file access.
    *  Monitor for suspicious network connections.

**4.4.  Monitoring and Auditing:**

*   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of the entire Sourcery-based code generation process, including templates, generated code, and the CI/CD pipeline.
*   **Log Monitoring:**  Monitor logs for any signs of information disclosure, such as unexpected error messages or unusual data being logged.
*   **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Regularly scan the application (including the generated code) for known vulnerabilities.

## 5. Conclusion

Indirect information disclosure through compromised Sourcery templates is a significant security risk.  The most effective mitigation is to prevent template injection and ensure that templates are securely managed and reviewed.  By implementing the strategies outlined in this analysis, the development team can significantly reduce the attack surface and protect sensitive information.  Continuous monitoring, auditing, and improvement of security practices are essential to maintain a strong security posture.
