# Deep Analysis: Sourcery Configuration Manipulation

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the risks associated with unauthorized modification of Sourcery's configuration file (`.sourcery.yml` or similar), identify potential attack vectors, and propose robust mitigation strategies beyond the initial high-level recommendations.  We aim to provide actionable guidance for the development team to minimize the likelihood and impact of this attack.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the attack surface related to the Sourcery configuration file.  It encompasses:

*   **Direct modification:**  Unauthorized changes to the configuration file's contents.
*   **Indirect modification:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in other systems (e.g., CI/CD pipelines, development environments) to alter the configuration file.
*   **Impact on Sourcery's behavior:**  How changes to the configuration can be leveraged for malicious purposes.
*   **Mitigation strategies:**  Both preventative and detective measures to reduce risk.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Vulnerabilities within Sourcery's code generation engine itself (e.g., bugs in template parsing).
*   Attacks that do not involve manipulating the configuration file.

### 1.3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  Identify potential attackers, their motivations, and the likely attack paths.
2.  **Configuration Parameter Analysis:**  Examine each configurable parameter in `.sourcery.yml` and assess its potential for misuse.
3.  **Attack Scenario Development:**  Create concrete examples of how an attacker might exploit configuration manipulation.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Refinement:**  Expand on the initial mitigation strategies, providing specific implementation details and considering edge cases.
5.  **Residual Risk Assessment:**  Evaluate the remaining risk after implementing the proposed mitigations.

## 2. Threat Modeling

*   **Attacker Profiles:**
    *   **External Attacker:**  Gains unauthorized access to the development environment or CI/CD pipeline (e.g., through phishing, compromised credentials, or exploiting vulnerabilities in other applications).  Motivation:  Data theft, code sabotage, system disruption.
    *   **Insider Threat (Malicious):**  A developer or other team member with legitimate access intentionally modifies the configuration file.  Motivation:  Disgruntled employee, financial gain (e.g., selling access or data), espionage.
    *   **Insider Threat (Accidental):**  A developer unintentionally makes a harmful change to the configuration file due to error or lack of awareness.  Motivation:  None (unintentional).

*   **Attack Paths:**
    *   **Direct File Modification:**  Attacker gains write access to the `.sourcery.yml` file through compromised credentials, SSH access, or other means.
    *   **CI/CD Pipeline Compromise:**  Attacker injects malicious configuration changes into the build process (e.g., by modifying build scripts or environment variables).
    *   **Dependency Poisoning:**  Attacker compromises a package or tool used in the development environment, which then modifies the Sourcery configuration.
    *   **Social Engineering:**  Attacker tricks a developer into making harmful changes to the configuration file.

## 3. Configuration Parameter Analysis

Let's examine key parameters within a typical `.sourcery.yml` and their potential for misuse:

```yaml
sources:
  - ./Sources  # Input source code directories
templates:
  - ./Templates # Location of Stencil/Swift templates
output:
  ./Generated # Output directory for generated code
args:          # Custom arguments passed to templates
  someArg: value
```

*   **`sources`:**
    *   **Risk:**  An attacker could add malicious source files to be processed by Sourcery, potentially leading to the inclusion of unwanted code.  Less likely to be a primary attack vector, but could be used in conjunction with template manipulation.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Strict access control, code reviews, and input validation (if possible) to ensure only intended source files are included.

*   **`templates`:**
    *   **Risk:**  **HIGH**.  This is the most critical parameter.  Changing this to a directory controlled by the attacker allows them to inject arbitrary code through malicious templates.  This is a classic template injection attack.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Extremely strict access control.  Consider storing templates in a separate, highly secured repository.  Implement robust change detection and alerting for the template directory.

*   **`output`:**
    *   **Risk:**  **HIGH**.  An attacker could:
        *   Overwrite critical application files, leading to denial of service or code execution.
        *   Write generated code to a publicly accessible directory, exposing sensitive information.
        *   Write to a location that is later executed as part of a build or deployment process, injecting malicious code.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Use a dedicated, isolated output directory with minimal permissions.  Implement checks to prevent overwriting existing files outside the intended output directory (e.g., a "safe output" wrapper script).  Sanitize the output path to prevent path traversal attacks (e.g., `../`).

*   **`args`:**
    *   **Risk:**  Medium.  Depends on how the templates use these arguments.  If arguments are used directly in code generation without proper sanitization, they could be exploited for injection attacks.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Treat arguments as untrusted input within templates.  Use appropriate escaping and sanitization techniques within the templates themselves.  Document clearly how arguments are used and their security implications.  Consider limiting the types of values allowed for arguments.

## 4. Attack Scenario Development

**Scenario 1: Template Injection via CI/CD Compromise**

1.  **Attacker:** External attacker gains access to the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., through a compromised API key).
2.  **Action:** The attacker modifies the build script to change the `templates` path in `.sourcery.yml` to point to a repository they control.  This repository contains malicious templates.
3.  **Execution:** The next time the CI/CD pipeline runs, Sourcery uses the attacker's templates.
4.  **Impact:** The generated code contains malicious code that is deployed to production, potentially allowing the attacker to steal data, execute arbitrary commands, or disrupt the application.

**Scenario 2: Denial of Service via Output Path Manipulation**

1.  **Attacker:** Insider threat (malicious developer).
2.  **Action:** The developer modifies the `output` path in `.sourcery.yml` to point to a critical system directory (e.g., `/etc/passwd` on Linux or a system32 folder on Windows, or even a critical file of the application).
3.  **Execution:** The next time Sourcery runs, it overwrites the critical system file.
4.  **Impact:** The application or the entire system becomes unstable or unusable, leading to a denial of service.

**Scenario 3: Data Exfiltration via Output Path and Template Manipulation**

1.  **Attacker:** External attacker gains access to the development environment.
2.  **Action:**
    *   Modifies the `templates` path to point to a directory containing a malicious template designed to extract sensitive data (e.g., database credentials, API keys) from the source code.
    *   Modifies the `output` path to point to a web-accessible directory.
3.  **Execution:** Sourcery runs, the malicious template extracts the data, and the generated code containing the data is written to the public directory.
4.  **Impact:** Sensitive data is exposed and can be accessed by anyone.

## 5. Mitigation Strategy Refinement

Beyond the initial mitigations, we need more specific and robust strategies:

*   **1. Enhanced Access Control:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure that only authorized users and processes have write access to the `.sourcery.yml` file.  Use operating system-level permissions (e.g., `chmod` on Linux) to restrict access.
    *   **Separate Configuration Repository (Ideal):**  Store the `.sourcery.yml` file in a separate, highly secured repository with stricter access controls than the main codebase.  This makes it more difficult for an attacker to modify the configuration even if they compromise the main repository.
    *   **CI/CD Pipeline Security:**  Secure the CI/CD pipeline with strong authentication, authorization, and auditing.  Use dedicated service accounts with minimal permissions.  Regularly review and update pipeline configurations.

*   **2. Version Control and Change Management:**
    *   **Mandatory Code Reviews:**  Require code reviews for *all* changes to the `.sourcery.yml` file, including changes made through the CI/CD pipeline.  This helps catch accidental and malicious modifications.
    *   **Automated Change Detection:**  Implement a system to automatically detect and alert on any changes to the `.sourcery.yml` file.  This could be a simple script that checks the file's hash or a more sophisticated intrusion detection system.
    *   **Rollback Capability:**  Ensure that it's easy to revert to a previous, known-good version of the `.sourcery.yml` file in case of a problem.

*   **3. Configuration Validation (Custom Implementation):**
    *   **Schema Validation:**  Define a schema for the `.sourcery.yml` file (e.g., using JSON Schema or YAML Schema) and validate the file against this schema before running Sourcery.  This can prevent syntax errors and some types of malicious configurations.
    *   **Whitelist Allowed Paths:**  Create a whitelist of allowed paths for the `sources`, `templates`, and `output` parameters.  Reject any configuration that uses paths outside this whitelist.
    *   **Output Path Sanitization:**  Implement a function to sanitize the `output` path, preventing path traversal attacks and ensuring that the output directory is within the intended location.  This function should be called *before* Sourcery is executed.  Example (Python):

        ```python
        import os
        import re

        def sanitize_output_path(output_path, base_dir):
            """
            Sanitizes the output path to prevent path traversal.

            Args:
                output_path: The output path specified in .sourcery.yml.
                base_dir: The allowed base directory for output.

            Returns:
                The sanitized absolute path, or None if the path is invalid.
            """
            absolute_path = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(base_dir, output_path))
            if not absolute_path.startswith(os.path.abspath(base_dir)):
                return None  # Path traversal attempt
            if not re.match(r'^[a-zA-Z0-9_\-/.]+$', output_path): # Example: Allow only alphanumeric, underscore, hyphen, slash, and dot.
                return None
            return absolute_path

        # Example usage:
        base_output_dir = "/path/to/project/generated"
        sourcery_output_path = "../../../etc/passwd"  # Malicious path
        sanitized_path = sanitize_output_path(sourcery_output_path, base_output_dir)

        if sanitized_path:
            print(f"Sanitized output path: {sanitized_path}")
            # Run Sourcery with the sanitized path
        else:
            print("Invalid output path detected!")
            # Handle the error (e.g., exit, log, alert)
        ```

    *   **Argument Validation:**  If `args` are used, implement validation logic to ensure that they conform to expected types and values.  This could involve regular expressions, type checking, or custom validation functions.

*   **4. Security Audits:**
    *   **Regular Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular penetration tests of the development environment and CI/CD pipeline to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited to modify the Sourcery configuration.
    *   **Code Reviews (Security-Focused):**  Include security experts in code reviews of the `.sourcery.yml` file and any related code (e.g., build scripts, template logic).

*   **5. Monitoring and Alerting:**
    *   **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):**  Use a FIM tool to monitor the `.sourcery.yml` file for changes and alert on any unauthorized modifications.
    *   **Log Analysis:**  Monitor system logs and application logs for suspicious activity related to Sourcery, such as errors indicating invalid configuration or unexpected output paths.

## 6. Residual Risk Assessment

Even with all the above mitigations in place, some residual risk remains:

*   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:**  There's always a possibility of undiscovered vulnerabilities in Sourcery, the operating system, or other tools used in the development environment.
*   **Sophisticated Insider Threats:**  A highly skilled and determined insider threat might be able to bypass some of the security controls.
*   **Human Error:**  Despite best efforts, mistakes can happen.

The goal is to reduce the risk to an acceptable level, not to eliminate it entirely.  Regular security reviews, updates, and vigilance are essential to maintain a strong security posture. The implementation of custom validation and a separate configuration repository are the two highest-impact mitigations, significantly reducing the attack surface.

This detailed analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the Sourcery configuration manipulation attack surface, going beyond the initial description to offer concrete, actionable steps for mitigation. It emphasizes the importance of a layered security approach, combining preventative and detective controls to minimize risk.
