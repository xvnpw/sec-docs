Okay, let's create a design document for Sourcery, based on the provided GitHub repository.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Sourcery is a meta-programming tool for Swift, designed to automate repetitive coding tasks, reduce boilerplate, and improve code consistency.  It's used during development and integrated into the build process.

Priorities:

*   Maintainability:  The project must be easy to maintain and extend, given its nature as a foundational tool for other projects.
*   Reliability: Sourcery's code generation must be accurate and predictable to avoid introducing bugs into the projects that use it.
*   Performance:  Sourcery should operate efficiently to minimize its impact on build times.
*   Usability:  The tool should be easy to configure and use, with clear documentation and helpful error messages.
*   Community Adoption:  As an open-source project, wider adoption leads to more contributions, bug reports, and overall improvement.

Goals:

*   Reduce boilerplate code in Swift projects.
*   Automate common coding tasks.
*   Enforce coding standards and best practices.
*   Improve developer productivity.
*   Provide a robust and reliable code generation engine.

Business Risks:

*   Incorrect Code Generation: The most critical risk is Sourcery generating incorrect code, leading to runtime errors or unexpected behavior in applications that depend on it. This could lead to significant debugging time and potential production issues.
*   Performance Bottlenecks: If Sourcery is slow or resource-intensive, it could significantly increase build times, impacting developer productivity and potentially delaying releases.
*   Security Vulnerabilities: While Sourcery itself doesn't handle sensitive data directly, vulnerabilities in its code or dependencies could be exploited to inject malicious code into generated output, creating security risks in the applications that use it.
*   Compatibility Issues: Changes in the Swift language or Xcode could break Sourcery's functionality, requiring significant updates and potentially disrupting existing workflows.
*   Lack of Adoption: If developers don't find Sourcery useful or easy to use, it won't be adopted, limiting its impact and potentially leading to the project being abandoned.
*   Maintenance Overhead: If the codebase is difficult to maintain or extend, it could become a burden for the maintainers, slowing down development and making it harder to address bugs and feature requests.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Code Reviews: The project uses pull requests on GitHub, implying that code reviews are part of the development process. (GitHub repository)
*   security control: Static Analysis: The presence of linters (SwiftLint) suggests some level of static analysis is performed. (.swiftlint.yml configuration file)
*   security control: Testing: The project has a comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests. (Tests directory)
*   security control: Dependency Management: Dependencies are managed using Swift Package Manager, which provides some level of security by allowing for version pinning and auditing. (Package.swift file)
*   security control: Continuous Integration: GitHub Actions are used for continuous integration, which can be configured to run security checks. (.github/workflows directory)

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Template Injection: Sourcery uses templates to generate code.  There's an inherent risk of template injection if user-provided templates are not handled carefully. This is partially mitigated by the Stencil template language, but care must still be taken.
*   accepted risk: Reliance on Third-Party Libraries: Sourcery depends on several third-party libraries. Vulnerabilities in these libraries could impact Sourcery's security. This is a standard risk for most software projects.
*   accepted risk: Limited Input Validation: While Sourcery parses Swift code, it may not perform extensive validation on all inputs, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: SAST (Static Application Security Testing): Integrate a dedicated SAST tool into the CI pipeline to automatically scan for security vulnerabilities in Sourcery's code.
*   security control: SCA (Software Composition Analysis): Use an SCA tool to identify known vulnerabilities in Sourcery's dependencies and keep them up-to-date.
*   security control: Fuzz Testing: Implement fuzz testing to identify potential crashes or unexpected behavior caused by malformed input.
*   security control: Security Documentation: Create dedicated security documentation that outlines potential threats and mitigation strategies, especially regarding template injection.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication: Not applicable, as Sourcery is a command-line tool run locally.
*   Authorization: Not applicable, as Sourcery operates with the privileges of the user running it.
*   Input Validation:
    *   Sourcery should validate the structure and syntax of input Swift files to prevent crashes or unexpected behavior.
    *   Sourcery should validate template files to mitigate the risk of template injection vulnerabilities.
    *   Configuration files should be validated to ensure they adhere to the expected schema.
*   Cryptography: Not directly applicable, as Sourcery doesn't handle sensitive data. However, if Sourcery were to interact with remote services in the future, secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS) should be used.
*   Output Encoding: Ensure that generated code is properly encoded to prevent potential injection vulnerabilities in the target application.

## DEPLOYMENT

Sourcery is a command-line tool, and its "deployment" is typically handled in one of the following ways:

1.  **Homebrew:**  Installing via Homebrew is a common method for macOS users. This involves downloading a pre-built binary from a trusted source (Sourcery's GitHub releases).
2.  **Swift Package Manager:** Sourcery can be added as a dependency to a Swift project using SPM. This downloads the source code and builds it locally.
3.  **Manual Build:** Users can clone the repository and build Sourcery manually using `swift build`.
4.  **Mint:** Installing via Mint, a package manager for Swift command-line tools.

We'll describe the **Homebrew** deployment, as it's a common and relatively straightforward method.

```mermaid

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Build Process
        developer[Developer]
        github[GitHub]
        githubActions[GitHub Actions]

        github -- "Triggers workflow" --> githubActions
        githubActions -- "Uses" --> swiftCompiler
        githubActions -- "Uses" --> testRunner
        swiftCompiler -- "Builds" --> artifact
        testRunner -- "Runs tests" --> githubActions
        githubActions -- "Creates release" --> github
    end
```
Build process description:

1.  **Code Push:** A developer pushes code changes to the Sourcery repository on GitHub.
2.  **Workflow Trigger:** GitHub Actions detects the push and triggers the defined workflow (e.g., on push to the `main` branch or on a pull request).
3.  **Checkout Code:** The workflow checks out the latest code from the repository.
4.  **Setup Environment:** The workflow sets up the required build environment (e.g., macOS, Swift version).
5.  **Build:** The workflow uses the Swift compiler (`swift build`) to build Sourcery.
6.  **Run Tests:** The workflow runs the test suite using the Swift test runner (`swift test`).
7.  **Create Artifact:** If the build and tests are successful, the workflow creates a release artifact (the Sourcery binary).
8.  **Publish Release:** For tagged commits, the workflow may create a new release on GitHub and upload the artifact.
9.  **Security Checks:**
    *   **Linters:** SwiftLint is run as part of the build process to enforce code style and identify potential issues.
    *   **Tests:** Unit and integration tests are run to ensure code correctness.
    *   **Dependency Management:** Swift Package Manager is used to manage dependencies, and the `Package.resolved` file helps ensure consistent builds.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   **Code Generation:** The core process of generating Swift code based on input files and templates. This must be reliable and accurate.
*   **Build Integration:** Sourcery's integration into the build process of Swift projects. This must be efficient and not significantly impact build times.
*   **Template Processing:** The handling of Sourcery templates, which must be secure and prevent injection vulnerabilities.

Data Sensitivity:

*   **Source Code (Low Sensitivity):** Sourcery processes Swift source code, which is generally not considered highly sensitive data *in itself*. However, the *generated* code could potentially introduce vulnerabilities if Sourcery is compromised.
*   **Templates (Low Sensitivity):** Sourcery templates are also generally low sensitivity, but they could contain sensitive information (e.g., API keys) if developers are not careful. This is a user responsibility, but Sourcery should provide guidance on secure template practices.
*   **Configuration Files (Low Sensitivity):** Configuration files may contain project-specific settings, but are generally not highly sensitive.
