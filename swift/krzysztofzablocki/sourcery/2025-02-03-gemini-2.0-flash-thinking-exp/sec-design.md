# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Increase developer productivity by automating repetitive code generation tasks in Swift projects.
  - Improve code consistency and reduce boilerplate code, leading to better maintainability.
  - Enable developers to focus on higher-level logic and business problems instead of manual code generation.
- Business Risks:
  - Risk of introducing bugs through generated code if Sourcery's parsing or template logic is flawed.
  - Potential for increased complexity if code generation is overused or templates are poorly designed, making debugging and understanding harder.
  - Dependency on Sourcery for code generation might create a single point of failure in development workflows if the tool becomes unavailable or has issues.
  - Risk of developers misusing Sourcery, leading to inconsistent coding styles or unintended code changes if not properly configured and used.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Open Source Code - The project is open source, allowing for community review and scrutiny of the codebase. Implemented in: GitHub repository.
  - security control: GitHub Security Features - Reliance on GitHub's platform security features for repository hosting, access control, and vulnerability scanning. Implemented in: GitHub platform.
  - security control: Input Validation -  Presumably, Sourcery includes input validation to parse Swift code and templates, although specific details are not provided in the repository description. Implemented in: Sourcery codebase (implementation details unknown).
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Dependency Vulnerabilities - Potential vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and dependencies used by Sourcery.
  - accepted risk: Template Security - Risk of using untrusted or malicious templates if developers source them from unverified locations (though this is less likely in typical usage as templates are usually project-specific).
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Dependency Scanning - Implement automated dependency scanning to identify and address vulnerabilities in Sourcery's dependencies.
  - security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) - Integrate SAST tools into the development pipeline to automatically analyze Sourcery's codebase for potential security flaws.
  - security control: Input Validation Hardening -  Thoroughly review and harden input validation logic for Swift code and template parsing to prevent injection attacks and unexpected behavior.
  - security control: Secure Template Development Guidelines - Provide guidelines and best practices for developers on how to create secure templates, minimizing the risk of introducing vulnerabilities through generated code.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable as Sourcery is a command-line tool used locally by developers.
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable as Sourcery operates on files accessible to the user running it. Access control is managed by the operating system's file system permissions.
  - Input Validation: Critical for parsing Swift code and templates. Sourcery must robustly validate inputs to prevent issues like code injection or denial-of-service attacks through maliciously crafted Swift code or templates.
  - Cryptography: Not directly applicable to the core functionality of Sourcery as a code generation tool. Cryptographic requirements might be relevant if Sourcery were to handle sensitive data or secrets, which is not indicated in its current description.

  - CI/CD Integration: Sourcery can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines to automatically generate code as part of the build process. This would involve installing Sourcery on build agents.
  - Server-Based Code Generation (Less Likely): In less common scenarios, Sourcery could potentially be deployed on a server to provide code generation as a service, although this is not the typical use case for Sourcery.
