## Attack Tree Path: [1. Root: Compromise Application via Sourcery [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1__root_compromise_application_via_sourcery__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this root node means the attacker has achieved their objective of compromising the application through Sourcery.
*   **Criticality:**  Highest criticality as it represents full application compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. AND 1: Exploit Sourcery Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2__and_1_exploit_sourcery_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the primary attack vector. To compromise the application via Sourcery, the attacker must exploit vulnerabilities within Sourcery itself. This node branches into different categories of vulnerabilities.
*   **Criticality:** High criticality as it is the direct path to achieving the root goal.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. OR 1.1: Template Manipulation [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/3__or_1_1_template_manipulation__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers aim to manipulate the templates used by Sourcery to generate code. This can be achieved by modifying existing templates or, in less likely scenarios, injecting new ones.
*   **Criticality:** High criticality because successful template manipulation can directly lead to arbitrary code execution in the generated application code.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1. OR 1.1.1: Direct Template Modification [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1__or_1_1_1_direct_template_modification__critical_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Gaining unauthorized access to template files (e.g., `.stencil` files) and directly modifying them to include malicious code within the template syntax.
*   **Impact:** When Sourcery uses these modified templates, it will generate code containing the attacker's malicious payload, leading to arbitrary code execution within the application's environment when the generated code is executed.
*   **Example Actions:**
    *   Compromise a developer's machine to access the template repository.
    *   Exploit insecure repository access controls to directly modify templates.
    *   Gain access to the file system where templates are stored if permissions are misconfigured.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. OR 1.2: Configuration Manipulation [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/4__or_1_2_configuration_manipulation__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers target Sourcery's configuration files (e.g., `.sourcery.yml`). Modifying these files can alter Sourcery's behavior in malicious ways.
*   **Criticality:** High criticality as configuration manipulation can lead to various severe outcomes, including malicious code generation and application disruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.1. OR 1.2.1: Direct Configuration Modification [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/4_1__or_1_2_1_direct_configuration_modification__critical_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Gaining unauthorized access to Sourcery's configuration files and modifying them to:
    *   Specify malicious templates for Sourcery to use.
    *   Change output paths to overwrite critical application files with generated (potentially malicious) code.
    *   Alter parsing behavior to introduce vulnerabilities in the generated code.
*   **Impact:** Control over Sourcery's code generation process, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, data corruption, or denial of service.
*   **Example Actions:** Similar access vectors as template modification - compromising developer machines, exploiting insecure repository access, or file system vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. OR 1.3: Dependency Exploitation (Sourcery's Dependencies) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/5__or_1_3_dependency_exploitation__sourcery's_dependencies___critical_.md)

*   **Description:**  Sourcery relies on external libraries like Stencil (template engine) and YAML parsers. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited to compromise Sourcery and, consequently, the application.
*   **Criticality:** High criticality because exploiting dependency vulnerabilities can be a relatively widespread and impactful attack vector if dependencies are not properly managed and updated.

## Attack Tree Path: [5.1. OR 1.3.1: Exploit Stencil Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/5_1__or_1_3_1_exploit_stencil_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting known or zero-day vulnerabilities within the Stencil template engine used by Sourcery. This could include sandbox escapes or template injection flaws within Stencil itself.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution during the template rendering process within Sourcery. This code execution happens in the context of the Sourcery process, which can then influence the generated code and potentially the application.
*   **Example Actions:**
    *   Identify the Stencil version used by Sourcery.
    *   Research public vulnerability databases for known vulnerabilities in that Stencil version.
    *   Craft malicious templates that specifically trigger these Stencil vulnerabilities during rendering.

## Attack Tree Path: [5.2. OR 1.3.2: Exploit YAML Parser Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/5_2__or_1_3_2_exploit_yaml_parser_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the YAML parser used by Sourcery to process its configuration files. YAML parsers can be susceptible to vulnerabilities like arbitrary code execution or denial of service through specially crafted YAML input.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution during the configuration parsing phase of Sourcery. This code execution occurs within the Sourcery process and can be leveraged to manipulate Sourcery's behavior or inject malicious code into the generated output.
*   **Example Actions:**
    *   Identify the YAML parser library used by Sourcery.
    *   Research known vulnerabilities for that specific YAML parser library and version.
    *   Craft malicious YAML configuration files that exploit these parser vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. OR 1.4: Code Injection via Logic Bugs in Sourcery [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/6__or_1_4_code_injection_via_logic_bugs_in_sourcery__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This path focuses on exploiting inherent logic flaws or bugs within Sourcery's core code itself. These bugs could be in parsing, template processing, or code generation logic.
*   **Criticality:** High criticality because successful exploitation of logic bugs can lead to subtle and hard-to-detect code injection vulnerabilities in the generated code.

## Attack Tree Path: [6.1. OR 1.4.1: Code Injection via Logic Bugs in Sourcery [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/6_1__or_1_4_1_code_injection_via_logic_bugs_in_sourcery__critical_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Discovering and exploiting subtle bugs in Sourcery's internal logic that allow an attacker to inject unintended code into the generated output. This might involve crafting specific input source code, templates, or configurations that trigger these logic flaws.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution through the generated code. This type of vulnerability can be particularly challenging to detect and mitigate because it stems from the core logic of Sourcery itself.
*   **Example Actions:**
    *   Perform in-depth code review of Sourcery's source code to identify potential logic flaws.
    *   Use fuzzing techniques to provide a wide range of inputs to Sourcery and observe for unexpected or erroneous behavior.
    *   Employ static analysis tools to identify potential code quality issues or vulnerabilities within Sourcery's codebase.
    *   Experiment with carefully crafted source code, templates, and configurations to try and trigger unintended code generation outcomes.
