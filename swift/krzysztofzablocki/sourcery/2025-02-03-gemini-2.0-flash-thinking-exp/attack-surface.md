# Attack Surface Analysis for krzysztofzablocki/sourcery

## Attack Surface: [Template Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/template_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in Sourcery templates to inject malicious code or commands during the code generation process. This occurs when templates process untrusted data without proper sanitization, allowing attackers to manipulate template logic.
*   **Sourcery Contribution:** Sourcery's core functionality relies on template processing. Vulnerabilities in how Sourcery handles template logic and data input directly contribute to this attack surface.
*   **Example:** A Sourcery template uses a string from a user-provided configuration file to construct a shell command for code generation. If an attacker modifies the configuration file to inject malicious shell commands within the string, Sourcery will execute these commands on the build system during code generation.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Critical:** Arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine or build server during code generation, potentially leading to full system compromise.
    *   **High:** Generation of malicious code embedded within the application, resulting in backdoors, data breaches, or other severe security flaws in the final product.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Treat Templates as Code:** Implement rigorous security reviews and secure coding practices for all Sourcery templates.
    *   **Strict Input Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate all external data sources used within templates, including configuration files, parsed code metadata, and any other dynamic inputs.
    *   **Secure Templating Practices:** Avoid dynamic template logic where possible. If necessary, use secure templating techniques and limit the capabilities of the templating engine to prevent code execution.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run Sourcery processes with the minimum necessary permissions to limit the impact of successful template injection.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of templates and Sourcery configurations to identify and remediate potential injection points.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Template Files](./attack_surfaces/malicious_template_files.md)

*   **Description:**  Introduction of vulnerabilities through the use of compromised or intentionally malicious Sourcery template files. If Sourcery is configured to load templates from untrusted sources, attackers can supply malicious templates.
*   **Sourcery Contribution:** Sourcery directly uses template files as the blueprint for code generation.  The mechanism by which Sourcery loads and processes templates is central to this attack surface.
*   **Example:** A developer configures Sourcery to load templates from a public, untrusted Git repository. An attacker compromises this repository and replaces legitimate templates with malicious ones that inject a backdoor into generated code. When the developer runs Sourcery, the application is unknowingly built with the backdoor.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Critical:** Generation of malicious code directly embedded into the application codebase, leading to severe security breaches, data exfiltration, or complete application compromise.
    *   **High:** Introduction of subtle vulnerabilities or logic flaws through malicious templates that are difficult to detect and can be exploited later.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Trusted Template Sources Only:**  Restrict template sources to highly trusted and internally controlled repositories. Never use templates from untrusted or public sources without rigorous security vetting.
    *   **Template Source Control and Access Control:** Store and manage all Sourcery templates in a secure version control system with strict access controls and audit logging.
    *   **Template Integrity Verification:** Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity and authenticity of template files before use, such as checksums, digital signatures, or code signing.
    *   **Mandatory Code Review for Templates:** Enforce mandatory code reviews for all template changes, treating templates with the same security scrutiny as production code.
    *   **Template Scanning (Static Analysis):**  Utilize static analysis tools to scan templates for suspicious patterns or potential malicious code injection attempts.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Sourcery Tool Itself](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_sourcery_tool_itself.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of inherent security vulnerabilities within the Sourcery application code itself.  Bugs in Sourcery's parsing logic, template engine integration, or core functionalities could be exploited.
*   **Sourcery Contribution:**  As the core code generation engine, vulnerabilities within Sourcery directly expose users to risk.  Any flaw in Sourcery's code becomes a potential attack vector for applications using it.
*   **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Sourcery's Swift code parser. An attacker crafts a specially designed Swift file that, when processed by Sourcery, triggers the buffer overflow, allowing for arbitrary code execution on the build server.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Critical:** Arbitrary code execution on the build server or developer machine during code generation, potentially leading to full system compromise and supply chain attacks.
    *   **High:** Denial of service attacks against the build process by crashing Sourcery, disrupting development and deployment pipelines.
    *   **High:** Information disclosure by exploiting vulnerabilities to leak sensitive data from the parsed Swift code or the build environment.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the nature and exploitability of the vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always Use Latest Sourcery Version:**  Maintain Sourcery at the latest stable version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes released by the Sourcery developers.
    *   **Proactive Security Monitoring:**  Actively monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases related to Sourcery and its dependencies.
    *   **Participate in Security Community:** Engage with the Sourcery community and security researchers to stay informed about potential vulnerabilities and best practices.
    *   **Consider Enterprise Support/Scanning (If Available):** For critical applications, consider using commercially supported versions of Sourcery (if available) or explore enterprise-grade static analysis tools that can scan third-party tools like Sourcery for vulnerabilities.
    *   **Isolate Build Environment:**  Run Sourcery in an isolated and hardened build environment to limit the impact of potential compromises.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration and Integration Misconfigurations Leading to Privilege Escalation or Malicious Code Generation](./attack_surfaces/configuration_and_integration_misconfigurations_leading_to_privilege_escalation_or_malicious_code_ge_f23798a0.md)

*   **Description:**  Security risks arising from misconfiguring Sourcery or its integration into the build process in ways that grant excessive privileges or create pathways for malicious code injection.
*   **Sourcery Contribution:**  Sourcery's configuration and integration points (e.g., how it's invoked in build scripts, what permissions it runs with, how it accesses resources) directly influence the overall security posture. Misconfigurations here can amplify other attack surfaces.
*   **Example:** Sourcery is mistakenly configured to run with root privileges within a CI/CD pipeline. If a template injection vulnerability is then exploited, the attacker gains root access to the entire CI/CD environment, enabling widespread compromise.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Critical:** Privilege escalation within the build environment, allowing attackers to gain administrative control and potentially compromise the entire infrastructure.
    *   **High:** Indirectly enabling or amplifying other attack vectors (like template injection) by providing excessive permissions or insecure integration points.
    *   **High:** Exposure of sensitive configuration data or credentials if Sourcery configuration is not managed securely.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege - Configuration:**  Configure Sourcery to run with the absolute minimum privileges required for its operation. Avoid running Sourcery with elevated permissions like root unless absolutely necessary and only after thorough security review.
    *   **Secure Configuration Management:**  Store and manage Sourcery configuration files securely. Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in configuration files. Use environment variables, secure vaults, or dedicated secret management solutions.
    *   **Secure Build Pipeline Integration:**  Integrate Sourcery into a secure CI/CD pipeline, following security best practices for build processes, access control, and environment isolation.
    *   **Regular Configuration Audits:**  Periodically audit Sourcery's configuration and integration settings to identify and rectify any misconfigurations that could introduce security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for Build Environments:** Use IaC to define and manage build environments, ensuring consistent and secure configurations and facilitating easier security reviews.
