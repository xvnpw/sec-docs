# Threat Model Analysis for krzysztofzablocki/sourcery

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/dependency_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

* **Description:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in Sourcery itself or one of its dependencies. This could involve crafting malicious input to trigger the vulnerability during Sourcery execution, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine or CI/CD server.
    * **Impact:**
        * Compromise of developer machines, allowing attackers to steal code, credentials, or inject malware into the development environment.
        * Compromise of CI/CD pipeline, enabling attackers to tamper with builds, inject malicious code into application artifacts, or disrupt the deployment process.
    * **Affected Sourcery Component:** Sourcery Core Application, Dependencies (e.g., libraries used by Sourcery).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update Sourcery to the latest version.
        * Implement dependency scanning in the development and CI/CD pipeline to identify vulnerable dependencies.
        * Subscribe to security advisories for Sourcery and its dependencies.
        * Isolate development environments and CI/CD pipelines to limit the blast radius of a potential compromise.

## Threat: [Malicious Template Injection](./threats/malicious_template_injection.md)

* **Description:** An attacker with access to Sourcery templates modifies them to inject malicious code into the generated output. This could be done by directly editing template files or by exploiting vulnerabilities in template management systems if used. The malicious code would then be incorporated into the application codebase during Sourcery execution.
    * **Impact:**
        * Introduction of backdoors, data exfiltration mechanisms, or other malicious functionalities into the application.
        * Subtle vulnerabilities that are difficult to detect through standard code review, as they originate from generated code.
        * Potential compromise of end-users if the malicious code is deployed in production.
    * **Affected Sourcery Component:** Templates, Template Processing Engine.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strict access control and version control for Sourcery templates.
        * Conduct thorough code reviews of all template changes, treating templates as critical code.
        * Employ static analysis tools to scan generated code for suspicious patterns or known vulnerabilities.
        * Implement code signing for generated code to ensure integrity and detect tampering.
        * Limit access to template modification to authorized personnel only.

## Threat: [Compromised Sourcery Distribution Channel](./threats/compromised_sourcery_distribution_channel.md)

* **Description:** An attacker compromises the distribution channel for Sourcery (e.g., GitHub releases, package managers) and replaces legitimate versions with a malicious version. Developers unknowingly download and use the compromised Sourcery, introducing malware into their development environment.
    * **Impact:**
        * Widespread compromise of developer machines and CI/CD pipelines using the malicious Sourcery version.
        * Injection of malware or backdoors into generated code and potentially deployed applications.
        * Large-scale supply chain attack affecting multiple projects using the compromised Sourcery.
    * **Affected Sourcery Component:** Distribution Mechanism (e.g., GitHub Releases, Package Managers).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Download Sourcery only from official and trusted sources.
        * Verify the integrity of downloaded Sourcery binaries using checksums or digital signatures provided by maintainers.
        * Monitor for any signs of compromise in Sourcery's distribution channels or official communication channels.
        * Implement software composition analysis (SCA) tools to detect unexpected changes in dependencies.
        * Consider using code signing and verification mechanisms throughout the development and build pipeline.
