    *   **Mitigation Effectiveness:** **High**. This strategy is highly effective in preventing and recovering from accidental template corruption.
        *   **Version Control:**  Allows for easy rollback to previous versions in case of accidental deletion or modification. Provides a reliable backup and recovery mechanism.
        *   **Access Control:** Reduces the likelihood of accidental changes by limiting the number of individuals with write access.
        *   **Code Review:** While primarily focused on security, code review can also catch accidental errors or unintended changes in template logic before they are merged.
    *   **Residual Risk:** Very Low. Version control provides a strong safety net against accidental corruption.

*   **4.2.3. Information Disclosure (Low Severity - if secrets are improperly handled)**

    *   **Mitigation Effectiveness:** **Medium to High (depending on Secrets Management implementation)**. The effectiveness here is contingent on the proper implementation of secrets management.
        *   **Secrets Management (If Applicable):**  This is the core component addressing this threat. Using a dedicated secrets management solution prevents hardcoding secrets in templates and configuration files, significantly reducing the risk of accidental or malicious information disclosure.
        *   **Access Control:** Restricting access to the repository and template directories also limits the potential exposure of secrets, even if they are inadvertently present.
        *   **Code Review:** Code review processes should specifically look for and flag any hardcoded secrets in templates or configuration files.
    *   **Residual Risk:**  Low to Very Low, if secrets management is properly implemented and enforced. If secrets management is neglected, the risk remains Medium, as hardcoded secrets are vulnerable.

#### 4.3. Strengths of the Mitigation Strategy
