# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for krzysztofzablocki/sourcery

## Mitigation Strategy: [1. Dependency Integrity and Verification](./mitigation_strategies/1__dependency_integrity_and_verification.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Verify Sourcery Release Integrity

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Identify Official Release Channels:** Determine the official sources for Sourcery releases (e.g., GitHub Releases page, official website).
        2.  **Locate Integrity Verification Information:**  Find the cryptographic signatures or checksums provided by the Sourcery maintainers for each release. This is usually available alongside the release files.
        3.  **Download Release and Verification Files:** Download Sourcery and the corresponding signature/checksum files.
        4.  **Verify Signature/Checksum:** Use a cryptographic tool (like `gpg` for signatures or `shasum` for checksums) to verify that the downloaded Sourcery file matches the provided signature or checksum. This confirms the file hasn't been tampered with since it was signed by the maintainers.
        5.  **Use Verified Release:** Only use the Sourcery release if the integrity verification is successful.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Supply Chain Attack (High Severity):**  Malicious actors could compromise the distribution channel and replace legitimate Sourcery releases with backdoored versions. This could lead to the introduction of malicious code into your application during code generation.
        *   **Accidental Corruption (Low Severity):**  Download errors or issues in the distribution infrastructure could lead to corrupted Sourcery binaries, potentially causing unpredictable behavior or build failures.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Supply Chain Attack (High):**  Significantly reduces the risk of using compromised Sourcery binaries.
        *   **Accidental Corruption (Medium):**  Reduces the risk of using corrupted binaries, ensuring a more stable and predictable build process.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented.  Developers are generally aware of downloading from GitHub releases, but formal signature verification is not consistently enforced.

        *   **Location:**  Implicitly during manual download and installation.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   **Automated Verification in CI/CD:**  Integrate automated signature or checksum verification into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure every build uses a verified Sourcery release.
        *   **Developer Guidelines:**  Create and enforce developer guidelines that mandate integrity verification for all Sourcery installations and updates.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Mitigation Strategy: Pin Sourcery Version](./mitigation_strategies/mitigation_strategy_pin_sourcery_version.md)

*   **Description:**
        1.  **Identify Dependency Management Tool:** Determine the dependency management tool used in your project (e.g., Swift Package Manager, CocoaPods, Carthage).
        2.  **Specify Exact Sourcery Version:** In your project's dependency configuration file (e.g., `Package.swift`, `Podfile`, `Cartfile`), explicitly specify the exact version of Sourcery you intend to use. Avoid using version ranges or "latest" specifiers.
        3.  **Commit Configuration:** Commit the updated dependency configuration file to your version control system.
        4.  **Enforce Version Pinning in CI/CD:** Configure your CI/CD pipeline to strictly adhere to the pinned Sourcery version during builds.
