# Threat Model Analysis for krzysztofzablocki/sourcery

## Threat: [Dependency on a Vulnerable Sourcery Version](./threats/dependency_on_a_vulnerable_sourcery_version.md)

*   **Description:** The application relies on Sourcery for code analysis and refactoring. If the specific version of Sourcery being used contains known security vulnerabilities, attackers could potentially exploit these flaws if they can somehow influence the development environment or the CI/CD pipeline where Sourcery is executed. This could lead to arbitrary code execution or other malicious activities within that environment.
*   **Impact:** Potential for arbitrary code execution in the development or build environment, compromise of the build process, potentially leading to the introduction of malicious code into the final application artifact.
*   **Affected Sourcery Component:** Entire Sourcery library.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Sourcery to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Monitor Sourcery's release notes and security advisories for any reported security issues.
    *   Implement dependency scanning tools in the development and CI/CD pipelines to identify outdated or vulnerable dependencies, including Sourcery.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion during Code Analysis](./threats/resource_exhaustion_during_code_analysis.md)

*   **Description:**  A maliciously crafted codebase or a specific set of complex rules could potentially cause Sourcery's analysis engine to consume excessive computational resources (CPU, memory). An attacker could exploit this by submitting code designed to trigger this behavior, leading to denial-of-service conditions in the development environment or CI/CD pipeline where Sourcery is running.
*   **Impact:** Disruption of development workflows, delays in builds and deployments, potential instability of the CI/CD infrastructure.
*   **Affected Sourcery Component:** `Code Parsing`, `Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Generation`, `Rule Execution`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement resource limits and monitoring for Sourcery processes in the CI/CD environment.
    *   Analyze and optimize custom Sourcery rules to prevent inefficient or overly complex analyses.
    *   Consider breaking down very large codebases into smaller modules for analysis to reduce the load on Sourcery.
    *   Implement timeouts for Sourcery analysis tasks to prevent indefinite resource consumption.
