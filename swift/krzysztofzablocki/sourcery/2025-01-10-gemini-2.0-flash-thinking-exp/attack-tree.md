## Attack Tree Path: [Inject malicious code into the application's build process via Sourcery (CRITICAL NODE):](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_into_the_application's_build_process_via_sourcery__critical_node_.md)

This represents the attacker's ultimate objective. Success at this point means the attacker has successfully injected malicious code into the application's codebase during the build process, potentially leading to compromised functionality, data breaches, or other severe consequences when the application is deployed and run.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Processing (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE):](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_processing__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

This attack path focuses on manipulating the input provided to Sourcery. Since Sourcery generates code based on these inputs, injecting malicious content here can directly influence the generated output. This is a critical node as it represents a direct and often effective way to inject malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Malicious Swift File (CRITICAL NODE):](./attack_tree_paths/supply_malicious_swift_file__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts a seemingly valid Swift file containing specific annotations or code structures that exploit vulnerabilities or intended functionality within Sourcery's parsing and code generation logic. This can lead Sourcery to generate unintended or malicious code that is then incorporated into the application.

**Mechanism:** This could involve crafting annotations that trigger the inclusion of arbitrary code, exploiting parsing bugs that lead to unexpected code generation, or leveraging features of Sourcery in unintended ways to introduce vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Malicious Templates (if applicable) (CRITICAL NODE):](./attack_tree_paths/supply_malicious_templates__if_applicable___critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** If Sourcery utilizes templates for code generation, an attacker can provide malicious templates containing harmful code snippets or logic. When Sourcery processes these templates, the malicious code is directly inserted into the generated output.

**Mechanism:** This requires access to the template files or the ability to influence which templates Sourcery uses. The malicious templates would contain code designed to compromise the application's security or functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE):](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

This attack path targets Sourcery's configuration settings. By manipulating these settings, an attacker can indirectly influence Sourcery's behavior and introduce malicious elements into the build process. This is a critical node because controlling the configuration can open up multiple avenues for attack.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Sourcery Configuration Files (CRITICAL NODE):](./attack_tree_paths/modify_sourcery_configuration_files__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to Sourcery's configuration files (e.g., `.sourcery.yml`). Once accessed, they modify these files to alter Sourcery's behavior for malicious purposes.

**Mechanism:** This could involve:
* **Pointing to Malicious Templates:** Changing the configuration to use attacker-controlled templates, leading to the injection of malicious code as described above.
* **Altering Output Directories:** Redirecting the generated code to attacker-controlled locations, potentially allowing for the substitution of legitimate code with malicious versions.
* **Executing Arbitrary Commands:** If Sourcery's configuration allows for the execution of external commands, the attacker could inject malicious commands to be run during the build process.
