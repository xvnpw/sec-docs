# Attack Surface Analysis for krzysztofzablocki/sourcery

## Attack Surface: [Attack Vector: Maliciously Crafted Stencil Templates](./attack_surfaces/attack_vector_maliciously_crafted_stencil_templates.md)

* **Description:** An attacker provides or modifies Stencil templates used by Sourcery to inject malicious code.
    * **How Sourcery Contributes:** Sourcery uses Stencil templates for code generation. If these templates are not properly controlled or sanitized, they can become a vector for injecting arbitrary code.
    * **Example:** An attacker modifies a template to include code that executes shell commands during the Sourcery code generation process, potentially compromising the build server.
    * **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the build server, file system manipulation, information disclosure from the codebase.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Restrict write access to template directories to authorized personnel only.
        * Implement a rigorous review process for all template changes.
        * Consider using a sandboxed environment for Sourcery execution if template sources are untrusted.
        * Avoid allowing external or untrusted sources to provide templates directly.
        * Implement input validation and sanitization on any data used within templates.

## Attack Surface: [Attack Vector: Manipulation of Sourcery Configuration Files (.sourcery.yml)](./attack_surfaces/attack_vector_manipulation_of_sourcery_configuration_files___sourcery_yml_.md)

* **Description:** An attacker modifies the `.sourcery.yml` configuration file to influence Sourcery's behavior maliciously.
    * **How Sourcery Contributes:** Sourcery relies on the `.sourcery.yml` file for configuration, including input and output paths, and included/excluded files.
    * **Example:** An attacker changes the output path in `.sourcery.yml` to overwrite critical application files with generated (or even malicious) code.
    * **Impact:** Overwriting critical files, including malicious templates, potentially leading to application compromise or denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Restrict write access to the `.sourcery.yml` file to authorized personnel only.
        * Implement version control for the `.sourcery.yml` file to track and revert unauthorized changes.
        * Consider using a separate, read-only configuration mechanism if flexibility allows.
        * Regularly audit the contents of the `.sourcery.yml` file.

## Attack Surface: [Attack Vector: Flaws in Sourcery's Code Generation Logic](./attack_surfaces/attack_vector_flaws_in_sourcery's_code_generation_logic.md)

* **Description:** Bugs or design flaws in Sourcery's code generation algorithms lead to the generation of insecure code in the application.
    * **How Sourcery Contributes:** Sourcery's primary function is code generation. Flaws in this logic directly translate to vulnerabilities in the generated code.
    * **Example:** Sourcery incorrectly generates code for handling user input, leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in a web application.
    * **Impact:** Introduction of security vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQL injection, insecure defaults) into the application's codebase.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Thoroughly review the code generated by Sourcery, especially for security-sensitive areas.
        * Implement security testing (static and dynamic analysis) on the generated code.
        * Understand the code generation patterns of Sourcery and identify potential security pitfalls.
        * If feasible, contribute to Sourcery development by reporting and fixing any discovered code generation flaws.

## Attack Surface: [Attack Vector: Compromised Build Environment](./attack_surfaces/attack_vector_compromised_build_environment.md)

* **Description:** The environment where Sourcery is executed is compromised, allowing an attacker to manipulate the Sourcery process or its output.
    * **How Sourcery Contributes:** Sourcery runs as part of the build process. A compromised build environment can directly affect Sourcery's execution and the integrity of the generated code.
    * **Example:** An attacker gains access to the build server and modifies the Sourcery executable or its dependencies to inject malicious code into the generated output.
    * **Impact:** Introduction of backdoors or other malicious code into the application, compromising the integrity of the build process.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strong security measures for the build environment (access control, regular patching, intrusion detection).
        * Use secure build pipelines and infrastructure.
        * Employ integrity checks for build tools and dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Attack Vector: Supply Chain Risks (Compromised Sourcery Distribution)](./attack_surfaces/attack_vector_supply_chain_risks__compromised_sourcery_distribution_.md)

* **Description:** The official Sourcery distribution is compromised, and a malicious version is used.
    * **How Sourcery Contributes:**  Directly using a compromised version of Sourcery introduces malicious code into the build process.
    * **Example:** An attacker compromises the Sourcery GitHub repository or a package manager distribution and injects malicious code into the Sourcery binary.
    * **Impact:**  Introduction of backdoors or other malicious code into the application during the build process.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Verify the integrity of the Sourcery distribution using checksums or signatures.
        * Obtain Sourcery from trusted sources (official GitHub repository, reputable package managers).
        * Be cautious of using unofficial or forked versions of Sourcery.
        * Consider using software composition analysis (SCA) tools to detect potential supply chain risks.
