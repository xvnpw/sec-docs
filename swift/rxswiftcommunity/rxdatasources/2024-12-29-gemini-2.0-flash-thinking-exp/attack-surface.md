Here's the updated key attack surface list, focusing on elements directly involving RxDataSources with high or critical severity:

* **Description:** Malicious Data Injection via Data Source
    * **How RxDataSources Contributes:** RxDataSources' core function is to bind data from a source to UI elements. It directly renders the provided data without inherent sanitization. This means if the data source is compromised and injects malicious content, RxDataSources will display it, leading to potential XSS or UI redress attacks within the application's context.
    * **Example:** An API providing data for a list of articles is compromised, and an attacker injects a malicious `<script>` tag into the title of an article. When RxDataSources renders this title in a `UITableViewCell`, the script executes within the application's web view or UI context.
    * **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks enabling actions on behalf of the user, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites; UI Redress attacks tricking users into unintended actions; potential information disclosure.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Client-Side Output Encoding within `configureCell`:** Developers *must* implement proper output encoding (e.g., escaping HTML entities) within the `configureCell` closure to prevent the interpretation of malicious scripts by the UI rendering engine.
        * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While not directly a mitigation within RxDataSources, implementing CSP headers can limit the damage caused by injected scripts.

* **Description:** Vulnerabilities in Custom Cell/Supplementary View Configuration
    * **How RxDataSources Contributes:** RxDataSources relies on developers to provide custom logic within the `configureCell` and `configureSupplementaryView` closures to populate UI elements with data. Insecure or flawed logic within these closures directly introduces vulnerabilities into the rendering process managed by RxDataSources.
    * **Example:** Inside the `configureCell` closure, a developer constructs a URL for an image download based on data from the data source without proper validation. An attacker could manipulate this data to point to a malicious server or a file that exploits a vulnerability in the image loading library or the operating system.
    * **Impact:** Code injection (if dynamic code execution is involved within the configuration logic), resource exhaustion (if the configuration logic is inefficient or performs unbounded operations), security bypasses if configuration logic interacts with security-sensitive operations without proper checks.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Secure Coding Practices within Configuration Closures:** Developers must adhere to secure coding principles when implementing cell and supplementary view configuration logic. This includes rigorous input validation of data used within these closures, avoiding dynamic code execution based on untrusted data, and implementing proper error handling to prevent unexpected behavior.
        * **Code Reviews Focusing on Configuration Logic:**  Specific attention should be paid during code reviews to the logic within `configureCell` and `configureSupplementaryView` to identify potential security flaws.
        * **Principle of Least Privilege for Configuration Logic:** Ensure the code within the configuration closures has only the necessary permissions and access to perform its intended function, minimizing the potential impact of a vulnerability.
