# Threat Model Analysis for rxswiftcommunity/rxdatasources

## Threat: [Malicious Data Injection via Observable Streams](./threats/malicious_data_injection_via_observable_streams.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Data Injection via Observable Streams
*   **Description:** An attacker can inject malicious data by compromising or influencing the observable streams that RxDataSources uses to populate UI elements. This crafted data can exploit vulnerabilities in custom cell rendering logic, potentially leading to serious consequences. The attacker manipulates data sources feeding into RxDataSources, inserting payloads designed to trigger exploits when processed and displayed by cells managed by RxDataSources.
*   **Impact:** Application crashes, unexpected and potentially harmful behavior, memory corruption vulnerabilities in cell rendering, and in critical scenarios, remote code execution if cell rendering logic is susceptible to such attacks.
*   **Affected RxDataSources Component:** Data source binding process, specifically the observable sequences consumed by `RxTableViewSectionedReloadDataSource`, `RxCollectionViewSectionedReloadDataSource`, and their processing within RxDataSources to update the UI.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement rigorous validation and sanitization of all data *before* it is pushed into observable streams consumed by RxDataSources.
    *   **Enforce Data Type Safety:** Strictly enforce data types within observable streams to match the expected types for cell configuration, preventing unexpected data interpretations.
    *   **Secure Observable Operations:** Apply secure coding practices within observable chains, carefully reviewing operations that handle data to avoid introducing vulnerabilities.
    *   **Thorough Code Reviews:** Conduct in-depth code reviews focusing on data processing pipelines and custom cell configuration logic to identify and eliminate potential injection points.

## Threat: [Observable Stream Flooding (DoS)](./threats/observable_stream_flooding__dos_.md)

*   **Threat:** Observable Stream Flooding (DoS)
*   **Description:** An attacker can perform a Denial of Service (DoS) attack by controlling the emission rate of observable sequences feeding RxDataSources. By flooding the UI with rapid updates, the attacker can overwhelm the application's UI rendering capabilities. This is achieved by manipulating data sources to emit an excessive number of updates in a short timeframe, forcing RxDataSources to process and render these updates rapidly.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service, application becomes unresponsive, UI freezes, excessive consumption of device resources (CPU, memory, battery), leading to a degraded user experience or application crashes.
*   **Affected RxDataSources Component:** RxDataSources' UI update mechanism, specifically how it processes and reacts to rapid emissions from observable sequences and triggers UI re-rendering.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement Rate Limiting/Throttling:** Utilize RxSwift operators like `throttle`, `debounce`, or `sample` to control the rate of updates processed by RxDataSources, especially for observables sourced from external or potentially untrusted sources.
    *   **Optimize Data Diffing:** Ensure efficient data diffing by correctly implementing section and item identity functions, minimizing unnecessary UI updates triggered by RxDataSources.
    *   **Background Data Processing:** Perform data processing and transformations on background threads *before* pushing data to observable streams, reducing the load on the UI thread during updates.
    *   **Resource Monitoring and Limits:** Implement monitoring of application resource usage and potentially introduce limits on update frequency to prevent resource exhaustion during rapid data updates.
