# Attack Surface Analysis for rxswiftcommunity/rxdatasources

## Attack Surface: [1. Observable Data Injection Vulnerability (High Severity)](./attack_surfaces/1__observable_data_injection_vulnerability__high_severity_.md)

*   **Description:**  Malicious data injected into Observable streams consumed by `rxdatasources` can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the UI if cell rendering logic improperly handles the data as code.
*   **How rxdatasources Contributes:** `rxdatasources` directly renders data from Observables in UI cells. If these Observables carry malicious payloads, `rxdatasources` will display them.
*   **Example:** An attacker injects a comment containing malicious JavaScript into an API response that feeds an Observable used by `rxdatasources`. If cell configuration naively renders this comment as HTML, the JavaScript executes within the app's context.
*   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in UI, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or malicious actions performed on behalf of the user.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all data from untrusted sources *before* it enters Observable streams.
    *   **Secure Cell Rendering:** Ensure cell configuration treats data as data, not code. Avoid interpreting data as HTML or JavaScript unless strictly necessary and securely implemented with proper encoding and Content Security Policy (CSP) if applicable.

## Attack Surface: [2. Logic Flaws in Custom Cell Configuration (High Severity)](./attack_surfaces/2__logic_flaws_in_custom_cell_configuration__high_severity_.md)

*   **Description:** Insecure deserialization vulnerabilities can arise in custom cell configuration logic if it deserializes data from Observables without proper validation, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code.
*   **How rxdatasources Contributes:** `rxdatasources` relies on developers to implement cell configuration. If this configuration includes insecure deserialization of data from `rxdatasources`'s data source Observables, it becomes a vulnerability point.
*   **Example:** Cell configuration logic deserializes data from an Observable using a vulnerable deserialization library. An attacker crafts a malicious serialized object in the data stream. When `rxdatasources` configures the cell, this object is deserialized, leading to remote code execution.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing attackers to gain full control of the application and potentially the user's device.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Insecure Deserialization:**  Do not use insecure deserialization methods in cell configuration. If deserialization is necessary, use secure and well-vetted libraries and practices.
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate the structure and content of deserialized data to ensure it conforms to expected formats and does not contain malicious payloads.
    *   **Code Reviews:** Rigorously review cell configuration code for potential insecure deserialization vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [3. Vulnerabilities in Custom Delegate/DataSource Implementations (High Severity - in specific scenarios)](./attack_surfaces/3__vulnerabilities_in_custom_delegatedatasource_implementations__high_severity_-_in_specific_scenari_5b405109.md)

*   **Description:**  If custom delegate/dataSource methods, interacting with data managed by `rxdatasources`, perform sensitive actions without proper authorization or validation, privilege escalation or unauthorized data modification can occur.
*   **How rxdatasources Contributes:** `rxdatasources` manages the data flow to UI elements, and developers often implement delegate methods to handle user interactions with this data.  Vulnerabilities in these delegate implementations, when acting on `rxdatasources` data, are relevant to the library's attack surface in the context of application usage.
*   **Example:**  `tableView:didSelectRowAt:` retrieves user data associated with a selected row from `rxdatasources` and attempts to modify user permissions based on this data. If the delegate method lacks proper authorization checks and relies solely on client-side data from `rxdatasources` without server-side validation, an attacker could manipulate the data to escalate their privileges.
*   **Impact:** Privilege Escalation, Unauthorized Data Modification, potentially leading to significant security breaches and data integrity issues.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (when sensitive actions are performed based on data from `rxdatasources` in delegate methods without proper security measures)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Server-Side Authorization:** Always perform authorization checks on the server-side for sensitive actions triggered by user interactions in delegate/dataSource methods. Do not rely solely on client-side data from `rxdatasources` for authorization decisions.
    *   **Input Validation in Delegates:** Validate any data retrieved from `rxdatasources` or user interactions within delegate methods before using it to perform actions, especially sensitive ones.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure delegate/dataSource methods only have the necessary permissions to perform their intended actions and avoid granting excessive privileges.

## Attack Surface: [4. Dependency on RxSwift Vulnerabilities (Critical Severity - potential)](./attack_surfaces/4__dependency_on_rxswift_vulnerabilities__critical_severity_-_potential_.md)

*   **Description:** Critical vulnerabilities in the underlying RxSwift library can directly impact applications using `rxdatasources`, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution or other severe exploits.
*   **How rxdatasources Contributes:** `rxdatasources` is built upon RxSwift.  A critical vulnerability in RxSwift directly translates to a potential critical vulnerability in any application using `rxdatasources` with the vulnerable RxSwift version.
*   **Example:** A hypothetical critical vulnerability in RxSwift's core Observable processing logic allows for remote code execution when processing a specially crafted Observable sequence. Applications using `rxdatasources` and the vulnerable RxSwift version become susceptible to RCE if their data sources can be manipulated to deliver such a malicious Observable.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), or other critical security breaches, depending on the nature of the RxSwift vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (potential, depending on RxSwift vulnerabilities)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Immediate RxSwift Updates:**  Promptly update RxSwift to the latest stable version whenever security updates are released.
    *   **Vulnerability Monitoring:** Continuously monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for RxSwift and `rxdatasources` dependencies.
    *   **Dependency Scanning:** Implement automated dependency scanning tools to detect known vulnerabilities in RxSwift and other dependencies within your project.
