## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Data Validation and Sanitization for Data Sources used with RxDataSources](./mitigation_strategies/input_data_validation_and_sanitization_for_data_sources_used_with_rxdatasources.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Strict Input Validation and Sanitization for RxDataSources
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify RxDataSources Usage:** Locate all instances in your application where `RxDataSources` is used to populate UI elements like `UITableView` or `UICollectionView`.
    2.  **Trace Data Flow:** For each `RxDataSources` instance, trace the flow of data from its origin (e.g., network response, database, user input) to the point where it's consumed by `RxDataSources`.
    3.  **Implement Validation Before RxDataSources:**  Insert validation and sanitization steps *before* the data reaches the `RxDataSources` binding. This can be achieved using RxSwift operators within the reactive chain:
        *   **`map` operator:** Transform data streams to apply validation logic and throw errors for invalid data.
        *   **`filter` operator:**  Remove invalid data items from the stream before they reach `RxDataSources`.
        *   **`do(onNext:)` operator:** Perform side effects like validation checks and logging without altering the data stream itself.
    4.  **Sanitize for UI Context:**  Sanitize data specifically considering the UI context where `RxDataSources` will display it. For example:
        *   **HTML Encoding:** If `RxDataSources` is used to display data that might be interpreted as HTML in a `WKWebView` or similar, encode HTML entities to prevent XSS.
        *   **URL Encoding:** If displaying URLs, ensure they are properly encoded to prevent injection attacks.
        *   **Data Type Coercion:**  Ensure data types are as expected by the UI elements and `RxDataSources` to prevent unexpected rendering or crashes.
    5.  **Handle Validation Errors in Rx Streams:** Use RxSwift error handling operators (like `catchError`) to gracefully manage validation failures within the reactive streams feeding `RxDataSources`. Provide fallback data or user-friendly error messages instead of crashing or displaying corrupted UI.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in UI (via data displayed by RxDataSources):** Severity: High
    *   **Data Injection (exploiting data displayed by RxDataSources):** Severity: Medium
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (via malicious data overwhelming RxDataSources rendering):** Severity: Medium

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS in UI:** High reduction - Directly prevents XSS vulnerabilities by ensuring data displayed via `RxDataSources` is safe.
    *   **Data Injection:** Medium reduction - Reduces the risk of data injection by validating data before it's used by `RxDataSources` for UI updates.
    *   **DoS (via malicious data):** Medium reduction - Mitigates DoS by preventing `RxDataSources` from processing and rendering excessively large or malformed data.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented:** Basic data type validation exists in network layers *before* data reaches the data source level, but not specifically tailored for `RxDataSources` usage.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **RxSwift Stream Validation:** Validation logic is not consistently integrated within the RxSwift streams *feeding* `RxDataSources`.
    *   **UI Context Sanitization:** Sanitization is not specifically implemented considering the UI rendering context of `RxDataSources` (e.g., HTML encoding for web views).
    *   **Error Handling in RxDataSources Streams:** Robust error handling within RxSwift streams that directly populate `RxDataSources` is not fully implemented to manage validation failures gracefully.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Handling of Sensitive Data Displayed by RxDataSources](./mitigation_strategies/secure_handling_of_sensitive_data_displayed_by_rxdatasources.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Sensitive Data Minimization and Masking in RxDataSources Display
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Data in RxDataSources:** Review all data sources used with `RxDataSources` and pinpoint data fields that contain sensitive information (PII, financial data, secrets, etc.) that are being displayed in the UI.
    2.  **Minimize Sensitive Data in Data Sources:**  Refactor data models and data retrieval logic to minimize the amount of sensitive data included in the data sources used by `RxDataSources`. Only include the *necessary* sensitive data for display purposes.
    3.  **Implement UI Masking within RxDataSources Cell Configuration:**  Within the cell configuration logic of your `RxDataSources` (e.g., in `cellForRowAt` or similar methods), implement UI-level masking or obfuscation for sensitive data *before* it's displayed in UI elements. Examples:
        *   Displaying only the last few digits of a credit card number in a `UILabel` within a `UITableViewCell`.
        *   Masking parts of an email address or phone number displayed in a `UICollectionViewCell`.
    4.  **Avoid Logging Sensitive Data from RxDataSources:** Ensure that logging mechanisms do not inadvertently log sensitive data that is being processed or displayed by `RxDataSources`. Implement log masking or filtering to remove sensitive information before logging.
    5.  **Secure Data Retrieval for RxDataSources:** When fetching data for `RxDataSources` from backend services or local storage, ensure secure data retrieval practices are in place (HTTPS, encrypted storage) to protect sensitive data *before* it even reaches `RxDataSources`.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (of sensitive data displayed by RxDataSources in UI):** Severity: High
    *   **Information Disclosure (of sensitive data logged from RxDataSources processing):** Severity: Medium

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (UI):** High reduction - Significantly reduces the risk of unintentional exposure of sensitive data directly in the UI rendered by `RxDataSources`.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Logs):** Medium reduction - Mitigates the risk of sensitive data being inadvertently logged during `RxDataSources` data processing and display.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented:** HTTPS is used for network requests, which helps secure data *before* it reaches `RxDataSources`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Data Minimization for RxDataSources:** No systematic review to minimize sensitive data specifically within data sources used by `RxDataSources`.
    *   **UI Masking in RxDataSources Cells:** UI masking is not consistently implemented within `RxDataSources` cell configuration for sensitive data fields.
    *   **Logging Restrictions for RxDataSources Data:** Specific logging restrictions are not in place to prevent logging sensitive data handled by `RxDataSources`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Error Handling in Reactive Streams Populating RxDataSources](./mitigation_strategies/error_handling_in_reactive_streams_populating_rxdatasources.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Robust Error Handling in Rx Streams Feeding RxDataSources
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Focus on RxDataSources Streams:** Specifically target the RxSwift streams that are used to provide data to `RxDataSources` (e.g., streams bound to `items(dataSource:)` or similar methods).
    2.  **Implement Error Handling Operators in RxDataSources Streams:** Within these specific RxSwift streams, implement comprehensive error handling using operators like:
        *   `catchError`: To intercept errors during data retrieval or processing *before* they reach `RxDataSources`. Use this to provide fallback data (e.g., an empty section or a section with an error message cell) to `RxDataSources` in case of errors.
        *   `onErrorResumeNext`: To replace the error-producing stream with a new observable that provides a default or error state to `RxDataSources`.
        *   `do(onError:)`: To perform error logging or other side effects when errors occur in the data streams for `RxDataSources`, without interrupting the stream flow (if using `catchError` or `onErrorResumeNext` to recover).
    3.  **Provide User-Friendly Error UI via RxDataSources:**  Design UI elements (e.g., custom cells) that can be displayed by `RxDataSources` to represent error states gracefully. When an error occurs in the data stream, use `catchError` or `onErrorResumeNext` to emit data that `RxDataSources` can use to display these error UI elements (e.g., a cell with a "Failed to load data" message and a retry button).
    4.  **Prevent Error Propagation to RxDataSources Rendering:** Ensure that unhandled errors in the data streams do not propagate directly to `RxDataSources` rendering logic, potentially causing crashes or unexpected UI behavior. Error handling should be implemented to *contain* errors within the reactive streams and provide controlled error states to `RxDataSources`.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Application Instability/Crashes (due to unhandled errors in RxDataSources data streams):** Severity: Medium
    *   **Poor User Experience (due to error states not handled gracefully in RxDataSources UI):** Severity: Medium
    *   **Potential Information Disclosure (via verbose error messages displayed in RxDataSources UI):** Severity: Low

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Application Instability/Crashes:** Medium reduction - Improves application stability by preventing crashes caused by errors in data streams used by `RxDataSources`.
    *   **User Experience:** Medium reduction - Enhances user experience by providing graceful error handling and informative error UI within `RxDataSources`-driven lists.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Error Messages):** Low reduction - Reduces the risk of accidentally displaying overly detailed or sensitive error messages in the UI managed by `RxDataSources`.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented:** Basic error handling exists in some network requests, but not specifically tailored for providing error UI states to `RxDataSources`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Error Handling in all RxDataSources Streams:** Error handling is not consistently implemented in *all* RxSwift streams that directly populate `RxDataSources`.
    *   **Error UI via RxDataSources:** No dedicated UI elements or data models are implemented to represent error states within `RxDataSources`-driven lists.
    *   **Controlled Error States for RxDataSources:** Error handling is not consistently used to provide controlled error states to `RxDataSources`, potentially leading to unhandled errors reaching rendering logic.
