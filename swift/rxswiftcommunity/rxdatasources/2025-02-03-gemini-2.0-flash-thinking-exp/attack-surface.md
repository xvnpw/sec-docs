# Attack Surface Analysis for rxswiftcommunity/rxdatasources

## Attack Surface: [Unintended Data Exposure through Cell Configuration](./attack_surfaces/unintended_data_exposure_through_cell_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information is inadvertently displayed in the user interface due to improper cell configuration logic within `rxdatasources` data binding.
    *   **rxdatasources Contribution:** `rxdatasources`'s data binding mechanism directly connects data to UI elements in cells.  Incorrect configuration within `rxdatasources` cell providers can lead to sensitive data being unintentionally rendered in the UI.
    *   **Example:** Using `rxdatasources` to display a list of user profiles, the cell configuration directly binds a user's Social Security Number from the data model to a visible text label in the cell, instead of a less sensitive identifier or masked representation.
    *   **Impact:** Privacy breach, potential identity theft, financial loss, severe regulatory penalties (e.g., GDPR, CCPA violations).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Implement Strict Data Masking:**  Always mask or redact sensitive data within cell configuration logic *before* it is bound to UI elements managed by `rxdatasources`. Display only the necessary, non-sensitive portions of data.
        *   **Enforce Access Control in Data Preparation:** Ensure data provided to `rxdatasources` for display has already undergone access control checks at a prior layer.  Do not rely on UI-level checks within cell configuration for security.
        *   **Regular Security Reviews of Cell Configuration:** Conduct thorough security reviews of all cell configuration code used with `rxdatasources` to identify and rectify potential unintended data exposure vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Injection Vulnerabilities Exploited via `rxdatasources` Displayed Content (Indirect)](./attack_surfaces/injection_vulnerabilities_exploited_via__rxdatasources__displayed_content__indirect_.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious data, originating from a compromised or vulnerable data source, is displayed through cells configured by `rxdatasources`. This data contains injection payloads that are then interpreted by the client application due to insecure cell content handling.
    *   **rxdatasources Contribution:** `rxdatasources` serves as the display layer, rendering data within cells. If cell configuration logic attempts to interpret or process data received via `rxdatasources` (e.g., rendering HTML, constructing URLs) without proper sanitization, it can become a vector for exploiting injection vulnerabilities originating elsewhere.
    *   **Example:** A compromised backend API injects malicious JavaScript code into user-generated content. `rxdatasources` displays this content in a cell. If the cell configuration uses a web view to render this content or attempts to dynamically construct URLs based on the content without sanitization, the malicious script can execute (XSS) or a malicious URL can be crafted and opened.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), leading to session hijacking, account takeover, data theft, redirection to phishing sites, and other client-side attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mandatory Input Sanitization at Data Source:** Implement robust and mandatory input validation and sanitization on all data sources *before* data is provided to `rxdatasources`. Prevent injection at the source.
        *   **Strict Output Encoding in Cell Configuration:** When displaying data in cells via `rxdatasources`, especially from external or untrusted sources, use strict output encoding (e.g., HTML encoding, URL encoding) to neutralize any potential injection payloads.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP) Implementation:** Implement a strong Content Security Policy to limit the capabilities of content rendered within the application, mitigating the impact of XSS even if it occurs.
        *   **Avoid Dynamic Interpretation of Cell Content:** Minimize or completely avoid dynamically interpreting or executing content displayed in cells (e.g., avoid rendering dynamic HTML or constructing URLs from raw cell data). If necessary, use secure and well-vetted libraries for such operations with rigorous sanitization.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in RxSwift](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_rxswift.md)

*   **Description:** Critical security vulnerabilities are discovered and exploited within the RxSwift library, upon which `rxdatasources` is built.
    *   **rxdatasources Contribution:** `rxdatasources` directly depends on RxSwift.  Applications using `rxdatasources` inherit the security posture of the RxSwift version they are using. Vulnerabilities in RxSwift directly translate to vulnerabilities in applications using `rxdatasources`.
    *   **Example:** A remote code execution vulnerability is identified in a specific version of RxSwift. Applications using `rxdatasources` and that vulnerable RxSwift version become susceptible to remote code execution attacks if exploited.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, complete application compromise, data breaches, server-side attacks originating from client-side vulnerabilities, full system takeover.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Proactive Dependency Management and Updates:** Implement a proactive dependency management strategy. Regularly monitor for security advisories related to RxSwift and `rxdatasources`. Immediately update to the latest patched versions of RxSwift and `rxdatasources` upon release of security fixes.
        *   **Automated Dependency Scanning:** Integrate automated dependency scanning tools into the development pipeline to continuously monitor for known vulnerabilities in RxSwift and other dependencies.
        *   **Security Audits of Dependencies:** Periodically conduct security audits of all project dependencies, including RxSwift, to identify and address potential vulnerabilities beyond publicly known CVEs.
