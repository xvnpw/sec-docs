# Threat Model Analysis for rxswiftcommunity/rxdatasources

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in `rxdatasources` or RxSwift Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in__rxdatasources__or_rxswift_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit publicly known security vulnerabilities within the `rxdatasources` library itself or its core dependency, RxSwift. This could involve leveraging exploits targeting specific versions of these libraries. Attackers might identify the application's dependency versions through various means (e.g., analyzing application bundles, network traffic if version information is inadvertently exposed, or by exploiting other vulnerabilities to gain internal application information). Once a vulnerable version is identified, attackers can utilize existing exploits to compromise the application.
    *   **Impact:**  Depending on the specific vulnerability, the impact can range from **critical** (remote code execution, complete application takeover, data breach, full system compromise if the application has elevated privileges) to **high** (significant information disclosure, denial of service, unauthorized access to sensitive functionalities, data manipulation).
    *   **RxDataSources Component Affected:** `rxdatasources` library module, RxSwift dependency module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the specific vulnerability discovered and its exploitability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Proactive Dependency Management:** Implement a robust process for tracking and managing dependencies, including `rxdatasources` and RxSwift.
        *   **Regular Updates:**  Establish a schedule for regularly updating `rxdatasources` and RxSwift to the latest stable versions. Prioritize updates that include security patches.
        *   **Security Monitoring:** Subscribe to security advisories and release notes for RxSwift and `rxdatasources` to stay informed about reported vulnerabilities and recommended updates.
        *   **Dependency Scanning:** Integrate dependency scanning tools into the development pipeline to automatically identify known vulnerabilities in project dependencies during build and testing phases.
        *   **Vulnerability Remediation Plan:**  Develop and maintain a plan for promptly addressing and remediating any identified vulnerabilities in `rxdatasources` or RxSwift, including a process for testing and deploying patched versions of the application.
        *   **Secure Development Practices:** Follow secure coding practices to minimize the application's attack surface and reduce the potential impact of any exploited dependency vulnerabilities. This includes input validation, output encoding, and principle of least privilege.
