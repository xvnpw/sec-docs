## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Compromise Data Source (External API/DB)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_compromise_data_source__external_apidb_.md)

*   **1.1.1 Compromise Data Source (External API/DB)**
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: High
    *   Effort: Medium
    *   Skill Level: Intermediate
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
    *   Actionable Insight: Secure backend data sources, implement strong authentication and authorization.
    *   Attack Vector: Attacker targets vulnerabilities in the backend systems (API, database, etc.) that serve data to the application. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to inject malicious data directly at the source, which will then be consumed and displayed by the application through RxDataSources. This can lead to data corruption, application malfunction, or even complete compromise depending on the nature of the injected data and backend vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.3 Application Logic Flaws in Data Processing Before RxDataSources](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_3_application_logic_flaws_in_data_processing_before_rxdatasources.md)

*   **1.1.3 Application Logic Flaws in Data Processing Before RxDataSources**
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: Medium
    *   Effort: Low to Medium
    *   Skill Level: Beginner to Intermediate
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
    *   Actionable Insight: Thoroughly validate and sanitize data before passing it to RxDataSources, implement input validation.
    *   Attack Vector: Attacker exploits flaws in the application's code that processes data *before* it is passed to RxDataSources for display. This could involve vulnerabilities in data transformation, filtering, or aggregation logic. By crafting specific inputs, the attacker can manipulate the data in a way that leads to unintended consequences in the UI, data corruption, or potentially further exploitation if the flawed logic has security implications.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.3 Logic Bugs in `cellForItemAt` or similar delegate methods leading to unexpected UI behavior](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_3_logic_bugs_in__cellforitemat__or_similar_delegate_methods_leading_to_unexpected_ui_behavior.md)

*   **1.2.3 Logic Bugs in `cellForItemAt` or similar delegate methods leading to unexpected UI behavior**
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: Low to Medium
    *   Effort: Low
    *   Skill Level: Beginner
    *   Detection Difficulty: Low to Medium
    *   Actionable Insight: Carefully review and test custom cell configuration logic, especially when handling user-controlled data.
    *   Attack Vector: Attacker leverages logic errors within the custom cell configuration code (e.g., in `cellForItemAt` delegate method). These errors can be triggered by specific data inputs, leading to unexpected UI behavior such as incorrect data display, UI glitches, or even information disclosure if sensitive data is inadvertently shown in the wrong context. While impact is generally lower than data source compromise, it can still lead to user confusion and potentially expose vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1 Sending Extremely Large Datasets](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1_sending_extremely_large_datasets.md)

*   **2.1.1 Sending Extremely Large Datasets**
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: Medium to High
    *   Effort: Low
    *   Skill Level: Beginner
    *   Detection Difficulty: Low
    *   Actionable Insight: Implement pagination and data limits on the backend and in the application, avoid loading excessively large datasets at once.
    *   Attack Vector: Attacker floods the application with requests for extremely large datasets. If the application is not properly designed to handle this (e.g., lacks pagination, data limits), it can lead to resource exhaustion, causing application slowdown, unresponsiveness, or even crashes. This is a classic Denial of Service (DoS) attack targeting application resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.2 Rapid and Continuous Data Updates](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_2_rapid_and_continuous_data_updates.md)

*   **2.1.2 Rapid and Continuous Data Updates**
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: Medium
    *   Effort: Low
    *   Skill Level: Beginner
    *   Detection Difficulty: Low
    *   Actionable Insight: Implement rate limiting on data updates, optimize UI rendering performance, consider debouncing or throttling updates.
    *   Attack Vector: Attacker sends a rapid stream of data updates to the application. If the application's UI rendering and data processing are not optimized for this scenario, it can lead to UI unresponsiveness, application slowdown, and potentially crashes due to overload. This is another form of DoS attack, focusing on overwhelming the application's update handling capabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.3 Memory Leaks due to Improper Resource Management in Data Handling](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_3_memory_leaks_due_to_improper_resource_management_in_data_handling.md)

*   **2.1.3 Memory Leaks due to Improper Resource Management in Data Handling**
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: Medium
    *   Effort: Low to Medium
    *   Skill Level: Beginner to Intermediate
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
    *   Actionable Insight: Use Instruments (or similar tools) to profile application for memory leaks, ensure proper disposal of RxSwift subscriptions and resources.
    *   Attack Vector: Attacker exploits memory leaks in the application's data handling logic, particularly related to RxSwift subscriptions and resource management. By triggering specific data flows or usage patterns, the attacker can cause the application to gradually consume more and more memory. Eventually, this leads to application slowdown, instability, and crashes due to memory exhaustion.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.1 Injecting Data that Triggers Expensive Computations in Data Mapping](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_1_injecting_data_that_triggers_expensive_computations_in_data_mapping.md)

*   **2.2.1 Injecting Data that Triggers Expensive Computations in Data Mapping**
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: Medium
    *   Effort: Low to Medium
    *   Skill Level: Beginner to Intermediate
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
    *   Actionable Insight: Optimize data transformation logic, avoid complex computations on the main thread, use background threads for heavy processing.
    *   Attack Vector: Attacker crafts data inputs that, when processed by the application's data mapping or transformation logic, trigger computationally expensive operations. If these operations are not optimized or performed on background threads, they can lead to CPU exhaustion, causing application slowdown, UI unresponsiveness, and battery drain. This is a resource exhaustion attack targeting CPU usage.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.2 Inefficient `diffIdentifier` or `identity` implementations leading to excessive diffing](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_2_inefficient__diffidentifier__or__identity__implementations_leading_to_excessive_diffing.md)

*   **2.2.2 Inefficient `diffIdentifier` or `identity` implementations leading to excessive diffing**
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: Medium
    *   Effort: Low
    *   Skill Level: Beginner
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
    *   Actionable Insight: Ensure `diffIdentifier` and `identity` are efficient and correctly implemented for data models, avoid unnecessary object comparisons.
    *   Attack Vector: Attacker exploits inefficient implementations of `diffIdentifier` or `identity` properties in data models used with RxDataSources. These properties are crucial for the diffing algorithm used by RxDataSources to update the UI efficiently. Inefficient implementations (e.g., complex object comparisons, always returning different identifiers) can lead to excessive and unnecessary diffing calculations, resulting in CPU exhaustion, UI slowdown, and battery drain, especially with large datasets.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1.1 Incorrect Section/Item Mapping leading to Data Exposure or Incorrect Display](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_1_incorrect_sectionitem_mapping_leading_to_data_exposure_or_incorrect_display.md)

*   **3.1.1 Incorrect Section/Item Mapping leading to Data Exposure or Incorrect Display**
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: Low to Medium
    *   Effort: Low
    *   Skill Level: Beginner
    *   Detection Difficulty: Low
    *   Actionable Insight: Thoroughly test data mapping logic, ensure correct section and item identification, review data flow from source to UI.
    *   Attack Vector: Attacker exploits misconfigurations or errors in how the application maps data to sections and items within RxDataSources. This can lead to incorrect data being displayed in the UI, data being shown in the wrong sections, or even sensitive data being inadvertently exposed in unintended contexts. While not a direct compromise of data integrity, it can lead to information disclosure and user confusion.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1.2 Weak Error Handling in RxSwift Streams leading to Application Crashes or Unexpected State](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_2_weak_error_handling_in_rxswift_streams_leading_to_application_crashes_or_unexpected_state.md)

*   **3.1.2 Weak Error Handling in RxSwift Streams leading to Application Crashes or Unexpected State**
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: Medium
    *   Effort: Low
    *   Skill Level: Beginner
    *   Detection Difficulty: Low
    *   Actionable Insight: Implement robust error handling in RxSwift streams using `catchError`, `onErrorReturn`, etc., gracefully handle errors and prevent application crashes.
    *   Attack Vector: Attacker triggers errors in the RxSwift data streams that RxDataSources relies on. If error handling is weak or missing, these errors can propagate and cause application crashes or lead to unexpected application states. This can be achieved by sending invalid data, causing network errors, or exploiting other error conditions that are not gracefully handled in the RxSwift stream.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1.3 Exposing Sensitive Data in Logs or Debug Output during RxDataSources operations](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_3_exposing_sensitive_data_in_logs_or_debug_output_during_rxdatasources_operations.md)

*   **3.1.3 Exposing Sensitive Data in Logs or Debug Output during RxDataSources operations**
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: Low to Medium
    *   Effort: Low
    *   Skill Level: Beginner
    *   Detection Difficulty: Low to Medium
    *   Actionable Insight: Disable verbose logging in production builds, avoid logging sensitive data, implement secure logging practices.
    *   Attack Vector: Attacker gains access to application logs or debug output that inadvertently contain sensitive data related to RxDataSources operations (e.g., data being displayed, user identifiers, API keys). This can occur if developers leave verbose logging enabled in production or fail to sanitize logs properly. Access to these logs can lead to information disclosure and potentially further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2.1 Injecting Data that Violates Expected Data Structure causing Parsing Errors](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_1_injecting_data_that_violates_expected_data_structure_causing_parsing_errors.md)

*   **3.2.1 Injecting Data that Violates Expected Data Structure causing Parsing Errors**
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: Medium
    *   Effort: Low
    *   Skill Level: Beginner
    *   Detection Difficulty: Low
    *   Actionable Insight: Implement robust data parsing and validation, handle unexpected data structures gracefully, use type-safe data models.
    *   Attack Vector: Attacker sends data that deviates from the expected data structure that the application anticipates when using RxDataSources. If the application lacks robust data parsing and validation, this can lead to parsing errors, application crashes, or incorrect data handling. In some cases, if parsing is resource-intensive and error handling is poor, it can also contribute to Denial of Service.
