# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business priorities and goals
  - Simplify development of iOS applications using reactive programming principles.
  - Provide reusable and efficient data source implementations for `UITableView` and `UICollectionView`.
  - Improve developer productivity by reducing boilerplate code for data management in lists and grids.
  - Enable more maintainable and testable codebases in iOS projects.
- Business risks
  - Security vulnerabilities in the library could be inherited by applications that depend on it, potentially leading to data breaches or application instability.
  - Lack of active maintenance or community support could lead to unaddressed security issues and compatibility problems in the future.
  - Dependency on RxSwift framework introduces a transitive dependency risk, where vulnerabilities in RxSwift could also impact applications using `rxdatasources`.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing security controls
  - security control: Open source development model, which allows for community review and contribution. Implemented on GitHub.
  - security control: Publicly accessible codebase, enabling transparency and external security audits. Implemented on GitHub.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability identification and patching.
  - accepted risk: Lack of formal security audits or penetration testing.
  - accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities to be introduced by contributors.
- Recommended security controls
  - security control: Implement automated static code analysis (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to detect potential code-level vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Integrate dependency scanning to identify known vulnerabilities in RxSwift and other dependencies.
  - security control: Establish a process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities, including a security policy and contact information.
  - security control: Consider code signing for releases to ensure integrity and authenticity of the library.
- Security requirements
  - Authentication: Not applicable, as the library itself does not handle authentication. Applications using the library will be responsible for their own authentication mechanisms.
  - Authorization: Not applicable, as the library itself does not handle authorization. Applications using the library will be responsible for their own authorization mechanisms.
  - Input validation: The library should handle data provided to data sources robustly, validating inputs to prevent unexpected behavior or crashes. Input validation should be implemented within the library's data processing logic.
  - Cryptography: Not directly applicable, as the library is focused on data presentation. If applications using the library handle sensitive data, they are responsible for implementing appropriate encryption and decryption mechanisms outside of the library's scope.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical business process: Development of iOS applications that rely on efficient and maintainable data presentation in lists and grids. Disruption or compromise of the `rxdatasources` library could impact the development and security of these applications.
- Data to protect:
  - Source code of the `rxdatasources` library: Sensitivity is high, as unauthorized access or modification could lead to vulnerabilities being introduced or intellectual property theft.
  - Integrity of published packages: Sensitivity is high, as compromised packages could be distributed to developers, leading to widespread vulnerabilities in applications using the library.
  - Indirectly, data handled by applications using `rxdatasources`: Sensitivity depends on the nature of the data within those applications. `rxdatasources` itself is not designed to handle sensitive data directly, but vulnerabilities could potentially be exploited in the context of a larger application.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS
