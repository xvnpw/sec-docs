## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Exploit Weak Input Validation in Data Source (if applicable)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_exploit_weak_input_validation_in_data_source__if_applicable_.md)

*   **[***1.1.1 Inject XSS Payloads into String Fields***] (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):**
    *   **Description:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript (or other client-side code) into string fields that are displayed by the application without proper sanitization.  RxDataSources then renders this malicious content, leading to code execution in the user's context.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Bypass Data Source Sanitization](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_bypass_data_source_sanitization.md)

*   **[1.2.1 Tamper with Network Traffic to Modify Data] (High-Risk Path):**
    *   **Description:** The attacker intercepts and modifies the network traffic between the application and the data source.  This allows them to bypass any server-side validation and inject malicious data directly into the data stream that RxDataSources consumes. *This is only high-risk if HTTPS is not properly implemented.*
    *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (High without HTTPS)
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

*   **[***1.2.2 Modify Data in Database (if RxDataSources Reads Directly)***] (Critical Node):**
    *   **Description:** The attacker gains unauthorized access to the database and directly modifies the data that RxDataSources reads. This bypasses all application-level security controls.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** High to Very High
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced to Expert
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2 Inject Invalid Data Types](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_inject_invalid_data_types.md)

*    **[***2.2.2 Send Extremely Large Data Sets***] (Critical Node, High Risk Path):**
    *   **Description:** The attacker sends excessively large data sets (e.g., very long strings, huge arrays) to the application. This can overwhelm the UI components managed by RxDataSources, leading to performance degradation, UI freezes, or even a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
    *    **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
    *    **Impact:** Medium to High
    *    **Effort:** Low
    *    **Skill Level:** Novice
    *    **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1 Trigger Excessive Reloads/Updates](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_trigger_excessive_reloadsupdates.md)

*   **[3.1.1 Flood with Data Changes] (Part of High-Risk Path from 2.2.2):**
    *   **Description:** The attacker rapidly changes the data source, causing RxDataSources to trigger frequent UI updates. This can overwhelm the UI thread and lead to unresponsiveness, especially when combined with large datasets.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
