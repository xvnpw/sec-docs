# Attack Surface Analysis for rxswiftcommunity/rxdatasources

## Attack Surface: [Data Injection (XSS, Data Corruption, DoS)](./attack_surfaces/data_injection__xss__data_corruption__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious data is introduced into the data source, leading to severe consequences like code execution or application instability.
*   **RxDataSources Contribution:** RxDataSources acts as the *direct conduit* for data to reach UI elements.  While it doesn't *create* the vulnerability, its role in binding data makes it a critical part of the attack chain.  It's the "delivery mechanism" for the injected data.
*   **Example:**
    *   An attacker injects a string containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` into a text field that is *directly bound* to a `UITableView` cell's text label via RxDataSources.  The lack of sanitization *before* reaching RxDataSources allows the script to be passed to the UI.
    *   An attacker sends a very large JSON payload that is *immediately* used to update an RxDataSources-managed `UICollectionView`, causing the app to freeze due to excessive UI updates triggered by the library.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the application's context (Critical).
    *   **Data Corruption:** Modification or corruption of the application's internal data model, potentially leading to further vulnerabilities (High).
    *   **DoS:** Application becomes unresponsive or crashes due to excessive UI updates or data processing (High).
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (for XSS), **High** (for Data Corruption/DoS)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement rigorous validation *before* data reaches the RxDataSources binding. Use whitelisting and type checks. This is the *most crucial* mitigation.
    *   **Data Sanitization:** Escape or encode data appropriately *before* it's passed to RxDataSources, especially if it will be rendered as HTML.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Limit the frequency and size of data updates *sent to* RxDataSources to prevent DoS attacks.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** If rendering web content that might be influenced by the data source, use CSP to restrict script execution.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Data Modification](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_data_modification.md)

*   **Description:** Untrusted code within the application gains direct access to the `Observable` sequence (e.g., `BehaviorRelay`, `PublishRelay`) that *powers* the RxDataSources data source and modifies it.
*   **RxDataSources Contribution:** This attack vector is *entirely* about the exposure of RxDataSources' internal data management mechanisms (the `Observable` sequences).  The vulnerability exists because the application allows direct manipulation of these sequences.
*   **Example:** A compromised third-party library obtains a reference to the `BehaviorRelay` that is used as the input for an `RxTableViewSectionedReloadDataSource`.  It then calls `.accept()` on this relay with malicious data, bypassing all intended application logic and directly altering the table view's contents.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data corruption within the data source, leading to incorrect UI display and potential application instability (High).
    *   Bypassing of security checks and business logic that should have been applied before data reaches the UI (High).
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** *Never* expose the underlying `Subject` or `Relay` directly.  Use `asObservable()` to provide a read-only view of the data stream. This is the *primary* defense.
    *   **Access Control:** Use Swift's access control keywords (private, fileprivate, etc.) to strictly limit which parts of the code can access the data source's underlying observable.
    *   **Code Reviews:** Thoroughly review all code that interacts with RxDataSources to ensure that the underlying observables are not leaked or misused.
    *   **Dependency Injection:** Use dependency injection to control the flow of data sources and prevent unauthorized access. Inject `Observable` instances, not mutable subjects.
