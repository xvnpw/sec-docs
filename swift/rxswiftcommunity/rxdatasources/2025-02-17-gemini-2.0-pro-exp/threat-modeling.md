# Threat Model Analysis for rxswiftcommunity/rxdatasources

## Threat: [High-Frequency UI Update DoS](./threats/high-frequency_ui_update_dos.md)

*   **Threat:** High-Frequency UI Update DoS (Direct RxDataSources Involvement)

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability *elsewhere* in the application or its data source to cause a very high frequency of updates to be emitted on the `Observable` bound to RxDataSources.  Even with RxDataSources' internal diffing, an extremely high rate can overwhelm the UI thread. This is a direct threat to RxDataSources because it's the component responsible for handling these updates and updating the UI.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Application becomes unresponsive (UI freezes).
        *   Application crashes due to excessive resource consumption on the main thread.
        *   User experience is severely degraded.
    *   **Affected RxDataSources Component:** The `bind(to:)` method (or similar binding methods) and the internal diffing algorithm within RxDataSources are directly affected. The diffing algorithm, while designed for efficiency, has limits.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Throttling/Debouncing (Pre-Binding):** Use RxSwift operators like `throttle` or `debounce` *before* the `bind(to:)` call to RxDataSources. This is crucial to prevent the flood of updates from even reaching RxDataSources.
        *   **Distinct Until Changed (Pre-Binding):** Use the `distinctUntilChanged` operator *before* binding, ensuring a correct `Equatable` implementation for your data models, to prevent unnecessary updates.
        *   **Rate Limiting at the Source (External):** If possible, implement rate limiting at the data source (e.g., server-side API) â€“ this is a defense-in-depth measure.
        *   **Background Processing (Pre-Binding):** Perform data processing and filtering on a background thread, and only update the UI on the main thread using `observe(on: MainScheduler.instance)`. This prevents heavy computation from blocking the UI thread *before* RxDataSources is even involved.
        *   **Error Handling (Within Binding Logic):** While less direct, consider adding error handling *within* the binding logic (e.g., using `catchError` on the Observable) to detect and potentially mitigate extremely high update rates, perhaps by displaying an error or temporarily unsubscribing.

## Threat: [Uncontrolled Observable Modification Leading to UI Manipulation](./threats/uncontrolled_observable_modification_leading_to_ui_manipulation.md)

* **Threat:** Uncontrolled Observable Modification Leading to UI Manipulation (Indirect, but RxDataSources is the Display Vector)
    * **Description:** Although the *root cause* is external access to the `Observable`, RxDataSources is the *mechanism* through which the manipulated data is presented to the user. An attacker, having gained access to the `Observable` feeding RxDataSources, injects malicious data. RxDataSources then dutifully displays this data, potentially leading to security consequences. This is included because RxDataSources is the *direct* point of UI interaction.
    * **Impact:**
        * Display of incorrect/misleading information.
        * Triggering unintended actions if UI data influences application logic (e.g., incorrect prices, modified user roles).
        * Potential bypass of security checks if displayed data is used for authorization.
    * **Affected RxDataSources Component:** The `bind(to:)` method and the associated data binding mechanism are the direct components involved. RxDataSources is displaying whatever data it receives on the bound `Observable`.
    * **Risk Severity:** High (Potentially Critical if the data influences security-sensitive operations).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Strict Access Control (External):** The *primary* mitigation is to make the `Subject`/`Relay` driving the RxDataSources `private` or `internal`. This prevents external modification.
        * **Immutable Data Models (Within Observable):** Use immutable data models within the `Observable` stream. This makes modification more difficult.
        * **Data Validation (Pre-Binding):** Implement robust data validation *before* the data is emitted onto the `Observable` that is bound to RxDataSources.
        * **Input Sanitization (External):** If data originates from user input, sanitize it thoroughly *before* it enters the Observable stream.
        * **Defensive Programming (Within Binding/Cell Configuration):** Design the application and the cell configuration within RxDataSources to handle unexpected or invalid data gracefully.
        * **Code Review (All Related Code):** Thoroughly review the code related to the Observable, data models, and RxDataSources binding.

## Threat: [Data Model Exposure via Incorrect Binding](./threats/data_model_exposure_via_incorrect_binding.md)

*   **Threat:** Data Model Exposure via Incorrect Binding (Direct RxDataSources Usage)

    *   **Description:** The data models used with RxDataSources contain sensitive information. A programming error *within the RxDataSources binding configuration* (e.g., in the `cellFactory` or custom cell configuration within `bind(to:)`) causes this sensitive data to be directly displayed in the UI. This is a *direct* threat because it stems from how RxDataSources is used to configure the UI.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Information disclosure (privacy violations, security breaches).
        *   Exposure of credentials.
    *   **Affected RxDataSources Component:** The `cellFactory` closure or the custom cell configuration code within the `bind(to:)` method (or equivalent binding methods) is the *direct* source of the vulnerability. This is where the mapping between data model properties and UI elements occurs.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Separate UI Models (Pre-Binding):** Create separate data models specifically for UI presentation, containing *only* the necessary data. This is the most important mitigation.
        *   **Data Transformation (Pre-Binding):** Use RxSwift operators (e.g., `map`, `compactMap`) *before* binding to RxDataSources to transform the original data models into the UI-specific models.
        *   **Data Masking/Redaction (Within Binding/Cell Configuration):** If sensitive data *must* be partially displayed, implement masking/redaction *within* the `cellFactory` or custom cell configuration.
        *   **Code Review (Binding Configuration):** *Carefully* review the UI binding code within the `cellFactory` or custom cell configuration. This is the most critical area to review.
        *   **UI Testing (Automated Verification):** Use UI testing frameworks to automatically verify that sensitive data is *not* exposed in the UI.
