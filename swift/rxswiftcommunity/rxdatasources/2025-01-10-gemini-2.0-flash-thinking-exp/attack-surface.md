# Attack Surface Analysis for rxswiftcommunity/rxdatasources

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Data Injection via Data Sources](./attack_surfaces/malicious_data_injection_via_data_sources.md)

* **Description:** An attacker injects malicious data into the application's data sources that are then used by RxDataSources to populate UI elements.
    * **How RxDataSources Contributes:** RxDataSources directly consumes the data provided in the data sources and uses it to configure cells and sections *without inherent sanitization*. This means if the application provides unsanitized data, RxDataSources will faithfully render it, potentially leading to vulnerabilities.
    * **Example:** An attacker manipulates an API response that populates a `titleForHeaderInSection` string with JavaScript code. RxDataSources passes this string to the UI framework, which might execute the script if not properly handled there.
    * **Impact:**
        * Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if the injected data is interpreted as code by the UI framework.
        * Data manipulation or corruption within the application's UI.
        * Denial of Service (DoS) if the injected data causes excessive resource consumption during rendering.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all data *before* it is used to populate the data sources for RxDataSources.
        * **Output Encoding/Escaping:** Ensure the UI framework used with RxDataSources properly encodes or escapes data when rendering it.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Cell Configuration Logic](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_cell_configuration_logic.md)

* **Description:** The `configureCell` closure provided to RxDataSources contains insecure logic that can be exploited.
    * **How RxDataSources Contributes:** RxDataSources *delegates the responsibility of cell configuration* to the developer through the `configureCell` closure. This means any security flaws in the logic within this closure directly become part of the application's attack surface when using RxDataSources.
    * **Example:** The `configureCell` closure takes a URL string from the data source and directly loads it into a web view without validation.
    * **Impact:**
        * URL Redirection to malicious websites.
        * Local file access (depending on the UI component used within the cell).
        * Potential for other vulnerabilities depending on the actions performed within the `configureCell` closure.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Secure Coding Practices in `configureCell`:** Implement secure coding practices within the `configureCell` closure. Avoid directly using untrusted data in sensitive operations.
        * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the cell configuration logic only performs necessary actions.
        * **Input Validation within `configureCell`:** Consider adding checks within the `configureCell` closure for critical operations, even if data is validated elsewhere.
