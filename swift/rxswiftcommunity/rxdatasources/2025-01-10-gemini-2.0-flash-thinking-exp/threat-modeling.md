# Threat Model Analysis for rxswiftcommunity/rxdatasources

## Threat: [Race Conditions Leading to Inconsistent UI](./threats/race_conditions_leading_to_inconsistent_ui.md)

* **Threat:** Race Conditions Leading to Inconsistent UI
    * **Description:** An attacker might trigger rapid or concurrent data updates, exploiting potential race conditions within the `RxDataSources` update mechanism. This could lead to the UI displaying an inconsistent state, missing updates, or even crashing.
    * **Impact:** An inconsistent UI can confuse users, make the application appear unreliable, and potentially lead to data loss or corruption if the UI state doesn't reflect the actual data state.
    * **Affected RxDataSources Component:** The core diffing and updating mechanisms within `RxDataSources` (e.g., `RxTableViewSectionedReloadDataSource`, `RxCollectionViewSectionedReloadDataSource`).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Ensure proper synchronization and thread-safety when handling data updates that feed into `RxDataSources`.
        * Use appropriate reactive operators (e.g., `debounce`, `throttle`, `observe(on: MainScheduler())`) *before* data reaches the `RxDataSources` data source.
        * Thoroughly test scenarios with rapid and concurrent data updates.

## Threat: [Denial of Service through Excessive UI Updates](./threats/denial_of_service_through_excessive_ui_updates.md)

* **Threat:** Denial of Service through Excessive UI Updates
    * **Description:** An attacker could intentionally trigger a massive number of data updates, potentially by manipulating the backend data source or exploiting a vulnerability in the application's update logic. This could overwhelm the `RxDataSources` update mechanism, leading to UI freezes, application unresponsiveness, and potentially crashing the application.
    * **Impact:** Application becomes unusable, leading to user frustration and potentially business disruption. On mobile devices, this could also lead to excessive battery drain.
    * **Affected RxDataSources Component:** The core diffing and updating mechanisms within `RxDataSources`.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement rate limiting or throttling on data updates *before* they are processed by `RxDataSources`.
        * Optimize data diffing and UI update logic for performance within the application's use of `RxDataSources`.
        * Monitor application performance and resource usage to detect and mitigate excessive update scenarios.

## Threat: [Security Vulnerabilities in Custom Cell Configuration](./threats/security_vulnerabilities_in_custom_cell_configuration.md)

* **Threat:** Security Vulnerabilities in Custom Cell Configuration
    * **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities within the custom code used to configure cells when using `RxDataSources` (e.g., via the `configureCell` closure). This could involve injecting malicious scripts if the cell displays web content or exploiting insecure handling of user input within the cell.
    * **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) if displaying web content, arbitrary code execution if the cell interacts with system functionalities insecurely, or information disclosure if sensitive data is mishandled.
    * **Affected RxDataSources Component:** The mechanism by which `RxDataSources` allows for custom cell configuration (e.g., closures provided to data sources).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Sanitize and validate any user-provided data before displaying it in cells within the configuration logic.
        * Avoid displaying untrusted web content directly within cells without proper security measures.
        * Follow secure coding practices when handling user input and interacting with external systems within cell configuration logic.
