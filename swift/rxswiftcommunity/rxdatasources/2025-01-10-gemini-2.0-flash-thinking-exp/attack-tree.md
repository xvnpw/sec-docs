# Attack Tree Analysis for rxswiftcommunity/rxdatasources

Objective: Compromise application data integrity by injecting malicious data through the data source.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
**Title:** Threat Model: RxDataSources Application - High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes

**Sub-Tree (High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes):**

Attack: Compromise Application Using RxDataSources [HIGH-RISK PATH]
  OR
  Attack: Manipulate Displayed Data [HIGH-RISK PATH]
    OR
    Attack: Inject Malicious Data Through Data Source [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]
      AND
      Condition: Application uses an external, potentially untrusted data source.
      Attack: Modify external data source to include malicious data.
        Insight: RxDataSources will reflect the changes in the data source.
        Actionable Insight: Implement strict input validation and sanitization on data received from external sources *before* feeding it to RxDataSources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using RxDataSources](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_rxdatasources.md)

**High-Risk Path: Compromise Application Using RxDataSources -> Manipulate Displayed Data**

*   **Description:** This path represents the overarching goal of an attacker seeking to compromise the application by altering the data presented to the user. Success along this path can lead to misinformation, incorrect user actions, and a loss of trust in the application.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Moderate
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Displayed Data](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_displayed_data.md)

**High-Risk Path: Compromise Application Using RxDataSources -> Manipulate Displayed Data**

*   **Description:** This path represents the overarching goal of an attacker seeking to compromise the application by altering the data presented to the user. Success along this path can lead to misinformation, incorrect user actions, and a loss of trust in the application.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Moderate
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Data Through Data Source](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_data_through_data_source.md)

**High-Risk Path: Compromise Application Using RxDataSources -> Manipulate Displayed Data -> Inject Malicious Data Through Data Source**

*   **Description:** This more specific path details how an attacker can achieve data manipulation by targeting the application's data source. By successfully injecting malicious data at the source, the attacker ensures that the compromised information is consistently displayed throughout the application wherever that data is used by RxDataSources.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (depends on data source security)
*   **Impact:** Moderate to Significant (depending on the nature of the malicious data)
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium (depending on data source access)
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate (depending on data source vulnerabilities)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate to Difficult (may require monitoring data source changes)

**Critical Node: Inject Malicious Data Through Data Source**

*   **Description:** This node represents a critical point of compromise. If an attacker gains the ability to inject malicious data directly into the data source, they effectively control the information displayed by the application. This can have significant consequences, as the application will faithfully present the attacker's manipulated data to users.
*   **Attack Vector:** Modify external data source to include malicious data.
    *   **Condition:** The application relies on an external data source that is not adequately secured against unauthorized modification.
    *   **Attacker Action:** The attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the data source's security mechanisms (e.g., weak authentication, SQL injection, API vulnerabilities) to insert or modify data records.
    *   **Impact:** The injected malicious data is then retrieved and displayed by the application through RxDataSources, potentially leading to:
        *   Displaying false or misleading information to users.
        *   Triggering unintended actions within the application based on the manipulated data.
        *   Damaging the credibility and trustworthiness of the application.
        *   Potentially facilitating further attacks if the malicious data contains scripts or links.
    *   **Insight:** RxDataSources acts as a faithful mirror of the data it receives. If the source is compromised, the displayed information will be compromised.
    *   **Actionable Insight:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for accessing and modifying the data source.
        *   Apply strict input validation and sanitization to all data *before* it is stored in the data source to prevent injection attacks.
        *   Regularly monitor the data source for unauthorized changes or suspicious activity.
        *   Consider using read-only access for the application where modification is not necessary.
        *   Implement data integrity checks to detect and potentially revert unauthorized modifications.
