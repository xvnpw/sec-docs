    *   Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to logs to only authorized personnel.
    *   Encrypt log data both in transit (e.g., using TLS/SSL for log shipping) and at rest (e.g., using disk encryption for log storage).
    *   Implement log rotation and retention policies to manage log volume and comply with data retention regulations.
    *   Consider centralized logging solutions for improved security monitoring and management of logs from distributed applications.
    *   Regularly audit and review access controls and security configurations of the logging infrastructure.

**5. Review `rxalamofire` Log Output Regularly for Sensitive Data:**
