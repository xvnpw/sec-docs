## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Unhandled Errors in Rx Chains](./threats/information_disclosure_via_unhandled_errors_in_rx_chains.md)

**Threat:** Information Disclosure via Unhandled Errors in Rx Chains

    *   **Description:** RxAlamofire wraps Alamofire's networking calls in RxSwift observables.  If an error occurs within this reactive chain (e.g., a network error, a parsing error from a malformed server response, or a server-side error), and this error is *not* properly handled using RxSwift's error handling operators, sensitive information within the error object (which might include API keys in headers, internal server error details, or even parts of the response) can be leaked.  This is *more* dangerous in Rx than traditional imperative code because the error might propagate through multiple operators before surfacing, making it harder to track and handle correctly. The attacker could monitor logs or observe user interface.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Confidentiality breach: Sensitive information (API keys, internal server details, potentially user data) could be exposed to unauthorized parties (users, log files, monitoring systems).
    *   **Affected RxAlamofire Component:** The *entire* Rx observable chain created by RxAlamofire methods (e.g., `request(...).responseJSON()`, `requestData(...)`, etc.) is vulnerable.  Specifically, the *absence* or incorrect implementation of error handling operators like `catchError`, `catchErrorJustReturn`, `materialize`, and custom error handling logic within `subscribe` blocks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mandatory Error Handling:**  Enforce a coding standard that *requires* explicit error handling for *every* RxAlamofire observable chain.  Use linters or code review processes to ensure this.
        *   **Centralized Error Handling:** Implement a centralized error handling mechanism (e.g., a custom `Observable` extension or a dedicated error handling service) to ensure consistent and secure error handling across the application.  This mechanism should sanitize error messages before displaying them to the user or logging them.
        *   **Never Expose Raw Errors:**  Absolutely prohibit exposing raw `Error` objects from Alamofire or the server directly to the user interface.  Always map them to user-friendly, non-sensitive error messages.
        *   **Secure Logging:**  If error details *must* be logged, ensure that any sensitive information (API keys, tokens, etc.) is *always* redacted or masked before logging.  Use a dedicated logging framework with appropriate security controls.

## Threat: [Request Tampering via Misuse of Reactive Operators](./threats/request_tampering_via_misuse_of_reactive_operators.md)

**Threat:** Request Tampering via Misuse of Reactive Operators

    *   **Description:** While `RequestInterceptor` is an Alamofire component, RxAlamofire's reactive nature introduces a *new* vector for request tampering.  Developers might use custom RxSwift operators (or misuse existing ones) to modify the `URLRequest` *within* the observable chain *after* RxAlamofire has created it but *before* Alamofire sends it.  This is less obvious than a direct `RequestInterceptor` modification and harder to detect in code reviews. For example, a poorly written `map` or `flatMap` operator could alter the URL, headers, or body in unintended ways.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Integrity violation: The request sent to the server could be significantly different from what the application developer intended, leading to unpredictable behavior, data corruption, or even security vulnerabilities on the server-side if the tampered request bypasses server-side validation.
        *   Potential for other attacks: A maliciously crafted operator could be used to inject malicious data, bypass security checks, or redirect the request to a completely different (malicious) server.
    *   **Affected RxAlamofire Component:** Any custom RxSwift operators used within the RxAlamofire observable chain that interact with the `URLRequest` object.  This includes operators like `map`, `flatMap`, `concatMap`, `flatMapLatest`, and any custom operators created by the development team.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Restrict Request Modification:**  Establish a strict coding guideline that *strongly discourages* modifying the `URLRequest` object directly within the Rx chain *after* it's been created by RxAlamofire.  If modifications are absolutely necessary, they should be done through Alamofire's `RequestInterceptor` (with all the usual precautions for interceptors).
        *   **Favor Built-in Operators:**  Prioritize using built-in RxAlamofire and Alamofire methods for request configuration.  Avoid custom operators that directly manipulate the `URLRequest`.
        *   **Thorough Code Reviews:**  Code reviews should specifically focus on any custom operators used within RxAlamofire chains, paying close attention to how they interact with the `URLRequest`.
        *   **Unit Testing of Operators:**  Any custom operators that *do* modify the `URLRequest` must be thoroughly unit-tested to ensure they behave as expected and don't introduce any unintended side effects or security vulnerabilities.  This testing should include negative test cases to check for potential injection vulnerabilities.
