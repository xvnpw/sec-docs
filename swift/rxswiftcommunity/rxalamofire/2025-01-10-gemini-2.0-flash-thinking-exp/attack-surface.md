# Attack Surface Analysis for rxswiftcommunity/rxalamofire

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can induce the application to make HTTP requests to arbitrary destinations.
    *   **How RxAlamofire Contributes:** RxAlamofire directly provides the functionality used by the application to execute these potentially malicious HTTP requests based on URLs it is given. If the application constructs these URLs using untrusted input, RxAlamofire becomes the tool that carries out the SSRF attack.
    *   **Example:** The application uses a user-provided URL to fetch content using RxAlamofire. An attacker provides a URL pointing to an internal service (`http://localhost:8080/admin`), and RxAlamofire sends a request to this internal endpoint.
    *   **Impact:** Access to internal resources, information disclosure, potential remote code execution on internal systems, acting as a proxy for further attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all URL inputs used with RxAlamofire.
        *   Use allow-lists of permitted domains or protocols for requests made via RxAlamofire.
        *   Avoid directly constructing request URLs by concatenating user input.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Header Handling (Header Injection)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_header_handling__header_injection_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious headers into HTTP requests made by the application.
    *   **How RxAlamofire Contributes:** RxAlamofire allows developers to set custom headers for requests. If the application incorporates unsanitized user-provided data into these headers when using RxAlamofire, it creates an opportunity for header injection.
    *   **Example:** The application allows users to customize a "User-Agent" header. An attacker injects a malicious header like `X-Forwarded-For: <script>alert('XSS')</script>` which is then sent by RxAlamofire and potentially mishandled by intermediary servers or logged unsafely.
    *   **Impact:** Account Takeover, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in specific scenarios, Information Disclosure, Session Fixation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize and validate all user-provided data before setting it as a request header in RxAlamofire.
        *   Use predefined header options where possible instead of allowing arbitrary input.
        *   Implement proper logging and monitoring to detect suspicious header activity originating from RxAlamofire requests.
