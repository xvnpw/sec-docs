## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE: Inject Malicious Headers](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_&_critical_node_inject_malicious_headers.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The application takes user-provided input and directly uses it to set HTTP headers when making requests via RxAlamofire.
*   **Exploitation:** An attacker can craft malicious header values.
*   **Potential Outcomes:**
    *   **HTTP Response Splitting:** If the server doesn't properly sanitize headers, the attacker can inject additional headers and body into the response, potentially leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or cache poisoning.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE: Inject Malicious Query Parameters](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_&_critical_node_inject_malicious_query_parameters.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The application uses user-provided input to construct the query parameters of a URL used in an RxAlamofire request.
*   **Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious code or commands into the query parameters.
*   **Potential Outcomes:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** If the backend uses these parameters in a database query without proper sanitization, the attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to data breaches or modification.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE: Inject Malicious Request Body](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_&_critical_node_inject_malicious_request_body.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The application uses user-provided input to build the body of an HTTP request (e.g., in POST requests) made via RxAlamofire.
*   **Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious code or commands into the request body.
*   **Potential Outcomes:**
    *   **Command Injection:** If the backend processes the request body and executes commands based on it without proper sanitization, the attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server.
    *   **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** If the backend parses XML data from the request body without proper configuration, the attacker can include external entities that allow them to access local files or internal network resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH: Manipulate Request Destination - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_manipulate_request_destination_-_server-side_request_forgery__ssrf_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The application uses user-provided input to construct the URL for an RxAlamofire request, and this URL points to an internal resource or a resource accessible from the server but not directly from the outside.
*   **Exploitation:** An attacker manipulates the URL to target internal endpoints.
*   **Potential Outcomes:**
    *   **Access to Internal Systems:** The attacker can make requests to internal services or APIs that are not exposed to the public internet, potentially gaining access to sensitive data or functionalities.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH: Exploit Insecure Deserialization](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_insecure_deserialization.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The application receives data from a network response handled by RxAlamofire and deserializes it (e.g., using `JSONDecoder`). If the deserialization process is not configured securely or the data source is untrusted, it can be exploited.
*   **Exploitation:** An attacker crafts a malicious server response containing serialized data that, when deserialized by the application, executes arbitrary code.
*   **Potential Outcomes:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution:** The attacker can gain the ability to execute arbitrary code within the application's process.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in the Specific Alamofire Version](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_&_critical_node_exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_the_specific_alamofire_version.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The application uses a version of Alamofire (the underlying networking library) that has known security vulnerabilities. RxAlamofire, being a wrapper, exposes these vulnerabilities.
*   **Exploitation:** An attacker leverages publicly known exploits for the specific version of Alamofire being used.
*   **Potential Outcomes:**
    *   **Various Impacts:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in Alamofire. This could include bypassing certificate pinning, arbitrary code execution, or other security breaches.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Lack of Input Validation on Data Used in Requests](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_&_critical_node_exploit_lack_of_input_validation_on_data_used_in_requests.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The application does not properly validate or sanitize user-provided input before using it in network requests made via RxAlamofire.
*   **Exploitation:** This lack of validation is the root cause that enables the "Inject Malicious Headers", "Inject Malicious Query Parameters", and "Inject Malicious Request Body" attacks.
*   **Potential Outcomes:**
    *   **Enables Injection Attacks:** As detailed above, this lack of validation opens the door to various injection vulnerabilities, leading to severe consequences.
