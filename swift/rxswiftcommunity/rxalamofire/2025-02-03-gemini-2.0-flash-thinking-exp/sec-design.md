# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a reactive programming interface for Alamofire, a popular HTTP networking library for Swift.
  - Simplify asynchronous network operations in Swift applications using RxSwift.
  - Enhance developer productivity by offering a more declarative and composable way to handle network requests and responses.
  - Maintain compatibility and feature parity with Alamofire.
  - Ensure the library is performant and reliable for use in production applications.
- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in RxAlamofire could be inherited by applications that depend on it, leading to potential data breaches or service disruptions.
  - Poor performance or instability of the library could negatively impact the user experience of applications using it.
  - Lack of ongoing maintenance and updates could result in the library becoming outdated, insecure, or incompatible with newer versions of Swift, Alamofire, or RxSwift.
  - Incorrect or incomplete implementation of reactive wrappers could introduce unexpected behavior or errors in network handling.
  - Adoption risk if developers find the library too complex or not beneficial compared to using Alamofire directly or other alternatives.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Open Source Code - The library is publicly available on GitHub, allowing for community review and scrutiny, which can help identify potential security vulnerabilities. Implemented in: GitHub Repository.
  - security control: Dependency on Alamofire - RxAlamofire relies on Alamofire, inheriting its security features and practices. Described in: Alamofire documentation and project.
  - security control: Dependency on RxSwift - RxAlamofire relies on RxSwift, inheriting its security considerations. Described in: RxSwift documentation and project.
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in Dependencies - RxAlamofire depends on external libraries (Alamofire, RxSwift, Swift standard library), and vulnerabilities in these dependencies could indirectly affect RxAlamofire and applications using it.
  - accepted risk: Misuse by Developers - Developers using RxAlamofire might misuse the library or integrate it insecurely into their applications, leading to security issues.
  - accepted risk: Lack of Formal Security Audits - As an open-source community project, RxAlamofire may not undergo regular, formal security audits by dedicated security firms.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Dependency Scanning - Implement automated dependency scanning to identify known vulnerabilities in Alamofire, RxSwift, and other dependencies.
  - security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) - Integrate SAST tools into the development process to automatically analyze the RxAlamofire codebase for potential security flaws.
  - security control: Regular Security Review - Conduct periodic security reviews of the RxAlamofire codebase, focusing on areas that handle network requests and data processing.
  - security control: Secure Development Practices - Follow secure coding practices during development, including input validation, secure error handling, and avoiding common vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Documentation on Secure Usage - Provide clear documentation and examples on how to use RxAlamofire securely, including best practices for handling sensitive data and authentication.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: RxAlamofire itself does not handle authentication, but it must facilitate the secure implementation of authentication mechanisms by client applications using it.
    - Requirement: Support for passing authentication tokens and credentials securely within HTTP requests (e.g., using headers, secure storage).
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: RxAlamofire itself does not handle authorization, but it must not hinder the implementation of authorization logic in client applications.
    - Requirement: Ensure that responses from the server, including authorization decisions, are handled correctly and securely by client applications.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: While primarily the responsibility of applications using RxAlamofire, the library itself should avoid introducing vulnerabilities through improper handling of inputs.
    - Requirement: Ensure that any input processing within RxAlamofire (e.g., handling request parameters, response data) is done securely and does not lead to injection vulnerabilities.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: RxAlamofire relies on Alamofire and the underlying operating system for cryptographic operations (e.g., TLS/SSL).
    - Requirement: Ensure that RxAlamofire does not weaken or bypass any cryptographic protections provided by Alamofire or the underlying platform.
    - Requirement: Support for secure communication protocols (HTTPS) and proper certificate validation should be maintained.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Secure and reliable network communication for Swift applications using RxAlamofire.
  - Maintaining the integrity and availability of the RxAlamofire library for the Swift developer community.
  - Protecting applications that depend on RxAlamofire from inheriting vulnerabilities.
- Data Sensitivity:
  - RxAlamofire itself does not directly handle or store sensitive data.
  - Data sensitivity depends entirely on the applications that use RxAlamofire and the backend services they interact with.
  - RxAlamofire is a conduit for data transmission; the sensitivity of data transmitted through RxAlamofire is determined by the applications and backend services involved.
  - Potential data types handled by applications using RxAlamofire could include: User credentials, personal information, financial data, application-specific data, API keys, and other sensitive information depending on the application's purpose.
