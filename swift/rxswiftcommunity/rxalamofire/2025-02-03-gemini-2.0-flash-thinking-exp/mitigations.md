## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Robust Error Handling in RxSwift Streams for RxAlamofire Requests](./mitigation_strategies/implement_robust_error_handling_in_rxswift_streams_for_rxalamofire_requests.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Robust Error Handling in RxSwift Streams for RxAlamofire Requests
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Use `catchError` or `onErrorResumeNext` operators for RxAlamofire streams:** In RxSwift streams that handle `rxalamofire` requests, use operators like `catchError` or `onErrorResumeNext` to gracefully handle errors emitted during network operations initiated by `rxalamofire`.
        2.  **Log RxAlamofire errors securely:** Within error handling closures for `rxalamofire` requests, log detailed error information for debugging purposes. Ensure logs are stored securely and access is restricted to authorized personnel. Avoid logging sensitive user data in error logs related to network requests.
        3.  **Sanitize error messages for users from RxAlamofire operations:** When presenting error messages to the user interface that originate from `rxalamofire` operations, sanitize them to remove any sensitive information or technical details that could be exploited by attackers. Provide user-friendly, generic error messages related to network failures.
        4.  **Implement fallback mechanisms for RxAlamofire failures:** In error handling for `rxalamofire` requests, implement fallback mechanisms to gracefully handle network failures. This could involve retrying requests (with appropriate retry strategies to avoid DoS), displaying cached data, or providing alternative functionality when network requests fail.
        5.  **Avoid re-throwing RxAlamofire errors without handling:** Avoid simply re-throwing errors from `rxalamofire` operations up the stream without proper handling. This can lead to unhandled exceptions and potential application crashes or information leaks related to network communication issues.
        6.  **Test error handling scenarios for RxAlamofire requests:** Thoroughly test error handling logic for various network error conditions that can occur during `rxalamofire` requests (e.g., network connectivity issues, server errors, invalid responses, timeouts) to ensure robustness and prevent information exposure related to network operations.

        *   Denial of Service (DoS): Low reduction - Reduces the risk of DoS related to error handling of network requests, specifically concerning uncontrolled retries initiated by `rxalamofire`.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. Basic error handling is implemented in some network requests using `catchError` with `rxalamofire`, but sanitization and secure logging of network errors are not consistently applied.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Consistent error message sanitization across all network requests made with `rxalamofire` is missing. Secure logging practices for error information from `rxalamofire` operations need to be implemented. Fallback mechanisms in error handling for `rxalamofire` requests are not consistently applied.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize Error Messages Specifically from RxAlamofire Operations](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_error_messages_specifically_from_rxalamofire_operations.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Sanitize Error Messages Specifically from RxAlamofire Operations
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Identify sensitive information in RxAlamofire errors:** Determine what types of information within error responses or error details from `rxalamofire` are considered sensitive and should not be exposed in error messages (e.g., API keys in URLs, internal server paths revealed in error responses, specific error codes indicating internal system details).
        2.  **Implement error message sanitization logic for RxAlamofire:** Create functions or utility methods to sanitize error messages originating from `rxalamofire` operations before they are displayed to users or logged in publicly accessible logs. This logic should specifically target and remove sensitive information that might be present in network error details.
        3.  **Apply sanitization in RxAlamofire error handling closures:** Within `catchError` or `onErrorResumeNext` closures in RxSwift streams handling `rxalamofire` requests, apply the sanitization logic to error messages before presenting them to the user or logging them in non-secure logs.
        4.  **Log detailed, unsanitized RxAlamofire errors securely:** For debugging purposes, log the original, unsanitized error messages from `rxalamofire` operations in secure logs that are only accessible to authorized developers and administrators. This allows for detailed analysis of network issues without exposing sensitive information publicly.
        5.  **Regularly review RxAlamofire error sanitization logic:** Periodically review and update the error message sanitization logic specifically for `rxalamofire` errors to ensure it remains effective and covers new types of sensitive information that might be exposed through network error responses.

        *   Reduced attack surface: Low reduction - Provides a minor reduction in the information available to attackers regarding network interactions and potential backend details exposed through `rxalamofire` errors.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** No. Error message sanitization specifically for `rxalamofire` errors is not currently implemented in the project. Network error messages are often displayed directly or logged without sanitization.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Error message sanitization logic needs to be developed and implemented in all error handling paths within RxSwift streams used with `rxalamofire`. Secure logging for detailed, unsanitized `rxalamofire` errors needs to be set up.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Properly Dispose of RxSwift Subscriptions Created for RxAlamofire Requests](./mitigation_strategies/properly_dispose_of_rxswift_subscriptions_created_for_rxalamofire_requests.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Properly Dispose of RxSwift Subscriptions Created for RxAlamofire Requests
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Use `DisposeBag` for RxAlamofire subscriptions:** Utilize `DisposeBag` to manage the lifecycle of RxSwift subscriptions specifically created for `rxalamofire` requests. Add subscriptions to a `DisposeBag` associated with the scope where the network request is relevant. When the scope is deallocated, the `DisposeBag` will automatically dispose of all network-related subscriptions.
        2.  **Use `takeUntil` for lifecycle-bound RxAlamofire subscriptions:** For subscriptions to `rxalamofire` requests that should only live as long as a specific event occurs (e.g., until a view is dismissed, or a specific user action completes), use the `takeUntil` operator to automatically unsubscribe when the event occurs, ensuring network resources are released appropriately.
        3.  **Manually dispose of long-lived RxAlamofire subscriptions:** For subscriptions to `rxalamofire` requests that are not easily bound to a lifecycle or event, ensure they are manually disposed of when they are no longer needed. Store these subscriptions in a way that allows for explicit disposal (e.g., storing `Disposable` objects and calling `dispose()` when the network operation is complete or no longer relevant).
        4.  **Avoid creating RxAlamofire subscriptions without disposal:** Always ensure that every RxSwift subscription created in conjunction with `rxalamofire` requests has a mechanism for disposal, either automatic or manual, to prevent resource leaks related to network connections and operations.
        5.  **Monitor for resource leaks related to RxAlamofire:** Monitor application resource usage (e.g., memory, network connections) to detect potential subscription leaks specifically related to `rxalamofire` operations. Tools like memory profilers can help identify undisposed subscriptions associated with network requests.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Resource leaks (memory leaks, network connection leaks) due to undisposed RxAlamofire subscriptions (Severity: High) - Undisposed subscriptions to `rxalamofire` requests can lead to memory leaks and exhaustion of network resources, particularly network connections.
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) due to resource exhaustion from network leaks (Severity: Medium) - Resource leaks from undisposed `rxalamofire` subscriptions can eventually lead to application instability and DoS due to network resource exhaustion.
        *   Performance degradation due to leaked network resources (Severity: Medium) - Leaked network resources from `rxalamofire` subscriptions can degrade application performance over time, especially in scenarios with frequent network requests.

    *   **Impact:**

        *   Performance degradation: Medium reduction - Prevents performance degradation associated with resource leaks, particularly network resource leaks from `rxalamofire` usage.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. `DisposeBag` is used in some parts of the project, but not consistently across all RxSwift subscriptions related to `rxalamofire`. Manual disposal is sometimes used for network requests, but can be error-prone.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Consistent use of `DisposeBag` or `takeUntil` for all RxSwift subscriptions related to `rxalamofire` is missing. A project-wide standard for subscription management specifically for network requests needs to be enforced. Monitoring for subscription leaks related to `rxalamofire` is not actively performed.

        2.  **Implement backpressure operators in RxAlamofire streams:** In RxSwift streams that handle high-volume `rxalamofire` requests, use backpressure operators like `throttle`, `debounce`, `sample`, `buffer`, or `window` to control the rate of network requests or process them in batches. Choose operators appropriate for the specific network request patterns and use case.
        3.  **Implement request queuing or buffering for RxAlamofire:** If network requests initiated by `rxalamofire` cannot be dropped or throttled, implement request queuing or buffering mechanisms to handle bursts of network requests and process them at a manageable rate, preventing overload.
        4.  **Consider server-side rate limiting for RxAlamofire accessed endpoints:** Implement rate limiting on the backend server for API endpoints accessed through `rxalamofire` to protect it from being overwhelmed by excessive requests from the application.

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Validate input data before RxAlamofire requests:** Before incorporating user input or data from other sources into `rxalamofire` request parameters, headers, or bodies, rigorously validate the data. This includes checking data types, formats, ranges, and lengths to ensure data integrity before making network requests.
        2.  **Sanitize input data for RxAlamofire requests:** Sanitize input data to prevent injection attacks when constructing `rxalamofire` requests. Encode or escape special characters in request parameters, headers, and bodies as needed, depending on the context (e.g., URL encoding for URL parameters, JSON encoding for request bodies).
        3.  **Use parameterized queries or prepared statements (if applicable in backend) for RxAlamofire interactions:** If the backend API accessed through `rxalamofire` interacts with databases and requires constructing queries based on user input, ensure the backend uses parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities on the server-side.
        4.  **Avoid constructing RxAlamofire requests directly from raw user input:** Do not directly concatenate raw user input into request URLs or bodies when using `rxalamofire` without validation and sanitization. Use secure methods for building requests, such as using Alamofire's parameter encoding features which are utilized by `rxalamofire`.
        5.  **Review RxAlamofire request construction logic:** Regularly review the code that constructs `rxalamofire` requests within reactive flows to ensure that input validation and sanitization are consistently applied and that no vulnerabilities are introduced in the process of creating network requests.

        2.  **Sanitize response data from RxAlamofire:** Sanitize response data received from `rxalamofire` before using it in the application, especially if it will be displayed to users or used in further processing. This is crucial to prevent client-side injection attacks if the backend is compromised or returns malicious data in network responses.
        3.  **Implement output encoding for RxAlamofire response data:** When displaying response data from `rxalamofire` in user interfaces (e.g., web views, labels), use appropriate output encoding techniques (e.g., HTML encoding, URL encoding) to prevent XSS vulnerabilities if the backend response contains malicious content.
        4.  **Avoid directly trusting server responses from RxAlamofire:** Do not assume that server responses received via `rxalamofire` are always safe and trustworthy. Always validate and sanitize data received from external sources, even from trusted backends, to protect against compromised servers or malicious responses.
        5.  **Review RxAlamofire response processing logic:** Regularly review the code that processes `rxalamofire` responses within reactive flows to ensure that data validation and sanitization are consistently applied and that no vulnerabilities are introduced during response handling from network operations.
