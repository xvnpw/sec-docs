## Attack Tree Path: [1. Attack Goal: Compromise Application via Reachability.swift Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1__attack_goal_compromise_application_via_reachability_swift_exploitation__critical_node___high-risk_12d9d2ea.md)

This is the ultimate objective of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized control or causing significant disruption to the application by manipulating its perception of network connectivity through vulnerabilities related to `reachability.swift` usage.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. 1. Manipulate Application Behavior by Falsifying Reachability Status [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2__1__manipulate_application_behavior_by_falsifying_reachability_status__critical_node___high-risk_p_a3f02b74.md)

The core strategy. The attacker aims to make the application behave in a way that benefits them by providing incorrect information about the network status. This can be achieved by making the application believe the network is unavailable or available when it is not.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. 1.1. Force Application to Believe Network is Unavailable (Denial of Service/Feature Restriction) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/3__1_1__force_application_to_believe_network_is_unavailable__denial_of_servicefeature_restriction____0a5b848e.md)

This path focuses on causing a denial of service or restricting application features by making it believe there is no network connection. This can disrupt user experience and potentially expose vulnerabilities in offline functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. 1.1.1. Network Interception and Blocking [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/4__1_1_1__network_interception_and_blocking__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

This involves positioning the attacker in a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) position to intercept and block network traffic intended for the application. This directly prevents the application from accessing network resources, leading to a "no network" status as detected by `reachability.swift`.

*   **4.1. 1.1.1.1. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on Wi-Fi [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
    *   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in Wi-Fi networks to place the attacker between the user's device and the internet. This is a common and relatively accessible attack vector, especially on public Wi-Fi networks.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.1.1. 1.1.1.1.a. ARP Spoofing to intercept traffic [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/4_1_1__1_1_1_1_a__arp_spoofing_to_intercept_traffic__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Sending forged ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) messages to associate the attacker's MAC address with the default gateway's IP address.
*   **Mechanism:** This redirects network traffic intended for the internet through the attacker's machine, enabling interception and manipulation.
*   **Impact:** Allows the attacker to intercept all network traffic between the user's device and the internet, setting the stage for further attacks like blocking or DNS spoofing.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.1.2. 1.1.1.1.b. Rogue Access Point (Evil Twin) to control network [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/4_1_2__1_1_1_1_b__rogue_access_point__evil_twin__to_control_network__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Setting up a fake Wi-Fi access point with a name similar to a legitimate one (e.g., a public Wi-Fi hotspot).
*   **Mechanism:** Users may unknowingly connect to the attacker's rogue AP, believing it to be the legitimate network. All traffic then passes through the attacker's AP.
*   **Impact:** Grants the attacker full control over the user's network connection, allowing for traffic interception, blocking, and manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.1.3. 1.1.1.1.c. Packet Dropping/Filtering to simulate network outage [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/4_1_3__1_1_1_1_c__packet_droppingfiltering_to_simulate_network_outage__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Once in a MITM position (e.g., via ARP Spoofing or Rogue AP), the attacker selectively drops or filters network packets.
*   **Mechanism:** By dropping packets, especially those related to reachability checks or application server communication, the attacker can simulate a network outage.
*   **Impact:** Forces the application to detect a "no network" state, potentially triggering offline functionalities or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. 1.1.2. DNS Spoofing to Prevent Connectivity Resolution [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/5__1_1_2__dns_spoofing_to_prevent_connectivity_resolution__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

Manipulating the Domain Name System (DNS) resolution process to prevent the application from resolving the domain names of its backend servers. This leads to connection failures and a perceived lack of network connectivity.

*   **5.1. 1.1.2.1. MITM DNS Spoofing [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
    *   **Description:** Performing DNS spoofing while in a Man-in-the-Middle position.

## Attack Tree Path: [5.1.1. 1.1.2.1.a. Intercept DNS requests and return false "no route" or incorrect IP addresses [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/5_1_1__1_1_2_1_a__intercept_dns_requests_and_return_false_no_route_or_incorrect_ip_addresses__critic_98acd3d6.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Intercepting DNS queries sent by the application.
*   **Mechanism:** The attacker responds to the DNS query with a forged DNS response that indicates the server's domain name cannot be resolved (e.g., NXDOMAIN) or provides an incorrect IP address (e.g., pointing to a non-existent server).
*   **Impact:** Prevents the application from connecting to its intended servers, leading to functionality failures and potentially triggering "no network" behavior based on `reachability.swift`.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. 1.2.2. Delay or Intercept Network Traffic [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/6__1_2_2__delay_or_intercept_network_traffic__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

Instead of completely blocking traffic, the attacker introduces significant delays or packet loss while in a MITM position. This can trick the application into believing it is connected (as basic reachability checks might pass), but actual data transfer becomes unreliable or extremely slow.

*   **6.1. 1.2.2.1. MITM Delay Attack [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
    *   **Description:**  Introducing artificial delays to network packets while in a MITM position.

## Attack Tree Path: [6.1.1. 1.2.2.1.a. Intercept and significantly delay network packets, making the application *think* it's connected but data transfer fails or times out. [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/6_1_1__1_2_2_1_a__intercept_and_significantly_delay_network_packets__making_the_application_think_it_9503a881.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Intercepting network packets and holding them back for a significant duration before forwarding them.
*   **Mechanism:** The application might initially detect network connectivity via `reachability.swift`, but subsequent data requests will experience extreme latency or timeouts due to the delays.
*   **Impact:** Can expose vulnerabilities in application logic that relies on timely network responses. It can also lead to denial of service if the application cannot function properly with such delays.

## Attack Tree Path: [6.2. 1.2.2.2. Packet Loss Simulation [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/6_2__1_2_2_2__packet_loss_simulation__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

Randomly dropping a portion of network packets while in a MITM position.

*   **6.2.1. 1.2.2.2.a. Randomly drop packets to create unreliable connection, potentially triggering application logic based on "connected" status but failing in data operations. [CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   **Description:**  Randomly dropping a portion of network packets while in a MITM position.

## Attack Tree Path: [6.2.1. 1.2.2.2.a. Randomly drop packets to create unreliable connection, potentially triggering application logic based on "connected" status but failing in data operations. [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/6_2_1__1_2_2_2_a__randomly_drop_packets_to_create_unreliable_connection__potentially_triggering_appl_41a33d2b.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Intercepting network packets and randomly discarding a percentage of them.
*   **Mechanism:** This creates an unreliable network connection with frequent packet loss. `reachability.swift` might still report "connected," but data transfer will be inconsistent and prone to failures.
*   **Impact:** Can expose vulnerabilities in how the application handles unreliable network connections when it believes it is connected. It can also lead to data corruption or application malfunctions if data integrity is not properly handled under unreliable network conditions.
