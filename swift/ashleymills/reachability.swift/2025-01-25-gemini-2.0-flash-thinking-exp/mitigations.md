## Mitigation Strategy: [1. Minimize Data Collection and Logging](./mitigation_strategies/1__minimize_data_collection_and_logging.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Minimize Data Collection and Logging of Reachability Information
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Reachability Logging:** Developers should specifically review code sections where reachability status obtained from `reachability.swift` or related information is logged.
    2.  **Identify Sensitive Data in Reachability Logs:** Determine if any logged data points, in conjunction with reachability status, include sensitive information such as user identifiers, location data, or application-specific data.
