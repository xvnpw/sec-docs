# Attack Surface Analysis for ashleymills/reachability.swift

## Attack Surface: [Reliance on Reachability Status for Security Decisions](./attack_surfaces/reliance_on_reachability_status_for_security_decisions.md)

*   **Description:** Applications incorrectly use the network reachability status reported by `reachability.swift` as the sole basis for enforcing security measures, leading to bypass vulnerabilities.
*   **Reachability.swift Contribution:**  `reachability.swift` provides the network status information that the application directly uses to make security-related decisions, creating a dependency and potential point of failure.
*   **Example:** An application disables critical security checks, such as multi-factor authentication or server-side validation, when `reachability.swift` indicates "not reachable," assuming an offline state is inherently safe. An attacker manipulates the local network to simulate an "unreachable" state and bypasses these security measures while still potentially having local access or a manipulated network connection.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive functionalities, data, or resources; complete bypass of intended security controls.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Eliminate reliance on `reachability.swift` for any security-critical decisions.** Security mechanisms must be robust and independent of client-side network status.
    *   **Implement server-side security validation and enforcement.**  Never trust client-reported network status for security purposes.
    *   **Use `reachability.swift` solely for user experience enhancements**, such as adapting UI for offline modes or informing users about network connectivity, but not for security logic.

## Attack Surface: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Vulnerabilities due to Misconstrued Reachability](./attack_surfaces/man-in-the-middle__mitm__vulnerabilities_due_to_misconstrued_reachability.md)

*   **Description:** Applications misinterpret the "reachable" status reported by `reachability.swift` as an indication of a secure or trusted network connection, leading to insecure communication practices and MitM vulnerabilities.
*   **Reachability.swift Contribution:** `reachability.swift`'s output, indicating network connectivity, can be misinterpreted by developers as a guarantee of connection security, leading to flawed assumptions about the network environment.
*   **Example:** An application, upon receiving a "reachable" notification from `reachability.swift`, proceeds to transmit sensitive user credentials or personal data over an unencrypted HTTP connection, assuming reachability implies a safe network.  The user is on a public Wi-Fi network under a Man-in-the-Middle attack, and their data is intercepted, despite `reachability.swift` correctly reporting network reachability.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of highly sensitive data (credentials, personal information, financial data) to attackers, leading to account compromise, identity theft, and data breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always enforce HTTPS for all network communication involving sensitive data, regardless of the reachability status reported by `reachability.swift`.**
    *   **Implement certificate pinning to actively prevent MitM attacks by validating server certificates against a known set.**
    *   **Educate developers and users that `reachability.swift` only indicates network connectivity, not connection security.**
    *   **Promote secure network practices and user awareness regarding public Wi-Fi risks.**
