## Attack Tree Path: [1. Attack Goal: Compromise Application via Reachability.swift Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/1__attack_goal_compromise_application_via_reachability_swift_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** This is the overarching goal. The attacker aims to leverage weaknesses related to how the application uses `reachability.swift` to achieve a compromise. This could manifest in various forms depending on the application's functionality and vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Manipulate Application Behavior by Falsifying Reachability Status [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/2__manipulate_application_behavior_by_falsifying_reachability_status__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The core strategy. The attacker's primary method is to provide the application with incorrect information about network connectivity. This manipulation can be in two main directions: making the application believe there's no network when there is, or vice versa.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. 1.1. Force Application to Believe Network is Unavailable (Denial of Service/Feature Restriction) [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/3__1_1__force_application_to_believe_network_is_unavailable__denial_of_servicefeature_restriction____c07ec5b6.md)

* **Attack Vector:**  The attacker aims to induce a state where the application incorrectly perceives a lack of network connectivity. This can lead to:
    * **Denial of Service:** Preventing the application from accessing online resources or functionalities.
    * **Feature Restriction:** Triggering offline modes or degraded functionality even when a network might be partially available.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. 1.1.1. Network Interception and Blocking [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/4__1_1_1__network_interception_and_blocking__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:**  Positioning oneself in the network path between the application and the internet to intercept and block network traffic. This is typically achieved through Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. 1.1.1.1. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on Wi-Fi [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/5__1_1_1_1__man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_wi-fi__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vectors:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in Wi-Fi networks to become a "man-in-the-middle". Common techniques include:
    * **1.1.1.1.a. ARP Spoofing to intercept traffic [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Sending forged ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) messages to associate the attacker's MAC address with the default gateway's IP address. This redirects network traffic intended for the internet through the attacker's machine.
    * **1.1.1.1.b. Rogue Access Point (Evil Twin) to control network [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Setting up a fake Wi-Fi access point that mimics a legitimate one (e.g., using a similar SSID). Users might unknowingly connect to this rogue AP, giving the attacker control over their network traffic.
    * **1.1.1.1.c. Packet Dropping/Filtering to simulate network outage [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Once in a MITM position (e.g., after ARP spoofing or via a Rogue AP), selectively dropping or filtering network packets. This can simulate a network outage from the application's perspective, even if the underlying network is functional.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. 1.1.2. DNS Spoofing to Prevent Connectivity Resolution [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/6__1_1_2__dns_spoofing_to_prevent_connectivity_resolution__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Manipulating the Domain Name System (DNS) resolution process to prevent the application from correctly resolving the domain names of its backend servers.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. 1.1.2.1. MITM DNS Spoofing [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/7__1_1_2_1__mitm_dns_spoofing__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Performing DNS spoofing within a Man-in-the-Middle position.
    * **1.1.2.1.a. Intercept DNS requests and return false "no route" or incorrect IP addresses [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Intercepting DNS queries sent by the application and responding with forged DNS responses. These responses can indicate that the server domain does not exist or point to an incorrect IP address, preventing the application from establishing a connection.

## Attack Tree Path: [8. 1.2.2. Delay or Intercept Network Traffic [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/8__1_2_2__delay_or_intercept_network_traffic__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:**  Instead of completely blocking traffic, the attacker manipulates network traffic by introducing delays or packet loss. This aims to create an unreliable or slow connection while still allowing basic reachability checks to pass, potentially exposing vulnerabilities in how the application handles such conditions.

## Attack Tree Path: [9. 1.2.2.1. MITM Delay Attack [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/9__1_2_2_1__mitm_delay_attack__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:**  In a MITM position, intercepting and significantly delaying network packets.
    * **1.2.2.1.a. Intercept and significantly delay network packets, making the application *think* it's connected but data transfer fails or times out. [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Attack Vector:**  Introducing artificial latency to network communication. The application might initially detect network connectivity via `reachability.swift`, but subsequent data transfer operations will be severely delayed or time out. This can expose vulnerabilities in application logic that assumes a functional connection based solely on reachability status.

## Attack Tree Path: [10. 1.2.2.2. Packet Loss Simulation [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/10__1_2_2_2__packet_loss_simulation__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** In a MITM position, randomly dropping network packets to simulate an unreliable connection.
    * **1.2.2.2.a. Randomly drop packets to create unreliable connection, potentially triggering application logic based on "connected" status but failing in data operations. [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Attack Vector:**  Introducing random packet loss into the network stream.  Similar to delay attacks, the application might report "connected" based on reachability checks, but the unreliable nature of the connection due to packet loss can cause data transfer failures and expose vulnerabilities in how the application handles unreliable networks when it believes it's connected.
