Here's the updated key attack surface list, focusing only on elements directly involving `Reachability.swift` and with high or critical risk severity:

*   **Attack Surface:** Notification Injection/Spoofing

    *   **Description:** A malicious actor could potentially inject or spoof network status change notifications that `Reachability.swift` relies on.
    *   **How Reachability.swift Contributes:** `Reachability.swift` registers for and processes system-level notifications about network changes. It trusts the integrity of these notifications.
    *   **Example:** Malware on the device could send a fake "network connected" notification even when the device is offline, causing the application to attempt network operations that will fail or potentially expose sensitive data through error handling.
    *   **Impact:** The application might behave incorrectly, leading to failed operations, incorrect UI display, or triggering unintended actions based on false network status.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Application-Level Validation:** Do not solely rely on `Reachability.swift`'s status. Implement additional checks at the application level before performing critical network operations (e.g., attempting a connection and handling failures gracefully).
        *   **Contextual Awareness:** Consider other factors beyond `Reachability.swift`'s status to determine network availability (e.g., can a specific endpoint be reached?).
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the application runs with the minimum necessary privileges to reduce the impact if other parts of the system are compromised.
