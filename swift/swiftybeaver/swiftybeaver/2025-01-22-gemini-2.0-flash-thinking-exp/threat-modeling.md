# Threat Model Analysis for swiftybeaver/swiftybeaver

## Threat: [Logging Sensitive Data](./threats/logging_sensitive_data.md)

**Description:** Developers may unintentionally log sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API keys, PII, session tokens) using SwiftyBeaver's logging functions. An attacker gaining access to these logs could extract this sensitive data. This access could be achieved through compromised log destinations, file system access, or network interception.

**Impact:** Data breach, privacy violation, identity theft, account compromise, compliance violations, reputational damage, financial loss.

**Affected Component:** Application code using SwiftyBeaver logging functions (`SwiftyBeaver.verbose()`, `SwiftyBeaver.debug()`, `SwiftyBeaver.info()`, `SwiftyBeaver.warning()`, `SwiftyBeaver.error()`), and all configured destinations (`SwiftyBeaver.addDestination()`).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Mandatory Code Reviews:** Implement rigorous code reviews to identify and eliminate logging of sensitive data before deployment.
*   **Data Sanitization & Masking:** Sanitize or mask sensitive data within log messages before logging using string manipulation or custom formatting.
*   **Strict Logging Guidelines:** Define and enforce clear guidelines for developers specifying what data is permissible to log and what is considered sensitive and prohibited.
*   **Structured Logging Practices:** Employ structured logging to minimize accidental inclusion of sensitive variables in free-form log messages.
*   **Regular Log Audits:** Conduct periodic audits of existing logs to detect and remediate any instances of accidental sensitive data exposure.

## Threat: [Insecure Log Destinations (when handling sensitive data)](./threats/insecure_log_destinations__when_handling_sensitive_data_.md)

**Description:** SwiftyBeaver supports various log destinations. If these destinations are not properly secured and sensitive data is logged, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to the logs. This could involve exploiting weak access controls on cloud storage, accessing unsecured network shares, or intercepting unencrypted network traffic.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data contained in logs, data breach, potential for further system compromise if logs reveal system vulnerabilities or internal configurations.

**Affected Component:** `Destinations` added via `SwiftyBeaver.addDestination()`, particularly network destinations and file destinations with inadequate access controls.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Secure Destination Selection:** Choose inherently secure log destinations with robust access control and encryption capabilities.
*   **Strong Access Control Configuration:** Implement and enforce strict access controls (authentication, authorization) for all log destinations, limiting access to only authorized personnel.
*   **Encryption in Transit and at Rest:** Encrypt log data both in transit (when using network destinations - use HTTPS/TLS) and at rest (encrypt log files on storage) to protect confidentiality.
*   **Regular Security Audits of Destinations:** Periodically review and audit the security configurations of all log destinations to ensure ongoing security and compliance.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in SwiftyBeaver or its Dependencies](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_swiftybeaver_or_its_dependencies.md)

**Description:** SwiftyBeaver, like any software library, may contain vulnerabilities or rely on vulnerable dependencies. Attackers could exploit known vulnerabilities in SwiftyBeaver itself or its dependencies to compromise the application. This could lead to remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.

**Impact:** Application compromise, potential remote code execution, denial of service, data breach, complete system takeover depending on the vulnerability.

**Affected Component:** `SwiftyBeaver` library code, and any vulnerable dependencies it relies upon.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability and its exploitability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Maintain Up-to-Date SwiftyBeaver:** Regularly update SwiftyBeaver to the latest version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
*   **Proactive Dependency Management:** Implement a robust dependency management process to track and update SwiftyBeaver and all its dependencies.
*   **Regular Vulnerability Scanning:** Conduct regular vulnerability scans of SwiftyBeaver and its dependencies using security scanning tools to identify and address known vulnerabilities promptly.
*   **Security Monitoring and Advisories:** Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases related to SwiftyBeaver and its ecosystem to stay informed about potential threats and necessary updates.
