# Attack Surface Analysis for swiftybeaver/swiftybeaver

## Attack Surface: [Log File Path Traversal](./attack_surfaces/log_file_path_traversal.md)

### Description:
Attackers exploit vulnerabilities to manipulate log file paths, allowing them to write logs to arbitrary locations on the file system.

### SwiftyBeaver Contribution:
SwiftyBeaver's file destination configuration, if not carefully managed, can allow for dynamic path construction or be influenced by external, unvalidated configuration, making it susceptible to path traversal attacks when writing log files.

### Example:
An attacker modifies a configuration file that dictates the log file path, injecting "../../../../../tmp/evil.log" instead of the intended log directory. SwiftyBeaver, configured to use this path without validation, writes logs to `/tmp/evil.log`.

### Impact:
Overwriting critical system files, gaining write access to sensitive directories, potentially leading to code execution or denial of service.

### Risk Severity:
High

### Mitigation Strategies:
*   **Strict Path Validation:** Implement robust validation and sanitization of any input used to construct log file paths *before* configuring SwiftyBeaver.
*   **Fixed Log Directory Configuration:** Configure SwiftyBeaver to exclusively use a fixed, pre-defined log directory, avoiding any dynamic path construction based on external input.
*   **Operating System Level Permissions:** Enforce strict file system permissions on the designated log directory, ensuring only the application user has write access.
*   **Path Canonicalization:** Canonicalize log file paths within the application before passing them to SwiftyBeaver to resolve symbolic links and relative paths, preventing traversal attempts.

## Attack Surface: [Log File Information Disclosure](./attack_surfaces/log_file_information_disclosure.md)

### Description:
Sensitive information contained within log files is exposed to unauthorized users or processes due to insecure storage or access controls.

### SwiftyBeaver Contribution:
SwiftyBeaver is responsible for writing logs to files. If the application logs sensitive data (and many applications do) and the resulting log files are not adequately secured, SwiftyBeaver's file writing action directly contributes to this information disclosure risk.

### Example:
Log files generated by SwiftyBeaver contain user passwords in plaintext (due to application logging practices) and are stored in a directory with overly permissive file permissions (e.g., world-readable). An attacker gains access to the server and reads these log files to obtain user credentials.

### Impact:
Exposure of sensitive data, privacy violations, potential account compromise, and further attacks leveraging disclosed information.

### Risk Severity:
High

### Mitigation Strategies:
*   **Restrict File System Permissions:** Implement the most restrictive file system permissions possible on log files and directories. Ensure only the application user and necessary system processes have read access, and only the application user has write access.
*   **Log Rotation and Secure Archiving:** Implement regular log rotation and archive older logs to secure storage locations with even stricter access controls.
*   **Proactive Data Sanitization and Masking:** Implement data sanitization or masking techniques *within the application* before logging data with SwiftyBeaver. Avoid logging highly sensitive information directly. Use techniques like one-way hashing, tokenization, or redaction for sensitive data in logs.
*   **Encryption at Rest for Log Files:** Encrypt log files at rest to provide an additional layer of protection for sensitive data, even if unauthorized access to the file system is achieved.

## Attack Surface: [Data in Transit Exposure (Unencrypted Remote Logging)](./attack_surfaces/data_in_transit_exposure__unencrypted_remote_logging_.md)

### Description:
Sensitive log data is transmitted over an unencrypted network connection when using remote logging destinations, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping and interception.

### SwiftyBeaver Contribution:
SwiftyBeaver provides the functionality to send logs to remote destinations, including the option to use unencrypted HTTP. Configuring SwiftyBeaver to use HTTP for remote logging directly introduces the risk of data in transit exposure.

### Example:
Logs containing API keys or user session IDs are configured to be sent via HTTP to a remote logging server using SwiftyBeaver. An attacker on the network performs a man-in-the-middle attack and intercepts this traffic, capturing the sensitive information transmitted by SwiftyBeaver.

### Impact:
Information disclosure, credential theft, session hijacking, and other attacks based on intercepted sensitive data.

### Risk Severity:
High

### Mitigation Strategies:
*   **Enforce HTTPS for Remote Destinations:** **Always** configure SwiftyBeaver to use HTTPS for all remote logging destinations. This ensures that log data is encrypted in transit, protecting it from eavesdropping.
*   **Avoid HTTP Configuration:**  Explicitly avoid configuring SwiftyBeaver to use HTTP for remote logging under any circumstances in production or sensitive environments.
*   **VPN or Secure Channels (If HTTPS Not Directly Possible):** In rare cases where direct HTTPS to the logging destination is not feasible, establish a VPN or other secure network channel to protect the traffic between the application and the remote logging server *in addition to* any encryption SwiftyBeaver might offer. However, HTTPS is the strongly preferred and standard solution.
