# Threat Model Analysis for swiftybeaver/swiftybeaver

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Logs](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_logs.md)

**Description:** Developers using SwiftyBeaver might inadvertently configure the logging to capture and store sensitive data (e.g., API keys, passwords, personal information) within the logs managed by SwiftyBeaver's destinations (File or Network). This occurs through the direct use of SwiftyBeaver's logging methods (`verbose`, `debug`, etc.) without proper filtering or sanitization of the data being logged.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of personally identifiable information (PII), API keys, passwords, or other sensitive data, leading to potential identity theft, financial loss, or reputational damage.

**Affected SwiftyBeaver Component:** All logging methods (e.g., `verbose`, `debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`), File Destination, Network Destinations.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict controls within the application code over what data is passed to SwiftyBeaver for logging, avoiding the logging of sensitive information.
* Utilize SwiftyBeaver's features (if any, though it's primarily a logging transport) or implement custom logic to filter or mask sensitive data *before* it is passed to SwiftyBeaver's logging methods.
* Configure SwiftyBeaver to use secure and encrypted destinations for log storage and transmission (e.g., HTTPS, TLS for network destinations), although this is a secondary mitigation.

## Threat: [Insecure Transmission of Logs to Remote Destinations](./threats/insecure_transmission_of_logs_to_remote_destinations.md)

**Description:** When using SwiftyBeaver's Network Destinations (like `StreamDestination`), developers might configure it to send logs over unencrypted protocols (like plain HTTP) if they don't explicitly configure secure options. This directly involves SwiftyBeaver's functionality for transmitting logs.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of application behavior and potentially sensitive data contained within the logs during transit.

**Affected SwiftyBeaver Component:** Network Destinations (e.g., `StreamDestination`) and their configuration.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* When configuring SwiftyBeaver's Network Destinations, explicitly ensure the use of secure protocols like HTTPS or TLS.
* Verify the security configurations of any custom network destinations implemented using SwiftyBeaver's extension points.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Log Files](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_log_files.md)

**Description:** If developers rely on SwiftyBeaver's File Destination and do not implement appropriate file system permissions on the directories where SwiftyBeaver writes log files, unauthorized individuals or processes could gain access to these files. This is a direct consequence of how SwiftyBeaver manages local file storage.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive information, potential tampering with audit trails.

**Affected SwiftyBeaver Component:** File Destination.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict file system permissions on the directories where SwiftyBeaver is configured to store log files.
* Ensure that the user account under which the application runs has only the necessary permissions to write to the log directory.
* Regularly review and audit file permissions on log directories managed by SwiftyBeaver.
