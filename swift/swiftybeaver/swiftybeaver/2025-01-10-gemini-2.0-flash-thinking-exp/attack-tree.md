## Attack Tree Path: [Access Sensitive Log Files via Path Traversal [HIGH RISK]:](./attack_tree_paths/access_sensitive_log_files_via_path_traversal__high_risk_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Path Traversal Vulnerability in Log File Path Configuration
    * **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability where the application allows configuration of the log file path without proper sanitization.
    * **Action:** The attacker provides a malicious log file path containing ".." sequences or other path traversal characters to access files or directories outside the intended logging directory.
    * **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data contained in accessed files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Remote Log Destination by Compromising Credentials [HIGH RISK]:](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_remote_log_destination_by_compromising_credentials__high_risk_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Credentials Stored Insecurely (e.g., Plaintext Configuration)
    * **Description:** The application stores credentials for the remote logging service (like Elasticsearch or an HTTP endpoint) in an insecure manner, such as plaintext in configuration files.
    * **Action:** The attacker gains access to the application's configuration files (through other vulnerabilities or unauthorized access) and retrieves the plaintext credentials.
    * **Impact:** The attacker gains full control over the logging data sent to the remote service, allowing them to manipulate, delete, or inject malicious data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Data into Log Stream leading to Command Injection [HIGH RISK]:](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_data_into_log_stream_leading_to_command_injection__high_risk_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Log Injection leading to Command Injection
    * **Description:** The application uses log entries in system commands without proper sanitization.
    * **Action:** The attacker crafts log messages containing malicious commands that will be executed by the system when the log entry is processed.
    * **Impact:** Critical system compromise, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Data into Log Stream leading to SQL Injection [HIGH RISK]:](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_data_into_log_stream_leading_to_sql_injection__high_risk_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Log Injection leading to SQL Injection
    * **Description:** The application uses log entries in database queries without proper sanitization.
    * **Action:** The attacker crafts log messages containing malicious SQL code that will be executed against the database when the log entry is processed.
    * **Impact:** Database compromise, allowing the attacker to access, modify, or delete sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Configuration Files (Configuration Injection) [HIGH RISK]:](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_configuration_files__configuration_injection___high_risk_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Manipulate Configuration Files to Change Log Destinations or Behavior
    * **Description:** The application reads SwiftyBeaver's configuration from external files without proper integrity checks or access controls.
    * **Action:** The attacker gains unauthorized access to the configuration files and modifies them to change log destinations (e.g., to a server they control) or alter logging behavior for malicious purposes.
    * **Impact:** Full control over logging data, potentially redirecting sensitive information to an attacker-controlled location or disabling logging to mask malicious activity.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting the Lack of Built-in Sanitization [HIGH RISK]:](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_the_lack_of_built-in_sanitization__high_risk_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Relying on Application-Level Sanitization (which might be flawed)
    * **Description:** SwiftyBeaver does not provide built-in sanitization, and the application relies on its own sanitization logic, which may contain flaws.
    * **Action:** The attacker provides input that bypasses the application's flawed sanitization and is then logged by SwiftyBeaver. This unsanitized data can then be exploited in downstream processes (as seen in the log injection scenarios).
    * **Impact:** Can lead to various injection vulnerabilities (like command injection or SQL injection) if the logged data is used in other contexts without proper handling.
