# Threat Model Analysis for swiftybeaver/swiftybeaver

## Threat: [Logging Sensitive Data in Plain Text](./threats/logging_sensitive_data_in_plain_text.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker who gains access to log files (local or remote) can read sensitive information logged in plain text, such as passwords, API keys, PII, or session tokens. This access could be achieved through various means like exploiting server vulnerabilities, insider threats, or insecure storage.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, privacy violations, unauthorized access to systems and user accounts, compliance violations.
*   **SwiftyBeaver Component Affected:**  `Destinations` (all destinations where logs are written: file, console, remote services). `Logging functions` (e.g., `SwiftyBeaver.debug()`, `SwiftyBeaver.error()`, etc. when used to log sensitive data).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Data Minimization: Log only necessary information and avoid logging sensitive data.
    *   Data Masking/Redaction: Implement techniques to mask or redact sensitive data before logging.
    *   Secure Coding Practices: Educate developers on secure logging practices and data handling.
    *   Regular Code Reviews: Review code to identify and prevent logging of sensitive information.

## Threat: [Unintended Exposure via Remote Logging Destinations](./threats/unintended_exposure_via_remote_logging_destinations.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could intercept or access log data transmitted to or stored in remote logging destinations if communication channels or the remote service itself are insecure. This could involve man-in-the-middle attacks, compromised remote logging service accounts, or vulnerabilities in the remote service.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, privacy violations, reliance on third-party security, potential compromise of remote logging infrastructure.
*   **SwiftyBeaver Component Affected:** `Remote Destinations` (e.g., CloudDestination, HTTPDestination, etc.), network communication channels.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   HTTPS/TLS for Remote Logging: Always use HTTPS or TLS to encrypt communication with remote logging destinations.
    *   Strong Authentication: Implement strong authentication mechanisms for accessing remote logging destinations.
    *   Third-Party Security Review: Review the security policies and practices of any third-party logging services used.
    *   Secure Configuration of Remote Destinations: Properly configure remote destinations with secure settings and access controls.
