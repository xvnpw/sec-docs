# Attack Surface Analysis for swiftybeaver/swiftybeaver

## Attack Surface: [Unencrypted Remote Logging (HTTP/TCP/UDP)](./attack_surfaces/unencrypted_remote_logging__httptcpudp_.md)

*   **Description:** SwiftyBeaver is configured to send logs to a remote server using unencrypted protocols like HTTP, TCP, or UDP. This allows attackers to intercept and read sensitive log data while it is being transmitted over the network.
*   **SwiftyBeaver Contribution:** SwiftyBeaver's `HttpDestination` and `StreamDestination` features enable sending logs over HTTP, TCP, and UDP.  If developers configure these destinations to use plain HTTP or unencrypted TCP/UDP connections, SwiftyBeaver directly facilitates this insecure transmission.
*   **Example:** An application uses SwiftyBeaver's `HttpDestination` to send logs to a central logging server over standard HTTP. An attacker on the network performs a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack and intercepts the HTTP traffic, gaining full access to the log data, which contains sensitive user information and application secrets.
*   **Impact:** Information Disclosure (High), Credential Theft (if credentials are logged - High), Data Breach (Critical if significant sensitive data is exposed).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enforce HTTPS for HTTP Logging:**  Always configure SwiftyBeaver's `HttpDestination` to use HTTPS (`https://`) to encrypt all log data transmitted over HTTP.
    *   **Utilize TLS/SSL for TCP Logging:** When using `StreamDestination` with TCP, explicitly enable TLS/SSL encryption for the connection to the remote logging server to ensure secure communication.
    *   **Avoid UDP for Sensitive Data:**  Never use UDP for transmitting sensitive log data as it is inherently unencrypted and provides no confidentiality. Consider disabling UDP-based logging destinations if security is a concern.

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured File Logging with Sensitive Data Exposure](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_file_logging_with_sensitive_data_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** SwiftyBeaver is configured to write logs to local files, and these files contain sensitive information. If file permissions are not strictly controlled, unauthorized users or processes can access these files and expose the sensitive data.
*   **SwiftyBeaver Contribution:** SwiftyBeaver's `FileDestination` is responsible for writing logs to files. While SwiftyBeaver itself doesn't manage file permissions, its functionality directly leads to the creation of log files that, if misconfigured in terms of permissions and content, become an attack surface.
*   **Example:** An application uses SwiftyBeaver's `FileDestination` and logs detailed debugging information, including user session tokens and database query parameters, to a file located in a publicly readable directory (e.g., due to default or misconfigured deployment settings). An attacker gains access to the server and reads the log file, extracting session tokens to impersonate users or database credentials from the query parameters.
*   **Impact:** Information Disclosure (High), Privilege Escalation (if credentials are exposed - Critical), Account Takeover (if session tokens are exposed - Critical), Data Breach (Critical if PII or other highly sensitive data is exposed).
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the sensitivity of data logged and the environment's security posture).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Restrict File System Permissions:**  Implement the most restrictive file permissions possible for log files. Ensure only the application's user account and authorized administrators have read access (e.g., `chmod 600 logfile.log`).
    *   **Secure Log Directory Location:** Store log files in a dedicated directory with restricted access, ensuring it is not located in publicly accessible or easily guessable paths.
    *   **Minimize Sensitive Data Logging to Files:**  Critically review what data is being logged to files. Avoid logging sensitive information like credentials, session tokens, PII, or internal system secrets to file destinations. If absolutely necessary, implement robust data masking or redaction techniques *before* logging to files within the application code itself.
    *   **Regular Security Audits of Log Files and Permissions:** Periodically audit log file locations and permissions to ensure they remain securely configured and that no sensitive data is inadvertently being logged to files.
