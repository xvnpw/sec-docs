            [HIGH RISK PATH] 2.1.1.1 Logs Unintentionally Capture Sensitive User Data (PII, Credentials, Secrets) [CRITICAL NODE]
                [Actionable Insight: Implement strict logging policies. Review logged data to ensure no sensitive information is inadvertently logged. Use data masking or redaction techniques where necessary.]
                - Likelihood: Medium to High
                - Impact: Medium to High

            [HIGH RISK PATH] 2.1.1.2 Logs Include Application Secrets or Configuration Details [CRITICAL NODE]
                [Actionable Insight: Avoid logging sensitive configuration details or secrets. Use secure configuration management and secret management solutions instead of logging them.]

            [HIGH RISK PATH] 2.1.2.2 Logs Stored in Publicly Accessible Web Directories [CRITICAL NODE]
                [Actionable Insight: Never store logs in web-accessible directories. Configure web servers to prevent direct access to log directories.]
                - Likelihood: Very Low
                - Impact: High
                - Effort: Low

                - Detection Difficulty: Very Easy
            [HIGH RISK PATH] 2.1.2.3 Logs Transmitted Insecurely to Remote Destinations [CRITICAL NODE]
                [Actionable Insight: If using remote logging destinations (e.g., cloud services), ensure secure transport protocols (HTTPS, TLS) are used. Verify the security of the remote logging service itself.]
                - Likelihood: Low to Medium
                - Impact: Medium
                - Effort: Low to Medium
                - Skill Level: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] 2.0 Exploit Misconfiguration or Insecure Usage of SwiftyBeaver [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__2_0_exploit_misconfiguration_or_insecure_usage_of_swiftybeaver__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities arising from how SwiftyBeaver is configured and used within the application, rather than inherent flaws in the SwiftyBeaver library code itself.
*   **Breakdown:** This is a broad category encompassing various missteps in implementation. It's critical because misconfigurations are often easier to exploit than complex code vulnerabilities and are frequently overlooked.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] 2.1 Information Disclosure via Logs [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__2_1_information_disclosure_via_logs__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Gaining unauthorized access to sensitive information by exploiting weaknesses in how logs are handled, specifically focusing on the content and storage of logs generated by SwiftyBeaver.
*   **Breakdown:** Logs, by their nature, contain application data. If not managed securely, they become a prime target for information theft. This path is high-risk because information disclosure can have severe consequences, including privacy breaches and reputational damage.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] 2.1.1 Logs Contain Sensitive Data [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__2_1_1_logs_contain_sensitive_data__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Exploiting the presence of sensitive information *within* the log data itself. This occurs when developers inadvertently or intentionally log data that should be kept confidential.
*   **Breakdown:** This is a critical node because the very content of the logs becomes the vulnerability. If logs contain sensitive data, any unauthorized access to these logs directly leads to a security breach.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] 2.1.1.1 Logs Unintentionally Capture Sensitive User Data (PII, Credentials, Secrets) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__2_1_1_1_logs_unintentionally_capture_sensitive_user_data__pii__credentials__secrets_95abc48c.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Sensitive user data (Personally Identifiable Information - PII, credentials like passwords, API keys, session tokens, secrets) is accidentally logged by the application using SwiftyBeaver.
*   **Breakdown:** This is a very common and high-risk scenario. Developers might unknowingly log user input, database queries containing sensitive data, or internal variables that hold secrets. Successful exploitation leads to direct exposure of user data and/or application secrets.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] 2.1.1.2 Logs Include Application Secrets or Configuration Details [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__2_1_1_2_logs_include_application_secrets_or_configuration_details__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Application secrets (API keys, database passwords, encryption keys) or sensitive configuration details are explicitly or implicitly logged by the application using SwiftyBeaver.
*   **Breakdown:** This is a critical mistake with potentially catastrophic consequences. If application secrets are logged and exposed, attackers can gain full control over the application and its backend systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] 2.1.2 Logs Stored Insecurely [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__2_1_2_logs_stored_insecurely__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Logs, even if they don't contain highly sensitive data directly, are stored in a manner that allows unauthorized access. This could be due to incorrect file permissions, storage in publicly accessible locations, or insecure transmission.
*   **Breakdown:**  Insecure storage is a common vulnerability. Even if logs are intended to be less sensitive, they can still contain valuable information for attackers, such as application behavior, internal paths, or error details.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] 2.1.2.2 Logs Stored in Publicly Accessible Web Directories [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__2_1_2_2_logs_stored_in_publicly_accessible_web_directories__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Log files are mistakenly placed within directories that are directly accessible via the web server (e.g., within the document root).
*   **Breakdown:** This is a severe misconfiguration. Anyone who knows or can guess the URL to the log files can directly download and access them via a web browser, requiring minimal effort and skill from the attacker.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] 2.1.2.3 Logs Transmitted Insecurely to Remote Destinations [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__2_1_2_3_logs_transmitted_insecurely_to_remote_destinations__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Logs are sent to remote logging services or systems using insecure protocols (e.g., plain HTTP instead of HTTPS).
*   **Breakdown:**  Transmitting logs over unencrypted channels exposes them to interception during transit. Attackers on the network path can eavesdrop and capture the log data, potentially including sensitive information.
