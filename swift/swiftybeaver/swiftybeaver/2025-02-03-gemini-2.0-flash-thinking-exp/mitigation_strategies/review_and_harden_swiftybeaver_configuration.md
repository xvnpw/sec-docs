*   **Resource Requirements:**  Requires expertise in security protocols and destination-specific security configurations.  May require time for infrastructure setup, certificate management, and testing.
*   **SwiftyBeaver Specific Considerations:**  SwiftyBeaver's support for secure protocols and authentication depends on the specific destination type being used (e.g., HTTP destination might support HTTPS and authentication headers).  The analysis needs to verify SwiftyBeaver's capabilities for each destination and configure them accordingly.

**Recommendations for Step 3:**

*   **Prioritize Secure Protocols:**  Always use secure protocols (HTTPS, TLS, SSH, etc.) for remote destinations whenever supported by SwiftyBeaver and the destination service.
*   **Implement Authentication and Authorization:**  Enable authentication and authorization mechanisms for all destinations that support them.  Use strong authentication methods and follow the principle of least privilege for access control.
*   **Regularly Review Security Configurations:**  Security configurations should be reviewed periodically to ensure they remain effective and aligned with security best practices.
*   **Consider Log Encryption at Rest:**  If logs are stored in file destinations or remote storage, consider implementing encryption at rest to protect data even if the storage medium is compromised.
*   **Destination-Specific Security Hardening:**  Research and implement destination-specific security hardening measures beyond SwiftyBeaver configuration (e.g., firewall rules, access control lists on remote log servers).

#### 4.4. Step 4: Least Privilege for SwiftyBeaver Configuration Access
