# Attack Surface Analysis for swiftybeaver/swiftybeaver

## Attack Surface: [Log File Injection](./attack_surfaces/log_file_injection.md)

*Description:* Attackers inject malicious content into log files, potentially exploiting vulnerabilities in log analysis tools or causing denial of service.
*SwiftyBeaver Contribution:* SwiftyBeaver's `FileDestination` writes log entries to files, creating the direct target for this attack.  The library itself doesn't inherently prevent injection; it relies on the application to provide sanitized input.
*Example:* An attacker submits a specially crafted username containing newline characters and malicious code intended for a log parser. The application, without proper input validation, passes this directly to SwiftyBeaver, which writes it to the log file.
*Impact:* Log file poisoning, denial of service (disk exhaustion), potential code execution via vulnerable log parsers, information disclosure.
*Risk Severity:* High
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Input Validation:** Developers *must* rigorously validate and sanitize *all* user-supplied input *before* it is passed to SwiftyBeaver for logging. This is the primary defense.
    *   **Log Rotation & Size Limits:** Configure SwiftyBeaver's `FileDestination` to rotate log files and enforce maximum sizes.
    *   **Secure File Permissions:** Ensure log files have restrictive permissions.

## Attack Surface: [API Key Compromise (SwiftyBeaver Platform)](./attack_surfaces/api_key_compromise__swiftybeaver_platform_.md)

*Description:* Attackers gain access to the SwiftyBeaver API keys (app ID, secret, encryption key).
*SwiftyBeaver Contribution:* The `SwiftyBeaverPlatformDestination` *requires* these API keys for authentication and authorization.  The security of these keys is paramount to the security of the logging data.
*Example:* An attacker finds the API keys hardcoded in a publicly accessible Git repository.
*Impact:* Attackers can send forged log messages, access and potentially exfiltrate existing log data, and disrupt the logging service.
*Risk Severity:* Critical
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Secure Key Storage:** *Never* hardcode API keys. Use environment variables, secure configuration files, or a dedicated secrets management solution.
    *   **Regular Key Rotation:** Implement a policy to regularly rotate API keys.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Use API keys with the minimum necessary permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack (SwiftyBeaver Platform)](./attack_surfaces/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack__swiftybeaver_platform_.md)

*Description:* Attackers intercept log data transmitted between the application and the SwiftyBeaver platform.
*SwiftyBeaver Contribution:* The `SwiftyBeaverPlatformDestination` sends data over the network (HTTPS), making it inherently susceptible to MitM attacks if TLS is not properly configured. SwiftyBeaver relies on the underlying system and application to handle TLS correctly.
*Example:* An attacker on the same network intercepts the HTTPS traffic to SwiftyBeaver's servers due to a misconfigured or outdated TLS setup.
*Impact:* Log data interception, potential modification of log data, information disclosure.
*Risk Severity:* High
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Enforce Strong TLS:** The application *must* use the latest TLS version (TLS 1.3, or at least TLS 1.2 with strong cipher suites) and disable support for older protocols.
    *   **Certificate Pinning:** Implement certificate pinning to validate the SwiftyBeaver server's certificate.

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure via Overly Verbose Logging](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_via_overly_verbose_logging.md)

*Description:* Sensitive information is inadvertently logged, increasing the risk of exposure.
*SwiftyBeaver Contribution:* SwiftyBeaver logs whatever data is passed to it.  The library provides formatting and filtering capabilities, but it's the *developer's* responsibility to control *what* is logged and at what level.
*Example:* The application logs full HTTP request bodies, including user credentials.
*Impact:* Exposure of sensitive data (passwords, API keys, PII) if logs are compromised.
*Risk Severity:* High
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Log Level Management:** Use appropriate log levels and configure the application to only log necessary information in production. Avoid `debug` in production.
    *   **Data Minimization:** *Never* log sensitive data directly. Use redaction or masking if sensitive data must be included.
    *   **Log Review:** Regularly review logs to identify and address overly verbose logging.
