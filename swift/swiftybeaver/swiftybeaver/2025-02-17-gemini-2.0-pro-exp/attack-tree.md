        *   **1.1.2.2. Leverage privilege escalation vulnerabilities within the platform.**
            *   *Attack Vector:* Exploiting a bug that allows a low-privileged user to gain higher privileges.
            *   *Mitigation:* Regular security updates, vulnerability scanning, intrusion detection.

*   **1.2. Intercept Log Data in Transit**
