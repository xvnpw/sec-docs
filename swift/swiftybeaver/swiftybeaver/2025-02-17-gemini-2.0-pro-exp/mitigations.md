## Mitigation Strategy: [Custom Formatters for Sensitive Data Handling](./mitigation_strategies/custom_formatters_for_sensitive_data_handling.md)

**1. Custom Formatters for Sensitive Data Handling**

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Identify Sensitive Fields:** Within your application's data models and common log messages, pinpoint specific fields that routinely contain sensitive information (e.g., `user.password`, `request.apiKey`, `transaction.creditCardNumber`).
        2.  **Create Custom Formatters:** Develop custom `SwiftyBeaver.Formatter` subclasses.  These formatters will override the `format()` method.
        3.  **Implement Sanitization Logic:** Within the `format()` method of your custom formatters, implement the logic to:
            *   Detect the presence of the identified sensitive fields.
            *   Apply appropriate sanitization (redaction, masking, or hashing) *before* the field's value is included in the formatted log message.  Use the sanitization functions you've already created (from the broader strategy).
        4.  **Register Formatters:**  Register your custom formatters with the relevant SwiftyBeaver destinations.  You can apply different formatters to different destinations if needed.  This is done when configuring the destination:
            ```swift
            let console = ConsoleDestination()
            let formatter = MyCustomFormatter() // Your custom formatter
            console.format = "$Dyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss$d $C$L$c: $M" // Base format
            console.addFormat(formatter) // Add your custom formatter
            SwiftyBeaver.addDestination(console)
            ```
        5. **Testing:** Thoroughly test your custom formatters to ensure they correctly identify and sanitize sensitive data in various scenarios.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Sensitive Data Exposure (Severity: High):** Directly prevents sensitive data from being included in log messages, even if developers forget to manually sanitize data before logging.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Significantly reduces the risk, providing a more robust and automated solution than relying solely on manual sanitization.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** *(Fill in details: e.g., "No custom formatters are currently implemented.")*

    *   **Missing Implementation:** *(Fill in details: e.g., "Custom formatters are needed for user objects, request objects, and transaction objects to handle sensitive fields.")*

## Mitigation Strategy: [Log Level Configuration via SwiftyBeaver](./mitigation_strategies/log_level_configuration_via_swiftybeaver.md)

**2. Log Level Configuration via SwiftyBeaver**

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Environment-Specific Levels:** Determine the appropriate log level for each environment (development, staging, production).  Production should typically use `info`, `warning`, or `error`.
        2.  **SwiftyBeaver Configuration:**  Use SwiftyBeaver's configuration options to set the `minLevel` property for each destination.  This is done when creating the destination:
            ```swift
            let console = ConsoleDestination()
            console.minLevel = .info // Set the minimum log level
            SwiftyBeaver.addDestination(console)
            ```
        3.  **Centralized Configuration:**  Ideally, manage the `minLevel` settings through a centralized configuration file or environment variables, so you can easily adjust them without modifying code.
        4. **Testing:** Verify that the configured log levels are correctly applied in each environment.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Sensitive Data Exposure (Severity: Medium):** Reduces the risk of sensitive data being logged in production if `debug` or `verbose` levels are accidentally left enabled.
        *   **Performance Degradation (Severity: Low):** Reduces unnecessary logging overhead.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Reduces the risk, especially if `debug` logging contains sensitive information.
        *   **Performance:** Improves performance by reducing logging overhead.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** *(Fill in details: e.g., "Log levels are set in code, but not consistently across all destinations. No centralized configuration.")*

    *   **Missing Implementation:** *(Fill in details: e.g., "Need to centralize log level configuration using environment variables. Need to ensure all destinations use the correct `minLevel` for each environment.")*

## Mitigation Strategy: [Destination Configuration and Security (SwiftyBeaver API)](./mitigation_strategies/destination_configuration_and_security__swiftybeaver_api_.md)

**3. Destination Configuration and Security (SwiftyBeaver API)**

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Choose Destinations Wisely:** Select SwiftyBeaver destinations that are appropriate for your security and compliance requirements.
        2.  **Secure Credentials:** If using destinations that require credentials (e.g., cloud services), *never* hardcode them in your source code.  Use environment variables or a secure configuration management system.  Pass these credentials to SwiftyBeaver when configuring the destination:
            ```swift
            let cloud = SBPlatformDestination(appID: "YOUR_APP_ID", appSecret: "YOUR_APP_SECRET", encryptionKey: "YOUR_ENCRYPTION_KEY")
            SwiftyBeaver.addDestination(cloud)
            ```
        3.  **Encryption (If Applicable):**  If the destination supports encryption (e.g., `SBPlatformDestination`), ensure it's enabled and configured correctly. Use a strong encryption key.
        4.  **Access Control (External):**  This is *partially* SwiftyBeaver-related. While SwiftyBeaver itself doesn't manage access control *to* the logs (that's handled by the destination system, e.g., AWS IAM), the *configuration* of the destination within SwiftyBeaver is crucial.  Ensure you're using the correct credentials and settings to connect to a destination with appropriate access controls.
        5. **Testing:** Thoroughly test the configuration of each destination, including credential handling and encryption (if applicable).

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Logs (Severity: High):**  Ensures that logs are sent to secure destinations with appropriate access controls.
        *   **Data Breach (Severity: High):**  Reduces the risk of a data breach if an attacker gains access to your logging infrastructure.
        *   **Misconfiguration (Severity: Medium):**  Helps prevent misconfiguration of destinations.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access/Data Breach:**  Significantly reduces the risk.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** *(Fill in details: e.g., "Using `SBPlatformDestination`, but credentials are hardcoded. Encryption is not enabled.")*

    *   **Missing Implementation:** *(Fill in details: e.g., "Need to move credentials to environment variables.  Need to enable encryption for `SBPlatformDestination`. Need to review and tighten access controls on the cloud storage used for logs.")*

## Mitigation Strategy: [Structured Logging with SwiftyBeaver (JSON Format)](./mitigation_strategies/structured_logging_with_swiftybeaver__json_format_.md)

**4. Structured Logging with SwiftyBeaver (JSON Format)**

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Enable JSON Format:** Configure SwiftyBeaver to use the JSON format for log messages. This can often be done by setting the `format` property of the destination:
            ```swift
            let console = ConsoleDestination()
            console.format = "$J" // Use the built-in JSON format
            SwiftyBeaver.addDestination(console)
            ```
            Alternatively, you can create a custom formatter that outputs JSON.
        2.  **Consistent Data Structure:**  Define a consistent structure for your log messages.  Include standard fields like timestamp, log level, message, and any relevant context data.
        3.  **Log Viewing/Analysis:** Ensure that your log viewing and analysis tools are configured to properly parse and interpret the JSON-formatted logs.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Log Injection (Severity: Medium):** Makes it more difficult for attackers to inject malicious content that could be misinterpreted by log parsing tools.
        *   **Improved Log Analysis:** Facilitates easier and more reliable parsing and analysis of logs.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Log Injection:** Reduces the risk, especially when combined with input validation and sanitization.
        *   **Log Analysis:** Significantly improves the efficiency and accuracy of log analysis.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** *(Fill in details: e.g., "Plain text logging is currently used.")*

    *   **Missing Implementation:** *(Fill in details: e.g., "Need to configure SwiftyBeaver destinations to use the JSON format. Need to define a consistent JSON structure for log messages.")*
