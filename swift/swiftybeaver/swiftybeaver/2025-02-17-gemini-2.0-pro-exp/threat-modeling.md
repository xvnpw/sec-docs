# Threat Model Analysis for swiftybeaver/swiftybeaver

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure in Logs](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_in_logs.md)

*   **Threat:** Sensitive Data Exposure in Logs

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to log files or the SwiftyBeaver Platform dashboard and views sensitive information (passwords, API keys, PII, session tokens, etc.) that was inadvertently logged by the application *through SwiftyBeaver*. The attacker might achieve this through compromised server access, weak file permissions, or a compromised SwiftyBeaver Platform account.  This threat is *direct* because SwiftyBeaver is the mechanism by which the sensitive data is exposed.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, identity theft, unauthorized access to other systems, reputational damage, legal and financial consequences.
    *   **Affected SwiftyBeaver Component:** All destinations (Console, File, SwiftyBeaver Platform, Custom). The core logging functions (`log.debug()`, `log.info()`, etc.) are indirectly affected, as they are the entry points for logging data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Data Minimization:**  Never log sensitive data.  Implement a strict policy against logging any information that is not absolutely necessary.
        *   **Data Masking/Redaction:**  Before logging, sanitize any data that might contain sensitive information.  Replace sensitive parts with placeholders or hashes. Use SwiftyBeaver filters or custom code.
        *   **Code Review:**  Regularly review code to identify and remove instances of sensitive data being logged.
        *   **Automated Scanning:**  Use static analysis tools to scan for potential logging of sensitive data.
        *   **Secure Configuration:**  Ensure strict file permissions. Securely store SwiftyBeaver Platform credentials.

## Threat: [Log Injection (Network)](./threats/log_injection__network_.md)

*   **Threat:** Log Injection (Network)

    *   **Description:** An attacker on the network intercepts and modifies log messages sent to the SwiftyBeaver Platform or a custom network destination *managed by SwiftyBeaver*, or injects forged log entries. This is possible if SwiftyBeaver's communication is not properly secured. This is *direct* because it targets SwiftyBeaver's network communication.
    *   **Impact:**  False information in logs, misleading investigations, potential for denial of service.
    *   **Affected SwiftyBeaver Component:** SwiftyBeaver Platform Destination, Custom Network Destinations.  The encryption and authentication mechanisms within these destinations are the key components.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **TLS Encryption:**  Use TLS (HTTPS) for all communication with the SwiftyBeaver Platform and custom network destinations. Ensure certificates are properly validated. This is a configuration option *within SwiftyBeaver*.
        *   **Strong Authentication:**  Use strong API keys or other authentication mechanisms provided by SwiftyBeaver.
        *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the application and logging infrastructure.

## Threat: [SwiftyBeaver Platform Account Compromise](./threats/swiftybeaver_platform_account_compromise.md)

*   **Threat:** SwiftyBeaver Platform Account Compromise

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the application's SwiftyBeaver Platform account credentials (API keys, etc.) *used by SwiftyBeaver*.
    *   **Impact:**  The attacker can view, modify, or delete all logs stored in the SwiftyBeaver Platform.
    *   **Affected SwiftyBeaver Component:** SwiftyBeaver Platform Destination. The authentication and authorization mechanisms of the platform, as used by SwiftyBeaver, are key.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Credential Storage:**  Never hardcode SwiftyBeaver Platform credentials. Use environment variables, a secure configuration store, or a secrets management service.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Use the least privileged credentials possible within SwiftyBeaver's configuration.
        *   **Regular Credential Rotation:**  Rotate SwiftyBeaver Platform credentials regularly.
        *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** If supported by the SwiftyBeaver Platform, enable MFA.

## Threat: [SwiftyBeaver Library Vulnerability](./threats/swiftybeaver_library_vulnerability.md)

*   **Threat:** SwiftyBeaver Library Vulnerability

    *   **Description:** A security vulnerability is discovered *in the SwiftyBeaver library itself* (e.g., buffer overflow, code injection). An attacker exploits this vulnerability. This is the most *direct* threat, as it involves a flaw in SwiftyBeaver's code.
    *   **Impact:**  Code execution, privilege escalation, denial of service, data breach.
    *   **Affected SwiftyBeaver Component:**  Any part of the SwiftyBeaver library, depending on the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical, depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep SwiftyBeaver Updated:**  Regularly check for and apply updates to the SwiftyBeaver library.
        *   **Dependency Management:**  Use a dependency management tool (e.g., Swift Package Manager).
        *   **Security Audits:**  Consider security audits of the SwiftyBeaver library.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Run the application with the least necessary privileges.
