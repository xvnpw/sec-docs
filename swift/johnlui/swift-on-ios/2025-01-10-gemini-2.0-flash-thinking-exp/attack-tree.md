## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Swift Code [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_swift_code__critical_node_.md)

This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this node means the attacker has gained the ability to execute arbitrary code within the application's context, potentially leading to complete compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in swift-on-ios Bridge [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_swift-on-ios_bridge__high-risk_path_.md)

This path focuses on directly attacking the communication bridge between the JavaScript in the WebView and the native Swift code.
    * Attackers aim to find weaknesses in how `swift-on-ios` handles communication, data processing, or code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify Exposed Swift Functions [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/identify_exposed_swift_functions__critical_node_.md)

This is a crucial initial step for attackers targeting the `swift-on-ios` bridge.
    * Attackers will attempt to discover which Swift functions are accessible from the JavaScript side. This can be done through reverse engineering, examining documentation (if available), or by observing the application's behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Lack of Input Validation in Exposed Functions [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_lack_of_input_validation_in_exposed_functions__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

If the Swift functions exposed to JavaScript do not properly validate or sanitize the input they receive, attackers can exploit this.
    * By providing unexpected, malicious, or specially crafted input, attackers can potentially trigger vulnerabilities leading to code execution or other undesirable behavior. This is a high-risk path due to the prevalence of input validation issues in software.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious JavaScript to Interact with swift-on-ios [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_javascript_to_interact_with_swift-on-ios__high-risk_path_.md)

This path involves injecting malicious JavaScript code into the WebView.
    * Once malicious JavaScript is running within the WebView's context, it can interact with the `swift-on-ios` bridge to call exposed Swift functions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the WebView [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_cross-site_scripting__xss__in_the_webview__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities allow attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript into web pages viewed by other users.
    * In the context of `swift-on-ios`, achieving XSS in the WebView is a critical step, as it provides the attacker with the ability to execute JavaScript that can interact with the Swift bridge. This is a high-risk path due to the common occurrence of XSS vulnerabilities in web applications.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute JavaScript to Call Exposed Swift Functions with Malicious Arguments [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/execute_javascript_to_call_exposed_swift_functions_with_malicious_arguments__critical_node__high-ris_dc9f69fb.md)

After successfully injecting malicious JavaScript (via XSS or other means), the attacker can use this JavaScript to call the Swift functions exposed by `swift-on-ios`.
    * The attacker will craft these calls with malicious arguments, aiming to exploit vulnerabilities in the Swift functions or to abuse their intended functionality for malicious purposes. This is a critical node within a high-risk path as it directly leverages the bridge for attack.
