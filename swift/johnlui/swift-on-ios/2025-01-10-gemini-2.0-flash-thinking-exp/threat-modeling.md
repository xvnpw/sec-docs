# Threat Model Analysis for johnlui/swift-on-ios

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Insecure Bridge Handling](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_insecure_bridge_handling.md)

* **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Insecure Bridge Handling
    * **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the web view by manipulating data passed from the Swift side through the `swift-on-ios` bridge. This occurs if the framework doesn't properly sanitize or encode data before sending it to the JavaScript context. The attacker might then execute arbitrary scripts within the web view, potentially stealing user data, cookies, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
    * **Impact:** Data breach, session hijacking, defacement of the web view, unauthorized actions within the application's web context.
    * **Affected Component:** The JavaScript bridge mechanism within `swift-on-ios` responsible for communication between Swift and the web view. Specifically, functions or methods within `swift-on-ios` that facilitate sending data from Swift to JavaScript.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strict input sanitization and output encoding on the Swift side *within the code interacting with the `swift-on-ios` bridge* before passing data to the JavaScript context.
        * Utilize any built-in sanitization or encoding features provided by `swift-on-ios` if available.
        * Avoid directly injecting raw strings into the web view's DOM through the `swift-on-ios` bridge.

## Threat: [JavaScript-to-Native Bridge Exploitation](./threats/javascript-to-native_bridge_exploitation.md)

* **Threat:** JavaScript-to-Native Bridge Exploitation
    * **Description:** A malicious actor could craft JavaScript code within the web view to call Swift functions exposed through the `swift-on-ios` bridge in unintended or harmful ways. This could involve calling functions with unexpected parameters, bypassing intended security checks implemented within the `swift-on-ios` bridge, or triggering actions that should not be accessible from the web view via the framework's mechanisms.
    * **Impact:** Privilege escalation, unauthorized access to native functionalities, data manipulation within the native application context, potential application crash or instability.
    * **Affected Component:** The JavaScript bridge mechanism within `swift-on-ios` responsible for allowing JavaScript to invoke Swift functions. Specifically, the functions or methods within `swift-on-ios` that expose native functionality to the web view.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement a strict whitelist of allowed JavaScript-to-Swift function calls *within the `swift-on-ios` bridge configuration or implementation*.
        * Thoroughly validate all input parameters received from JavaScript *within the Swift functions called via the `swift-on-ios` bridge* before executing any native code.
        * Adhere to the principle of least privilege, exposing only the necessary functions to the web view through the `swift-on-ios` bridge.
        * Implement robust authentication and authorization checks within the native functions called from JavaScript via the `swift-on-ios` bridge.

## Threat: [Insecure Handling of WebView Content Loading](./threats/insecure_handling_of_webview_content_loading.md)

* **Threat:** Insecure Handling of WebView Content Loading
    * **Description:** If `swift-on-ios` allows loading arbitrary URLs or local files into its managed `WebView` without proper validation, an attacker could potentially load malicious content. This could be achieved through manipulating URLs passed to `swift-on-ios` functions responsible for loading content or exploiting vulnerabilities in how `swift-on-ios` handles content loading. This malicious content could then execute scripts or perform other harmful actions within the web view's context.
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution within the web view, exposure to web-based attacks like XSS and clickjacking, potential for phishing attacks if malicious external sites are loaded.
    * **Affected Component:** The `WebView` component managed by `swift-on-ios` and the logic within the framework that determines which URLs or local files are loaded into the web view. Specifically, functions within `swift-on-ios` responsible for loading web content.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement a strict whitelist of allowed URLs or URL patterns that can be loaded into the web view *within the application's logic interacting with `swift-on-ios`*.
        * Validate and sanitize any user-provided input that influences the URLs loaded into the web view *before passing it to `swift-on-ios` content loading functions*.
        * Enforce HTTPS for all remote content loaded into the web view *through configurations or checks within the application using `swift-on-ios`*.
        * Restrict the ability to load local files unless absolutely necessary and implement strict access controls *within the application's interaction with `swift-on-ios` file loading capabilities*.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in the `swift-on-ios` Framework Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_the__swift-on-ios__framework_itself.md)

* **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in the `swift-on-ios` Framework Itself
    * **Description:** Like any software library, `swift-on-ios` itself might contain security vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities if they exist in the version of the framework being used by the application. This could lead to various impacts depending on the nature of the vulnerability within the `swift-on-ios` code.
    * **Impact:**  Potential for remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, or other security breaches *within the context of how `swift-on-ios` operates*.
    * **Affected Component:** The core modules and components of the `swift-on-ios` framework.
    * **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability (can range from Low to Critical, considering only High and Critical here).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update to the latest stable version of the `swift-on-ios` framework to benefit from security patches.
        * Monitor the `swift-on-ios` repository and security advisories for any reported vulnerabilities.
        * Consider contributing to the project or engaging with the community to help identify and address potential security issues within `swift-on-ios`.
