## Threat: [Swift Runtime Vulnerabilities in Node.js Environment](./threats/swift_runtime_vulnerabilities_in_node_js_environment.md)

*   **Threat:** Swift Runtime Exploitation in Node.js
    *   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities within the Swift runtime when it's executed in the Node.js/JavaScriptCore environment. This might involve crafting specific inputs or triggering runtime conditions that expose memory corruption, unexpected behavior, or allow for code execution. Attackers could leverage this to gain control of the backend server or disrupt service. This threat is specific to `swift-on-ios` because it arises from running the Swift runtime in a non-native environment (Node.js).
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Remote Code Execution on the backend server.
        *   Denial of Service (DoS).
        *   Information Disclosure (memory leaks, crash dumps).
        *   Server compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Swift Runtime within JavaScriptCore (specifically the bridging layer and Swift standard library functions used in the backend, as facilitated by `swift-on-ios`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Stay updated with the latest `swift-on-ios` and Swift toolchain versions to benefit from security patches.
            *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization in Swift backend code to minimize attack surface.
            *   Perform thorough fuzzing and security testing of the Swift backend specifically in the Node.js environment provided by `swift-on-ios`.
            *   Utilize memory safety tools like AddressSanitizer (ASan) during development and testing to detect memory corruption issues early.
        *   **Users (Operations/Deployment):**
            *   Regularly update `swift-on-ios` and Node.js dependencies to apply security updates.
            *   Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to monitor for and potentially block exploitation attempts.

## Threat: [JavaScriptCore Bridging Vulnerabilities](./threats/javascriptcore_bridging_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** JavaScriptCore Bridge Exploitation
    *   **Description:** Attackers could exploit vulnerabilities in the communication bridge between Swift code and the JavaScriptCore/Node.js environment. This bridge, a core component of `swift-on-ios`, handles data marshalling and function calls. Flaws in this bridge could be exploited by manipulating data passed across it to cause buffer overflows, type confusion, or other memory safety issues. An attacker might be able to execute arbitrary code in either the Swift or Node.js context, directly leveraging the `swift-on-ios` mechanism.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Remote Code Execution in Swift backend or Node.js process.
        *   Denial of Service (DoS).
        *   Data corruption or manipulation due to bridge manipulation.
        *   Privilege escalation within the backend environment.
    *   **Affected Component:** JavaScriptCore Bridge (specifically the data marshalling and function call mechanisms implemented by `swift-on-ios` to connect Swift and JavaScriptCore).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Minimize the complexity of bridge interactions to reduce potential attack surface.
            *   Use well-defined and type-safe interfaces for communication between Swift and JavaScript to limit type-related vulnerabilities.
            *   Carefully review and rigorously test data marshalling and unmarshalling logic within the `swift-on-ios` bridge implementation.
            *   Avoid passing sensitive data directly through the bridge if possible; consider alternative secure data handling practices.
        *   **Users (Operations/Deployment):**
            *   Monitor for unusual bridge activity or errors in logs that might indicate exploitation attempts.
            *   Apply security patches and updates for `swift-on-ios` and JavaScriptCore components as they become available.
