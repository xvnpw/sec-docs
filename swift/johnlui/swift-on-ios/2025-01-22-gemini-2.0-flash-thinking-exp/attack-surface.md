# Attack Surface Analysis for johnlui/swift-on-ios

## Attack Surface: [Unvalidated JavaScript Message Data via `JSBridge`](./attack_surfaces/unvalidated_javascript_message_data_via__jsbridge_.md)

*   **Description:** The `JSBridge` in `swift-on-ios` enables JavaScript code within the `WKWebView` to send messages to native Swift code. If the Swift side fails to rigorously validate and sanitize the data received in these messages, it becomes highly vulnerable to injection attacks.
*   **How `swift-on-ios` contributes to the attack surface:**  `swift-on-ios`'s fundamental purpose is to establish this communication channel via `JSBridge`. It directly facilitates the flow of data from the potentially untrusted JavaScript environment to the trusted native environment, making secure data handling on the Swift side paramount.
*   **Example:** A Swift function, exposed through `JSBridge`, is designed to process user-provided names from JavaScript. If JavaScript sends a message containing a malicious payload like `; rm -rf /` as the "name", and the Swift code naively executes this without validation (e.g., in a shell command), it could lead to critical command injection, potentially wiping out the device's file system.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Critical Command Injection:** Arbitrary code execution on the iOS device with the application's privileges.
    *   **Critical File System Access:** Unauthorized read, write, or deletion of sensitive files on the device.
    *   **High Data Breach (SQL Injection):** If JavaScript data is used in database queries without sanitization, it can lead to unauthorized data access or modification.
    *   **High Application Logic Bypass:** Manipulation of application logic leading to unintended functionality or security breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory Input Validation:** Implement strict and comprehensive input validation on the Swift side for *all* data received from `JSBridge`. Define and enforce expected data types, formats, lengths, and allowed character sets.
    *   **Robust Data Sanitization:** Sanitize all input data to neutralize potentially harmful characters or sequences before using it in any operations. Employ context-aware sanitization based on how the data will be used (e.g., for shell commands, database queries, file paths).
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for JSBridge Handlers:** Design Swift functions exposed via `JSBridge` with the absolute minimum necessary privileges and access rights. Avoid granting broad permissions.
    *   **Secure API Usage:**  Never construct system commands or raw database queries directly from JavaScript input. Utilize secure APIs and frameworks that offer built-in protection against injection vulnerabilities (e.g., parameterized database queries, secure file handling APIs).

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Complex Message Handling](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_complex_message_handling.md)

*   **Description:** When applications using `swift-on-ios` exchange complex data structures between JavaScript and Swift using serialization (e.g., JSON, custom formats), vulnerabilities in the deserialization process on the Swift side can be exploited to achieve code execution or denial of service.
*   **How `swift-on-ios` contributes to the attack surface:** While `swift-on-ios` doesn't dictate serialization methods, its flexibility in message passing encourages developers to exchange richer data. If developers choose to serialize complex objects for communication via `JSBridge`, they inherently introduce the risk of deserialization vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:**  Swift code deserializes JSON data received from JavaScript. If a vulnerable JSON deserialization library is used, or if the deserialization logic itself is flawed, a malicious JavaScript can craft a specially crafted JSON payload that, when deserialized by Swift, triggers code execution due to object injection or buffer overflows in the deserializer.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Critical Object Injection:**  Remote code execution on the iOS device by exploiting vulnerabilities in the deserialization process.
    *   **High Denial of Service:** Application crash or unresponsiveness due to resource exhaustion or errors during the deserialization of maliciously crafted payloads.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the deserialization method, library vulnerabilities, and exploitability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Minimize Deserialization Complexity:**  Favor simpler data formats like strings or basic key-value pairs for `JSBridge` communication whenever feasible to reduce the attack surface associated with complex deserialization.
    *   **Utilize Secure and Updated Deserialization Libraries:** If complex data exchange is necessary, use well-vetted, actively maintained, and regularly updated JSON or other deserialization libraries known for their security.
    *   **Schema Validation for Deserialized Data:** Implement schema validation to verify the structure and data types of deserialized objects against a predefined schema. Reject payloads that deviate from the expected schema.
    *   **Resource Limits for Deserialization:**  Enforce limits on the size and nesting depth of serialized data to mitigate potential denial-of-service attacks caused by excessively large or complex payloads.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Leading to Sensitive Actions via Swift to JavaScript Communication](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__leading_to_sensitive_actions_via_swift_to_javascript_communication.md)

*   **Description:** When Swift code sends data to JavaScript using `callHandler`, and this data is not properly handled and encoded in JavaScript, it can create critical XSS vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities become especially severe if they allow attackers to trigger sensitive actions or access privileged functionalities within the application's JavaScript context, which can then interact back with the native side via `JSBridge`.
*   **How `swift-on-ios` contributes to the attack surface:** `swift-on-ios` provides the `callHandler` mechanism for Swift to initiate communication with JavaScript. If developers use this to pass dynamic content or user-controlled data to JavaScript without proper output encoding, they create a pathway for XSS attacks.
*   **Example:** Swift code retrieves a user's session token and sends it to JavaScript via `callHandler` to be used in subsequent API calls from the WebView. If the JavaScript code doesn't properly handle this token and is vulnerable to XSS, an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript to steal the session token and impersonate the user, potentially even triggering privileged native functions via `JSBridge` if the JavaScript side has access to such functionalities.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Critical Account Hijacking:** Stealing session tokens or credentials leading to complete account takeover.
    *   **High Data Theft:** Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive user data or application data accessible within the JavaScript context.
    *   **High Privilege Escalation:** Exploiting XSS to trigger privileged actions or functionalities within the application, potentially interacting with native functionalities via `JSBridge` to bypass security controls.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the sensitivity of data exposed and the potential for triggering privileged actions).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory Output Encoding in JavaScript:**  Always HTML-encode *all* data received from Swift in JavaScript via `callHandler` before displaying it in the WebView or using it in HTML context. Use appropriate encoding functions based on the context (e.g., HTML encoding for HTML, JavaScript encoding for JavaScript strings).
    *   **Strict Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a robust Content Security Policy (CSP) to significantly limit the impact of XSS attacks. Restrict sources for JavaScript, CSS, and other resources, and disable `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval` directives.
    *   **Secure JavaScript Development Practices:** Follow secure JavaScript coding practices to minimize DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities in the JavaScript codebase itself. Regularly review and audit JavaScript code for potential XSS weaknesses.
    *   **Minimize Data Sent from Swift to JavaScript:** Reduce the amount of sensitive data transmitted from Swift to JavaScript via `callHandler`. Re-evaluate if sensitive data truly needs to be exposed to the JavaScript context. If possible, perform sensitive operations entirely on the native side.
