*   **Attack Surface:** Embedded HTTP Server Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** The `Swift-On-iOS` library embeds a fully functional HTTP server within the iOS application. This introduces potential vulnerabilities inherent in web server implementations.
    *   **How Swift-On-iOS Contributes:** The library is the direct source of this embedded server, making its implementation and any flaws within it a direct contributor to the application's attack surface.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could send a specially crafted HTTP request that exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in the server's request parsing logic, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution within the app's context.
    *   **Impact:**  Remote code execution, application crash, data exfiltration, unauthorized access to device resources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Thoroughly audit the `Swift-On-iOS` library's server implementation for known vulnerabilities. Keep the library updated to benefit from security patches. Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all data received by the embedded server. Consider using a well-vetted and actively maintained server implementation if possible, or contribute to the security of the `Swift-On-iOS` project. Implement rate limiting and request size restrictions to mitigate DoS attacks.

*   **Attack Surface:** Path Traversal
    *   **Description:**  Attackers could potentially access files or directories outside of the intended web root served by the embedded server.
    *   **How Swift-On-iOS Contributes:** If the library's server implementation doesn't properly sanitize file paths requested by clients, it can be exploited for path traversal.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a request like `GET /../../../../etc/passwd` to the embedded server, potentially gaining access to sensitive system files if the server doesn't prevent navigating outside the intended directory.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive application data, configuration files, or even system files.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Ensure the `Swift-On-iOS` server implementation strictly validates and sanitizes all file paths received in requests. Implement proper access controls and restrict the server's access to only the necessary files and directories. Avoid constructing file paths directly from user input.

*   **Attack Surface:** Data Handling Vulnerabilities in Embedded Server
    *   **Description:**  If the server-side Swift code handles user input without proper sanitization, it can be vulnerable to common web application attacks.
    *   **How Swift-On-iOS Contributes:** The library facilitates the creation of server-side endpoints within the app, which can process user-provided data.
    *   **Example:**
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** If the server generates dynamic web content based on user input without proper encoding, an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript that executes in another user's context.
        *   **SQL Injection (if interacting with local storage):** If the server-side code constructs SQL queries based on user input without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious SQL code to manipulate the database.
    *   **Impact:**  Data breaches, session hijacking, unauthorized actions on behalf of other users, manipulation of local data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all data received by the embedded server. Use parameterized queries or ORM frameworks to prevent SQL injection. Employ proper output encoding to prevent XSS vulnerabilities. Follow secure coding practices for handling user input.
