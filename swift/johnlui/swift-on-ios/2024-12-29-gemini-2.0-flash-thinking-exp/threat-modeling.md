Here's the updated threat list, focusing only on high and critical threats directly involving the `Swift-On-iOS` library:

*   **Threat:** Malicious JavaScript Function Call
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the web view. This code then calls Swift functions exposed by `Swift-On-iOS` with crafted, unexpected, or malicious arguments. This could bypass intended logic or trigger unintended actions within the native iOS environment.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption or manipulation within the native application's data stores, unauthorized access to native functionalities, potential crashes or instability of the application.
    *   **Affected Component:** The `Swift-On-iOS` message handling mechanism that bridges JavaScript calls to Swift functions, and the specific Swift functions exposed to the web view.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly validate all input received from JavaScript within the Swift functions.
        *   Implement whitelisting of expected input values and types.
        *   Avoid directly executing commands or modifying data based on unvalidated input.
        *   Use strong type checking and error handling within the Swift functions.

*   **Threat:** Unintended Native Functionality Access
    *   **Description:**  An attacker leverages vulnerabilities in the Swift code exposed by `Swift-On-iOS` to gain access to native iOS APIs or functionalities that were not intended to be accessible from the web view. This could allow them to perform actions with elevated privileges.
    *   **Impact:** Access to sensitive device information (location, contacts, etc.), ability to trigger device functionalities (camera, microphone), potential for privilege escalation within the application or even the device.
    *   **Affected Component:** Specific Swift functions exposed by `Swift-On-iOS` that interact with native iOS APIs.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Minimize the number of native APIs exposed to the web view.
        *   Implement strict authorization and access controls within the Swift code before invoking native APIs.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when designing the Swift-JavaScript interface.
        *   Regularly audit the exposed Swift functions for potential vulnerabilities.

*   **Threat:** Information Leakage Through the Bridge
    *   **Description:** Sensitive data is inadvertently or intentionally passed from the Swift side to the JavaScript side via the `Swift-On-iOS` bridge. Malicious JavaScript within the web view can then access and exfiltrate this data.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive user data, application secrets, or other confidential information.
    *   **Affected Component:** The `Swift-On-iOS` data passing mechanism between Swift and JavaScript.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Minimize the amount of sensitive data passed to the web view.
        *   If sensitive data must be passed, encrypt it before sending it to JavaScript and decrypt it securely within the native environment when needed.
        *   Avoid storing sensitive data in the web view's local storage or session storage.
        *   Carefully review the data flow between Swift and JavaScript to identify potential leakage points.
