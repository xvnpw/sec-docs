# Attack Surface Analysis for johnlui/swift-on-ios

## Attack Surface: [CGO Memory Corruption](./attack_surfaces/cgo_memory_corruption.md)

*Description:* Vulnerabilities arising from incorrect memory management across the CGO (C-Go) boundary between Swift and Go. This includes buffer overflows, use-after-free errors, double-frees, and other memory corruption issues.
*How `swift-on-ios` Contributes:* `swift-on-ios` fundamentally relies on CGO to enable communication between Swift and Go. This creates a direct pathway for memory corruption vulnerabilities if data is not handled correctly across the language boundary. This is the *core* attack surface introduced by the project.
*Example:* A Swift function passes a string to a Go function. The Go function incorrectly calculates the string's length and writes past the allocated buffer, overwriting adjacent memory.
*Impact:* Arbitrary code execution, application crashes, data corruption, denial of service.
*Risk Severity:* Critical
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Fuzz Testing:** Extensive fuzz testing of the CGO interface using tools like `go-fuzz` and AFL is *crucial*. This involves providing a wide range of random inputs to the interface to trigger potential memory errors.
    *   **Memory Safety Tools:** Use memory safety tools like AddressSanitizer (ASan) and MemorySanitizer (MSan) during development and testing to detect memory errors at runtime.
    *   **Code Review:** Rigorous code review of the CGO interface, focusing on memory allocation, deallocation, and pointer arithmetic. Multiple reviewers should be involved.
    *   **Minimize Data Transfer:** Reduce the amount and complexity of data passed across the CGO boundary. Favor simple data types (integers, booleans) over complex structures or strings when possible.
    *   **Safe String Handling:** If strings must be passed, use well-defined and safe string handling mechanisms (e.g., length-prefixed strings) and avoid direct pointer manipulation.
    *   **Defensive Programming:** Implement checks on both the Swift and Go sides to validate data sizes and prevent out-of-bounds access.

## Attack Surface: [CGO Type Confusion](./attack_surfaces/cgo_type_confusion.md)

*Description:* Vulnerabilities caused by mismatches in data types between Swift and Go, leading to incorrect interpretation of data and potential bypass of type safety checks.
*How `swift-on-ios` Contributes:* The CGO interface requires careful mapping of data types between Swift and Go. `swift-on-ios` facilitates this interaction, and errors in this mapping, inherent to the project's design, can lead to type confusion.
*Example:* A Swift `Int` is passed to a Go function that expects a `uintptr`. The Go function might misinterpret the `Int` value, leading to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
*Impact:* Potentially arbitrary code execution (depending on how the type confusion is exploited), data corruption, unexpected program behavior.
*Risk Severity:* High
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Strict Type Definitions:** Use explicit and well-defined type mappings between Swift and Go. Avoid ambiguous or implicit type conversions.
    *   **Code Generation:** Consider using code generation tools to automatically generate the CGO interface code, reducing the risk of manual errors in type mapping.
    *   **Validation:** Implement runtime checks on both sides of the CGO boundary to validate the types of data being passed.
    *   **Testing:** Thoroughly test the CGO interface with different data types and edge cases to ensure correct type handling.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Go Dependency](./attack_surfaces/malicious_go_dependency.md)

*Description:* A compromised or malicious Go module introduced into the project's dependency tree. This is a supply-chain attack.
*How `swift-on-ios` Contributes:* `swift-on-ios` *itself* uses Go modules for dependency management. The project's reliance on the Go ecosystem introduces this risk.
*Example:* A seemingly benign Go module used for logging, and included as a dependency of `swift-on-ios`, is compromised and modified to include malicious code that exfiltrates data.
*Impact:* Arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, compromise of the entire application.
*Risk Severity:* High
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Dependency Auditing:** Regularly audit all Go module dependencies of `swift-on-ios` using tools like `go mod verify` and `go mod why`.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use dependency scanning tools (e.g., Snyk, Dependabot, or Go's built-in vulnerability scanning) to automatically identify known vulnerabilities in `swift-on-ios`'s dependencies.
    *   **Private Proxy:** Consider using a private Go module proxy to control and audit the dependencies used by `swift-on-ios`.
    *   **Vendor Dependencies:** Vendor dependencies (copy them into the `swift-on-ios` project's repository) to have a known-good copy and to prevent unexpected changes from upstream.
    *   **Minimal Dependencies:** Minimize the number of dependencies in `swift-on-ios` to reduce the attack surface.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Build Environment](./attack_surfaces/compromised_build_environment.md)

*Description:* The build environment (e.g., a developer's machine or CI/CD server) is compromised, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code into the build process of the Go part of `swift-on-ios`.
*How `swift-on-ios` Contributes:* `swift-on-ios` relies on custom build scripts and the Go toolchain for its Go component. A compromised build environment could modify these scripts or the toolchain, directly affecting the compiled output of `swift-on-ios`.
*Example:* An attacker gains access to a developer's machine and modifies the `build.sh` script (or equivalent) used to build the Go component of `swift-on-ios` to include a backdoor.
*Impact:* Arbitrary code execution, backdoor in the application, compromise of the entire application.
*Risk Severity:* High
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Secure Build Server:** Use a secure and isolated build environment (e.g., a CI/CD pipeline with strong access controls) for building `swift-on-ios`.
    *   **Code Signing:** Digitally sign build scripts used for `swift-on-ios` and verify the signature before execution.
    *   **Build Artifact Verification:** Verify the integrity of build artifacts of `swift-on-ios` (e.g., using checksums) before deployment or integration.
    *   **Developer Machine Security:** Ensure that developers' machines used to build or contribute to `swift-on-ios` are secure and protected from malware.
    *   **Two-Factor Authentication:** Enforce two-factor authentication for access to build systems and code repositories related to `swift-on-ios`.
