Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Unauthorized Native Function Execution via Bridge" threat, tailored for a development team using `swift-on-ios`, presented in Markdown format:

# Deep Analysis: Unauthorized Native Function Execution via Bridge

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Unauthorized Native Function Execution via Bridge" threat, identify specific vulnerabilities within the context of a `swift-on-ios` application, and propose concrete, actionable steps to mitigate the risk.  This goes beyond the general mitigation strategies listed in the threat model and delves into implementation-specific considerations.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses on the following areas:

*   **Bridge Implementation:**  The specific Swift code that uses `swift-on-ios` (and indirectly `gonative-ios`) to expose native functions to JavaScript. This includes the `gonative_ios.go` file (if modified) and any Swift files interacting with it.
*   **JavaScript Interaction:**  The JavaScript code within the webview that interacts with the bridge.  This includes both first-party code and any third-party libraries used.
*   **Data Flow:**  The precise flow of data from the webview (JavaScript) through the bridge to the native (Swift) code, and any return values.
*   **Exposed Functions:**  A complete inventory of all native functions exposed to JavaScript, their intended purpose, and their potential for misuse.
*   **Input Validation:**  The existing input validation mechanisms (if any) for data passed through the bridge.
* **Vulnerable Code Patterns:** Identify any code patterns that are known to be vulnerable.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methods:

1.  **Code Review:**  A manual, line-by-line review of the relevant Swift and JavaScript code, focusing on the bridge implementation and data handling.  This will be the primary method.
2.  **Static Analysis:**  Using static analysis tools (e.g., SwiftLint, ESLint, potentially security-focused linters) to identify potential vulnerabilities and code quality issues.
3.  **Dynamic Analysis (Fuzzing):**  Constructing a series of malformed and unexpected JavaScript inputs to test the robustness of the bridge and identify potential crashes or unexpected behavior. This will involve creating a test harness specifically for this purpose.
4.  **Dependency Analysis:**  Reviewing all third-party JavaScript libraries for known vulnerabilities and ensuring they are up-to-date.  Tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` will be used.
5.  **Documentation Review:**  Examining any existing documentation related to the bridge implementation and security considerations.
6.  **Threat Modeling Review:** Re-evaluating the existing threat model in light of the findings from the code review and dynamic analysis.

## 4. Deep Analysis

### 4.1. Inventory of Exposed Functions

The first critical step is to create a complete list of all native functions exposed to JavaScript.  This should include:

*   **Function Name (JavaScript side):**  The name used in JavaScript to call the function.
*   **Function Name (Swift side):** The corresponding Swift function name.
*   **Parameters:**  The number, names, and data types of all parameters passed to the function.
*   **Return Value:**  The data type of the return value (if any).
*   **Intended Purpose:**  A brief description of what the function is supposed to do.
*   **Potential Misuse:**  How an attacker might misuse the function to achieve malicious goals.

**Example Table:**

| JavaScript Function | Swift Function      | Parameters                               | Return Value | Intended Purpose                     | Potential Misuse
