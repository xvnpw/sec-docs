# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, represented by the GitHub repository 'swift-on-ios', appears to be a demonstration or template project showcasing Swift development for iOS applications.  Assuming this is an example project, its primary business goal is likely educational or demonstrative, aiming to provide a starting point or reference for developers learning or using Swift for iOS development.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Provide a clear and functional example of Swift code for iOS development.
- Demonstrate best practices in iOS development using Swift.
- Offer a reusable template or starting point for new iOS projects.
- Potentially showcase specific iOS features or libraries.

Business Risks:
- Lack of adoption or interest from the developer community if the example is not relevant or well-executed.
- Misinterpretation or misuse of the example code leading to insecure or poorly designed applications if security aspects are not properly addressed or highlighted.
- Outdatedness of the example code if not maintained with the latest Swift and iOS updates, reducing its educational value.
- Potential security vulnerabilities in the example code itself, which could be copied and pasted into real applications, leading to security issues.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: iOS platform security features (sandboxing, code signing, app store review). Implemented by: iOS operating system and Apple App Store.
- security control: Swift language safety features (memory safety, type safety). Implemented by: Swift compiler and language design.
- security control: Secure coding practices by developers (input validation, secure data handling). Implemented by: Developers following secure coding guidelines.
- security control: Static code analysis tools (linters, SAST) can be integrated into development workflow. Implemented by: Developer tooling and CI/CD pipelines (if used).

Accepted Risks:
- accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries if used and not regularly updated.
- accepted risk: Developer errors leading to security vulnerabilities in the application code.
- accepted risk: Reverse engineering of the application code, common for mobile applications.
- accepted risk: Data breaches if sensitive data is stored insecurely on the device or during transmission.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Implement automated static application security testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code.
- security control: Conduct regular dependency scanning to identify and update vulnerable third-party libraries.
- security control: Implement runtime application self-protection (RASP) techniques to detect and prevent attacks at runtime (if applicable and necessary for the application's risk profile).
- security control: Perform penetration testing or security audits to identify vulnerabilities before release.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication:
    - requirement: If the application interacts with backend services, implement secure authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0, token-based authentication).
    - requirement: Store authentication tokens securely on the device, using Keychain services.
- Authorization:
    - requirement: Implement proper authorization checks to ensure users can only access data and functionalities they are permitted to.
    - requirement: Follow the principle of least privilege when designing authorization models.
- Input Validation:
    - requirement: Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting if using web views).
    - requirement: Sanitize inputs before processing and displaying them.
- Cryptography:
    - requirement: Use strong and up-to-date cryptographic algorithms for data encryption and hashing.
    - requirement: Securely manage cryptographic keys, avoiding hardcoding them in the application.
    - requirement: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- Providing a functional and secure example of Swift iOS development for educational purposes.
- Maintaining the integrity and security of the example code to prevent misuse in real-world applications.
- Ensuring the example remains relevant and up-to-date with current iOS development practices.

Data Sensitivity:
- The example project itself likely does not handle sensitive user data.
- However, if the example is extended or used as a template for real applications, the data sensitivity will depend on the specific application's functionality.
- For the example project, the primary data to protect is the source code itself and the integrity of the build artifacts to prevent malicious modifications.

Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
- Source Code: High sensitivity - Intellectual property, potential vulnerabilities if exposed or modified maliciously.
- Build Artifacts (IPA): Medium sensitivity - Integrity is important to ensure users download the intended application.
- Developer Credentials and Signing Certificates: High sensitivity - Critical for maintaining the integrity and authenticity of the application.
- CI/CD Pipeline Configuration: Medium sensitivity - Misconfiguration could lead to security vulnerabilities in the build process.
