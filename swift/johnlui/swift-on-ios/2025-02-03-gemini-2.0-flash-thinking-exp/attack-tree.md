## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Older Vapor Version (CVEs)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_older_vapor_version__cves_.md)

*   Attack Vector:
    *   Attacker identifies the Vapor version used by the application (e.g., through server headers, error messages, or reverse engineering).
    *   Attacker searches for publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) associated with that specific Vapor version.
    *   Attacker utilizes readily available exploit code or tools (like Metasploit modules) to exploit these vulnerabilities.
*   Likelihood: Medium
*   Impact: High (Remote Code Execution, Data Breach, Denial of Service)
*   Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Regularly update Vapor and its dependencies to the latest stable versions.
    *   Implement a dependency management process and monitor security advisories.
    *   Use vulnerability scanning tools to detect outdated dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Access sensitive information or administrative functions via Exposed Debug/Development Endpoints](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_access_sensitive_information_or_administrative_functions_via_exposed_debugdevelopme_f47a155d.md)

*   Attack Vector:
    *   Attacker discovers debug or development endpoints that were unintentionally left enabled in the production application.
    *   Attacker accesses these endpoints through simple web requests or browsing.
    *   These endpoints may expose sensitive configuration details, internal data, or even administrative functionalities that can be abused.
*   Likelihood: Medium
*   Impact: Medium-High (Information Disclosure, Potential Privilege Escalation)
*   Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Strictly disable all debug and development endpoints in production builds.
    *   Implement feature flags or environment-based configurations to control endpoint availability.
    *   Automated checks in the build process to ensure debug endpoints are disabled in production.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 3: Server-Side Injection Attacks due to Lack of Input Validation](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3_server-side_injection_attacks_due_to_lack_of_input_validation.md)

*   Attack Vector:
    *   Attacker identifies API endpoints that do not properly validate user-supplied input.
    *   Attacker crafts malicious input payloads designed to inject commands or manipulate server-side operations (e.g., Command Injection, Path Traversal if file system access is involved).
    *   The server-side code executes the injected commands or operations, leading to unauthorized actions.
*   Likelihood: Medium-High
*   Impact: High (Remote Code Execution, Data Breach, File System Access, Denial of Service)
*   Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user inputs at API endpoints.
