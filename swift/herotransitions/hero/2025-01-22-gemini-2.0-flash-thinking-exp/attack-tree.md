## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Outdated or Vulnerable Dependencies of Hero [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_outdated_or_vulnerable_dependencies_of_hero__critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Hero library relies on other JavaScript packages (dependencies).
    *   These dependencies might have known security vulnerabilities due to being outdated or inherently flawed.
    *   An attacker can identify these vulnerabilities using publicly available databases or vulnerability scanning tools.
    *   If a vulnerable dependency is present, the attacker can exploit it to compromise the application. This could involve:
        *   Executing arbitrary code on the client-side.
        *   Gaining access to sensitive data.
        *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Example:** A dependency used by Hero might have a known XSS vulnerability. If the application uses a vulnerable version of Hero (and thus the vulnerable dependency), an attacker could exploit this XSS to inject malicious scripts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Hero's Distribution Channel (e.g., npm, GitHub) [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_hero's_distribution_channel__e_g___npm__github___critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Hero library is distributed through package managers like npm and code repositories like GitHub.
    *   An attacker could attempt to compromise these distribution channels. This is a supply chain attack.
    *   If successful, the attacker could inject malicious code into the Hero library itself.
    *   When developers install or update Hero, they would unknowingly download the compromised version.
    *   This malicious code would then be executed in every application using the compromised Hero library.
*   **Example:** An attacker could gain access to the npm account of the Hero library maintainer and publish a malicious update.  Applications automatically updating Hero would then be compromised.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Script through User-Controlled Data Used in Transitions [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_script_through_user-controlled_data_used_in_transitions__critical_node__high_risk_p_db5694c4.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Applications using Hero might allow user-provided data to influence the transitions.
    *   If this user-controlled data is not properly sanitized and validated, an attacker can inject malicious scripts.
    *   This is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
    *   When Hero processes this unsanitized data to create or manipulate transitions, the malicious script will be executed in the user's browser.
*   **Example:** An application might use user input to set the `id` or `class` of an element being transitioned by Hero. If an attacker inputs `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`, and this is directly used in the DOM manipulation by Hero without sanitization, the `alert('XSS')` script will execute.

## Attack Tree Path: [Tamper with Transition State or Configuration [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/tamper_with_transition_state_or_configuration__critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Hero transitions are client-side JavaScript code.
    *   Attackers can use browser developer tools or other client-side manipulation techniques to inspect and modify the state and configuration of Hero transitions.
    *   While directly manipulating transitions might not always lead to direct data breaches, it can be used to:
        *   Bypass intended application logic that relies on transitions.
        *   Cause unexpected application behavior.
        *   Potentially reveal sensitive information if transition data is not handled securely.
*   **Example:** An application might use Hero transitions to visually guide a user through a multi-step process. An attacker could manipulate the transition state to skip steps or bypass validation checks that are only enforced client-side during the transition process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Transition Data [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_transition_data__critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This is a broader category encompassing attack vector #3. It highlights the general risk of XSS arising from the way applications handle data within Hero transitions.
    *   Any user-controlled data that is used in Hero configurations, DOM manipulations, or event handlers without proper sanitization is a potential XSS vector.
    *   This includes data used for:
        *   Transition IDs or names.
        *   CSS classes applied during transitions.
        *   Content injected into elements during transitions.
        *   Data passed to event handlers triggered by transitions.
*   **Example:**  Beyond direct script injection, an attacker could inject malicious URLs or HTML attributes that, when processed by Hero and rendered in the DOM, lead to XSS vulnerabilities or other security issues.
