# Threat Model Analysis for herotransitions/hero

## Threat: [Client-Side Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./threats/client-side_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the application that gets executed in the user's browser. This is achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in how Hero.js handles user-provided data during DOM manipulations for transitions. The attacker might inject `<script>` tags or manipulate event handlers within content used by Hero.js.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the user's session, including session hijacking, stealing sensitive data (cookies, local storage), defacement of the webpage, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Affected Hero.js Component:** Potentially affects any component that handles dynamic content or user-provided data used in transitions, especially if used with custom content or configurations.  Specifically, areas where Hero.js dynamically injects or modifies DOM elements based on configuration or data.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Sanitization:**  Strictly sanitize and escape all user-provided data before using it in conjunction with Hero.js, especially any content that will be dynamically injected into the DOM during transitions. Use appropriate encoding functions for HTML context.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to restrict the origins from which scripts can be loaded and to limit the actions that scripts can perform. This can significantly reduce the impact of XSS attacks.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Hero.js library updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
    *   **Code Review:** Conduct thorough code reviews of the application's Hero.js integration to identify potential XSS vulnerabilities in how dynamic content is handled.
    *   **Minimize Dynamic Content:** Where possible, use static content for transitions and avoid relying on user-provided or dynamically generated HTML within Hero.js configurations.
