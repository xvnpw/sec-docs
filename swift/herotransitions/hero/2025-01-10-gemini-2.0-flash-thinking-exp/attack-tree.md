## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Transition Logic](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_transition_logic.md)

This path focuses on vulnerabilities in how transitions are initiated and controlled, potentially allowing attackers to bypass intended security measures or force transitions to unauthorized areas.

* **Critical Node: Bypass Transition Security Checks (H-BTC-01)**
    * **Attack Vector:** An attacker identifies weaknesses in the logic that initiates transitions. This could involve:
        * Exploiting missing or insufficient validation of parameters used to trigger transitions (e.g., `heroID`, transition type).
        * Crafting malicious input that circumvents authentication or authorization checks intended to be performed before the transition.
    * **Potential Impact:** Gaining unauthorized access to restricted parts of the application or functionalities.

* **Critical Node: Force Unintended Transitions (H-FTC-02)**
    * **Attack Vector:** An attacker finds ways to programmatically trigger transitions to views they are not intended to access. This could involve:
        * Exploiting a lack of input sanitization or authorization checks at points where transitions are triggered programmatically.
        * Injecting malicious code or data that manipulates the application into initiating a transition to a sensitive view (e.g., an admin panel or settings page).
    * **Potential Impact:** Information disclosure, execution of unintended actions within the unauthorized view, or further compromise of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Data Handling During Transitions](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_data_handling_during_transitions.md)

This path focuses on vulnerabilities related to the data passed between views during transitions, potentially allowing for the injection of malicious content.

* **Critical Node: Inject Malicious Data via Transition Context (H-DTI-01)**
    * **Attack Vector:** An attacker identifies how data is passed between views during transitions (e.g., using `HeroModifier` or custom transition implementations). They then craft a malicious data payload that, when processed by the destination view, leads to a security vulnerability. This is particularly concerning if the destination view renders web content.
    * **Potential Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if the injected data includes malicious scripts, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or other client-side attacks. Other vulnerabilities could arise depending on how the injected data is processed by the destination view.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Integration with Application State Management](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_integration_with_application_state_management.md)

This path focuses on vulnerabilities arising from the interaction between transition logic and the application's overall state management, potentially allowing attackers to trigger unintended actions.

* **Critical Node: Trigger Unintended Side Effects via Transitions (H-AST-01)**
    * **Attack Vector:** An attacker understands how transitions interact with the application's logic and state changes. They then craft specific transitions that inadvertently trigger unintended functionalities or state modifications. This could happen if critical actions are too closely tied to transition events.
    * **Potential Impact:** Triggering unauthorized actions such as initiating a purchase, deleting data, modifying user settings, or other unintended changes to the application's state.
