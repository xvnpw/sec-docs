# Threat Model Analysis for herotransitions/hero

## Threat: [Malicious Style Injection](./threats/malicious_style_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate the data captured by `hero` (e.g., element styles, positions, sizes) either before it's captured or during its processing by `hero`. This involves injecting arbitrary CSS properties or values that `hero` will then apply during the transition. The attacker might achieve this by manipulating the DOM structure or attributes of the elements intended for transition before `hero` captures their state.

**Impact:**
*   **Application Defacement:** Injecting styles that drastically alter the visual appearance of the application, potentially misleading or confusing users.
*   **Clickjacking:** Injecting styles that overlay malicious interactive elements on top of legitimate ones, tricking users into performing unintended actions.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Using CSS selectors and injected styles to extract information from the page based on the presence or absence of certain elements or data.

**Affected Hero Component:**
*   Data Capture Mechanism (the code within `hero` responsible for reading element styles and properties).
*   Style Application Logic (the code within `hero` that applies the captured styles to the target elements).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Input Sanitization:** While `hero` primarily deals with internal data, if any external input influences the elements being transitioned, rigorously sanitize that input before it affects the elements `hero` will capture.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to limit the sources from which stylesheets can be loaded and restrict the use of inline styles, reducing the impact of injected CSS that `hero` might apply.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Avoid transitioning elements that contain user-controlled content or elements whose styles are heavily influenced by user input, minimizing the attack surface for `hero` to capture malicious styles.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Review the codebase and the usage of `hero` to identify potential injection points where the data captured by `hero` could be influenced by malicious actors.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Captured Data](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_unsanitized_captured_data.md)

**Description:** Although `hero` primarily focuses on styles and positions, if the content of the transitioning elements (text, attributes) is captured by `hero` and subsequently used in a way that dynamically generates HTML or manipulates the DOM in the target state without proper sanitization, it could lead to an XSS vulnerability. An attacker might inject malicious scripts into the content of an element that is then captured and re-inserted into the DOM by `hero` during the transition.

**Impact:**
*   **Execution of Malicious Scripts:** Attackers can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies to gain unauthorized access to the application.
*   **Data Theft:** Stealing user credentials or other sensitive information.
*   **Redirection to Malicious Sites:** Redirecting users to attacker-controlled websites.

**Affected Hero Component:**
*   Data Capture Mechanism (within `hero`, specifically capturing element content and attributes).
*   Style/Attribute Application Logic (within `hero`, if it involves re-inserting or manipulating element content based on captured data).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Strict Output Encoding/Escaping:** Ensure that any content from the transitioning elements captured by `hero` that is used to dynamically generate HTML in the target state is properly encoded or escaped to prevent the execution of malicious scripts.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to mitigate the impact of XSS attacks, even if vulnerabilities exist in how `hero` handles captured content.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Review the codebase to identify any potential areas where captured content handled by `hero` might be used to manipulate the DOM unsafely.
