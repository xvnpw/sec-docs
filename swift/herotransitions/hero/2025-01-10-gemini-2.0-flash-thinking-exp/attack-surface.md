# Attack Surface Analysis for herotransitions/hero

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Shared Element Names](./attack_surfaces/malicious_shared_element_names.md)

* **Description:** Attackers can influence or inject malicious identifiers used by `hero` to match elements for transitions.
    * **How Hero Contributes:** `hero` relies on developers defining shared element names (likely CSS selectors or similar). If these names are derived from or influenced by untrusted sources, it creates an entry point for manipulation *within hero's transition logic*.
    * **Example:** A URL parameter like `?sharedElement=<img><script>alert('XSS')</script>` could be used if the application naively uses this parameter to set the shared element, potentially leading to script execution *during the hero transition*.
    * **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), arbitrary HTML injection, visual manipulation.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**
            * Never directly use user-provided data or data from untrusted sources to define shared element names.
            * Sanitize and validate any input that might influence shared element names *before passing it to hero*.
            * Use a predefined, safe list of shared element names and map user input to these safe values.
            * Implement robust Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate potential XSS.

## Attack Surface: [DOM Manipulation Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dom_manipulation_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Flaws in how `hero` selects, modifies, or animates DOM elements can be exploited.
    * **How Hero Contributes:** `hero`'s core functionality *directly* involves manipulating the DOM to create transition effects. Vulnerabilities *within hero's DOM manipulation code* can be exploited.
    * **Example:** A bug in `hero`'s code could allow an attacker to inject or modify attributes of elements involved in the transition *through hero's internal mechanisms*, potentially leading to unintended script execution or visual changes.
    * **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), arbitrary HTML injection, visual spoofing, denial of service (by manipulating critical UI elements).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**
            * Ensure the `hero` library is up-to-date to benefit from security patches *in hero itself*.
            * Carefully review the library's documentation and usage to avoid insecure configurations *specific to hero's features*.
            * Implement thorough testing, including security testing, of the application's transitions *using hero*.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfiguration and Improper Usage](./attack_surfaces/misconfiguration_and_improper_usage.md)

* **Description:** Developers using `hero` in unintended or insecure ways that directly expose vulnerabilities.
    * **How Hero Contributes:** The flexibility of `hero` means incorrect implementation *when using hero's specific APIs or configurations* can introduce vulnerabilities.
    * **Example:** Directly embedding user-provided HTML within elements that are then used as shared elements by `hero` without proper sanitization.
    * **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), DOM manipulation issues, unexpected application behavior.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**
            * Thoroughly understand the `hero` library's documentation and best practices *for secure usage*.
            * Follow secure coding principles when implementing transitions *with hero*.
            * Conduct code reviews to identify potential misconfigurations *involving hero*.
