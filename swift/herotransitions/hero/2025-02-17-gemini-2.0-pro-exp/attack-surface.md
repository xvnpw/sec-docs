# Attack Surface Analysis for herotransitions/hero

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Complex Animations](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_complex_animations.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers trigger excessively complex or long-running animations, consuming client-side resources (CPU/GPU).
*   **Hero Contribution:** Hero's core functionality is animation; it provides the mechanism for creating and controlling these potentially resource-intensive animations.
*   **Example:** An attacker manipulates a form field that controls animation duration, setting it to an extremely high value, causing the browser to freeze.  Or, they trigger a transition that involves animating hundreds of complex SVG elements simultaneously.
*   **Impact:** Browser unresponsiveness, freezing, or crashing for the user.  Potential for wider impact if the attack is coordinated (e.g., botnet).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   Implement strict input validation on all parameters affecting animation complexity (duration, easing, number of elements, etc.).  Use whitelists where possible.
        *   Set reasonable upper bounds on animation duration and complexity.
        *   Use `requestAnimationFrame` responsibly and consider debouncing/throttling animation updates.
        *   Monitor client-side performance metrics (e.g., using browser developer tools or performance monitoring libraries) to detect potential abuse.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Excessive View Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_excessive_view_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers trigger the creation and animation of a large number of DOM elements, exhausting client-side memory.
*   **Hero Contribution:** Hero facilitates the manipulation and animation of views (DOM elements) during transitions.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts input that causes Hero to animate a list with thousands of dynamically generated items, leading to excessive memory consumption.
*   **Impact:** Browser slowdown, freezing, or crashing due to memory exhaustion.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   Strictly limit the number of views that can be animated based on user input.
        *   Validate and sanitize any data that influences the creation or modification of views within Hero transitions.
        *   Implement pagination or lazy-loading for large datasets to avoid animating all elements at once.
        *   Consider using virtualized lists or other techniques to minimize the number of DOM elements rendered at any given time.

## Attack Surface: [UI Redressing / Overlay Attacks](./attack_surfaces/ui_redressing__overlay_attacks.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers use Hero animations to visually obscure or overlay security-critical UI elements, tricking users.
*   **Hero Contribution:** Hero's ability to animate and position elements makes it possible to create deceptive overlays.
*   **Example:** An attacker uses a Hero animation to move a transparent, malicious button over a legitimate "Login" button, capturing user credentials.
*   **Impact:** Users unknowingly interact with malicious elements, potentially leading to credential theft, unauthorized actions, or other security breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   Ensure security-critical elements (login forms, confirmation buttons, etc.) are always rendered on top (highest z-index) and are not obscured by animated content.
        *   Use techniques like shadow DOM to isolate security-sensitive components and prevent them from being manipulated by external scripts or styles.
        *   Avoid animating elements in a way that could mislead users about their functionality.
        *   Implement clickjacking protection mechanisms (e.g., `X-Frame-Options` header).

## Attack Surface: [Modifier Misuse / Logic Errors (High Severity Instances)](./attack_surfaces/modifier_misuse__logic_errors__high_severity_instances_.md)

*   **Description:**  Maliciously crafted Hero modifiers, *specifically those that can lead to significant security issues*, cause unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.  This focuses on the high-severity subset of modifier misuse.
*   **Hero Contribution:** Hero modifiers are the mechanism for controlling animation behavior; their misuse is directly tied to Hero.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a flaw in how a specific modifier interacts with z-index or opacity, allowing them to create an overlay attack (similar to the UI Redressing attack, but achieved through modifier manipulation).  Or, a modifier is misused to bypass intended animation restrictions, leading to a DoS condition.
*   **Impact:**  Potentially allows for UI redressing, denial of service, or other vulnerabilities that could compromise security.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize any user input that influences Hero modifiers. Treat modifiers as a *high-risk* attack vector.
        *   Implement a strict whitelist of allowed modifiers and their parameters. *Never* allow arbitrary modifier strings from untrusted sources.
        *   Conduct rigorous security testing, specifically focusing on how different modifier combinations can be abused. Fuzz testing of modifier inputs is highly recommended.
