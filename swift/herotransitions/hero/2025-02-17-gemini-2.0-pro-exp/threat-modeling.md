# Threat Model Analysis for herotransitions/hero

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Complex Animations](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_complex_animations.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) via Complex Animations

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input (e.g., a very large number of nested elements, or data that triggers the creation of many DOM nodes) that, when processed by the application, results in Hero attempting to animate an excessive number of elements or perform extremely complex calculations for animation parameters. This overwhelms the client's browser, causing it to become unresponsive or crash.
    *   **Impact:** Client-side denial of service; the user's browser becomes unusable.  Potentially crashes the browser tab or the entire browser.
    *   **Affected Hero Component:** Primarily the core animation engine, likely involving functions related to:
        *   `Hero.shared.animate(...)` (or similar internal animation driver).
        *   DOM manipulation functions within Hero that handle element matching and style updates.
        *   Internal logic that calculates animation durations and easing based on element properties.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Limit Element Count:** Impose a strict limit on the number of elements that can participate in a single Hero transition.
        *   **Maximum Duration:** Set a maximum allowed duration for any Hero animation. Reject or truncate animations exceeding this limit.
        *   **Input Validation:** Sanitize and validate any user input that could influence the number of elements or complexity of animations.
        *   **Performance Profiling:** Use browser developer tools to profile animation performance and identify potential bottlenecks.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** If animations are triggered by user actions, implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.

## Threat: [Accessibility Issues](./threats/accessibility_issues.md)

*   **Threat:** Accessibility Issues

    *   **Description:** Poorly implemented animations can create accessibility barriers.  Rapidly changing content, flashing animations, or animations that interfere with screen readers can make the application unusable for users with disabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Exclusion of users with disabilities; potential legal and ethical issues.
    *   **Affected Hero Component:**
        *   The entire Hero library, as any animation can potentially cause accessibility problems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **`prefers-reduced-motion`:** Respect the user's `prefers-reduced-motion` media query setting and reduce or disable animations accordingly.
        *   **Disable Animations Option:** Provide a user-accessible setting to disable all animations.
        *   **WCAG Compliance:** Adhere to WCAG guidelines for animations and motion.
        *   **Screen Reader Testing:** Test the application with assistive technologies (screen readers) to ensure compatibility.
        *   **Avoid Flashing:** Do not use animations that flash or blink rapidly.
        *   **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure that animations do not interfere with keyboard navigation.
