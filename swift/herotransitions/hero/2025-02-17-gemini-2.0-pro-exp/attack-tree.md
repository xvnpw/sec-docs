## Attack Tree Path: [2. Leak Sensitive Information During Transitions [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2__leak_sensitive_information_during_transitions__high-risk_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the most critical area, focusing on the potential for Hero to inadvertently expose sensitive data during animation transitions.
*   **Mitigation Focus:** Preventing unauthorized access to visual data during transitions.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1 Capture Intermediate Animation States [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_capture_intermediate_animation_states__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers attempt to capture the screen content *while* the animation is in progress, potentially revealing data that should only be visible after the transition completes.
*   **Mitigation:** Use OS-level screen capture prevention, minimize sensitive data display during transitions, consider blurring/masking.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1 Screen Recording/Screenshotting During Transition [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1_screen_recordingscreenshotting_during_transition__critical_.md)

*   **(Likelihood: Low / Impact: Very High / Effort: High / Skill Level: Expert / Detection Difficulty: Very Hard)**
*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the operating system or weaknesses in the app's screen capture prevention mechanisms to record the screen during a transition.
*   **Mitigation:** Rely on OS-provided mechanisms for preventing screen recording and screenshots.  Keep the OS and app up-to-date.  Be aware that these can be bypassed on compromised devices.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.2 Access View Hierarchy During Transition](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_2_access_view_hierarchy_during_transition.md)

*   **(Likelihood: Medium / Impact: Very High / Effort: Medium / Skill Level: Intermediate to Advanced / Detection Difficulty: Hard)**
*   **Description:** Using debugging tools or runtime inspection techniques (on a compromised device or through a vulnerability) to access the application's view hierarchy *during* the transition and extract sensitive data.
*   **Mitigation:** Minimize the amount of sensitive data present in the view hierarchy during transitions.  Implement runtime integrity checks (though these can be bypassed).  Avoid storing sensitive data directly in UI elements.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2 Exploit "Snapshotting" Mechanism [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_exploit_snapshotting_mechanism__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** If Hero creates temporary snapshots of views for animation purposes, these snapshots could be a target for attackers to extract data.
*   **Mitigation:** Securely store snapshots (encrypted, appropriate permissions), delete them immediately after use, avoid storing sensitive data in snapshots.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.1 If Hero creates temporary snapshots, access these to extract data](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_1_if_hero_creates_temporary_snapshots__access_these_to_extract_data.md)

*   **(Likelihood: Low to Medium / Impact: Very High / Effort: Medium to High / Skill Level: Advanced / Detection Difficulty: Hard)**
*   **Description:** The attacker identifies where Hero stores temporary snapshots (if it uses them) and attempts to access them, potentially gaining access to sensitive data that was displayed in the view.
*   **Mitigation:**  If snapshots are used, ensure they are stored in a secure location with appropriate access controls (e.g., encrypted, sandboxed).  Delete the snapshots immediately after they are no longer needed.  Avoid including sensitive data in the views being snapshotted.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Cause Application Crashes](./attack_tree_paths/3__cause_application_crashes.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [3.1 Trigger Unhandled Exceptions in Hero](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_trigger_unhandled_exceptions_in_hero.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [3.1.2 Exploit Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_2_exploit_memory_corruption_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

*   **(Likelihood: Low / Impact: Very High / Effort: Very High / Skill Level: Expert / Detection Difficulty: Very Hard)**
*   **Description:**  The attacker identifies and exploits a memory corruption vulnerability (like a buffer overflow or use-after-free) within the Hero library itself.  This is a very serious vulnerability, as it could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Mitigation:** Thorough code review of Hero, focusing on memory safety.  Use static analysis tools.  Extensive fuzz testing.  Keep Hero updated to the latest version.  Consider contributing to Hero's security by reporting and fixing vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Bypass Security Measures Implemented Using Hero [HIGH-RISK] (If Hero is misused for security)](./attack_tree_paths/4__bypass_security_measures_implemented_using_hero__high-risk___if_hero_is_misused_for_security_.md)

*   **Description:** This branch is *only* high-risk if the application is incorrectly using Hero as part of its security mechanisms (e.g., for visual obfuscation or to enforce a specific UI flow).  This is a *misuse* of the library.
*   **Mitigation Focus:**  Do *not* rely on Hero for any security-critical functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.1 If Hero is used for visual obfuscation during sensitive operations, disable it. [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/4_1_if_hero_is_used_for_visual_obfuscation_during_sensitive_operations__disable_it___critical_.md)

*   **Description:** If Hero is being used to hide sensitive UI elements (e.g., a password entry field), an attacker could disable Hero to bypass this obfuscation.
*   **Mitigation:** Do not use visual effects for security.  Use proper authentication, authorization, and data protection techniques.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.1.1 Runtime Manipulation to Disable Hero](./attack_tree_paths/4_1_1_runtime_manipulation_to_disable_hero.md)

*   **(Likelihood, Impact, Effort, Skill, Detection: Similar to 1.3.1.1 in the full tree)**
*   **Description:** Similar to disabling transitions for UX degradation, but with the specific goal of bypassing a (misguided) security measure.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.2 If Hero is used to enforce a specific UI flow, disrupt it. [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/4_2_if_hero_is_used_to_enforce_a_specific_ui_flow__disrupt_it___critical_.md)

*   **Description:** If the application relies on Hero to enforce a particular sequence of screens or actions (e.g., to prevent skipping a step in a payment process), an attacker could disrupt the transitions to bypass this flow.
*   **Mitigation:** Do not rely on UI transitions for security-critical flow control.  Implement server-side validation and state management to ensure the correct sequence of actions is followed.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.2.1 Inject events or manipulate state to trigger incorrect transitions.](./attack_tree_paths/4_2_1_inject_events_or_manipulate_state_to_trigger_incorrect_transitions.md)

*   **(Likelihood: Medium / Impact: Medium to High / Effort: Medium to High / Skill Level: Advanced / Detection Difficulty: Hard)**
*   **Description:** The attacker injects events or manipulates the application's state to force Hero to perform incorrect transitions, potentially bypassing security checks or allowing unauthorized actions.
*   **Mitigation:**  Implement robust server-side validation of all user actions and data.  Do not rely on the client-side UI flow for security.  Use secure state management techniques.
