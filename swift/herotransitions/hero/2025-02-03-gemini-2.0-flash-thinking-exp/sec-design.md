# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project aims to provide an Android library that simplifies the implementation of hero transitions in Android applications. Hero transitions enhance user experience by providing smooth and visually appealing animations when navigating between different screens or UI elements within an application.

Business Priorities:
- Enhance User Experience: The primary goal is to improve the visual appeal and user experience of Android applications by making it easier for developers to implement hero transitions.
- Developer Productivity: Simplify the process of implementing hero transitions, reducing development time and effort for Android developers.
- Code Reusability: Provide a reusable component that can be easily integrated into multiple Android projects.
- Performance: Ensure the library is performant and does not introduce significant overhead or lag in animations.
- Compatibility: Support a wide range of Android versions and devices.

Business Risks:
- Adoption Risk: Developers may not adopt the library if it is not well-documented, easy to use, or performant.
- Bug Risk: Bugs in the library could lead to application crashes or unexpected behavior, negatively impacting user experience.
- Maintenance Risk: Lack of ongoing maintenance and updates could lead to the library becoming outdated or incompatible with newer Android versions.
- Performance Risk: Poorly implemented animations could negatively impact application performance and user experience.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Code hosted on GitHub - provides version control and transparency. (Implemented: GitHub Repository)
- security control: Open Source License (MIT License) - allows for community review and contribution. (Implemented: LICENSE file in repository)

Accepted Risks:
- accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in dependencies - the library may depend on other libraries that have known vulnerabilities.
- accepted risk: Open source nature - potential for malicious actors to contribute or introduce vulnerabilities.
- accepted risk: Lack of formal security audits - as a small open-source project, formal security audits are unlikely to be conducted regularly.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Dependency Scanning - Implement automated dependency scanning to identify and address known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
- security control: Static Code Analysis - Integrate static code analysis tools into the development process to identify potential security flaws in the code.
- security control: Code Review - Conduct peer code reviews to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities before code is merged.
- security control: Automated Testing - Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests to ensure the library functions as expected and to prevent regressions.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication: Not applicable for a library. Authentication is handled by the applications that integrate this library.
- Authorization: Not applicable for a library. Authorization is handled by the applications that integrate this library.
- Input Validation: While the library primarily deals with UI elements and animations, ensure that any input parameters accepted by the library are validated to prevent unexpected behavior or crashes. Focus on validating parameters related to animation properties and view identifiers.
- Cryptography: Cryptography is not expected to be a core requirement for this UI library. If any sensitive data handling is introduced in future versions, appropriate cryptographic measures should be considered.
