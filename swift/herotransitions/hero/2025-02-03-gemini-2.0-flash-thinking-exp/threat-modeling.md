# Threat Model Analysis for herotransitions/hero

## Threat: [Critical Performance Flaw in Hero.js Animation Engine Leading to Client-Side Denial of Service](./threats/critical_performance_flaw_in_hero_js_animation_engine_leading_to_client-side_denial_of_service.md)

**Description:** A critical performance vulnerability exists within Hero.js's core animation engine. Even under normal, intended usage scenarios with moderately complex transitions, this flaw causes excessive CPU and/or GPU usage, leading to significant performance degradation, application unresponsiveness, and potential browser crashes on a wide range of devices, including modern machines. An attacker could exploit this by simply triggering standard hero transitions within the application, effectively causing a denial of service for legitimate users.

**Impact:** Client-side Denial of Service, severe user experience degradation, application unresponsiveness, frequent browser crashes, rendering the application unusable.

**Affected Hero Component:** Hero.js library (core animation engine, rendering loop)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Upgrade Hero.js to the latest version: Check for and apply any available updates to Hero.js, as the vulnerability might be patched in a newer release.
*   Simplify Transitions: If an immediate patch is not available, drastically simplify or disable hero transitions in the application to reduce the load on the animation engine and mitigate the performance impact.
*   Implement Client-Side Resource Monitoring: Add client-side monitoring to detect high CPU/GPU usage during transitions and potentially throttle or disable transitions dynamically if performance thresholds are exceeded.
*   Consider Alternative Animation Libraries: If the performance flaw is persistent and unfixable in Hero.js, evaluate migrating to a different animation library that offers better performance and stability.
