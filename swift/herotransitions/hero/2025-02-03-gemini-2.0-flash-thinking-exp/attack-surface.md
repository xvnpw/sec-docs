# Attack Surface Analysis for herotransitions/hero

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Configuration](./attack_surfaces/client-side_cross-site_scripting__xss__via_configuration.md)

Description: Injection of malicious JavaScript code into the web page, executed in the user's browser, by exploiting insecure handling of user-controlled configuration data used by `hero.js`.

Hero Contribution: `hero.js` relies on configuration options (e.g., element selectors, transition parameters) that, if derived from user input and not properly sanitized, can be used to manipulate the DOM in unintended ways, potentially injecting scripts.

Example: An attacker crafts a URL with malicious parameters that are used to configure `hero.js`. These parameters inject a `<script>` tag into the DOM during a transition, leading to XSS when `hero.js` processes this configuration. For instance, a URL like `example.com/?heroConfig={"from": "<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>"}` if improperly handled by the application and `hero.js` could inject the script.

Impact: Full compromise of the user's session, including stealing cookies, session tokens, redirecting to malicious sites, defacement, and further attacks against the user's system.

Risk Severity: **High** to **Critical**

Mitigation Strategies:
*   **Input Sanitization:**  Strictly sanitize and validate all user-provided data before using it in `hero.js` configuration. Use appropriate escaping functions for HTML context.
*   **Parameter Whitelisting:**  If possible, whitelist allowed configuration parameters and values instead of blacklisting.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to restrict the sources from which scripts can be executed, reducing the impact of XSS.
*   **Code Review:** Regularly review code that handles `hero.js` configuration to identify potential injection points.

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side DOM-Based XSS through Transition Logic](./attack_surfaces/client-side_dom-based_xss_through_transition_logic.md)

Description: XSS vulnerability arising from flaws within the `hero.js` library's code itself, where it might mishandle or incorrectly process DOM elements during transitions, leading to script execution.

Hero Contribution:  The internal logic of `hero.js` that manipulates the DOM to create transitions might contain vulnerabilities if it makes unsafe assumptions about the structure or content of the elements being transitioned.

Example:  `hero.js` might parse attributes of elements during transitions without proper sanitization. If an attacker can inject malicious HTML attributes into elements that are later processed by `hero.js`, it could lead to DOM-based XSS. For example, if `hero.js` reads an attribute like `data-hero-content` and directly inserts it into another element without escaping, an attacker could inject `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>` into this attribute.

Impact: Similar to configuration-based XSS, full compromise of the user's session, data theft, and malicious actions on behalf of the user.

Risk Severity: **High** to **Critical** (if vulnerabilities exist within `hero.js` itself).

Mitigation Strategies:
*   **Library Updates:** Keep `hero.js` updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
*   **Security Audits of Hero.js (If Possible):** If feasible, conduct or review security audits of the `hero.js` library itself to identify and report potential vulnerabilities to the maintainers.
*   **CSP:**  As with configuration XSS, a strong CSP is crucial to mitigate the impact of DOM-based XSS.
*   **Careful Integration:**  Thoroughly test the application's integration with `hero.js` to ensure no unexpected DOM manipulations create vulnerabilities.
