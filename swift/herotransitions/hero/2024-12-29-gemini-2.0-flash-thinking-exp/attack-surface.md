Here's the updated key attack surface list, focusing only on elements directly involving Hero and with High or Critical risk severity:

*   **Attack Surface: Dependency Vulnerabilities in Hero**
    *   **Description:** The Hero library itself contains security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.
    *   **How Hero Contributes:** Using the Hero library directly introduces the risk of inheriting any vulnerabilities present within its codebase.
    *   **Example:** A known remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exists within a specific version of the Hero library, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on the user's machine if they interact with a page using the vulnerable version.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, cross-site scripting (if the vulnerability allows for it), information disclosure, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Dependencies Up-to-Date:**  Immediately update the Hero library to the latest stable version as soon as security patches are released.
        *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Regularly check for security advisories and vulnerability reports related to the Hero library on its GitHub repository, security news outlets, and vulnerability databases.
        *   **Dependency Scanning:** Implement automated dependency scanning tools in your development pipeline to identify known vulnerabilities in your project's dependencies, including Hero.
        *   **Consider Alternatives (If Necessary):** If a critical vulnerability persists without a timely patch, consider temporarily using an alternative library or implementing the required transition functionality directly.
