## Threat Model: Compromising Applications Using Hero Transitions - Focused View on High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes

**Attacker's Goal:** Gain unauthorized access or manipulate application state/data by exploiting vulnerabilities within the Hero Transitions library or its integration.

**Sub-Tree of High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

        * AND Inject Malicious Code/Data during Transition (Less Likely, but possible via application misuse) **CRITICAL NODE**
            * Inject Malicious Payloads into Shared Elements **HIGH-RISK PATH** **CRITICAL NODE**

            * Intercept and Modify Data During Transition **HIGH-RISK PATH**
        * AND Inject Malicious Data into Shared Elements **HIGH-RISK PATH** **CRITICAL NODE**
    * OR Exploit Application Integration with Hero **CRITICAL NODE**
        * AND Expose Sensitive Data in Shared Elements **HIGH-RISK PATH** **CRITICAL NODE**

        * AND Insecure Handling of Transition Callbacks **HIGH-RISK PATH** **CRITICAL NODE**
            * Leak Sensitive Information in Callback Data

        * AND Lack of Input Validation on Transition Data **HIGH-RISK PATH** **CRITICAL NODE**
            * Pass Unvalidated User Input to Hero Functions

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

* **Exploit Missing or Weak Authorization Checks (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE):**
    * If the application relies on Hero transitions to navigate between views with different authorization levels, an attacker might try to bypass the intended flow by directly triggering a transition to a protected view without proper authorization. This could be achieved by manipulating browser history, directly calling Hero's transition functions, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's routing logic.

* **Inject Malicious Payloads into Shared Elements (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE):**
    * If the application uses shared elements to display user-controlled data, an attacker could inject malicious scripts (XSS) or other harmful content into these elements. When the transition occurs, this malicious payload could be executed in the context of the target view.

* **Manipulate Transition Callbacks to Execute Malicious Code (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE):**
    * Hero allows defining callbacks that are executed during or after transitions. If the application doesn't properly sanitize data passed to these callbacks or if the callbacks themselves are vulnerable, an attacker could potentially inject and execute malicious code.

* **Intercept and Modify Data During Transition (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * While less likely with HTTPS, if the communication is not properly secured, an attacker could potentially intercept the data being transferred for shared elements during the transition and modify it before it reaches the target view.

* **Inject Malicious Data into Shared Elements (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE):**
    * If the application doesn't properly validate the data that will be displayed in shared elements, an attacker could inject malicious data that could be exploited in the target view (e.g., XSS).

* **Inadvertently Include Sensitive Information in Transitioning Elements (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE):**
    * Developers might unintentionally include sensitive information in elements that are being transitioned using Hero. This could expose this data to unauthorized users if the transition is not properly controlled or if the target view is not adequately protected.

* **Leak Sensitive Information in Callback Data (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE):**
    * Transition callbacks might receive data that includes sensitive information. If this data is not handled securely or is logged inappropriately, it could be exposed to attackers.

* **Execute Unauthorized Actions Based on Callback Data (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE):**
    * If the application relies on data passed in transition callbacks to perform actions without proper authorization checks, an attacker could manipulate this data to trigger unauthorized actions.

* **Pass Unvalidated User Input to Hero Functions (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE):**
    * If the application directly passes user-provided input to Hero's transition functions without proper validation, an attacker could inject malicious data that could lead to unexpected behavior or potential exploits.

**Critical Nodes Breakdown:**

* **Exploit Transition Logic:**  Successful exploitation of the transition logic can lead to bypassing security checks, injecting malicious code, or forcing unintended application states.
* **Bypass Transition Checks:**  Circumventing intended access controls is a fundamental security failure, allowing attackers to reach protected areas or functionalities.
* **Inject Malicious Code/Data during Transition:**  This node represents the potential for introducing active threats (like XSS or code execution) into the application flow through the transition mechanism.
* **Manipulate Transition State:** Gaining control over the application's state during transitions can lead to data corruption, bypassing security measures, or forcing the application into vulnerable states.
* **Exploit Application Integration with Hero:** This highlights that vulnerabilities are more likely to arise from how the application *uses* the Hero library rather than within the library itself. Improper integration can expose sensitive data or create pathways for unauthorized actions.
* **Inject Malicious Data into Shared Elements:** This node directly represents the risk of injection attacks, primarily XSS, through the data being transitioned.
* **Expose Sensitive Data in Shared Elements:** This critical node signifies the risk of directly leaking sensitive information through the transition process.
* **Insecure Handling of Transition Callbacks:** This node highlights the danger of mishandling data within transition callbacks, potentially leading to data leaks or the execution of unauthorized actions.
* **Lack of Input Validation on Transition Data:** This represents a common and easily exploitable weakness where failing to validate input can lead to various security issues.
