Here is the updated threat list, focusing only on high and critical threats directly involving the Hero library:

*   **Threat:** Manipulation of Transition Destination
    *   **Description:** An attacker might discover vulnerabilities within the Hero library's view matching or transition initiation logic that allows them to manipulate the intended destination view. This could involve crafting specific transition parameters or exploiting flaws in how Hero identifies and navigates between views. The attacker aims to redirect the user to an unintended or malicious view by exploiting Hero's internal mechanisms.
    *   **Impact:** Integrity violation, as the user is directed to an unexpected location. Potential for phishing or malware distribution if the attacker controls the destination.
    *   **Affected Hero Component:** `Hero`'s view matching and transition initiation logic, specifically how `Hero` identifies the target view based on provided identifiers or data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the Hero library updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
        *   Implement robust validation of transition parameters before passing them to Hero.
        *   Avoid relying on easily manipulated client-side data for determining transition destinations when using Hero.
        *   Consider server-side validation of navigation requests if the transition involves sensitive actions.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in the Hero Library Itself
    *   **Description:** The Hero library, like any software, might contain undiscovered security vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to achieve various malicious goals, such as remote code execution within the client's browser or information disclosure by exploiting flaws in Hero's internal workings.
    *   **Impact:** Depends on the nature of the vulnerability, potentially leading to remote code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service directly caused by a flaw in the library.
    *   **Affected Hero Component:** Any part of the `Hero` library's codebase.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability (can be Critical or High).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the `Hero` library updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
        *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for any reported issues with the `Hero` library.
        *   Consider using static analysis tools to scan the application's dependencies, including `Hero`, for known vulnerabilities.
