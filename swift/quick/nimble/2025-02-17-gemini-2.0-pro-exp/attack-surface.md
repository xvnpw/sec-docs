# Attack Surface Analysis for quick/nimble

## Attack Surface: [Custom Matcher Logic Errors](./attack_surfaces/custom_matcher_logic_errors.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities (e.g., ReDoS, injection) or logic errors within custom-defined Nimble matchers, leading to incorrect test results or denial of service.
*   **How Nimble Contributes:** Nimble's `Matcher` protocol and related functions enable the creation of custom matchers, placing the responsibility for their security and correctness on the developer. Nimble *provides the mechanism*, but the vulnerability lies in the *developer's implementation*.
*   **Example:** A custom matcher for validating email addresses using a poorly crafted regular expression could be vulnerable to ReDoS. An attacker could provide a specially crafted email string that causes excessive backtracking, consuming CPU resources and making the test suite unresponsive.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Incorrect test results (false positives/negatives), masking real vulnerabilities.
    *   Denial of service (DoS) within the test environment.
    *   (Extremely unlikely, but theoretically possible) Code execution if the matcher handles untrusted input in an unsafe way.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (due to the potential for DoS and incorrect test results, which can mask real vulnerabilities).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Thorough Code Review:** Rigorously review all custom matcher code, focusing on input validation, regular expression safety (avoiding ReDoS), and potential injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize all inputs to custom matchers before processing.
    *   **Unit Testing of Matchers:** Write comprehensive unit tests *specifically for the custom matchers* to ensure they behave correctly and handle edge cases.
    *   **Fuzz Testing:** Consider fuzz testing custom matchers with a variety of unexpected inputs.
    *   **Limit Matcher Complexity:** Keep custom matchers as simple as possible.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities present in libraries that Nimble directly depends on.
*   **How Nimble Contributes:** Nimble, as a software package, relies on external libraries. The security of Nimble is therefore tied to the security of its dependencies. Nimble *directly uses* these dependencies.
*   **Example:** An outdated version of a library used by Nimble for string manipulation might have a known buffer overflow vulnerability.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Potential for exploitation of the test environment.
    *   Compromise of test data or infrastructure.
    *   (In extreme cases, and depending on the nature of the vulnerability) Potential for lateral movement.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the severity of the vulnerability in the dependency; could be Critical if a readily exploitable RCE exists).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Management:** Use a dependency management tool (e.g., Swift Package Manager, CocoaPods) to track and update dependencies.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like OWASP Dependency-Check or Snyk.
    *   **Keep Dependencies Updated:** Promptly update dependencies to the latest secure versions.
    *   **Dependency Auditing:** Periodically audit dependencies to understand their security posture.
    *   **Supply Chain Security:** Consider measures to verify the integrity of dependencies.
