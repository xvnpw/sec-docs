# Threat Model Analysis for quick/nimble

## Threat: [Malicious Packages in Public Repositories](./threats/malicious_packages_in_public_repositories.md)

- **Threat:** Malicious Packages in Public Repositories
- **Description:**
    - Attackers upload packages containing malware to public Nimble repositories.
    - Developers use `nimble install <package_name>` to install these packages, unknowingly introducing malware into their projects.
    - Nimble, by default, fetches and installs packages without extensive built-in security checks beyond basic repository access.
- **Impact:**
    - Code Execution: Malware within the installed package executes within the application's context when the application uses the package.
    - Data Breach: Malware can steal sensitive data, credentials, or inject backdoors, leading to data breaches.
    - Supply Chain Compromise:  Compromised dependencies propagate vulnerabilities to applications using them, affecting the wider ecosystem.
- **Nimble Component Affected:**
    - `nimble install` command
    - Package resolution process within Nimble
    - Dependency management features of Nimble
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Use Reputable Repositories: Primarily rely on the official Nimble package registry and well-known, trusted GitHub repositories.
    - Dependency Auditing: Regularly audit project dependencies. Investigate unfamiliar or less popular packages before installation.
    - Package Pinning/Version Locking: Use specific package versions in `nimble.toml` to prevent automatic updates to potentially malicious versions.
    - Dependency Scanning Tools: Explore and utilize tools that can scan Nimble dependencies for known vulnerabilities (if available).
    - Code Review of Dependencies: For critical dependencies, especially from less established sources, consider reviewing the source code before use.

## Threat: [Compromised Upstream Dependencies](./threats/compromised_upstream_dependencies.md)

- **Threat:** Compromised Upstream Dependencies
- **Description:**
    - Legitimate packages that your application depends on, managed by Nimble, become compromised *after* initial safe installation. This could be due to maintainer account compromise or malicious code injection into a previously safe package version on the repository.
    - When using `nimble update` or reinstalling dependencies, Nimble might fetch and install the newly compromised version of a previously trusted package.
    - Nimble's update mechanism, while convenient, can propagate compromised dependencies if upstream packages are affected.
- **Impact:**
    - Indirect Supply Chain Attack: Your application becomes vulnerable through a dependency updated via Nimble, even if initially chosen packages were safe.
    - Code Execution, Data Breach: Similar impacts to direct malicious packages, but introduced through a previously trusted dependency updated by Nimble.
    - Widespread impact if a commonly used package, managed by Nimble across many projects, is compromised.
- **Nimble Component Affected:**
    - `nimble update` command
    - Dependency resolution and update mechanisms within Nimble
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Dependency Monitoring: Continuously monitor dependencies for security advisories and updates. Subscribe to security mailing lists or use vulnerability tracking services related to Nimble packages.
    - Regular Dependency Updates with Testing: Keep dependencies updated to patch vulnerabilities, but *always* test updates thoroughly in a staging environment before deploying to production. Avoid blindly updating without testing.
    - "Vendoring" Dependencies (with Extreme Caution): In very high-security scenarios, consider vendoring dependencies (copying them into your project) to control updates more tightly. However, this significantly increases maintenance overhead and should be done with a clear update strategy.

## Threat: [Nimble Client Software Bugs Leading to RCE](./threats/nimble_client_software_bugs_leading_to_rce.md)

- **Threat:** Nimble Client Software Bugs Leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE)
- **Description:**
    - Critical vulnerabilities may exist in the Nimble client application itself (e.g., in code parsing package metadata, handling network responses from repositories, or file system operations).
    - Attackers could craft malicious packages or manipulate repository responses to exploit these vulnerabilities.
    - Successful exploitation could lead to Remote Code Execution on the developer's machine *when using Nimble* to interact with repositories or packages.
- **Impact:**
    - Remote Code Execution (RCE): Attackers gain the ability to execute arbitrary code on the developer's machine by exploiting a vulnerability in Nimble.
    - System Compromise: RCE can lead to full compromise of the developer's machine, including data theft, malware installation, and further attacks.
- **Nimble Component Affected:**
    - Nimble client application itself (core modules, parsing logic, network handling, file system interaction)
    - `nimble` executable
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Keep Nimble Updated:  Immediately update Nimble to the latest version whenever security updates or bug fixes are released. This is crucial to patch known vulnerabilities.
    - Monitor Nimble Security Advisories: Actively monitor for any reported security vulnerabilities in Nimble and apply recommended updates promptly.
    - Run Nimble in a Secure Environment:  Use a secure development environment and avoid running Nimble with unnecessary elevated privileges. Consider using virtual machines or containers for development to isolate potential compromises.

## Threat: [Compromised Package Repositories (Leading to Mass Distribution of Malware)](./threats/compromised_package_repositories__leading_to_mass_distribution_of_malware_.md)

- **Threat:** Compromised Package Repositories (Leading to Mass Distribution of Malware)
- **Description:**
    - Nimble package repositories themselves (official or third-party) could be compromised by attackers. This is a severe supply chain attack vector.
    - Attackers could inject malicious packages, modify existing packages to include malware, or manipulate repository metadata to redirect users to malicious packages.
    - If the official Nimble registry or a widely used third-party repository is compromised, it can lead to mass distribution of malware to a large number of Nimble users.
- **Impact:**
    - Large-Scale Supply Chain Attack: A compromised repository can distribute malicious packages to a vast number of developers and applications relying on Nimble.
    - Widespread Code Execution, Data Breach: Installation of malicious packages from a compromised repository across numerous systems.
    - Catastrophic Loss of Trust: Severe damage to the Nimble ecosystem's trust and security reputation.
- **Nimble Component Affected:**
    - Package repository infrastructure (external to Nimble client, but the core source of packages for Nimble users)
    - Package download and installation process *initiated by Nimble clients*.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Use HTTPS for Repositories: Ensure Nimble is *always* configured to use HTTPS for all package repositories to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks and ensure data integrity during downloads. This is a fundamental security requirement.
    - Repository Trust and Verification:  Prioritize using the official Nimble package registry and *highly* reputable, well-established third-party repositories. Exercise extreme caution with less known or unverified repositories.
    - Package Integrity Verification (If Available and Implemented by Repositories/Nimble): If Nimble or repositories offer package signature verification or checksum mechanisms, ensure they are enabled and actively used to verify the integrity and authenticity of downloaded packages. Advocate for and support the development and adoption of robust package integrity verification within the Nimble ecosystem.

## Threat: [Malicious `install.nim` Scripts Leading to System Compromise](./threats/malicious__install_nim__scripts_leading_to_system_compromise.md)

- **Threat:** Malicious `install.nim` Scripts Leading to System Compromise
- **Description:**
    - Nimble packages can include `install.nim` scripts that are automatically executed by Nimble during the package installation process.
    - Malicious packages can contain highly dangerous `install.nim` scripts designed to perform harmful actions directly on the developer's system.
    - These scripts run with the privileges of the user executing `nimble install`, potentially allowing for significant system-level changes and compromise.
- **Impact:**
    - Code Execution: Arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine *during package installation* via Nimble.
    - System Compromise: Malicious scripts can modify critical system files, install persistent backdoors, steal credentials stored on the system, escalate privileges, or perform other severe malicious actions, leading to full system compromise.
- **Nimble Component Affected:**
    - `install.nim` script execution functionality within Nimble's package installation process.
    - `nimble install` command and its script execution behavior.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Exercise Extreme Caution with `install.nim` Scripts: Be *extremely* wary of packages from untrusted or unknown sources, especially those that include `install.nim` scripts. Treat `install.nim` scripts from unknown sources as potentially hostile.
    - *Never* blindly install packages with `install.nim` from untrusted sources.
    - Review `install.nim` Scripts *Before* Installation: If you must use a package with an `install.nim` script from a less-trusted source, *carefully review the entire `install.nim` script* to understand what it does before installing the package. Look for suspicious or dangerous operations.
    - Sandboxing/Containerization (Strongly Recommended): For any package installation, especially from less trusted sources or those with `install.nim` scripts, strongly consider using sandboxing or containerization technologies to isolate the installation process. This limits the potential damage from malicious `install.nim` scripts by restricting their access to the host system.
    - Principle of Least Privilege during Installation: Ensure that Nimble and the installation process are run with the *minimum necessary privileges*. Avoid running `nimble install` as root or with administrator privileges unless absolutely required and you fully trust the package.
