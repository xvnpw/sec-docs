# Attack Surface Analysis for quick/nimble

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Packages in Nimble Repositories (Dependency Supply Chain)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_packages_in_nimble_repositories__dependency_supply_chain_.md)

**Description:**  Nimble relies on package repositories. If these repositories are compromised or contain malicious packages, users downloading packages are at risk.

**Nimble Contribution:** Nimble directly downloads and installs packages from configured repositories. It trusts the content of these repositories and facilitates the download and installation process.

**Example:** An attacker compromises `nimble.directory` or uploads a package with a popular name containing malware. A developer using `nimble install popular_package` unknowingly downloads and executes the malicious code during installation or when the application is run.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on developer machines and potentially in deployed applications. Data theft, system compromise, and supply chain contamination.

**Risk Severity:** **Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Package Source Verification:**  Carefully vet package authors and sources. Prefer packages from trusted and well-established developers.
* **Dependency Pinning:**  Specify exact package versions in `.nimble` files to prevent automatic updates to potentially compromised versions.
* **Checksum Verification (if available):** Utilize checksum verification mechanisms provided by Nimble (if any) to ensure package integrity.
* **Regular Dependency Audits:** Periodically review project dependencies for known vulnerabilities using vulnerability scanning tools or manual audits.
* **Use Private Repositories (if feasible):**  Host internal packages in private repositories to control the source of dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Confusion/Substitution Attacks](./attack_surfaces/dependency_confusionsubstitution_attacks.md)

**Description:** Attackers register packages with names similar to internal or private packages in public repositories, hoping Nimble will install the malicious public package instead of the intended private one.

**Nimble Contribution:** Nimble's package resolution mechanism might prioritize public repositories over intended private sources if not configured carefully. Nimble's logic in choosing package sources directly contributes to this attack surface.

**Example:** A company uses an internal package named `company_utils`. An attacker registers a package named `company-utils` (with a hyphen instead of underscore) on `nimble.directory` containing malware. If a developer accidentally uses `nimble install company-utils` or if Nimble's resolution logic is flawed, the malicious package might be installed.

**Impact:** Installation of malicious code, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, data theft, and system compromise.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Private Package Repositories:**  Utilize private Nimble repositories or alternative mechanisms to host and manage internal packages, ensuring they are prioritized during dependency resolution.
* **Namespace/Prefix Conventions:**  Use unique prefixes or namespaces for internal packages to minimize naming conflicts with public packages.
* **Strict Dependency Resolution Configuration:**  Understand and configure Nimble's dependency resolution to prioritize intended package sources and prevent accidental substitution.
* **Package Name Verification:**  Double-check package names before installation, especially for packages with names similar to internal ones.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Nimble Package Manager Code](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_nimble_package_manager_code.md)

**Description:** Bugs and vulnerabilities within the Nimble package manager itself can be exploited to compromise the system during package management operations.

**Nimble Contribution:** Nimble *is* the package manager. Vulnerabilities in its code are directly exploitable when using Nimble.

**Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability in Nimble's package parsing logic is discovered. An attacker crafts a malicious `.nimble` file within a package that triggers this overflow when Nimble processes it, allowing for arbitrary code execution.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution during package management, potentially leading to system compromise, privilege escalation, and denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Keep Nimble Updated:**  Regularly update Nimble to the latest version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
* **Monitor Security Advisories:**  Stay informed about reported Nimble vulnerabilities and apply updates or workarounds promptly.
* **Use Stable Nimble Versions:**  Prefer stable releases of Nimble over development versions for production environments to minimize exposure to undiscovered bugs.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure `.nimble` File Processing](./attack_surfaces/insecure___nimble__file_processing.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in how Nimble parses and processes `.nimble` files can be exploited by malicious packages to execute arbitrary code or cause other security issues.

**Nimble Contribution:** Nimble's core functionality relies on parsing `.nimble` files. The parsing logic is part of Nimble's code and directly contributes to this attack surface if vulnerabilities exist.

**Example:** A command injection vulnerability exists in Nimble's `.nimble` file parser. An attacker crafts a malicious `.nimble` file with specially crafted fields that, when parsed by Nimble, execute arbitrary commands on the system.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, potentially leading to system compromise and data theft.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Input Validation (Nimble Developer Responsibility):** Rely on Nimble developers to implement robust input validation and sanitization in `.nimble` file parsing.
* **Report Suspicious Files:**  If you encounter `.nimble` files with unusual or suspicious syntax, investigate and report potential issues to Nimble maintainers.
* **Code Review of Dependencies:**  Review `.nimble` files of dependencies, especially from untrusted sources, for unusual or potentially malicious configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Unsafe Execution of `install.nim` Scripts](./attack_surfaces/unsafe_execution_of__install_nim__scripts.md)

**Description:** `install.nim` scripts within Nimble packages are executed during installation. Malicious packages can use these scripts to run arbitrary code on the user's system.

**Nimble Contribution:** Nimble provides the mechanism to execute `install.nim` scripts. This feature, while intended for package setup, directly introduces a critical attack surface if not handled securely by package authors and users.

**Example:** A malicious package includes an `install.nim` script that downloads and executes a backdoor, modifies system files, or steals credentials when `nimble install malicious_package` is run.

**Impact:** Full system compromise, arbitrary code execution, data theft, privilege escalation, and persistent malware installation.

**Risk Severity:** **Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Minimize Reliance on `install.nim`:**  Prefer packages that do not rely on `install.nim` scripts for core functionality.
* **Code Review of `install.nim` Scripts:**  Thoroughly review `install.nim` scripts of all dependencies, especially from untrusted sources, before installation. Look for suspicious or malicious code patterns.
* **Sandboxing/Isolation (if feasible):** Explore if Nimble or OS-level mechanisms can sandbox or isolate the execution of `install.nim` scripts to limit potential damage.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run `nimble install` with a least privileged user account to restrict the impact of a compromised `install.nim` script.
* **Static Analysis of `install.nim` Scripts:** Use static analysis tools to automatically scan `install.nim` scripts for potentially malicious code patterns.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Network Communication (HTTP for Downloads)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_network_communication__http_for_downloads_.md)

**Description:** If Nimble uses insecure HTTP for downloading packages or metadata, it is vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.

**Nimble Contribution:** Nimble's choice of network protocols for package downloads directly determines the security of the download process. Using HTTP makes it vulnerable.

**Example:** An attacker performs a MITM attack on a network. When a developer uses `nimble install package_name`, the attacker intercepts the HTTP download request and injects a malicious package instead of the legitimate one.

**Impact:** Installation of malicious packages, leading to arbitrary code execution and system compromise.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Enforce HTTPS for Repositories:** Ensure Nimble and package repositories are configured to use HTTPS for all communication.
* **Certificate Pinning (if implemented):** If Nimble supports certificate pinning, enable it to further protect against MITM attacks by verifying server certificate authenticity.
* **Network Security Best Practices:** Use secure network connections (VPNs) when downloading packages from untrusted networks.
