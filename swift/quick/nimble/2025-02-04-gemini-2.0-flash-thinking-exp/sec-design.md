# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, Nimble, aims to provide a robust and user-friendly package manager for the Nim programming language. The primary business goal is to foster the growth and adoption of Nim by simplifying dependency management and package distribution for Nim developers. This involves creating a tool that is reliable, efficient, and secure, enabling developers to easily discover, install, and manage Nim packages.

Key business priorities include:
- Ease of use for Nim developers to manage dependencies.
- Reliability and availability of package management services.
- A rich ecosystem of Nim packages accessible through Nimble.
- Security and integrity of packages to protect developers from malicious software.
- Community growth and contribution to the Nim package ecosystem.

The most important business risks that need to be addressed are:
- Risk of package integrity compromise, leading to distribution of malicious packages.
- Risk of service unavailability, disrupting Nim development workflows.
- Risk of vulnerabilities in Nimble itself, affecting the security of Nim developers' environments.
- Risk of slow adoption if Nimble is not user-friendly or reliable.

    style build_artifacts fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

Build process description:
1. Developer writes code and commits changes to a Git repository (e.g., GitHub).
2. A CI system (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins) is triggered by code changes.
3. The CI system performs the build process, including:
    - Checking out the code from the Git repository.
    - Building the Nimble CLI application and potentially packages.
    - Running automated tests.
    - Performing security checks such as SAST (Static Application Security Testing) and linters to identify potential vulnerabilities and code quality issues.
4. Security reports are generated from the security checks. These reports should be reviewed and addressed.
5. Build artifacts, including Nimble CLI binaries and packages, are created.
6. The CI system publishes the build artifacts to the Package Registry or distribution channels, making them available for Nim developers.

- security control: Automated build process using CI/CD to ensure consistency and repeatability. Implemented: CI System.
- security control: Source code hosted in a version control system (Git) to track changes and enable code review. Implemented: Git Repository.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes we are trying to protect:
- Package installation process: Ensuring developers can reliably and securely install packages.
- Package publishing process: Ensuring package authors can securely publish their packages.
- Dependency resolution: Ensuring Nimble correctly and securely resolves dependencies.
- Package discovery: Ensuring developers can find and discover packages easily and safely.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- Package metadata (package names, versions, descriptions, dependencies): Sensitivity: Low to Medium. Integrity and availability are important to ensure correct package management. Public information, but tampering could lead to supply chain attacks.
- Package files (binaries, source code): Sensitivity: Medium. Integrity is critical to prevent distribution of malicious software. Availability is important for developers to download packages. Confidentiality is less critical for open-source packages, but important for private packages if supported.
- User credentials (for package publishing, if applicable): Sensitivity: High. Confidentiality and integrity are crucial to prevent unauthorized package publishing.
- Security logs and audit trails: Sensitivity: Medium. Confidentiality and integrity are important for security monitoring and incident response.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- Is there a central Nimble package registry or is it purely decentralized relying on Git repositories?
- What is the intended mechanism for package signing and verification?
- What authentication and authorization mechanisms are planned for package publishing?
- Are there plans for a web interface for package discovery and management?
- What is the strategy for handling security vulnerabilities reported in Nimble or Nimble packages?

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to provide a secure and reliable package manager to foster the Nim ecosystem growth. Security and ease of use are high priorities.
- SECURITY POSTURE: Current security controls are basic, relying on open-source community review and GitHub's platform security. There is room for improvement in automated security checks, package signing, and formal security processes.
- DESIGN: Nimble likely consists of a CLI application and potentially backend services for a package registry and download server. Deployment might involve cloud infrastructure for backend services and local installation of the CLI. Build process should be automated and include security checks.
