# Threat Model Analysis for quick/nimble

## Threat: [Malicious Package Injection in Official Repositories](./threats/malicious_package_injection_in_official_repositories.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises the official Nimble package registry or repositories. They inject a malicious package, potentially replacing a legitimate one or introducing a new one with a deceptive name. When developers use `nimble install`, they download and integrate this malicious package into their project.
    *   **Impact:**  **Critical**. Full compromise of applications using the malicious package. Attackers can achieve remote code execution, steal sensitive data, establish backdoors, and completely control the affected systems. Wide-spread supply chain attack affecting many users of the compromised package.
    *   **Nimble Component Affected:** Package Registry, Package Download Mechanism
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Nimble/Ecosystem Level:** Implement strong security measures for Nimble infrastructure, including access control, intrusion detection, and regular security audits. Implement package signing and verification mechanisms to ensure package integrity and authenticity.
        *   **Developer Level:**  While developers have limited control over official repository security, they should be aware of this risk and rely on trusted sources for Nimble and package information. Monitor Nimble security announcements and best practices.

## Threat: [Lack of Package Integrity Checks](./threats/lack_of_package_integrity_checks.md)

*   **Description:** Nimble lacks robust mechanisms to verify the integrity of downloaded packages (e.g., missing checksum verification or signature checks). An attacker could tamper with packages during transit or storage, and Nimble would not detect the modification.
    *   **Impact:** **Critical**.  If package integrity is not verified, attackers can easily inject malicious code into downloaded packages. This leads to supply chain compromise, code execution, and potential full system compromise for users installing these tampered packages.
    *   **Nimble Component Affected:** Package Download Mechanism, Package Installation
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Nimble/Ecosystem Level:** Implement package checksum verification (e.g., using SHA hashes) for all downloaded packages. Implement package signing and signature verification to ensure authenticity and prevent tampering. Document and enforce secure package distribution practices.
        *   **Developer Level:** Developers have limited mitigation if Nimble itself lacks these features. They should advocate for these security features in Nimble and consider alternative dependency management solutions if integrity checks are deemed critical and missing.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks during Package Download](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_during_package_download.md)

*   **Description:** Nimble downloads packages over insecure HTTP connections or has a flawed HTTPS implementation. An attacker positioned in the network path (MitM) can intercept the download traffic and inject malicious packages before they reach the developer's machine.
    *   **Impact:** **High**. MitM attacks can lead to the delivery of malicious packages, resulting in code execution, data theft, and backdoors. The impact is similar to package injection, but relies on network-level interception.
    *   **Nimble Component Affected:** Package Download Mechanism, Network Communication
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Nimble/Ecosystem Level:** Enforce HTTPS for all package downloads and repository interactions. Ensure proper TLS/SSL configuration and prevent downgrade attacks.
        *   **Developer Level:** Ensure a secure network environment during development and deployment (use VPNs or trusted networks). Verify Nimble's configuration and behavior to confirm HTTPS usage for package downloads. Avoid using Nimble in untrusted network environments (e.g., public Wi-Fi) without VPN.

## Threat: [Malicious Updates to Nimble Client Application](./threats/malicious_updates_to_nimble_client_application.md)

*   **Description:** Nimble's update mechanism is compromised or insecure. Attackers distribute malicious updates that replace the legitimate Nimble client with a compromised version.
    *   **Impact:** **High**. A malicious Nimble update can give attackers control over developer machines and the entire development environment. This can lead to supply chain compromise, backdoors in developed applications, and data theft from development systems.
    *   **Nimble Component Affected:** Update Mechanism, Nimble Client Application
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Nimble/Ecosystem Level:** Implement a secure update mechanism for Nimble, including signed updates and HTTPS for update downloads. Maintain robust infrastructure for distributing updates and ensure its security. Clearly communicate about updates and their authenticity to users.
        *   **Developer Level:** Only download Nimble updates from official and trusted sources. Verify the authenticity of updates if possible (e.g., through signatures or checksums provided on official channels). Be cautious of unsolicited update prompts from unofficial sources.

## Threat: [Execution of Malicious Code during Package Installation/Build Scripts](./threats/execution_of_malicious_code_during_package_installationbuild_scripts.md)

*   **Description:** Nimble packages can include build scripts or installation scripts (e.g., in `nimble.toml` or separate script files) that are automatically executed during the dependency installation process (`nimble install`). Malicious packages can leverage these scripts to execute arbitrary code on the developer's machine.
    *   **Impact:** **Critical**. Execution of malicious code during installation can lead to full compromise of the developer's machine. Attackers can steal credentials, install backdoors, modify project files, or perform any other action with the privileges of the user running `nimble install`.
    *   **Nimble Component Affected:** Package Installation, Script Execution
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer Level:** Exercise extreme caution when installing new packages, especially from untrusted or unknown sources. Review package manifests (`nimble.toml`) and installation scripts before installation if possible to identify suspicious commands. Use sandboxing or virtualization for development environments to limit the impact of malicious code execution during installation. Monitor system activity during package installation for any unusual or suspicious behavior. Consider using tools that analyze package scripts for potential security risks before installation.
