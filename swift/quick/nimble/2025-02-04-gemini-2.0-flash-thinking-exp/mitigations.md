# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for quick/nimble

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dependency Pinning and Locking](./mitigation_strategies/dependency_pinning_and_locking.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Dependency Pinning and Locking

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Open the `.nimble` file in your Nim project root.
*   Step 2: In the `requires` section, specify exact or minimum versions for each dependency.
    *   Exact version: `requires "package == version"` (e.g., `requires "requests == 0.9.0"`)
    *   Minimum version: `requires "package >= version"` (e.g., `requires "requests >= 0.9.0"`)
*   Step 3: Run `nimble lock` in your project root. This generates `nimble.lock` file with resolved dependency versions.
*   Step 4: Commit both `.nimble` and `nimble.lock` to version control.
*   Step 5: Use `nimble install` for dependency installation to enforce versions from `nimble.lock`.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Dependency Confusion/Substitution (High Severity): Malicious packages with similar names could be installed if version ranges are too broad in `.nimble`. Pinning restricts acceptable versions.
*   Accidental Vulnerability Introduction (Medium Severity): Automatic dependency updates might introduce new vulnerabilities. Pinning prevents unexpected updates.
*   Build Reproducibility Issues (Low Severity - Security Impact): Inconsistent dependency versions across environments can lead to unpredictable behavior and environment-specific vulnerabilities. Locking ensures consistency.

**Impact:**
*   Dependency Confusion/Substitution: High Risk Reduction.
*   Accidental Vulnerability Introduction: Medium Risk Reduction.
*   Build Reproducibility Issues: High Risk Reduction.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Partially implemented. `.nimble` is used, but version constraints are often broad, and `nimble.lock` is not consistently used.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Pinning specific versions in `.nimble` for most dependencies.
*   Generating and using `nimble.lock`.
*   Enforcing `nimble install` with lock file in CI/CD.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Dependency Audits (Nimble Context)](./mitigation_strategies/regular_dependency_audits__nimble_context_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Regular Dependency Audits

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Schedule regular audits (e.g., monthly) for Nimble dependencies.
*   Step 2: List Nimble dependencies using `nimble list-deps` and inspect `nimble.lock` (if used) for transitive dependencies.
*   Step 3: For each Nimble dependency, check for vulnerabilities:
    *   Review dependency release notes and security advisories (linked from Nimble registry if available, or directly from package repository).
    *   Search for CVEs for the dependency version.
    *   Explore dependency scanning tools (general tools or future Nimble-specific tools).
*   Step 4: If vulnerabilities are found in Nimble dependencies:
    *   Assess severity and exploitability in your application.
    *   Prioritize patching.
    *   Update to patched Nimble dependency version. Consider alternatives if no patch exists.
*   Step 5: Document audit process, findings, and remediation for Nimble dependencies.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Use of Vulnerable Dependencies (High Severity): Exploiting known vulnerabilities in Nimble packages.
*   Supply Chain Attacks (Medium Severity): Compromised Nimble dependencies could introduce malicious code. Audits help detect this.

**Impact:**
*   Use of Vulnerable Dependencies: High Risk Reduction.
*   Supply Chain Attacks: Medium Risk Reduction.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Not implemented. No scheduled dependency audits for Nimble packages.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Establishing a schedule for Nimble dependency audits.
*   Systematic process for vulnerability checking of Nimble packages.
*   Documentation of Nimble dependency audit findings.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Source Verification of Nimble Dependencies](./mitigation_strategies/source_verification_of_nimble_dependencies.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Source Verification of Dependencies

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Primarily use the official Nimble package registry (`https://nimble.directory/`).
*   Step 2: When adding new Nimble dependencies, examine package information on the registry:
    *   Check for typosquatting in package names.
    *   Review package description, documentation, and source repository (linked from Nimble registry).
    *   Assess maintainer reputation (Nimble registry might provide maintainer info).
*   Step 3: Be cautious with Nimble packages from unofficial sources:
    *   Thoroughly vet unofficial sources and maintainers.
    *   Carefully review code of packages from unofficial sources.
    *   Consider private hosting/mirroring for better control.
*   Step 4: Utilize future Nimble checksum verification or package signing features when available.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Typosquatting (High Severity): Malicious Nimble packages with similar names.
*   Malicious Packages from Untrusted Sources (High Severity): Nimble packages from unknown sources containing malware.
*   Compromised Package Registry (Low to Medium Severity): Risk if the Nimble registry itself is compromised.

**Impact:**
*   Typosquatting: High Risk Reduction.
*   Malicious Packages from Untrusted Sources: High Risk Reduction.
*   Compromised Package Registry: Medium Risk Reduction.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Partially implemented. Official Nimble registry is generally used, but formal source verification is lacking.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Formal source verification process for Nimble dependencies.
*   Guidelines for evaluating Nimble package maintainers and sources.
*   Adopting future Nimble checksum/signature verification.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimal Nimble Dependency Principle](./mitigation_strategies/minimal_nimble_dependency_principle.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Minimal Dependency Principle

**Description:**
*   Step 1: When adding Nimble dependencies, evaluate necessity. Can functionality be implemented internally?
*   Step 2: Periodically review existing Nimble dependencies. Identify unused or minimally used packages.
*   Step 3: Remove unnecessary Nimble dependencies. Refactor code or implement alternatives.
*   Step 4: When choosing between Nimble packages, prefer those with smaller dependency footprint and narrower functionality.
*   Step 5: Monitor Nimble dependency tree using `nimble list-deps`. Analyze transitive dependencies for reduction opportunities.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Increased Attack Surface (Medium Severity): More Nimble dependencies increase potential vulnerability entry points.
*   Transitive Dependency Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity): Vulnerabilities in Nimble transitive dependencies.
*   Supply Chain Complexity (Low Severity - Security Management Overhead): Managing many Nimble dependencies becomes complex.

**Impact:**
*   Increased Attack Surface: Medium Risk Reduction.
*   Transitive Dependency Vulnerabilities: Medium Risk Reduction.
*   Supply Chain Complexity: Medium Risk Reduction (indirect).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Partially implemented. Developers generally avoid unnecessary Nimble dependencies, but no formal process exists.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Formalizing minimal Nimble dependency principle guideline.
*   Process for regular Nimble dependency review and reduction.
*   Integrating Nimble dependency footprint analysis in development workflow.

    *   Vetting and approving Nimble packages.
    *   Syncing with official Nimble registry (if mirroring).
    *   Access control for private Nimble repository.
*   Step 5: Educate developers on using private Nimble repository.
