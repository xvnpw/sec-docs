        *   Provide ongoing support and answer developer questions.
        *   Incorporate private repository usage into onboarding processes for new developers.
    *   **Security Effectiveness:**  Indirectly effective but crucial for ensuring developers adhere to the security measures and utilize the private repository as intended.

### 5. Threats Mitigated (Detailed Analysis)

*   **Supply Chain Attacks via Public Registry (Medium Severity):**
    *   **Mitigation Effectiveness:** **High**.  By using a private repository, the organization significantly reduces its direct reliance on the public Nimble registry. Vetting packages before they enter the private repository acts as a strong defense against malicious packages being introduced through the public registry.
    *   **Residual Risk:**  Some residual risk remains if the vetting process is imperfect or if vulnerabilities are introduced through compromised developer machines or internal systems. The initial packages still originate from the public registry (or other sources) and the vetting process needs to be robust.
*   **Dependency Confusion/Substitution (Medium Severity):**
    *   **Mitigation Effectiveness:** **High**.  A private repository, with proper package naming conventions and access control, effectively eliminates the risk of dependency confusion attacks.  Developers are directed to a controlled and trusted source for dependencies, preventing them from accidentally or maliciously pulling packages from unintended locations.
    *   **Residual Risk:**  Minimal residual risk if access control is properly implemented and package naming conventions are enforced within the private repository.
*   **Data Exfiltration via Dependency Requests (Low Severity - Confidentiality):**
    *   **Mitigation Effectiveness:** **Medium**.  By directing dependency requests to the private repository, the strategy prevents direct requests to the public Nimble registry. This reduces the potential for dependencies to be manipulated to exfiltrate data during the dependency resolution process via requests to external, potentially malicious, servers controlled by attackers.
    *   **Residual Risk:**  Low residual risk. While direct requests to the public registry are prevented, dependencies themselves could still contain code that attempts data exfiltration.  Vetting processes should also consider this aspect, but it's a broader code security concern not solely addressed by a private repository.

### 6. Impact and Risk Reduction (Detailed Analysis)

*   **Supply Chain Attacks via Public Registry: Medium Risk Reduction -> Significant Risk Reduction.**  The initial assessment of "Medium Risk Reduction" is likely **understated**. A well-implemented private repository with robust vetting can achieve **Significant Risk Reduction** against supply chain attacks originating from the public registry. It moves the risk from relying on the public registry's security to relying on the organization's internal security practices and vetting processes, which are under direct control.
*   **Dependency Confusion/Substitution: Medium Risk Reduction -> High Risk Reduction.**  Similarly, "Medium Risk Reduction" for dependency confusion is also likely **understated**. A private repository provides **High Risk Reduction** against this threat by establishing a definitive and controlled source of truth for dependencies.
*   **Data Exfiltration via Dependency Requests: Low Risk Reduction -> Low to Medium Risk Reduction.**  The "Low Risk Reduction" is accurate but could be considered **Low to Medium Risk Reduction**. While it primarily addresses confidentiality related to dependency requests, it also contributes to a more controlled dependency environment, which indirectly reduces the attack surface for other types of data exfiltration attempts embedded within dependencies.

### 7. Currently Implemented & Missing Implementation (Re-evaluation)

The initial assessment is accurate.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. Public Nimble registry is solely used.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Decision on need for private Nimble repository/mirror. **(In progress with this analysis)**
    *   Setup of private Nimble repository solution. **(Requires decision on Step 2)**
    *   Configuration to use private Nimble repository. **(Dependent on Step 2 & 3)**
    *   Package vetting and management for private Nimble repository. **(Requires process definition - Step 4)**
