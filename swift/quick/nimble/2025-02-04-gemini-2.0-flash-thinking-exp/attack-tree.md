            * **Likelihood:** Low (Compromising a major repository is difficult but high impact)
            * **Impact:** Critical (Widespread distribution of malicious packages, massive application compromise)
            * **Effort:** High (Requires significant resources and sophistication to compromise a repository)
            * **Skill Level:** Expert (Advanced hacking skills, social engineering, persistence, potentially supply chain attack expertise)

* **Critical Node Rationale:** Social engineering is a critical node because it targets the human element, often bypassing technical security controls and exploiting user trust or lack of awareness.

    * **High-Risk Path: 4.1. Phishing Attacks to Distribute Malicious Nimble Packages or Nimble Files [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        * **Attack Vector:** Attackers use phishing emails or websites to trick developers into downloading and installing malicious Nimble packages or Nimble files (e.g., modified `package.nimble` files).
        * **Likelihood:** Medium-High (Phishing is a common and effective attack vector)
        * **Impact:** High (Installation of malicious packages, system compromise, application compromise)
        * **Effort:** Low (Setting up phishing campaigns is relatively easy)
        * **Skill Level:** Low (Basic social engineering and email skills)
        * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Phishing emails can be detected with user awareness and email security tools, but some are very sophisticated)

    * **High-Risk Path: 4.2. Social Engineering to Trick Developers into Installing Malicious Packages [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        * **Attack Vector:** Attackers use social engineering tactics to convince developers to install specific malicious packages, perhaps by posing as helpful community members or creating fake tutorials or documentation.
        * **Likelihood:** Medium (Developers can be tricked, especially with convincing narratives and urgency)
        * **Impact:** High (Installation of malicious packages, application compromise)
        * **Effort:** Low (Social engineering tactics can be low effort, relying on manipulation)
        * **Skill Level:** Low-Medium (Social engineering skills, communication, persuasion)
        * **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (Difficult to detect social engineering in package selection, relies on developer vigilance and security awareness)
