# Threat Model Analysis for quick/nimble

## Threat: [Malicious Package Installation](./threats/malicious_package_installation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads a Nimble package to the official or third-party registries containing malicious code. Developers unknowingly install this package using `nimble install` as a dependency for their project. The malicious code executes during the build process or at runtime, potentially compromising the application or the developer's environment.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data breaches (sensitive data exfiltration from development environment or application).
    *   Backdoors introduced into the application, allowing persistent unauthorized access.
    *   Supply chain compromise, potentially infecting development systems and spreading malware.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) of the application or development environment.
    *   Complete compromise of developer machines, including code and credentials.
*   **Nimble Component Affected:** `nimble install` command, Nimble Registry interaction, package download and installation process managed by Nimble.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Review:** Carefully examine package details (author reputation, repository, code) before adding as a dependency in `nimble.toml`.
    *   **Package Pinning:**  Use specific package versions in `nimble.toml` to prevent automatic upgrades to potentially compromised newer versions.
    *   **Checksum Verification (if available in Nimble):** Utilize any checksum or signature verification mechanisms provided by Nimble to ensure package integrity during download and installation.
    *   **Static Analysis and Vulnerability Scanning:** Integrate static analysis tools and dependency vulnerability scanners into the development pipeline to detect known vulnerabilities and suspicious code in Nimble packages *before* installation.
    *   **Reputable Package Sources:** Prioritize using packages from well-known and reputable authors and repositories. Be highly cautious of packages from unknown sources or with limited history.
    *   **Sandboxed Build Environments:**  Use containerized or virtualized build environments to isolate the build process and limit the potential damage from malicious code executed during package installation by `nimble install`.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Periodically audit project dependencies to identify and address any newly discovered vulnerabilities or suspicious packages.

## Threat: [Nimble Registry Compromise](./threats/nimble_registry_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises the official Nimble package registry infrastructure. This allows them to replace legitimate packages with malicious versions directly on the registry, modify package metadata to redirect downloads, or cause a Denial of Service of the registry, preventing package access. When developers use `nimble install`, they would unknowingly download and install compromised packages from the registry.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Widespread distribution of malware throughout the Nimble ecosystem, affecting numerous Nim applications and developers.
    *   Large-scale supply chain compromise impacting many Nim projects and organizations.
    *   Complete Denial of Service of the Nimble package ecosystem, severely hindering Nim development globally.
    *   Erosion of trust in the Nimble package ecosystem, potentially leading to abandonment of Nim for critical projects.
*   **Nimble Component Affected:** Nimble Registry infrastructure, `nimble install` command relying on the registry, package download process initiated by Nimble.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Robust Registry Security (Nimble Team Responsibility):**  This threat relies heavily on the Nimble team implementing and maintaining extremely robust security measures for the official Nimble registry infrastructure. This includes strong access control, intrusion detection and prevention systems, regular security audits, and incident response plans.
    *   **HTTPS Enforcement for Registry Access:** Ensure Nimble *strictly* enforces HTTPS for all communication with the registry to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks that could redirect package downloads.
    *   **Mirroring and Caching (Limited Mitigation):** While local package mirrors or caching can offer some resilience against registry outages, they are less effective against registry *compromise* unless the mirror is actively and independently verifying package integrity.
    *   **Community Monitoring and Incident Response:**  Active community monitoring of the registry for suspicious activity and a well-defined incident response plan are crucial for detecting and mitigating registry compromises quickly.
