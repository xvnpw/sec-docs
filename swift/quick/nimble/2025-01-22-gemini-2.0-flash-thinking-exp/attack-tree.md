Objective: Compromise application using Nimble vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
* **[HIGH RISK PATH] 1. Compromise Package Source (Supply Chain Attack) [CRITICAL NODE: Package Source]**
    * **[HIGH RISK PATH] 1.1. Compromise Nimble Package Index [CRITICAL NODE: Nimble Package Index]**
        * **[HIGH RISK PATH] 1.1.1. Account Compromise of Index Maintainer [CRITICAL NODE: Index Maintainer Account]**
            * Action: Gain credentials of Nimble Package Index maintainer (phishing, credential stuffing, etc.)
        * **[HIGH RISK PATH] 1.1.3. Malicious Package Injection/Substitution**
            * Action: Upload a malicious package or replace an existing package with a malicious one on the index.
    * **[HIGH RISK PATH] 1.2. Compromise GitHub/External Repository [CRITICAL NODE: GitHub Repository]**
        * **[HIGH RISK PATH] 1.2.1. Account Compromise of Package Maintainer (GitHub) [CRITICAL NODE: GitHub Maintainer Account]**
            * Action: Gain credentials of package maintainer on GitHub (phishing, credential stuffing, etc.)
        * **[HIGH RISK PATH] 1.2.3. Malicious Commit Injection**
            * Action: Inject malicious code into a legitimate package repository (e.g., via compromised contributor account, pull request manipulation).
    * **[HIGH RISK PATH] 2.1.2. Command Injection in `.nimble` scripts/tasks [CRITICAL NODE: `.nimble` Script Execution]**
        * Action: Inject malicious commands into `.nimble` file's `task` or `script` sections that Nimble executes.
    * **[HIGH RISK PATH] 2.2.1. Dependency Confusion/Substitution [CRITICAL NODE: Dependency Resolution]**
        * Action: Create a malicious package with the same name as a legitimate dependency in a public or private repository, hoping Nimble will install the malicious one.
    * **[HIGH RISK PATH] 3.1. Modify `.nimble` file in Application Repository [CRITICAL NODE: Application Repository `.nimble` File]**
        * **[HIGH RISK PATH] 3.1.1. Direct Modification (if attacker has write access)**
            * Action: Directly modify the `.nimble` file in the application's repository to point to malicious packages or add malicious tasks.
        * **[HIGH RISK PATH] 3.1.2. Supply Chain Compromise via Developer Machine [CRITICAL NODE: Developer Machine]**
            * Action: Compromise a developer's machine and modify the `.nimble` file before it is committed to the repository.
    * **[HIGH RISK PATH] 4. Social Engineering Attacks Targeting Nimble Users/Developers [CRITICAL NODE: Human Factor]**
        * **[HIGH RISK PATH] 4.1. Phishing for Nimble Package Index Credentials [CRITICAL NODE: Index Maintainer Credentials]**
            * Action: Phish Nimble Package Index maintainers to gain access to upload malicious packages.
