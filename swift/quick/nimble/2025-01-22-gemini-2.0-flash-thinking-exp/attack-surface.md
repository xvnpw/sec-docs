# Attack Surface Analysis for quick/nimble

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Package Registry](./attack_surfaces/compromised_package_registry.md)

*   **Description:**  The official or user-configured Nimble package registries are compromised by an attacker.
*   **Nimble Contribution:** Nimble relies on these registries to discover and download packages. If a registry is compromised, Nimble will unknowingly fetch and install malicious packages from it.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains access to `nimble.directory` and replaces the `httpbeast` package with a backdoored version. Developers using Nimble to install `httpbeast` will unknowingly download and use the malicious version.
*   **Impact:** Malware infection of developer machines and deployed applications, supply chain compromise, data breaches, system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Registry Security:**  Ensure Nimble registries (especially `nimble.directory`) implement robust security measures (access control, intrusion detection, regular security audits). (This is primarily the responsibility of registry operators).
    *   **HTTPS Only:**  Force Nimble to only use HTTPS for registry communication to prevent MITM attacks during registry access.
    *   **Package Pinning/Vendoring:**  Pin specific package versions in `nimble.cfg` or use vendoring to reduce reliance on dynamic registry lookups for every build.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Package Download Channels (HTTP)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_package_download_channels__http_.md)

*   **Description:** Packages or dependencies are downloaded over insecure HTTP connections instead of HTTPS.
*   **Nimble Contribution:** Nimble handles package downloads and dependency retrieval. Misconfigurations or fallback mechanisms in Nimble might lead to HTTP downloads.
*   **Example:** A Nimble package specifies a dependency hosted on a Git repository accessed via `git://` (HTTP). During dependency resolution, Nimble uses HTTP to download from this repository. An attacker performs a MITM attack and replaces the dependency with malicious code.
*   **Impact:** Man-in-the-middle attacks, malicious package injection, code execution on developer machines.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enforce HTTPS:** Configure Nimble to strictly use HTTPS for all package downloads and registry communication. Avoid using or explicitly disallow HTTP sources.
    *   **Verify Download URLs:**  Inspect package manifests and dependency specifications to ensure URLs use HTTPS.
    *   **Use Secure Package Sources:**  Prefer package sources that are known to use HTTPS and have good security practices.

## Attack Surface: [Weak Package Integrity Verification](./attack_surfaces/weak_package_integrity_verification.md)

*   **Description:** Nimble lacks robust mechanisms to verify the integrity and authenticity of downloaded packages.
*   **Nimble Contribution:** Nimble is responsible for downloading and installing packages. Weak or missing integrity checks in Nimble allow for potential package tampering.
*   **Example:** An attacker compromises a package repository after a legitimate package is published but before it's widely downloaded. They modify the package archive. If Nimble doesn't strongly verify package integrity (e.g., using cryptographic signatures), users will download and install the tampered package.
*   **Impact:** Installation of tampered packages, potential malware execution, supply chain compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement Package Signing:**  Advocate for and utilize package signing mechanisms where package authors digitally sign their packages, and Nimble verifies these signatures before installation.
    *   **Checksum Verification:**  Utilize and encourage the use of strong cryptographic checksums (e.g., SHA256) for packages and ensure Nimble verifies them during download and installation.

## Attack Surface: [Unsafe Extraction and Installation Procedures](./attack_surfaces/unsafe_extraction_and_installation_procedures.md)

*   **Description:** Nimble's package extraction and installation processes are vulnerable to exploits like path traversal or command injection.
*   **Nimble Contribution:** Nimble handles package extraction and potentially executes scripts during installation. Vulnerabilities in Nimble's code for these processes can be exploited by malicious packages.
*   **Example:** A malicious Nimble package contains a zip archive with filenames designed to exploit path traversal vulnerabilities during extraction within Nimble. When Nimble extracts this package, files are written outside the intended installation directory, potentially overwriting system files.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary file write, system compromise, command execution on developer machines.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Extraction Libraries (Nimble Development):**  Ensure Nimble uses secure and well-vetted libraries for archive extraction that are resistant to path traversal vulnerabilities. (Primarily a Nimble development team responsibility, but users benefit).
    *   **Sandboxed Installation (Feature Request for Nimble):**  Request or contribute to features that run package installation processes in a sandboxed environment within Nimble.
    *   **Input Sanitization (Nimble Development):**  Ensure Nimble properly sanitizes inputs and filenames during extraction and installation to prevent path traversal and command injection.

## Attack Surface: [Build Script Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/build_script_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious Nimble packages exploit build scripts (`build.nimble`) to execute arbitrary code during the build process.
*   **Nimble Contribution:** Nimble executes `build.nimble` scripts as part of the package installation or build process. Nimble's execution of these scripts without sufficient security measures contributes to this attack surface.
*   **Example:** A malicious Nimble package includes a `build.nimble` script that contains commands to download and execute a remote payload on the developer's machine during package installation, triggered by Nimble's build process.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on developer machines, system compromise, modification of build artifacts.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Build Script Review:**  Carefully review `build.nimble` scripts of all dependencies before installation, especially for packages from untrusted sources.
    *   **Sandboxed Build Environment (Feature Request for Nimble):** Request or contribute to features that execute build scripts in a sandboxed environment within Nimble.
    *   **Minimize Build Script Complexity:**  Encourage packages to minimize the complexity and functionality of their build scripts.

## Attack Surface: [Nimble Client Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/nimble_client_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities exist in the Nimble client application itself.
*   **Nimble Contribution:** Using Nimble as a tool inherently introduces the risk of vulnerabilities within the Nimble application being exploited.
*   **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability is discovered in the Nimble client when parsing package manifests. An attacker crafts a malicious package manifest that, when processed by a vulnerable Nimble client, triggers the buffer overflow and allows arbitrary code execution *through Nimble*.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on developer machines, control over Nimble's functionality, manipulation of package installation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Nimble Updated:**  Regularly update Nimble to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Security Audits of Nimble (Community/Nimble Team):**  Encourage or participate in security audits of the Nimble client codebase to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
    *   **Report Vulnerabilities:**  Promptly report any discovered vulnerabilities in Nimble to the Nimble development team.
