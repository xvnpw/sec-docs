### High and Critical Nimble-Specific Threats

*   **Threat:** Malicious Dependencies
    *   **Description:** An attacker could compromise a dependency used by Nimble or introduce a completely malicious dependency that Nimble relies on. This could happen through supply chain attacks targeting package repositories. When Nimble is used to execute tests, the malicious code from the compromised dependency gets executed within the testing environment, potentially allowing the attacker to compromise the environment or inject malicious code that could later be included in the application build.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of the testing environment, potential injection of malicious code into the application build, data exfiltration from the testing environment.
    *   **Affected Nimble Component:** Dependency resolution mechanism (indirectly, as Nimble relies on the underlying package manager to fetch its dependencies).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize dependency pinning to lock down specific versions of Nimble and its dependencies.
        *   Regularly audit Nimble's dependencies for known vulnerabilities using security scanning tools.
        *   Employ Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools in the development pipeline.
        *   Verify the integrity of downloaded dependencies using checksums or signatures.
        *   Consider using private or mirrored package repositories with stricter controls.

*   **Threat:** Information Disclosure in Test Code
    *   **Description:** Developers might inadvertently include sensitive information (e.g., API keys, database credentials, personally identifiable information) directly within test code that utilizes Nimble matchers and test structures. When these tests are executed by Nimble, this sensitive information is processed and could be exposed through test logs, error messages, or if the test code repository is compromised.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials leading to unauthorized access to systems or data, privacy breaches due to exposure of PII.
    *   **Affected Nimble Component:** Test code files utilizing Nimble's testing framework, test execution environment where Nimble runs the tests.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in test code.
        *   Utilize environment variables or secure configuration management for test credentials and data.
        *   Implement proper access controls and secure storage for test code and results.
        *   Regularly scan test code repositories for accidentally committed secrets using secret scanning tools.
        *   Use anonymized or synthetic data for testing whenever possible.

*   **Threat:** Test Manipulation
    *   **Description:** If the testing environment where Nimble tests are executed is not properly secured, an attacker could potentially modify test code or test data used by Nimble. By altering the tests or their inputs, the attacker could hide existing vulnerabilities, create false positives, or influence the test outcomes to give a false sense of security, potentially leading to the deployment of vulnerable code.
    *   **Impact:** Deployment of vulnerable code into production, leading to potential security breaches and exploitation.
    *   **Affected Nimble Component:** Test code files that are executed by Nimble, test data sources used in conjunction with Nimble tests, and the test execution environment where Nimble operates.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access controls to the testing environment and test code repositories.
        *   Utilize version control for test code and track changes.
        *   Implement code signing or other integrity checks for test code.
        *   Automate test execution and reporting to reduce the opportunity for manual manipulation.

*   **Threat:** Build Process Compromise via Nimble
    *   **Description:** If the build environment where Nimble is used for testing is compromised, an attacker could potentially modify the Nimble installation itself or its configuration within the build environment. This could allow the attacker to inject malicious code that gets executed during the testing phase orchestrated by Nimble, ultimately leading to the inclusion of backdoors or other malicious components in the final application build.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of the production application, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, or other malicious activities.
    *   **Affected Nimble Component:** Nimble installation within the build environment, build scripts that invoke Nimble for testing.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Harden the build environment and implement strong access controls.
        *   Regularly scan the build environment for malware and vulnerabilities.
        *   Use immutable infrastructure for the build environment where possible.
        *   Implement integrity checks for the Nimble installation within the build environment.
