* **Malicious Test Code Execution:**
    * Description: Attackers introduce malicious code within test cases that are executed by the testing framework.
    * Nimble's Contribution: Nimble is the framework that executes these test cases, providing the environment for the malicious code to run.
    * Example: A compromised developer account pushes a test case that attempts to read sensitive environment variables or make network calls to exfiltrate data during test execution.
    * Impact: Data breaches, unauthorized access to resources, denial of service against testing infrastructure, introduction of backdoors into the application under test.
    * Risk Severity: High
    * Mitigation Strategies:
        * Implement strict access controls and code review processes for test code.
        * Regularly audit test code for suspicious or unexpected behavior.
        * Isolate the test environment from production systems and sensitive data.
        * Use dedicated service accounts with minimal privileges for test execution.
        * Employ static analysis tools on test code to detect potential vulnerabilities.

* **Test Environment Compromise via Nimble's Execution Capabilities:**
    * Description: Attackers exploit Nimble's ability to execute code to compromise the testing environment itself.
    * Nimble's Contribution: Nimble provides the mechanism to run code within the testing environment, which can be abused if vulnerabilities exist in Nimble or the environment.
    * Example: A vulnerability in Nimble's test runner allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands that are executed with the privileges of the test process, potentially granting access to the underlying system.
    * Impact: Full compromise of the testing environment, access to sensitive data within the environment, potential to pivot to other systems.
    * Risk Severity: High
    * Mitigation Strategies:
        * Keep Nimble updated to the latest version to patch any potential vulnerabilities in the framework itself.
        * Harden the testing environment by applying security best practices (e.g., least privilege, network segmentation).
        * Monitor the testing environment for suspicious activity.
        * Ensure the operating system and other software in the testing environment are up-to-date.
