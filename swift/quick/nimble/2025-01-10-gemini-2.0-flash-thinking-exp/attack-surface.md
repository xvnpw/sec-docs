# Attack Surface Analysis for quick/nimble

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Test Code Injection](./attack_surfaces/malicious_test_code_injection.md)

* **Description:** Attackers could inject malicious code into test files that are executed by Nimble.
* **How Nimble Contributes:** Nimble directly executes the tests, providing a platform for the malicious code to run within the development environment.
* **Impact:** Data breaches, modification of application code, introduction of backdoors, compromise of the development environment.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement strong access controls and authentication for the codebase (e.g., multi-factor authentication).
    * Enforce code review processes for all changes, including test code.
    * Utilize static analysis tools to detect suspicious patterns in test code.
    * Regularly audit developer access and permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Nimble relies on external libraries (dependencies). Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited to compromise the development environment or the application being tested.
* **How Nimble Contributes:** By including Nimble in the project, you are also including its dependency tree, potentially introducing vulnerable libraries.
* **Impact:** Compromise of the development machine, potential for supply chain attacks affecting the final application.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Regularly update Nimble and all its dependencies to the latest stable versions.
    * Utilize dependency scanning tools (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk) to identify and address known vulnerabilities.
    * Implement a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to track dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Nimble Itself](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_nimble_itself.md)

* **Description:** Nimble, like any software, could contain security vulnerabilities.
* **How Nimble Contributes:** Using Nimble directly introduces the risk of exploiting vulnerabilities within the framework itself.
* **Impact:** Compromise of the testing process, potential for arbitrary code execution within the development environment.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Stay updated with the latest versions of Nimble and monitor for security advisories.
    * Subscribe to security mailing lists or follow Nimble's development for security updates.
    * Report any discovered vulnerabilities to the Nimble maintainers.
