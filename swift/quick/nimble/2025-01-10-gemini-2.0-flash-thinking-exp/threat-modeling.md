# Threat Model Analysis for quick/nimble

## Threat: [Malicious Code Execution in Test Environment](./threats/malicious_code_execution_in_test_environment.md)

**Description:** An attacker, potentially through a compromised dependency of Nimble or by contributing a malicious custom matcher, could introduce malicious code that gets executed by Nimble's test execution engine. This could involve crafting a custom matcher that, when invoked by `expect`, performs arbitrary actions.

**Impact:** The attacker could gain unauthorized access to resources within the test environment, modify test data, disrupt the testing process, or potentially use the test environment as a stepping stone to other systems.

**Affected Nimble Component:** Test Execution Engine, Custom Matcher API

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict code review processes for all custom matchers.
* Regularly audit Nimble's dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
* Consider using a static analysis tool specifically designed for Swift to scan custom matchers.
* Limit the capabilities and permissions of the test execution environment.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attack via Compromised Nimble Dependency](./threats/supply_chain_attack_via_compromised_nimble_dependency.md)

**Description:** An attacker could compromise a direct dependency of the `nimble` library on GitHub or through a package manager. If a malicious version of a dependency is introduced, it could be included in projects using `nimble` without the developers' explicit knowledge.

**Impact:**  The malicious dependency could introduce vulnerabilities, exfiltrate data during test runs, or compromise the integrity of the testing process. This could lead to undetected vulnerabilities in the application being tested.

**Affected Nimble Component:** Dependency Management within `nimble`'s `Package.swift` or similar configuration.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update `nimble` to the latest version, which includes updates to its dependencies.
* Utilize dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in `nimble`'s dependencies.
* Monitor security advisories related to `nimble` and its dependencies.
* Consider using a dependency management tool with vulnerability scanning capabilities and lock file mechanisms.

## Threat: [Abuse of Custom Matchers for Malicious Actions](./threats/abuse_of_custom_matchers_for_malicious_actions.md)

**Description:** A developer with malicious intent or a compromised developer account could create a custom matcher that performs actions beyond simple value comparison during the expectation evaluation. This could include actions like making network requests, accessing local files, or executing arbitrary code.

**Impact:**  The attacker could leverage the custom matcher to exfiltrate data from the test environment, disrupt the testing process, or potentially gain unauthorized access to other systems if the test environment has network access.

**Affected Nimble Component:** Custom Matcher API, `expect` function when using the malicious custom matcher.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement mandatory code reviews for all custom matchers before they are integrated into the project.
* Establish clear guidelines and restrictions on what actions are permissible within custom matchers.
* Consider using static analysis tools to scan custom matchers for potentially malicious behavior.
* Regularly audit existing custom matchers for unexpected or suspicious functionality.
