# Attack Tree Analysis for quick/nimble

Objective: To compromise an application that uses the Nimble testing framework by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within Nimble itself or its integration (focusing on high-risk scenarios).

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Nimble Itself (Supply Chain Attack)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_nimble_itself__supply_chain_attack_.md)

*   Attack Vector: Compromise Nimble's GitHub Repository
    *   Critical Node: Compromise Nimble's GitHub Repository
        *   Description: An attacker gains control of the official Nimble repository on GitHub.
        *   Sub-Vector: Inject Malicious Code into Nimble
            *   High-Risk Path: Inject Malicious Code into Nimble
                *   Critical Node: Compromise Maintainer Account
                    *   Description: Attackers target and compromise the accounts of Nimble maintainers with write access to the repository.
                    *   Attack Steps:
                        *   Exploit Weak Credentials or MFA: Brute-force attacks or exploiting known vulnerabilities in authentication mechanisms.
                        *   Phishing Attack: Deceiving maintainers into revealing their credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Nimble's Release Process](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_nimble's_release_process.md)

*   Attack Vector: Compromise Nimble's Release Process
    *   High-Risk Path: Compromise Nimble's Release Process
        *   High-Risk Path: Inject Malicious Code into a Nimble Release
            *   Critical Node: Compromise Build Server
                *   Description: Attackers compromise the infrastructure used to build and release Nimble packages.
                *   Attack Steps:
                    *   Exploit Vulnerabilities in Build System: Exploiting software flaws in the build server's operating system or build tools.
                    *   Gain Access via Stolen Credentials: Obtaining valid credentials for the build server through various means.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Nimble's Interaction with Development Environment](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_nimble's_interaction_with_development_environment.md)

*   Attack Vector: Inject Malicious Test Code
    *   High-Risk Path: Inject Malicious Test Code
        *   Description: Attackers introduce malicious code disguised as legitimate tests within the application's test suite.
        *   Attack Steps:
            *   Introduce Tests that Exploit Application Vulnerabilities: Crafting tests that, while appearing to check functionality, actually trigger vulnerabilities.
            *   Intentionally Design Tests to Pass Despite Flaws: Creating tests with malicious assertions that always pass, masking underlying issues.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Nimble's Integration with Build Tools](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_nimble's_integration_with_build_tools.md)

*   Attack Vector: Exploit Nimble's Integration with Build Tools
    *   High-Risk Path: Exploit Nimble's Integration with Build Tools
        *   High-Risk Path: Inject Malicious Commands during Test Execution
            *   Description: Attackers leverage Nimble's execution within the build process to inject and run malicious commands.
            *   Attack Steps:
                *   Modify build scripts or Nimble configuration to execute arbitrary commands during test runs.
                *   Leverage Nimble's extensibility to inject malicious code that runs during the test lifecycle.
