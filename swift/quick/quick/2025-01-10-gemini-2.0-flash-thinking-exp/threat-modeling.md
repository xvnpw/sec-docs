# Threat Model Analysis for quick/quick

## Threat: [Malicious Test Code Injection](./threats/malicious_test_code_injection.md)

* **Threat:** Malicious Test Code Injection
    * **Description:**
        * **What the attacker might do:** An attacker with write access to the test codebase injects malicious code directly within Quick's `Describe` or `It` blocks.
        * **How:** The malicious code is executed by the Quick framework during test runs. This code can leverage the environment in which the tests are running.
    * **Impact:**
        * Exfiltration of sensitive data accessible within the test environment.
        * Modification of application behavior during testing, potentially masking vulnerabilities.
        * Denial of service within the testing infrastructure.
        * Introduction of backdoors that are only triggered under specific test conditions.
    * **Which https://github.com/quick/quick component is affected:**
        * `Describe` blocks: Used to organize tests, where malicious code can be embedded.
        * `It` blocks: Define individual test cases, the primary location for executable test code, including malicious code.
        * Test execution lifecycle: The core mechanism of Quick that executes the code within `Describe` and `It` blocks.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement mandatory code review for all changes to test files.
        * Enforce strict access controls and multi-factor authentication for test code repositories.
        * Utilize static analysis tools on test code to identify suspicious patterns or potential security issues.
        * Regularly audit test code and the permissions of those who can modify it.
        * Consider running tests in isolated environments with limited network access and permissions.

## Threat: [Information Leakage through Test Case Content](./threats/information_leakage_through_test_case_content.md)

* **Threat:** Information Leakage through Test Case Content
    * **Description:**
        * **What the attacker might do:** An attacker gains access to the test codebase and discovers sensitive information that was inadvertently included within the content of Quick's `It` blocks or supporting test files.
        * **How:** Developers might directly embed API keys, passwords, internal URLs, or sample data resembling real user data within the strings or code within `It` blocks.
    * **Impact:**
        * Exposure of sensitive credentials or internal infrastructure details.
        * Potential for attackers to gain unauthorized access to systems or data using the leaked information.
        * Compliance violations if sensitive personal information is exposed in the test codebase.
    * **Which https://github.com/quick/quick component is affected:**
        * `It` blocks: The primary location where test logic and assertions are defined, and where sensitive data might be inadvertently included as string literals or within test data structures.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Train developers on secure coding practices for testing, specifically emphasizing the avoidance of hardcoding sensitive information in test cases.
        * Implement mechanisms for securely managing test secrets, such as using environment variables or dedicated secret management tools, and accessing them programmatically within tests instead of hardcoding.
        * Regularly scan test code repositories for potential secrets exposure using tools like `git-secrets`.
        * Avoid using production data directly in tests; use anonymized or synthetic data instead.

## Threat: [Build System Compromise via Malicious Test Execution](./threats/build_system_compromise_via_malicious_test_execution.md)

* **Threat:** Build System Compromise via Malicious Test Execution
    * **Description:**
        * **What the attacker might do:** If the build system executes Quick tests in an environment with elevated privileges or access to sensitive infrastructure, a maliciously crafted test (as described in "Malicious Test Code Injection") executed by Quick can be used to escalate privileges or gain unauthorized access to other systems.
        * **How:** The malicious code within a Quick `It` block leverages the permissions of the build environment to perform actions beyond the scope of testing, such as accessing deployment credentials, modifying infrastructure configurations, or deploying malicious code.
    * **Impact:**
        * Full compromise of the build pipeline and potentially the production environment.
        * Unauthorized deployment of malicious code into production.
        * Data breaches or service disruptions caused by actions taken by the compromised build system.
    * **Which https://github.com/quick/quick component is affected:**
        * `It` blocks with malicious code: The code executed by Quick within the build environment that performs unauthorized actions.
        * Test execution lifecycle: The process by which Quick runs the malicious tests within the context of the build system's permissions.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Run tests in isolated environments within the build system with the minimum necessary privileges.
        * Implement strict access controls and auditing for the build system and related infrastructure.
        * Regularly review the build pipeline configuration for potential security vulnerabilities.
        * Employ secure build practices, such as using ephemeral build environments and infrastructure as code.
        * Sanitize environment variables and inputs provided to the test execution environment.
