## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] AND Inject Malicious Code via Test Suite [CRITICAL NODE: Inject Malicious Code]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__and_inject_malicious_code_via_test_suite__critical_node_inject_malicious_code_.md)

*   This path represents the direct injection of malicious code into the application's test suite. If successful, it allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the development or testing environment. This is a critical node because it is a primary goal for attackers and can have immediate and severe consequences.
    *   **OR Introduce Malicious Test Case:**
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Lack of Code Review on Test Files:**
            *   **Socially Engineer Developer to Merge Malicious Test:**  Attackers might use social engineering techniques to trick a developer into merging a test case containing malicious code. This relies on the lack of thorough code review for test files.
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE: Compromise Developer Account]:**
            *   **Obtain Credentials via Phishing, Malware, etc.:**  If an attacker compromises a developer's account credentials, they can directly introduce malicious test cases or modify existing ones. This is a critical node because it grants broad access to the codebase.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE: Manipulate Test Outcomes] AND Manipulate Test Outcomes](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node_manipulate_test_outcomes__and_manipulate_test_outcomes.md)

*   This node represents the attacker's ability to influence the results of tests, potentially masking the presence of vulnerabilities or malicious code. Success here can lead to the deployment of compromised code into production.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Lack of Code Review on Test Files](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_lack_of_code_review_on_test_files.md)

*   **Socially Engineer Developer to Merge Malicious Test:**  Attackers might use social engineering techniques to trick a developer into merging a test case containing malicious code. This relies on the lack of thorough code review for test files.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE: Compromise Developer Account] Compromise Developer Account](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node_compromise_developer_account__compromise_developer_account.md)

*   **Obtain Credentials via Phishing, Malware, etc.:**  If an attacker compromises a developer's account credentials, they can directly introduce malicious test cases or modify existing ones. This is a critical node because it grants broad access to the codebase.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] AND Exploit Development Environment Weaknesses Exposed by Quick/Nimble [CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Development Environment Weaknesses]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__and_exploit_development_environment_weaknesses_exposed_by_quicknimble__critical_nod_030b8ae8.md)

*   This path focuses on leveraging vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in the development or testing environment that are exposed or made exploitable through the use of Quick/Nimble. Compromising this environment can lead to data breaches, lateral movement, and broader system compromise.
    *   **OR Leverage Insecure Test Environment Configuration:**
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Shared Resources in Test Environment:**
            *   **Access Sensitive Data or Processes Due to Lax Permissions:** If the test environment shares resources with insufficient access controls, an attacker executing code within a test can potentially access sensitive data or processes.
    *   **OR [HIGH-RISK PATH] Leverage Quick/Nimble Features for Malicious Purposes:**
        *   **Exploit `pending()` or `fit()` for Persistent Backdoors:**
            *   **Introduce Tests Marked as Pending or Focused that Contain Malicious Code to be Activated Later:** Attackers can inject malicious code within tests marked as `pending()` or `fit()`. These tests are typically skipped during normal execution but can be activated later by simply removing the `pending()` or `fit()` markers, creating a persistent backdoor.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Shared Resources in Test Environment](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_shared_resources_in_test_environment.md)

*   **Access Sensitive Data or Processes Due to Lax Permissions:** If the test environment shares resources with insufficient access controls, an attacker executing code within a test can potentially access sensitive data or processes.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Leverage Quick/Nimble Features for Malicious Purposes](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__leverage_quicknimble_features_for_malicious_purposes.md)

*   **Exploit `pending()` or `fit()` for Persistent Backdoors:**
            *   **Introduce Tests Marked as Pending or Focused that Contain Malicious Code to be Activated Later:** Attackers can inject malicious code within tests marked as `pending()` or `fit()`. These tests are typically skipped during normal execution but can be activated later by simply removing the `pending()` or `fit()` markers, creating a persistent backdoor.
