# Attack Surface Analysis for quick/quick

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Test Code Injection/Execution](./attack_surfaces/malicious_test_code_injectionexecution.md)

*   **Description:**  The ability for an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code within the context of Quick's test execution environment.
    *   **How Quick Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Quick directly executes Swift code defined in test specifications. If these specifications can be modified by untrusted sources, malicious code can be introduced and run.
    *   **Example:** A developer unknowingly merges a pull request containing a test file with embedded code that, when executed by Quick, exfiltrates environment variables or modifies system files.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine or within the CI/CD pipeline, leading to data breaches, system compromise, or supply chain attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access controls and code review processes for all test files.
        *   Utilize Git signing or similar mechanisms to verify the authenticity of test code changes.
        *   Run tests in isolated and ephemeral environments to limit the impact of potential malicious code execution.
        *   Employ static analysis tools to scan test files for suspicious code patterns.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Test Reports](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_test_reports.md)

*   **Description:**  Accidental inclusion or exposure of sensitive data (API keys, passwords, database credentials, internal configurations) within the test reports generated by Quick.
    *   **How Quick Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Quick generates detailed reports that can include output from test executions, which might inadvertently contain sensitive information used during testing.
    *   **Example:** A test case logs the database connection string, including the password, which is then included in the generated HTML or console output report. This report is then inadvertently committed to a public repository.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to internal systems, and potential regulatory compliance violations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid hardcoding sensitive information directly in test code. Use environment variables or secure secrets management solutions.
        *   Implement mechanisms to redact or filter sensitive information from test output before it's included in reports.
        *   Securely store and manage test reports, ensuring they are not publicly accessible.
        *   Regularly review test reports for accidental exposure of sensitive data.
