## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Handling of Test Data and Secrets within `quick/quick` Tests](./mitigation_strategies/secure_handling_of_test_data_and_secrets_within__quickquick__tests.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Data in `quick/quick` Tests:**  Pinpoint any sensitive information (API keys, passwords, PII, etc.) that your `quick/quick` test specifications might require or inadvertently include.
    2.  **Externalize Secrets for `quick/quick`:**  Instead of hardcoding sensitive data directly within your `quick/quick` `describe` or `it` blocks, utilize environment variables or a secure secrets management system.
    3.  **Access Secrets in `quick/quick` Setup:**  Within your `quick/quick` test setup (e.g., `beforeEach`, `beforeAll` blocks), retrieve secrets from environment variables or your secrets management system.  Pass these retrieved secrets as variables or configurations to your tests.
    4.  **Avoid Direct Output of Secrets in `quick/quick` Assertions/Logs:**  Be mindful of what you log or assert within your `quick/quick` tests.  Avoid directly logging or displaying secret values in assertion messages or test output.
    5.  **Redact Sensitive Data in `quick/quick` Custom Reporters (if used):** If you are using custom reporters with `quick/quick`, ensure they are configured to redact or mask sensitive data from test outputs and reports.
    6.  **Review `quick/quick` Test Code for Hardcoded Secrets:** Regularly review your `quick/quick` test specifications to ensure no new sensitive data is accidentally hardcoded during development.
