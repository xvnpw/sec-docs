Objective: Compromise Application via Quick Vulnerabilities (Accidental Inclusion)

## Attack Tree Visualization



## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Information Disclosure via Test Artifacts](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_information_disclosure_via_test_artifacts.md)

* **Description:** This path focuses on attackers gaining access to sensitive information by exploiting the presence of test-related files and data that should not be in a production environment. This is considered high-risk due to the potential for exposing credentials, sensitive data, and internal application logic.

    * **High-Risk Path 1.1: Access Test Files Directly **[CRITICAL NODE]**

        * **Description:** Attackers attempt to directly access test files located within the application's deployment directory. Success here leads to potential access to all content within those files.

            * **Attack Vector 1.1.1: Directory Traversal Vulnerability in Web Server**
                * **Description:** Exploiting a directory traversal vulnerability in the web server configuration. This allows attackers to navigate outside the intended web root and access directories where test files are likely stored (e.g., 'Tests', 'Specs').
                * **Breakdown:**
                    * **Likelihood:** Medium
                    * **Impact:** High
                    * **Effort:** Low
                    * **Skill Level:** Intermediate
                    * **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate

            * **Attack Vector 1.1.2: Predictable Test File Paths**
                * **Description:** Guessing or discovering common naming conventions and paths for test files. Attackers try to access URLs that might lead to test directories or files based on typical project structures.
                * **Breakdown:**
                    * **Likelihood:** Medium
                    * **Impact:** Medium
                    * **Effort:** Minimal
                    * **Skill Level:** Novice
                    * **Detection Difficulty:** Very Difficult

    * **High-Risk Path 1.2: Exposure of Test-Specific Data/Credentials **[CRITICAL NODE]**

        * **Description:**  Even if direct file access is not possible, attackers might still gain access to sensitive data or credentials that are inadvertently included within the accessible test files.

            * **Attack Vector 1.2.1: Hardcoded Credentials in Test Files**
                * **Description:** Extracting hardcoded API keys, passwords, or other secrets that developers might have included in test files for testing purposes. If these files are accessible, these credentials become exposed.
                * **Breakdown:**
                    * **Likelihood:** Medium
                    * **Impact:** High
                    * **Effort:** Low
                    * **Skill Level:** Novice
                    * **Detection Difficulty:** Very Difficult

            * **Attack Vector 1.2.2: Sensitive Test Data in Test Files**
                * **Description:** Accessing Personally Identifiable Information (PII), business logic details, or other sensitive information that is used as sample data within test files. Exposure of this data can lead to data breaches or reveal sensitive business information.
                * **Breakdown:**
                    * **Likelihood:** Medium
                    * **Impact:** Medium to High
                    * **Effort:** Low
                    * **Skill Level:** Novice
                    * **Detection Difficulty:** Very Difficult

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Dependency Chain Vulnerabilities (Indirectly Related to Quick)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_dependency_chain_vulnerabilities__indirectly_related_to_quick_.md)

* **Description:** This path explores the risk of exploiting vulnerabilities in the dependencies of Quick, assuming these dependencies are also accidentally included in the production build. This is high-risk because dependency vulnerabilities are a common attack vector and can lead to various levels of compromise.

    * **High-Risk Path 2.1: Vulnerable Dependencies of Quick (e.g., Nimble)**

        * **Description:** Identifying and exploiting known vulnerabilities in libraries that Quick depends on, such as Nimble. If these dependencies are present in production, they expand the attack surface.

            * **Attack Vector 2.1.1: Identify Vulnerable Dependencies**
                * **Description:** Analyzing Quick's dependencies (like Nimble) for publicly known vulnerabilities. If vulnerable versions of these dependencies are included in the production application, attackers can exploit these known weaknesses.
                * **Breakdown:**
                    * **Likelihood:** Medium
                    * **Impact:** Medium to High
                    * **Effort:** Low to Moderate
                    * **Skill Level:** Intermediate
                    * **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate to Easy
