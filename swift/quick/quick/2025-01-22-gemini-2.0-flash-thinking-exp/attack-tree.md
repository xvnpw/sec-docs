# Attack Tree Analysis for quick/quick

Objective: To compromise application that use given project by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the project itself, specifically focusing on high-risk attack vectors stemming from the accidental inclusion of the Quick testing framework.

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Information Disclosure via Test Artifacts [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/1__information_disclosure_via_test_artifacts__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker aims to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information by exploiting the presence of test-related files and data that should not be in the production environment. This is a high-risk path because it is relatively likely and can have a significant impact due to potential exposure of credentials, sensitive data, or internal application logic.

    *   **1.1. Access Test Files Directly [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker attempts to directly access test files (e.g., `.swift` files in `Tests` or `Specs` directories) that are mistakenly deployed with the production application. This is a critical node because successful access to these files is a prerequisite for further information disclosure.

            *   **1.1.1. Directory Traversal Vulnerability in Web Server:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker exploits a directory traversal vulnerability in the web server configuration. This vulnerability allows them to navigate outside the intended web root directory by manipulating URLs (e.g., using `../` sequences). By traversing up the directory structure, they can reach and access directories where test files are located.
                *   **Example:**  An attacker might try a URL like `https://example.com/../../Tests/MyTests.swift` to attempt to access a test file if the web server is vulnerable to directory traversal.

            *   **1.1.2. Predictable Test File Paths:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Even without a directory traversal vulnerability, attackers can attempt to guess or discover common and predictable paths where test files might be located. Developers often follow naming conventions and place test files in directories like `Tests`, `Specs`, or within source code directories.
                *   **Example:** An attacker might try accessing URLs like `https://example.com/Tests/`, `https://example.com/Specs/`, or `https://example.com/src/Tests/` to see if test files are accessible at these predictable locations.

    *   **1.2. Exposure of Test-Specific Data/Credentials [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:**  If test files are accessible (as described in 1.1), the attacker can then analyze the *content* of these files to extract sensitive information. This is a critical node because it represents the actual exploitation of the accessible test files to gain valuable data.

            *   **1.2.1. Hardcoded Credentials in Test Files:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Developers sometimes hardcode API keys, database passwords, or other credentials directly within test files for ease of testing against staging or mock environments. If these test files are exposed, attackers can easily extract these credentials by simply reading the file content.
                *   **Example:** A test file might contain a line like `let apiKey = "TEST_API_KEY_12345"`. If this file is accessible, the attacker can obtain this API key.

            *   **1.2.2. Sensitive Test Data in Test Files:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Test files often include sample data used for testing various application functionalities. This data might contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII), business logic details, or other sensitive information that, if exposed, could be valuable to an attacker or reveal insights into the application's workings.
                *   **Example:** Test data might include sample user profiles with names, addresses, or email addresses, or examples of sensitive financial transactions used for testing payment processing.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Dependency Chain Vulnerabilities:](./attack_tree_paths/3__dependency_chain_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities in the dependencies that Quick relies upon. If these dependencies are also accidentally included in the production build, they can introduce security risks independent of Quick itself. This is a high-risk path because dependency vulnerabilities are a common attack vector and can be relatively easy to exploit if known vulnerabilities exist.

    *   **3.1. Vulnerable Dependencies of Quick:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Quick, like many software projects, relies on external libraries and frameworks (dependencies).  If these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, and if these vulnerable dependencies are also mistakenly included in the production application alongside Quick, attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities.  A common example dependency for Quick is Nimble (an assertion library).

            *   **3.1.1. Identify Vulnerable Dependencies:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker first needs to identify the dependencies of Quick that are present in the production build. They can then check public vulnerability databases (like CVE databases or security advisories) to see if any of these dependencies have known vulnerabilities. If vulnerable dependencies are found, the attacker can then attempt to exploit those specific vulnerabilities.
                *   **Example:** If Nimble (a dependency of Quick) is included and a known vulnerability exists in the version of Nimble deployed, the attacker would research the Nimble vulnerability and attempt to exploit it within the context of the application.
