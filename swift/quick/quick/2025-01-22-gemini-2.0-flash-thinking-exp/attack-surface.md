# Attack Surface Analysis for quick/quick

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Quick relies on external libraries (dependencies) like Nimble. Critical vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited during development and testing.
*   **Quick Contribution:** Quick directly depends on these libraries, inheriting their vulnerabilities. Using Quick with outdated or vulnerable dependencies directly introduces this attack surface into the development process.
*   **Example:** Nimble, a dependency of Quick, contains a critical remote code execution vulnerability. If a developer's machine running Quick tests is targeted, an attacker could exploit this Nimble vulnerability through a malicious test case or by compromising the test environment, gaining full control of the developer's machine or test infrastructure.
*   **Impact:** **Critical**. Full compromise of developer machines, testing environments, or build infrastructure. Potential for supply chain attacks by injecting malicious code into build artifacts through compromised testing processes.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory and Automated Dependency Updates:** Implement automated processes to regularly update Quick and *all* its dependencies to the latest versions.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning in CI/CD:** Integrate dependency scanning tools (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk) into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically identify and block builds with vulnerable dependencies used by Quick.
    *   **Dependency Pinning and Verification:** Pin specific versions of Quick and its dependencies to ensure consistent and controlled environments. Verify dependency integrity using checksums or signatures.

## Attack Surface: [Test Code Injection/Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/test_code_injectionmanipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious actors could inject or manipulate test code within the Quick test suite to execute arbitrary code or bypass security checks during testing.
*   **Quick Contribution:** Quick is the execution engine for test code. If access to the test codebase is compromised, attackers can leverage Quick to execute malicious tests, effectively using Quick as a tool for attack within the development lifecycle.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains write access to the test code repository. They inject a malicious Quick test case that, when executed, exploits a vulnerability in the application being tested *or* directly compromises the testing environment by executing system commands to install backdoors or exfiltrate sensitive data.  This malicious test could be designed to run silently and pass, masking its malicious activity.
*   **Impact:** **High**. Introduction of backdoors into the application through manipulated tests, data breaches by exfiltrating sensitive test data or credentials, complete bypass of testing security controls, leading to deployment of highly vulnerable applications.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Access Control for Test Code:** Implement robust access control mechanisms for the test codebase, limiting write access to authorized personnel only. Utilize branch protection and code review processes for all test code changes.
    *   **Code Review for Security in Tests:** Conduct thorough security-focused code reviews of *all* test code, treating it with the same security scrutiny as production code. Look for potentially malicious logic or unintended side effects in test cases.
    *   **Isolated and Secure Test Environments:** Run Quick tests in isolated and hardened environments with minimal access to sensitive resources. Implement network segmentation and restrict outbound network access from test environments.
    *   **Test Code Integrity Checks:** Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity of test code before execution, such as code signing or checksum validation, to detect unauthorized modifications.

## Attack Surface: [Build Process Integration Risks (Test Manipulation for Build Bypass)](./attack_surfaces/build_process_integration_risks__test_manipulation_for_build_bypass_.md)

*   **Description:**  Quick tests are integrated into the build process. Attackers compromising the build pipeline can manipulate Quick test execution or results to bypass quality and security gates.
*   **Quick Contribution:** Quick's test execution and reporting are critical steps in the build pipeline. By manipulating how Quick tests are run or interpreted, attackers can directly subvert the intended security checks within the build process that rely on Quick.
*   **Example:** An attacker compromises the CI/CD server. They modify the build script to:
    *   Skip execution of critical Quick security tests entirely.
    *   Modify the test command to always return a successful exit code, regardless of actual test failures reported by Quick.
    *   Alter the test reporting mechanism to falsely report "passing" tests even when Quick indicates failures.
    This allows vulnerable code to be deployed despite failing security tests that *should* have been caught by Quick.
*   **Impact:** **High**. Deployment of vulnerable applications into production by bypassing security testing. False sense of security due to compromised build pipeline. Potential for widespread exploitation of deployed vulnerabilities.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure and Harden CI/CD Infrastructure:** Implement robust security measures for the CI/CD pipeline infrastructure itself, including access control, regular patching, and security monitoring.
    *   **Immutable Build Pipelines:** Design build pipelines to be as immutable as possible, reducing the opportunity for unauthorized modifications. Use infrastructure-as-code and version control for pipeline configurations.
    *   **Pipeline Integrity Monitoring:** Implement monitoring and alerting for any unauthorized changes to the build pipeline configuration or scripts.
    *   **Independent Test Result Verification:** Implement mechanisms to independently verify test results reported by Quick, outside of the potentially compromised build pipeline. This could involve separate security scans or manual review of test reports in a secure environment.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Build Processes:** Grant build processes only the minimum necessary permissions to execute tests and access required resources, limiting the potential impact of a compromised build process.
