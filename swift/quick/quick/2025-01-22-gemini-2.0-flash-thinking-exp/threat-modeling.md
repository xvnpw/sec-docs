# Threat Model Analysis for quick/quick

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/dependency_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in a dependency used by Quick (e.g., Nimble). This could be done by targeting publicly known vulnerabilities and crafting exploits to leverage them within the development environment where Quick is used.
*   **Impact:** Compromise of the development environment, CI/CD pipeline, potential injection of malicious code into build artifacts if testing processes are not isolated. Data breaches if sensitive information is accessible in the compromised environment.
*   **Affected Quick Component:**  Quick's Dependencies (indirectly affects the entire framework usage)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Quick and its dependencies to the latest versions.
    *   Implement dependency scanning tools to automatically detect known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    *   Utilize Software Composition Analysis (SCA) in the CI/CD pipeline to monitor and manage dependency risks.
    *   Isolate development and CI/CD environments to limit the impact of a dependency compromise.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attacks Targeting Quick Development/Distribution](./threats/supply_chain_attacks_targeting_quick_developmentdistribution.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises the Quick project's supply chain, such as its repository, build process, or distribution channels (e.g., package managers). This could involve injecting malicious code into Quick itself or its distribution packages. Developers using a compromised version of Quick would then unknowingly introduce vulnerabilities into their development environments.
*   **Impact:** Compromised development environments for all users of the malicious Quick version. Potential for widespread injection of malicious code into applications under development if the attack is sophisticated enough to propagate beyond the testing framework.
*   **Affected Quick Component:** Quick Distribution, Quick Core Code
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use trusted and official sources for downloading Quick and its dependencies.
    *   Implement integrity checks (e.g., checksum verification) when downloading and installing Quick packages.
    *   Stay informed about security advisories related to Quick and its ecosystem.
    *   Consider using dependency pinning or lock files to ensure consistent and verifiable dependency versions.
    *   For organizations with high security requirements, consider mirroring Quick and its dependencies from trusted sources and performing internal security scans.
