## Attack Tree Path: [1. Abuse of `beforeEach` / `afterEach` / `beforeSuite` / `afterSuite` [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__abuse_of__beforeeach____aftereach____beforesuite____aftersuite___high-risk_.md)

*   **Description:**  Quick's setup and teardown blocks (executed before/after each test or the entire suite) are powerful features that can be abused to execute arbitrary code or manipulate the testing environment. This is a high-risk area because these blocks often contain code that interacts with the system at a lower level (e.g., file system, databases, network).

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. Inject Malicious Code into Setup/Teardown Blocks [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__inject_malicious_code_into_setupteardown_blocks__high-risk_.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker directly inserts malicious code into the setup/teardown blocks of Quick test files.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1. Compromise Developer Account/Environment](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1__compromise_developer_accountenvironment.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.1. Modify existing spec files to include malicious code. [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_1__modify_existing_spec_files_to_include_malicious_code___critical_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker gains access to a developer's account or development environment and modifies existing Quick spec files to include malicious code within the setup/teardown blocks. This code will be executed whenever the tests are run.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High (Arbitrary Code Execution)
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2. Submit Malicious Pull Request (if tests run on PRs) [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2__submit_malicious_pull_request__if_tests_run_on_prs___high-risk_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2.1. Create a new spec file or modify an existing one with malicious code in setup/teardown. [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_1__create_a_new_spec_file_or_modify_an_existing_one_with_malicious_code_in_setupteardown___cri_5ff7e13e.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker submits a pull request containing a new Quick spec file, or modifies an existing one, to include malicious code within the setup/teardown blocks.  If the pull request is merged and the tests are run automatically (e.g., in a CI/CD pipeline), the malicious code will be executed.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High (Arbitrary Code Execution)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.3. Exploit Vulnerability in CI/CD System](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_3__exploit_vulnerability_in_cicd_system.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.3.1. Gain access to modify build scripts or test configurations to inject code. [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_3_1__gain_access_to_modify_build_scripts_or_test_configurations_to_inject_code___critical_.md)

*   **Description:**  The attacker exploits a vulnerability in the CI/CD system to gain access and modify build scripts or test configurations.  This allows them to inject malicious code that will be executed during the test run, potentially even before Quick itself is invoked.
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** High (Arbitrary Code Execution, CI/CD compromise)
*   **Effort:** High
*   **Skill Level:** High
*   **Detection Difficulty:** High

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.4. Exploit vulnerability in Quick or Nimble](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_4__exploit_vulnerability_in_quick_or_nimble.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.4.1. Inject code that will be executed during test run. [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_4_1__inject_code_that_will_be_executed_during_test_run___critical_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker discovers and exploits a zero-day vulnerability in the Quick or Nimble framework itself to inject and execute arbitrary code. This is highly unlikely but would have a severe impact.
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** High (Arbitrary Code Execution)
*   **Effort:** High
*   **Skill Level:** High
*   **Detection Difficulty:** High

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2. Leverage Existing (Legitimate) Setup/Teardown Code for Malicious Purposes [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2__leverage_existing__legitimate__setupteardown_code_for_malicious_purposes__high-risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker exploits existing, seemingly legitimate code within the setup/teardown blocks to achieve malicious goals. This often involves manipulating inputs or exploiting vulnerabilities in the way the code interacts with external systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2. Find Setup/Teardown that Executes Shell Commands [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2__find_setupteardown_that_executes_shell_commands__high-risk_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2.1. Craft malicious input that gets passed to the shell command (command injection). [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2_1__craft_malicious_input_that_gets_passed_to_the_shell_command__command_injection____critical_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker identifies setup/teardown code that executes shell commands. They then craft malicious input that, when passed to the shell command, results in arbitrary code execution (command injection). This is a classic and dangerous vulnerability.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High (Arbitrary Code Execution)
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.3. Find Setup/Teardown that uses unsafe deserialization](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_3__find_setupteardown_that_uses_unsafe_deserialization.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.3.1 Craft malicious input that will be deserialized and execute code. [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_3_1_craft_malicious_input_that_will_be_deserialized_and_execute_code___critical_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker identifies setup/teardown code that uses unsafe deserialization of data. They craft a malicious payload that, when deserialized, executes arbitrary code.
*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
*   **Impact:** High (Arbitrary Code Execution)
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Medium to High
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Manipulation of Test Results](./attack_tree_paths/2__manipulation_of_test_results.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [2.1. Modify Quick/Nimble Source Code (Highly Unlikely, but included for completeness)](./attack_tree_paths/2_1__modify_quicknimble_source_code__highly_unlikely__but_included_for_completeness_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1. Gain Privileged Access to the Quick/Nimble Library Installation](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1__gain_privileged_access_to_the_quicknimble_library_installation.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1.1. Alter the reporting mechanism to always report success, or to selectively report success based on malicious criteria. [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1_1__alter_the_reporting_mechanism_to_always_report_success__or_to_selectively_report_success_ba_1888fa2d.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker gains privileged access to the system where Quick and Nimble are installed and modifies the source code of the libraries themselves.  They alter the test reporting mechanism to always report success, or to report success based on malicious criteria, effectively hiding failing tests and potentially masking vulnerabilities.
*   **Likelihood:** Very Low
*   **Impact:** High (Complete loss of test result integrity)
*   **Effort:** High
*   **Skill Level:** High
*   **Detection Difficulty:** High

## Attack Tree Path: [2.3. Abuse of Test Doubles (Mocks, Stubs, Spies) [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2_3__abuse_of_test_doubles__mocks__stubs__spies___high-risk_.md)

*   **Description:**  Test doubles (mocks, stubs, spies) are used to isolate the code under test.  However, they can be abused to manipulate test results or bypass security checks.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.3.1. Replace Legitimate Dependencies with Malicious Mocks [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2_3_1__replace_legitimate_dependencies_with_malicious_mocks__high-risk_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [2.3.1.1. Force the application to use a mock that always returns a specific value, bypassing security checks.](./attack_tree_paths/2_3_1_1__force_the_application_to_use_a_mock_that_always_returns_a_specific_value__bypassing_securit_08f146c3.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker replaces a legitimate dependency with a malicious mock object. This mock is designed to always return a specific value, regardless of the actual input or the behavior of the real dependency. This can be used to bypass security checks or force the application into a specific state that hides vulnerabilities.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium to High (Bypassing security checks)
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
