# Threat Model Analysis for quick/quick

## Threat: [Threat: Production Environment Execution](./threats/threat_production_environment_execution.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker, or a careless developer, configures Quick tests to run against the production environment instead of the designated testing environment.  This could involve manipulating environment variables, CI/CD pipeline configurations, or directly modifying test code (specifically, the parts that configure the test environment or target) to point to production endpoints or databases.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption or loss in the production database, unintended exposure of sensitive production data (leading to data breaches), service disruption for real users, potential financial and reputational damage, legal and compliance violations.
*   **Quick Component Affected:** `QuickConfiguration` subclasses, `beforeEach` and `afterEach` blocks (where environment setup and teardown are handled), test target configuration within the Xcode project, and any custom helper functions that determine the environment.  Nimble matchers are indirectly affected, as they operate within this context.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **a.**  *Strict Environment Checks:* Within `beforeEach` blocks, *assert* that an environment variable (e.g., `TEST_ENVIRONMENT`) is set to a specific, expected value (e.g., `"true"` or `"testing"`).  Fail the test immediately if this check fails.
    *   **b.**  *CI/CD Pipeline Safeguards:* Implement robust CI/CD pipeline controls:
        *   Restrict test execution to specific branches (e.g., `develop`, `feature/*`).
        *   Use separate pipeline stages for different environments (testing, staging, production).
        *   Require explicit manual approval gates *before* any deployment or test execution against production.
    *   **c.**  *Extensive Mocking and Stubbing:* Use Nimble (or other mocking frameworks) to *completely isolate* tests from external dependencies.  Mock all network requests, database interactions, and any other external service calls.  This prevents any accidental interaction with real systems.
    *   **d.**  *Clear Naming Conventions:* Use distinct and unambiguous names for test environment configurations (e.g., `ProductionConfig`, `TestingConfig`, `StagingConfig`).  Avoid generic names that could be easily confused.
    *   **e.** *"Fail-Fast" Design:* Ensure that tests fail *immediately and clearly* if the environment is incorrectly configured.  Provide informative error messages to help developers quickly identify the problem.

## Threat: [Threat: Test Data Leakage](./threats/threat_test_data_leakage.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to sensitive data that is used or generated during Quick test execution. This could happen if tests directly use real Personally Identifiable Information (PII), API keys, authentication tokens, or other confidential information.  The leakage could occur through test logs, error messages, exposed test artifacts, or even through the test results themselves if they are not properly secured.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, violation of privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA), reputational damage, potential financial losses, legal liabilities.
*   **Quick Component Affected:** `it`, `describe`, `context` blocks (where test data is used and manipulated), `beforeEach` and `afterEach` blocks (responsible for data setup and cleanup), any logging statements within tests, and custom helper functions that handle sensitive data. Nimble matchers that might display or log data are also relevant.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **a.**  *Never Use Real Sensitive Data:* This is the most crucial mitigation.  *Strictly prohibit* the use of real PII, API keys, or other confidential information in tests.
    *   **b.**  *Synthetic Data Generation:* Use libraries or custom functions to generate realistic but *synthetic* test data.  This data should mimic the structure and format of real data but contain no actual sensitive information.
    *   **c.**  *Data Anonymization/Pseudonymization:* If you must use data derived from real sources, employ robust anonymization or pseudonymization techniques to remove or replace identifying information.
    *   **d.**  *Secure Data Cleanup:* Implement thorough data cleanup procedures in `afterEach` blocks.  Ensure that any temporary data created during tests is securely deleted or overwritten.
    *   **e.**  *Log Sanitization:* Carefully review and sanitize test logs and error messages.  Use a logging framework that supports redaction or masking of sensitive data.  Avoid logging sensitive values directly.
    *   **f.**  *Secure Credential Storage:* If tests require credentials (e.g., for interacting with mock services), store them *securely* using environment variables or a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).  *Never* hardcode credentials in test code.
    *   **g.** *Encryption:* If, in exceptional cases, sensitive test data cannot be avoided, encrypt it both at rest (e.g., in temporary files or databases) and in transit (e.g., during network communication within tests).

## Threat: [Threat: Vulnerable Quick/Nimble Dependency](./threats/threat_vulnerable_quicknimble_dependency.md)

* **Description:** An attacker exploits a known (or zero-day) vulnerability within the Quick framework itself, or more likely, within its core dependency, Nimble. This vulnerability could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the test execution environment, potentially leading to further compromise.
* **Impact:** Varies significantly depending on the specific vulnerability. Could range from denial-of-service attacks against the test environment to complete remote code execution (RCE), allowing the attacker to potentially gain control of the test infrastructure and potentially move laterally to other systems.
* **Quick Component Affected:** The entire Quick and Nimble framework; any part could be vulnerable.
* **Risk Severity:** High (can escalate to Critical depending on the vulnerability's nature)
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **a.** *Regular Updates:* Keep Quick and Nimble updated to the *latest* versions. Use Swift Package Manager (or your chosen dependency manager) to manage updates and ensure you are using patched versions.
    * **b.** *Dependency Scanning:* Employ automated dependency scanning tools (e.g., Dependabot, Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check). These tools automatically identify known vulnerabilities in your project's dependencies, including Quick and Nimble, and provide alerts and remediation guidance.
    * **c.** *Security Advisories:* Actively monitor security advisories and mailing lists related to Quick, Nimble, and the broader Swift ecosystem (e.g., the Swift Security Updates mailing list, GitHub security advisories for the Quick and Nimble repositories).
    * **d.** *SBOM (Software Bill of Materials):* Consider using an SBOM to maintain a comprehensive and up-to-date inventory of all dependencies and their versions. This helps with tracking and managing vulnerabilities.
