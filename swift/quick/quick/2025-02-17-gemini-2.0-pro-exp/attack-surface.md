# Attack Surface Analysis for quick/quick

## Attack Surface: [1. Accidental Inclusion of Test Code in Production](./attack_surfaces/1__accidental_inclusion_of_test_code_in_production.md)

*   **Description:** Quick test code (specs) intended only for development/testing is unintentionally included in the production build. This is the most direct and severe risk.
*   **How Quick Contributes:** Quick *is* the framework used to write these tests. The presence of `QuickSpec` subclasses, `describe`, `it`, `context`, `beforeEach`, `afterEach` blocks, and Quick-specific assertions directly indicates the presence of test code.
*   **Example:** A `QuickSpec` subclass containing tests for database interactions, including hardcoded database credentials for a test database, is accidentally included in the production application.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** (Critical) Exposure of credentials, API keys, internal API endpoints, database schemas, and sensitive test data.
    *   **Potential for Code Execution:** (High) If test code interacts with external systems (databases, APIs), and those interactions are not properly secured in the test code itself, an attacker could potentially trigger unintended actions.
    *   **Denial of Service:** (High) Resource-intensive tests (e.g., those designed to test performance limits) could be triggered in production, leading to a DoS.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Build Configuration:** This is the *primary* defense.  Use build system features (Xcode schemes, Gradle, etc.) to *absolutely ensure* that test targets and source files are *excluded* from production builds.  There should be a clear separation.
    *   **CI/CD Pipeline Checks:** The CI/CD pipeline must *actively prevent* deployment of builds containing test code. Implement checks that *fail the build* if Quick-related code is detected (e.g., using `grep` or similar tools to search for `QuickSpec`, `describe`, `it`, etc.). This is a crucial second layer of defense.
    *   **Automated Artifact Scanning:** Before deployment, *scan the final build artifact* (IPA, APK, etc.) for the presence of Quick code. This is a final "safety net" to catch any errors in the build process or CI/CD configuration.
    *   **Code Reviews:** Mandatory code reviews *must* include a specific check for any accidental inclusion of test code in production-bound files.  This relies on human vigilance, but is still important.

## Attack Surface: [2. Insecure Mocking/Stubbing Practices (Leading to Production Inclusion)](./attack_surfaces/2__insecure_mockingstubbing_practices__leading_to_production_inclusion_.md)

*   **Description:** Mocks and stubs created for use with Quick are implemented insecurely, and *due to a build misconfiguration or code reuse*, these insecure mocks end up being used in the production environment. This is a high risk because it directly bypasses security mechanisms.
*   **How Quick Contributes:** Quick strongly encourages the use of mocks and stubs for test isolation. While Quick doesn't dictate *how* to implement them, the framework's prevalence in the testing process makes this a relevant attack surface. The risk arises when these mocks, intended only for testing, are *accidentally used in production*.
*   **Example:** A mock authentication service used in a Quick test always returns `true` for any login attempt (to simplify testing). If this mock is *inadvertently* included and used in the production code (due to a shared code module or a build error), it completely disables authentication.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Bypass of Security Controls:** (Critical) Authentication, authorization, and other security checks can be completely bypassed if insecure mocks are used in production.
    *   **Data Leakage:** (High) Mocks might handle or expose sensitive data in an insecure way.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (Approaches Critical if authentication/authorization is bypassed)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Realistic Mocks:** Design mocks to *closely* resemble the behavior of the real components, *including security checks*. Avoid "always successful" or overly permissive mocks. This reduces the impact even if a mock is accidentally included.
    *   **Secure Mock Configuration:** Never hardcode sensitive data (credentials, API keys) within mock implementations. Use environment variables or configuration files that are *strictly excluded* from production builds.
    *   **Code Reviews (Focus on Mocks):** Treat mock implementations with the *same level of security scrutiny* as production code during code reviews. Specifically look for potential bypasses of security mechanisms.
    *   **Strict Build Separation (Again):** The most effective mitigation is, again, to *prevent any test-related code, including mocks, from being included in production builds*. This reinforces the importance of the build configuration and CI/CD checks. The insecure mock is only a problem *if it ends up in production*.
