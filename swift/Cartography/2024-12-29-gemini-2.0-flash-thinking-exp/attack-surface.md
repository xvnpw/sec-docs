* **Data Source Credential Exposure**
    * **Description:**  Sensitive credentials (API keys, access tokens, passwords) required by Cartography to access various cloud providers and services are exposed or compromised.
    * **How Cartography Contributes:** Cartography necessitates the storage and management of these credentials to perform its data collection tasks. Insecure storage or handling of these credentials directly increases the attack surface.
    * **Example:** API keys for AWS, Azure, or GCP are hardcoded in Cartography configuration files or stored as plain text environment variables accessible to unauthorized users.
    * **Impact:** Attackers can use the compromised credentials to gain unauthorized access to the organization's cloud resources, potentially leading to data breaches, resource manipulation, or service disruption.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Utilize secure credential management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault).
        * Avoid hardcoding credentials in configuration files or code.
        * Employ environment variables with restricted access permissions.
        * Implement the principle of least privilege for Cartography's access to data sources.
        * Regularly rotate credentials.

* **Neo4j Database Exposure**
    * **Description:** The Neo4j database used by Cartography to store collected infrastructure data is accessible to unauthorized individuals or systems.
    * **How Cartography Contributes:** Cartography's primary function is to populate this database, making its security a direct concern. Misconfiguration or lack of security measures on the Neo4j instance exposes the data collected by Cartography.
    * **Example:** The Neo4j instance is exposed to the public internet with default credentials, allowing attackers to access and potentially exfiltrate sensitive infrastructure information.
    * **Impact:** Attackers can gain access to detailed information about the organization's infrastructure, including network topology, resource configurations, and potential vulnerabilities. This information can be used for further attacks or sold on the dark web. Data within Neo4j could also be manipulated, leading to inaccurate security assessments.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Secure the Neo4j instance by placing it behind a firewall and restricting access to authorized networks and users.
        * Enforce strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for Neo4j.
        * Avoid using default credentials for Neo4j.
        * Regularly update Neo4j to patch known vulnerabilities.
        * Consider encrypting data at rest and in transit for the Neo4j database.

* **Privilege Escalation on the Cartography Host**
    * **Description:** A vulnerability in Cartography or its dependencies could be exploited to gain higher privileges on the system where Cartography is running.
    * **How Cartography Contributes:** If Cartography runs with overly broad permissions, a successful exploit could grant the attacker significant control over the host system.
    * **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability in a Cartography dependency allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Cartography process, which has unnecessary root access.
    * **Impact:** Attackers can gain full control of the Cartography host, potentially using it as a pivot point to attack other systems on the network or to exfiltrate sensitive data.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Run the Cartography process with the minimum necessary privileges (principle of least privilege).
        * Implement proper system hardening and security controls on the host running Cartography.
        * Regularly update the operating system and other software on the host.
        * Isolate the Cartography environment using containers or virtual machines.
