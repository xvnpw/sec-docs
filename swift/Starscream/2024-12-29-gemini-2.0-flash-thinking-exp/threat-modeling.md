### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving Starscream

Here's an updated list of high and critical threats that directly involve the Starscream WebSocket library:

* **Threat:** Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack due to Insufficient TLS Validation
    * **Description:** An attacker intercepts the communication between the client and the WebSocket server. This is possible if Starscream doesn't properly validate the server's TLS certificate, allowing the attacker to eavesdrop on and potentially modify the data exchanged.
    * **Impact:** Confidential data transmitted over the WebSocket connection can be exposed to the attacker. Modified data can lead to application malfunction or security breaches.
    * **Affected Starscream Component:** Starscream's TLS Implementation (specifically the socket handling and certificate validation logic).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Ensure proper TLS certificate validation is enabled in Starscream's configuration.
        * Consider implementing certificate pinning to restrict accepted certificates to a known set.
        * Enforce the use of `wss://` for secure WebSocket connections.

* **Threat:** Downgrade Attack to Unencrypted WebSocket
    * **Description:** An attacker attempts to force the WebSocket connection to use the unencrypted `ws://` protocol instead of the secure `wss://`. This could happen if Starscream's connection negotiation doesn't strictly enforce the secure version.
    * **Impact:** All communication over the WebSocket connection becomes unencrypted and vulnerable to eavesdropping and manipulation.
    * **Affected Starscream Component:** Starscream's connection negotiation and protocol selection logic.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Explicitly configure Starscream to only use `wss://` and reject `ws://` connections.

* **Threat:** Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities in Starscream
    * **Description:**  Starscream itself might contain publicly known vulnerabilities that could be exploited by a malicious server or attacker.
    * **Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the specific vulnerability, including remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.
    * **Affected Starscream Component:** Any part of the Starscream library depending on the specific vulnerability.
    * **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update Starscream to the latest stable version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        * Monitor Starscream's GitHub repository, issue tracker, and security advisories for reported vulnerabilities.

* **Threat:** Dependency Vulnerabilities
    * **Description:** Starscream relies on other libraries that contain vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could be indirectly exploitable through Starscream.
    * **Impact:** Similar to known vulnerabilities in Starscream itself.
    * **Affected Starscream Component:** Indirectly affects Starscream through its dependencies.
    * **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update all dependencies of Starscream.
        * Use dependency management tools that can identify and alert on known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
