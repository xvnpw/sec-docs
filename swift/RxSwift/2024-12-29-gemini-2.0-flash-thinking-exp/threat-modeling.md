### High and Critical RxSwift Threats

Here's a list of high and critical threats that directly involve RxSwift components:

*   **Threat:** Unintended Data Exposure through Shared Observables
    *   **Description:** An attacker might gain access to sensitive data by intercepting or observing a shared observable stream that was intended for a different component with higher privileges. This occurs due to the inherent sharing mechanism of RxSwift observables, where a single stream can be subscribed to by multiple observers with varying security contexts. Lack of proper access control on these shared streams can lead to unauthorized data access.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, potential regulatory violations, reputational damage.
    *   **RxSwift Component Affected:** `Observable`, specifically shared instances (e.g., using `share()`, `publish().refCount()`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement fine-grained access control mechanisms *within* the reactive streams to restrict data flow based on component or user roles. This might involve using operators to filter or transform data before it reaches less privileged observers.
        *   Avoid sharing observables containing sensitive data across components with different security requirements. Consider creating separate, more specific observables for different contexts.
        *   Carefully review the sharing strategy of observables and ensure it aligns with security requirements.

*   **Threat:** Side Effects in Observable Pipelines Leading to Unauthorized Actions
    *   **Description:** An attacker might trigger unintended side effects with security implications by manipulating data flowing through an observable pipeline. If actions like database writes or API calls are performed directly within the pipeline's reactive flow without proper authorization checks *at the point of execution within the stream*, an attacker could exploit this by influencing the data stream.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized data modification, privilege escalation, potential for external system compromise.
    *   **RxSwift Component Affected:** `Observable` pipelines using operators like `do(onNext:)`, `subscribe(onNext:)` where side effects are performed within the reactive flow.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Decouple side effects from the core data processing logic within observable pipelines. Perform authorization checks *before* the side effect is executed within the stream.
        *   Use dedicated services or components *outside* the main reactive flow to handle actions with security implications, ensuring proper authorization and auditing before invoking these services from the stream.
        *   Avoid directly performing sensitive operations within `do` or `subscribe` blocks without explicit authorization logic within the stream.

*   **Threat:** Data Injection through Unsecured Subjects
    *   **Description:** An attacker might inject malicious data or commands into an application by directly publishing values to a `Subject` that is not properly secured or validated. Since `Subjects` act as both observers and observables within the RxSwift framework, they can be direct entry points for external, potentially malicious, data into the application's reactive streams.
    *   **Impact:** Code injection, command injection, denial of service, data corruption.
    *   **RxSwift Component Affected:** `Subject` types (e.g., `PublishSubject`, `BehaviorSubject`, `ReplaySubject`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Treat all input received through `Subjects` as untrusted and implement robust input validation and sanitization *immediately* upon receiving data through the subject.
        *   Restrict access to `Subjects` that are used for internal communication and avoid exposing them directly to external input without strict control.
        *   Consider using more controlled and type-safe mechanisms for inter-component communication if direct subject access poses a significant risk.

*   **Threat:** Data Corruption due to Incorrect Threading
    *   **Description:** An attacker might induce data corruption by exploiting scenarios where shared mutable state is accessed and modified concurrently from different threads managed by RxSwift schedulers without proper synchronization. The asynchronous nature of RxSwift, combined with the flexibility of schedulers, can create opportunities for race conditions if shared state is not carefully managed.
    *   **Impact:** Data integrity compromise, application malfunction, unpredictable behavior.
    *   **RxSwift Component Affected:** `Scheduler` and concurrent operations on shared state managed within RxSwift workflows.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure thread-safety of shared mutable data accessed within RxSwift workflows.
        *   Use appropriate schedulers to serialize access to critical resources when necessary.
        *   Employ synchronization primitives (locks, semaphores) when dealing with shared mutable state accessed from different RxSwift managed threads.
        *   Favor immutable data structures and reactive patterns that minimize the need for shared mutable state.
