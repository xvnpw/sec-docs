## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Network Requests via Alamofire](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_network_requests_via_alamofire.md)

* Attack Vectors:
    * URL Injection:
        * Description: Attacker manipulates the URL passed to Alamofire's request methods, causing the application to send requests to unintended destinations.
        * How: Exploiting insufficient input validation or improper URL construction when using user-supplied data or external configurations.
        * Likelihood: Medium
        * Impact: High
        * Effort: Low
        * Skill Level: Novice/Intermediate
        * Detection Difficulty: Medium
    * Header Injection:
        * Description: Attacker injects malicious headers into requests made by Alamofire.
        * How: Exploiting insufficient validation of header values provided by users or external sources. This can lead to various attacks like HTTP Response Splitting or bypassing security controls.
        * Likelihood: Medium
        * Impact: Medium/High
        * Effort: Low/Medium
        * Skill Level: Intermediate
        * Detection Difficulty: Medium
    * Request Body Manipulation (if applicable):
        * Description: Attacker manipulates the request body sent by Alamofire.
        * How: Exploiting vulnerabilities where the application doesn't properly sanitize or validate data used to construct the request body (e.g., JSON, form data). This can lead to server-side vulnerabilities.
        * Likelihood: Medium
        * Impact: High
        * Effort: Low/Medium
        * Skill Level: Intermediate
        * Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit TLS Implementation Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_tls_implementation_weaknesses.md)

* Attack Vectors:
    * Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack due to Improper Certificate Validation:
        * Description: Attacker intercepts network traffic by exploiting weaknesses in the application's TLS certificate validation when using Alamofire.
        * How:
            * Disabling certificate validation for development and forgetting to re-enable it in production.
            * Improperly implementing custom ServerTrustPolicy, leading to bypasses.
            * Not using certificate pinning when communicating with critical servers.
        * Likelihood: Medium
        * Impact: Critical
        * Effort: Medium/High
        * Skill Level: Intermediate/Advanced
        * Detection Difficulty: Difficult

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Data Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_data_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

* Attack Vectors:
    * Insecure Deserialization of Response Data:
        * Description: Attacker crafts malicious response data that, when deserialized by the application using Alamofire's response handling, leads to code execution or other vulnerabilities.
        * How:
            * Using insecure deserialization methods.
            * Trusting untrusted data sources without proper validation before deserialization.
        * Likelihood: Low/Medium
        * Impact: Critical
        * Effort: High
        * Skill Level: Advanced/Expert
        * Detection Difficulty: Difficult
