    *   **Location:**  `Podfile` in the project root directory.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **None:** Dependency management for Alamofire is already fully implemented using CocoaPods.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce HTTPS for All Requests (using Alamofire)](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_https_for_all_requests__using_alamofire_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce HTTPS for All Requests (using Alamofire)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Default Configuration (Alamofire):** Configure Alamofire's `Session` or `SessionManager` to default to HTTPS for all requests. This can be achieved by explicitly specifying `https://` in all URL strings used with Alamofire or by using URL components to construct URLs for Alamofire requests.
    2.  **Code Review (Alamofire Usage):** Implement code review processes to ensure that developers are consistently using HTTPS when making requests with Alamofire and not inadvertently making HTTP requests.
    3.  **Network Interception (Optional):**  In development and testing environments, consider using network interception tools to actively detect and flag any HTTP requests being made by the application *via Alamofire*.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks (High Severity):** HTTP traffic made by Alamofire is unencrypted and can be intercepted and modified by attackers on the network.
    *   **Eavesdropping (High Severity):** Sensitive data transmitted over HTTP via Alamofire can be easily eavesdropped upon by attackers.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks (High Impact):**  Significantly reduces the risk for requests made with Alamofire by encrypting all communication, making it much harder for attackers to intercept or modify data.
    *   **Eavesdropping (High Impact):**  Significantly reduces the risk for requests made with Alamofire by encrypting data in transit, protecting confidentiality.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented:**  Most network requests made with Alamofire are over HTTPS, but there's no systematic enforcement or automated checks specifically for Alamofire usage. Developers are generally aware of using HTTPS with Alamofire.
    *   **Location:**  Ad-hoc implementation across different network modules using Alamofire.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Systematic Enforcement for Alamofire:** Lack of a systematic way to enforce HTTPS usage for all Alamofire requests across the entire application.
    *   **Automated Checks for Alamofire:** No automated checks or linting rules to detect accidental HTTP requests made with Alamofire.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Proper Certificate Pinning (If Necessary) using Alamofire](./mitigation_strategies/implement_proper_certificate_pinning__if_necessary__using_alamofire.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Proper Certificate Pinning (If Necessary) using Alamofire
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose Pinning Strategy:** Decide on a certificate pinning strategy (e.g., public key pinning, certificate pinning, hostname pinning). Public key pinning is generally recommended for better flexibility.
    2.  **Obtain Server Certificates/Public Keys:** Obtain the correct server certificates or public keys from the server administrators or by securely retrieving them from the server itself during a trusted initial connection.
    3.  **Configure Alamofire Server Trust Evaluation:** Utilize Alamofire's `ServerTrustManager` and `ServerTrustPolicy` to implement custom server trust evaluation for requests made with Alamofire. Configure the policy to pin the obtained certificates or public keys.
    4.  **Handle Pinning Failures (Alamofire):** Implement robust error handling for certificate pinning failures within Alamofire request handling. Decide on an appropriate action when pinning fails (e.g., fail the request, display a warning to the user, fallback to system trust).
    5.  **Certificate Rotation Plan:** Develop a plan for certificate rotation and how to update pinned certificates in the application when server certificates are renewed, ensuring Alamofire's pinning configuration is updated. This is crucial to avoid application breakage during certificate renewals when using Alamofire.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks via Compromised Certificate Authorities (High Severity):** Certificate pinning with Alamofire mitigates MITM attacks even if a Certificate Authority is compromised or coerced into issuing fraudulent certificates for connections made by Alamofire.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks via Compromised Certificate Authorities (High Impact):** Provides a strong defense against advanced MITM attacks for Alamofire requests, significantly increasing security for highly sensitive applications using Alamofire.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Not Implemented:** Certificate pinning is not currently implemented in the project for Alamofire requests.
    *   **Location:** N/A
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **All Areas using Alamofire for sensitive APIs:** Certificate pinning needs to be implemented for all network requests made with Alamofire to sensitive APIs.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Carefully Configure Caching Policies (in Alamofire Context)](./mitigation_strategies/carefully_configure_caching_policies__in_alamofire_context_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Carefully Configure Caching Policies (in Alamofire Context)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Caching Needs:** Carefully assess the application's caching requirements in the context of API requests made with Alamofire. Determine which API responses obtained via Alamofire are safe and beneficial to cache and which should not be cached due to sensitivity or volatility.
    2.  **Configure `URLCache` (via Alamofire):** Configure Alamofire's underlying `URLCache` to control caching behavior for requests made with Alamofire. Set appropriate cache policies (e.g., `.useProtocolCachePolicy`, `.returnCacheDataElseLoad`, `.reloadIgnoringLocalCacheData`) that Alamofire will utilize.
    3.  **Disable Caching for Sensitive Data (via Alamofire):** Explicitly disable caching for API requests made with Alamofire that handle sensitive data (e.g., authentication tokens, personal information). Use `URLRequest` cache policies to override default caching behavior for specific requests made through Alamofire.
    4.  **Cache Invalidation:** Implement mechanisms to invalidate cached data obtained via Alamofire when it becomes outdated or when sensitive data needs to be purged from the cache managed by Alamofire.
    5.  **Secure Cache Storage (If Applicable):** If caching sensitive data obtained via Alamofire is absolutely necessary (which is generally discouraged), ensure that the cache storage itself is secure and protected from unauthorized access, considering Alamofire's usage of `URLCache`.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exposure of Cached Sensitive Data (Medium to High Severity depending on data sensitivity):**  Inappropriately cached sensitive data obtained via Alamofire can be exposed if the cache is compromised or accessed by unauthorized users.
    *   **Stale Data Issues (Low to Medium Severity):**  Aggressively caching dynamic data obtained via Alamofire can lead to users seeing outdated information.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exposure of Cached Sensitive Data (Medium to High Impact):** Reduces the risk of data exposure by controlling what data obtained via Alamofire is cached and how it's cached.
    *   **Stale Data Issues (Low to Medium Impact):** Balances caching benefits with data freshness by configuring appropriate cache policies for Alamofire requests.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Default Caching:**  Default `URLCache` settings are used, without specific configuration for security or data sensitivity in the context of Alamofire requests.
    *   **Location:** Default iOS system caching used by Alamofire.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Cache Policy Review and Configuration for Alamofire:** Need to review default caching policies and configure `URLCache` and `URLRequest` cache policies based on data sensitivity and application requirements for requests made with Alamofire.
    *   **Sensitive Data Caching Prevention for Alamofire:** Implement measures to prevent caching of sensitive API responses obtained via Alamofire.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Review Custom `Session` Configurations (in Alamofire)](./mitigation_strategies/review_custom__session__configurations__in_alamofire_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Document Custom Configurations:** Document all custom `Session` or `SessionManager` configurations used in the application with Alamofire.
    2.  **Security Review:** Conduct a security review of all custom Alamofire `Session` configurations, paying close attention to settings related to TLS, proxies, server trust evaluation, and any custom security policies defined within Alamofire's `Session`.
    3.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that custom Alamofire `Session` configurations only enable necessary features and do not unnecessarily weaken security settings within Alamofire.
    4.  **Regular Review:** Regularly review custom Alamofire `Session` configurations, especially when updating Alamofire or making changes to network infrastructure that might affect Alamofire's behavior.
    5.  **Justify Customizations:** For each custom Alamofire `Session` configuration, document the justification for the customization and its intended purpose within the context of Alamofire usage.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Weakened Security Posture due to Misconfiguration of Alamofire `Session` (Medium to High Severity depending on misconfiguration):**  Incorrectly configured Alamofire `Session` settings can weaken the security of network communication performed by Alamofire, potentially introducing vulnerabilities.
    *   **Unintended Security Implications of Alamofire `Session` Customizations (Medium Severity):**  Custom Alamofire `Session` configurations might have unintended security consequences if not thoroughly reviewed and understood in the context of Alamofire's networking operations.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Weakened Security Posture due to Misconfiguration of Alamofire `Session` (Medium to High Impact):** Reduces the risk of misconfiguration by ensuring careful review and documentation of custom Alamofire `Session` settings.
    *   **Unintended Security Implications of Alamofire `Session` Customizations (Medium Impact):** Reduces the risk of unintended consequences by promoting thorough understanding and justification of customizations made to Alamofire `Session`.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Not Implemented:** We are using the default Alamofire `Session` configuration in most cases, but there are a few instances where custom configurations might have been introduced without proper documentation or review.
    *   **Location:** Potentially in some network utility classes or specific feature modules that utilize custom Alamofire `Session` setups.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Configuration Documentation for Alamofire `Session`:** Document all custom Alamofire `Session` configurations.
    *   **Security Review Process for Alamofire `Session`:** Implement a process for security review of custom Alamofire `Session` configurations.
    *   **Configuration Justification for Alamofire `Session`:** Document the justification for each custom Alamofire `Session` configuration.
