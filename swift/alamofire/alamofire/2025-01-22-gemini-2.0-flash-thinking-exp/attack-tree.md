                    *   **Network Traffic Monitoring:** Monitor network traffic to identify and eliminate any HTTP communication involving sensitive data.

                    *   **4.1.2.a Application uses HTTP for communication when HTTPS should be used, exposing data in transit. [CRITICAL]**
                        *   **Vulnerability:** The application is configured or coded to use HTTP for network requests that should be using HTTPS, particularly when sensitive data is involved.
                        *   **Description:** This is a fundamental security flaw. Using HTTP for sensitive data transmits it in plaintext, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping.
                        *   **Exploitation Method:** As described in 4.1.2, attackers can passively intercept HTTP traffic.
                        *   **Potential Impact:** High - Data exposure, credential theft.
                        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
                            *   **Code Review:** Thorough code review to identify and replace all HTTP requests for sensitive data with HTTPS requests.
                            *   **API Endpoint Review:** Review API endpoint configurations to ensure all sensitive endpoints are configured for HTTPS.
                            *   **Network Security Policy:** Implement a network security policy that mandates HTTPS for all sensitive data transmission.

    *   **4.2 Improper Handling of Authentication/Authorization [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Attack Name:** Improper Authentication/Authorization Handling
        *   **Description:** Developers mishandle authentication and authorization mechanisms in conjunction with Alamofire, leading to unauthorized access and potential compromise.
        *   **Exploitation Method:** Attackers exploit weaknesses in authentication or authorization logic to gain unauthorized access to resources or perform actions they are not permitted to.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Unauthorized access to data, account compromise, privilege escalation, data manipulation.
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
            *   **Secure Credential Storage:** Store API keys and tokens securely using platform-provided secure storage mechanisms (e.g., Keychain).
            *   **Robust Server-Side Authorization:** Implement strong authorization checks on the server-side to verify user permissions.
            *   **Authentication/Authorization Review:** Regularly review authentication and authorization implementation for weaknesses.

            *   **4.2.1 Storing API Keys/Tokens insecurely and using them in Alamofire requests. [CRITICAL]**
                *   **Attack Name:** Insecure Credential Storage
                *   **Description:** API keys, authentication tokens, or other credentials are stored insecurely within the application (e.g., hardcoded in code, stored in plain text files, or easily accessible locations) and then used in Alamofire requests.
                *   **Exploitation Method:** Attackers extract the insecurely stored credentials through code review, decompilation, file system access, or other means.
                *   **Potential Impact:** Account compromise, unauthorized API access, data breaches, financial loss.
                *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
                    *   **Secure Storage:** Use platform-provided secure storage mechanisms like Keychain to store credentials.
                    *   **Avoid Hardcoding:** Never hardcode credentials directly in the application code.
                    *   **Credential Management Policy:** Implement a strict credential management policy that prohibits insecure storage of credentials.

                    *   **4.2.1.a API keys or tokens are hardcoded, stored in easily accessible locations, or logged, making them vulnerable to extraction. [CRITICAL]**
                        *   **Vulnerability:** API keys or tokens are stored in a way that is easily accessible to attackers, such as hardcoding them in the source code, storing them in plain text files within the application bundle, or logging them.
                        *   **Description:** This is a very common and critical vulnerability. Insecurely stored credentials are easily discovered and exploited.
                        *   **Exploitation Method:** As described in 4.2.1, attackers can extract these credentials through various methods.
                        *   **Potential Impact:** High - Account compromise, unauthorized API access.
                        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
                            *   **Secure Storage API:** Utilize secure storage APIs provided by the platform (e.g., Keychain).
                            *   **Environment Variables/Configuration Files:** If configuration files are used, ensure they are securely stored and not easily accessible.
                            *   **Code Scanning:** Use static code analysis tools to scan for hardcoded credentials.
                            *   **Developer Training:** Educate developers on secure credential management practices.
