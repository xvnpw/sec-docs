# Attack Surface Analysis for alamofire/alamofire

## Attack Surface: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks via Insecure Server Trust Evaluation](./attack_surfaces/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_via_insecure_server_trust_evaluation.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts the communication between the client application and the server, potentially reading or modifying data in transit. This is possible due to improper handling of server certificates.

**Alamofire Contribution:** Alamofire's `ServerTrustManager` (and related APIs like `ServerTrustEvaluating`) is *directly* responsible for handling server trust evaluation (certificate validation).  If misconfigured (e.g., using the default, which trusts all certificates) or not used at all, Alamofire will allow connections to servers with invalid or malicious certificates, enabling MitM attacks. This is a *direct* consequence of how Alamofire is configured.

**Example:** An attacker sets up a fake Wi-Fi hotspot with a self-signed certificate. An application using Alamofire with a default or improperly configured `ServerTrustManager` connects to the hotspot. Alamofire, *due to its configuration*, accepts the fake certificate, allowing the attacker to intercept and decrypt the traffic.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of communication confidentiality and integrity. The attacker can steal credentials, session tokens, and any other data exchanged. They can also inject malicious data.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Certificate Pinning:** Implement robust certificate pinning using Alamofire's `ServerTrustManager`. Pin to the specific certificate or public key of the legitimate server. This is the *primary* defense and is directly implemented using Alamofire's APIs.
*   **Multiple Evaluators:** Use a combination of evaluators (e.g., `PublicKeysTrustEvaluator` and `RevocationTrustEvaluator`) within Alamofire's `ServerTrustManager` to enhance security.
*   **Regular Updates:** Regularly update the pinned certificates before they expire.
*   **Never Disable Validation:** *Never* disable certificate validation in production builds. This is a crucial configuration setting within Alamofire.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Redirect Handling](./attack_surfaces/insecure_redirect_handling.md)

**Description:** An attacker redirects the application's requests to a malicious server, potentially intercepting sensitive data or causing other harm.

**Alamofire Contribution:** Alamofire, *by default*, automatically follows HTTP redirects. This behavior is a *direct* feature of Alamofire. If the application doesn't use Alamofire's `redirectHandler` to validate the target URL of redirects, Alamofire will blindly follow them, even to malicious destinations.

**Example:** An application uses Alamofire to access `https://example.com/api/data`. An attacker injects a redirect response that points to `https://evil.com/fake-api`. Because Alamofire follows redirects by default, and without a `redirectHandler`, the request (and any associated data) is sent to `evil.com`.

**Impact:** The attacker can intercept and potentially modify requests and responses. This can lead to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **`redirectHandler`:** *Must* use Alamofire's `redirectHandler` to inspect and control redirect behavior. This is the *primary* mitigation and is a direct use of Alamofire's API.
*   **URL Validation:** Within the `redirectHandler`, rigorously validate the target URL of *every* redirect. Check that it matches the expected domain and path structure. This validation logic is implemented *within* the Alamofire `redirectHandler`.
*   **Whitelist:** Maintain a whitelist of allowed redirect domains, and check against this list within the `redirectHandler`.
*   **Limit Redirects:** Limit the maximum number of redirects allowed, a setting configurable within the `redirectHandler`.
