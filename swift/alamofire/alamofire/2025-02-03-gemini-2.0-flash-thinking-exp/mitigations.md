# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for alamofire/alamofire

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement TLS/SSL Pinning](./mitigation_strategies/implement_tlsssl_pinning.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose Pinning Strategy:** Decide between certificate pinning (pinning the entire certificate) or public key pinning (pinning only the public key). Public key pinning is generally recommended for better certificate rotation flexibility.
    2.  **Obtain Server Certificate/Public Key:** Retrieve the correct certificate or public key from your server. Ensure you are getting it from a trusted source and not through an insecure channel.
    3.  **Configure Alamofire Server Trust Policy:** Use Alamofire's `ServerTrustManager` and `PinnedCertificatesTrustEvaluator` or `PublicKeysTrustEvaluator` to implement pinning within your Alamofire request configurations. This involves creating a `ServerTrustManager` instance and associating it with your `Session` or individual requests.
    4.  **Embed Pins in Application:** Include the obtained certificates or public keys within your application bundle as resources.
    5.  **Handle Pinning Failures:** Implement proper error handling within your Alamofire request completion handlers to detect pinning failures. Decide on a strategy for what happens when pinning fails (e.g., cancel the request, display an error message to the user, fallback to standard certificate validation - with extreme caution and only for specific, controlled scenarios).
    6.  **Certificate Rotation Plan:** Develop a plan for how to update pinned certificates or public keys when server certificates are rotated to avoid application breakage. This includes a process for updating the embedded pins in your application and deploying updates.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, even with compromised Certificate Authorities (Severity: High).
    *   Bypassing standard certificate validation due to compromised or rogue CAs (Severity: High).
*   **Impact:**
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks: High risk reduction, especially against advanced attacks.
    *   Bypassing standard certificate validation: High risk reduction.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   No, TLS/SSL pinning is not currently implemented in the application's Alamofire usage. Standard certificate validation, which is the default behavior of Alamofire, is relied upon.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   TLS/SSL pinning is missing for all network requests made using Alamofire.  We are not leveraging Alamofire's `ServerTrustManager` and `PinnedCertificatesTrustEvaluator`/`PublicKeysTrustEvaluator` to enforce certificate or public key pinning.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Review and Configure `ServerTrustManager`](./mitigation_strategies/review_and_configure__servertrustmanager_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Audit Existing `ServerTrustManager` Usage:** If you are already using custom `ServerTrustManager` configurations in your Alamofire setup, thoroughly review the code where `ServerTrustManager` is instantiated and configured.
    2.  **Verify Validation Logic:** Ensure that any custom logic within your `ServerTrustManager` correctly validates server certificates according to your security requirements. Check for any weaknesses or bypasses in the validation process that might have been unintentionally introduced.
    3.  **Avoid Disabling Validation:** Strictly avoid disabling certificate validation entirely within your `ServerTrustManager` configuration unless absolutely necessary for specific, controlled scenarios (like testing environments). If disabling is required, ensure it is not present in production builds and is clearly documented with justification in the code.
    4.  **Use Standard Evaluators When Possible:** Prefer using Alamofire's built-in `ServerTrustEvaluator` implementations (like `PinnedCertificatesTrustEvaluator`, `PublicKeysTrustEvaluator`, `RevocationTrustEvaluator`, `DefaultTrustEvaluator`) within your `ServerTrustManager` whenever possible. These are well-tested and designed for secure certificate validation and revocation checks.
    5.  **Securely Manage Custom Logic (If Necessary):** If custom validation logic within `ServerTrustManager` is unavoidable for specific use cases, ensure it is implemented securely, thoroughly tested (including negative test cases for validation failures), and reviewed by security-conscious developers.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Weak or bypassed certificate validation within Alamofire, potentially leading to MitM attacks (Severity: Medium to High, depending on the weakness).
    *   Accidental or intentional disabling of security features in Alamofire's certificate validation (Severity: High).
*   **Impact:**
    *   Weak or bypassed certificate validation in Alamofire: Medium to High risk reduction, depending on the previous weakness.
    *   Accidental disabling of security features in Alamofire: High risk reduction.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Yes, we are using Alamofire, and by default, it utilizes a `ServerTrustManager` that performs standard system certificate validation. We are implicitly relying on Alamofire's default `ServerTrustManager`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   While we are using the default `ServerTrustManager` behavior in Alamofire, a proactive review and explicit configuration of `ServerTrustManager` to potentially enhance security (e.g., by explicitly enabling revocation checks using `RevocationTrustEvaluator` or considering custom evaluators for specific needs) has not been undertaken. We are missing a conscious and documented configuration of `ServerTrustManager` beyond the default.
