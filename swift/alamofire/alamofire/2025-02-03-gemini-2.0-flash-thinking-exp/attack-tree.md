    * **Impact:** Full compromise of the application, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, and reputational damage.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Network Communication Vulnerabilities via Alamofire [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_network_communication_vulnerabilities_via_alamofire__critical_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Targeting the network communication layer used by Alamofire to intercept or manipulate data in transit.
    * **Impact:** Data interception, data manipulation, redirection to malicious servers.

    * **2.1. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack [CRITICAL]**
        * **Attack Vector:** Intercepting communication between the application and the server.
        * **Impact:** Data interception, credential theft, session hijacking, data manipulation.

        * **2.1.1. Downgrade HTTPS to HTTP (Stripping SSL/TLS)**
            * **Attack Vector:** Forcing the application to communicate over insecure HTTP instead of HTTPS.
            * **Execution:** An attacker positioned on the network intercepts the initial HTTPS handshake and manipulates it to force the client and server to communicate over HTTP.
            * **Impact:** All data transmitted, including sensitive information and credentials, is sent in plaintext and can be easily intercepted.
            * **Mitigations:**
                * **Enforce HTTPS:** Configure the application and server to strictly use HTTPS and reject HTTP connections.
                * **HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security):** Implement HSTS on the server to instruct browsers to always use HTTPS.

            * **2.1.1.a. Application does not enforce HTTPS and allows HTTP fallback. [CRITICAL]**
