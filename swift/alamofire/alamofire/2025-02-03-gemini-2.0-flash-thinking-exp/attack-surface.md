# Attack Surface Analysis for alamofire/alamofire

## Attack Surface: [Disabled or Improperly Implemented Certificate Pinning](./attack_surfaces/disabled_or_improperly_implemented_certificate_pinning.md)

*   **Description:** Failure to validate the server's certificate against a known, trusted certificate during TLS/SSL handshake. This allows Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.
*   **Alamofire Contribution:** Alamofire provides mechanisms for certificate pinning, and choosing to disable or incorrectly implement it directly creates this vulnerability.
*   **Example:** An attacker intercepts network traffic. If certificate pinning is disabled in Alamofire, the application will accept a fraudulent certificate, allowing the attacker to decrypt communication.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of data confidentiality and integrity. Potential for data theft and account hijacking.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement Certificate Pinning:** Utilize Alamofire's built-in features to enforce certificate pinning.
    *   **Use Robust Pinning Policies:** Pin to specific certificates or public keys for stronger security.
    *   **Regularly Update Pinned Certificates:** Keep pinned certificates updated with server certificate rotations.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure TLS Protocol Versions and Cipher Suites](./attack_surfaces/insecure_tls_protocol_versions_and_cipher_suites.md)

*   **Description:** Negotiation of weak or outdated TLS protocol versions or cipher suites during the TLS/SSL handshake, making communication vulnerable to cryptographic attacks.
*   **Alamofire Contribution:** Alamofire handles TLS/SSL connection setup. While system defaults are used, Alamofire's configuration and underlying libraries are involved in protocol/cipher negotiation.
*   **Example:** Alamofire connects to a server supporting older TLS versions. Due to system or server configuration, a vulnerable TLS 1.0 connection is established, susceptible to decryption attacks.
*   **Impact:** Compromise of data confidentiality and integrity. Susceptibility to protocol-level vulnerabilities.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enforce Strong System TLS Configuration:** Configure the OS and network to prefer and enforce TLS 1.2+ and secure cipher suites.
    *   **Server-Side TLS Configuration:** Ensure the server only supports strong TLS versions and ciphers.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Periodically audit TLS configurations.

## Attack Surface: [HTTP Header Injection](./attack_surfaces/http_header_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Injecting malicious HTTP headers into requests by manipulating user-controlled input used to construct headers.
*   **Alamofire Contribution:** Alamofire allows setting custom HTTP headers. If unsanitized user input is used for headers, Alamofire becomes the vehicle for header injection.
*   **Example:** User input is used to set a "User-Agent" header. An attacker injects `User-Agent: Malicious Header\r\nX-Custom-Header: Injected`, potentially causing server-side issues or XSS if reflected.
*   **Impact:** Server-side vulnerabilities, potential XSS, bypassing security controls, request smuggling.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Sanitization and Validation:** Sanitize and validate all user input before using it in HTTP headers.
    *   **Safe Header Construction:** Use Alamofire's API safely, minimizing injection risks, potentially using predefined headers and careful input escaping.
    *   **Limit User Header Control:** Avoid allowing user control over HTTP headers unless absolutely necessary.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Interceptors and Adapters](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_interceptors_and_adapters.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws introduced by poorly implemented custom request adapters or response interceptors that extend Alamofire's functionality.
*   **Alamofire Contribution:** Alamofire's design allows custom adapters/interceptors. Vulnerabilities in these custom components are directly related to how developers extend Alamofire.
*   **Example:** A custom adapter to add authentication tokens is poorly written, exposing tokens in logs or mishandling storage, creating vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the flaw, including authentication bypass, data manipulation, information disclosure, or code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Development for Custom Components:** Follow secure coding practices for interceptors/adapters. Conduct thorough code reviews and security testing.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Custom Code):** Keep custom components simple and focused to minimize attack surface.
    *   **Regular Security Audits of Custom Code:** Regularly audit custom interceptor/adapter code for vulnerabilities.
