* **Attack Surface:** Path Traversal Vulnerabilities
    * **Description:** An attacker can manipulate input to access files or directories outside of the intended scope, potentially leading to unauthorized file deletion.
    * **How FengNiao Contributes:** If the application allows user-controlled input to influence the directories or file paths that FengNiao operates on, the library's file system operations can be directed to arbitrary locations.
    * **Example:** An attacker provides a path like `../../../../important_file.txt` as a directory to scan for unused resources, causing FengNiao to attempt operations on that file.
    * **Impact:** Data loss due to deletion of critical files, potential system compromise if executable files are targeted.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Input Validation:**  Strictly validate and sanitize all user-provided input that influences file paths passed to FengNiao.
        * **Path Canonicalization:** Use secure path manipulation functions to resolve symbolic links and ensure paths are within the expected boundaries.
        * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run FengNiao operations with the minimum necessary file system permissions.

* **Attack Surface:** Denial of Service (DoS) through Resource Exhaustion
    * **Description:** An attacker can cause the application to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) by manipulating FengNiao's operations, leading to application unavailability.
    * **How FengNiao Contributes:** If an attacker can influence the directories FengNiao scans, they might point it towards directories with an extremely large number of files or deeply nested structures, overwhelming the library's processing capabilities.
    * **Example:** An attacker provides the root directory `/` as the target for FengNiao's cleanup, causing it to traverse the entire file system.
    * **Impact:** Application downtime, resource exhaustion affecting other services on the same system.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Resource Limits:** Implement timeouts and limits on the number of files or directories FengNiao can process in a single run.
        * **Input Validation:** Restrict the directories that can be targeted by FengNiao to a predefined set or validate user-provided paths against a whitelist.
        * **Rate Limiting:** If FengNiao operations are triggered by user requests, implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
