# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for mengto/spring

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dependency Vulnerability Scanning](./mitigation_strategies/dependency_vulnerability_scanning.md)

**Description:** (Same as previously described - focusing on general dependency scanning for any project)
1.  **Add Dependency-Check Plugin:** Integrate the `OWASP Dependency-Check` plugin into your project's build configuration file.
2.  **Configure Plugin Execution:** Set up the plugin to run during the build process.
3.  **Review Vulnerability Reports:** Examine the reports generated by the plugin.
4.  **Remediate Vulnerabilities:** Investigate and take action for each reported vulnerability.
5.  **Automate and Integrate:** Integrate the plugin into your CI/CD pipeline.
**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   Vulnerable Dependencies (High Severity) - Exploitation of known security flaws in third-party libraries.
**Impact:**
*   Vulnerable Dependencies: High Risk Reduction - Significantly reduces the risk of exploiting known dependency vulnerabilities.
**Currently Implemented:** Yes, using `OWASP Dependency-Check` plugin in `pom.xml` and integrated into Jenkins CI pipeline.
**Missing Implementation:** Automated vulnerability remediation process and issue tracking integration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Dependency Updates](./mitigation_strategies/regular_dependency_updates.md)

**Description:** (Same as previously described - focusing on general dependency updates for any project)
1.  **Establish Update Schedule:** Define a regular schedule for reviewing and updating project dependencies.
2.  **Monitor Dependency Updates:** Subscribe to security mailing lists and release notes for Spring projects and other dependencies.
3.  **Test Updates Thoroughly:** Test updated dependencies in a staging environment.
4.  **Utilize Dependency Management Tools:** Leverage dependency management tools (Maven, Gradle) to identify outdated dependencies.
5.  **Document Update Process:** Document the dependency update process.
**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   Vulnerable Dependencies (High Severity) - Proactively addressing known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
*   Zero-Day Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity) - Reducing exposure to newly discovered vulnerabilities.
**Impact:**
*   Vulnerable Dependencies: High Risk Reduction -  Significantly reduces the risk by ensuring timely patching.
*   Zero-Day Vulnerabilities: Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces exposure time to newly discovered vulnerabilities.
**Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Ad-hoc updates for major vulnerabilities, but no regular scheduled updates.
**Missing Implementation:** Formal, scheduled dependency update process and automated update detection tools.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Spring Security Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/secure_spring_security_configuration.md)

**Description:** (Same as previously described - focusing on general secure Spring Security configuration)
1.  **Review Default Configurations:** Carefully review default Spring Security configurations.
2.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** Configure security rules based on the principle of least privilege.
3.  **Strong Authentication Mechanisms:** Implement strong authentication mechanisms like MFA where appropriate.
4.  **Robust Authorization Rules:** Define granular authorization rules to control access.
5.  **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of your Spring Security configuration.
**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   Unauthorized Access (High Severity) - Gaining access without proper authentication or authorization.
*   Authentication Bypass (High Severity) - Circumventing authentication mechanisms.
*   Authorization Bypass (High Severity) -  Circumventing authorization checks.
**Impact:**
*   Unauthorized Access: High Risk Reduction - Significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access.
*   Authentication Bypass: High Risk Reduction - Makes authentication bypass significantly harder.
*   Authorization Bypass: High Risk Reduction - Prevents authorization bypass through access control rules.
**Currently Implemented:** Yes, Spring Security is configured with custom user details, role-based auth, and password hashing.
**Missing Implementation:** MFA and regular security audits of Spring Security configuration.
