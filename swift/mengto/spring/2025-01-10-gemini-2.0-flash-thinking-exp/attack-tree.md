## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Identify Vulnerable Dependency:**
*   Attackers analyze the project's `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` files to identify the dependencies used by the application.
*   They then compare these dependencies against known vulnerability databases (e.g., National Vulnerability Database, Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check).
*   If outdated or vulnerable dependencies are found, this opens the door for exploitation.

**Critical Node: Exploit Known Vulnerability (CVE):**
*   Once a vulnerable dependency is identified, attackers search for publicly available exploits (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures - CVEs) targeting that specific version of the library.
*   These exploits often provide readily usable code or techniques to leverage the vulnerability.
*   Successful exploitation can lead to various severe outcomes, including Remote Code Execution (RCE), data breaches, or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Bypass Authentication/Authorization](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_bypass_authenticationauthorization.md)

**Misconfigured Spring Security:**
*   Spring Security is a powerful framework for securing Spring applications, but misconfigurations are common.
*   Attackers analyze the Spring Security configuration (e.g., classes annotated with `@EnableWebSecurity`, security filter chain definitions) to identify weaknesses.
*   This includes looking for overly permissive access rules, incorrect authentication mechanisms, or vulnerabilities in custom security logic.

**Critical Node: Exploit missing authentication or authorization checks:**
*   A critical failure occurs when authentication or authorization checks are missing for certain parts of the application.
*   Attackers can directly access protected resources or functionalities without proper credentials or permissions.
*   This can lead to full application compromise, allowing attackers to access sensitive data, modify configurations, or execute arbitrary commands.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 3: Achieve Injection Attacks](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3_achieve_injection_attacks.md)

**Critical Node: Spring Expression Language (SpEL) Injection:**
*   Spring Expression Language (SpEL) is a powerful expression language used within Spring applications.
*   **Critical Node: Inject malicious SpEL expressions to execute arbitrary code:** If user-controlled input is directly embedded into SpEL expressions without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious code.
*   When these malicious SpEL expressions are evaluated by the Spring application, they can execute arbitrary commands on the server, leading to complete system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 4: Trigger Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_4_trigger_deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

**Critical Node: Send maliciously crafted serialized objects:**
*   If the application deserializes data from untrusted sources (e.g., user input, external systems) without proper safeguards, it's vulnerable to deserialization attacks.
*   **Critical Node: Send maliciously crafted serialized objects:** Attackers craft malicious serialized objects that, when deserialized by the application, trigger the execution of arbitrary code.
*   This often involves exploiting vulnerabilities in the classes being deserialized (known as "gadget chains"), allowing attackers to gain remote code execution.
