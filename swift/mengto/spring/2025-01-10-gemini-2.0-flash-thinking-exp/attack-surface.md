# Attack Surface Analysis for mengto/spring

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Deserialization](./attack_surfaces/insecure_deserialization.md)

**Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the deserialization process to execute arbitrary code or cause other malicious actions when an application deserializes untrusted data.

**How Spring Contributes:**
- Spring's dependency injection and remote communication mechanisms (like RMI or HTTP Invoker, if used) can involve deserialization of objects.
- If Spring manages beans that are deserialized from untrusted sources without proper safeguards, it can introduce this vulnerability.

**Example:** An attacker sends a maliciously crafted serialized Java object to an endpoint that Spring uses for RMI, leading to code execution when Spring deserializes it.

**Impact:** Critical - Remote code execution, allowing full control of the server.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources if possible.
- If deserialization is necessary, use secure deserialization libraries or techniques.
- Implement filtering or validation of deserialized objects.
- Keep the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and Spring framework up-to-date to patch known deserialization vulnerabilities.
- Consider using alternative data exchange formats like JSON or Protocol Buffers, which are generally safer than Java serialization.

## Attack Surface: [Spring Expression Language (SpEL) Injection](./attack_surfaces/spring_expression_language__spel__injection.md)

**Description:** Injecting malicious code into SpEL expressions that are evaluated by the Spring framework.

**How Spring Contributes:**
- Spring uses SpEL extensively for features like data binding, security expressions, and annotation attributes.
- If user-provided input is directly incorporated into SpEL expressions without proper sanitization, it creates an injection point.

**Example:** A user provides input in a form field that is then used in a `@PreAuthorize` annotation with SpEL, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code by crafting a malicious SpEL expression.

**Impact:** Critical - Remote code execution, data access, bypassing security checks.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Avoid using user-provided input directly in SpEL expressions.
- If it's unavoidable, rigorously sanitize and validate the input.
- Consider using parameterized queries or prepared statements when dealing with data access instead of dynamic SpEL expressions.
- Apply the principle of least privilege when granting permissions based on SpEL expressions.

## Attack Surface: [Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/mass_assignment_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Exploiting the data binding feature in Spring MVC to modify object properties that were not intended to be modified by the user.

**How Spring Contributes:**
- Spring MVC's `@ModelAttribute` and data binding mechanisms automatically bind request parameters to object properties.
- If developers don't explicitly define which fields are allowed to be bound, attackers can potentially modify sensitive or internal fields.

**Example:** An attacker sends a POST request with extra parameters that correspond to internal fields of a user object, allowing them to change their roles or permissions.

**Impact:** High - Privilege escalation, data manipulation, unauthorized access.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Use explicit data transfer objects (DTOs) or view models to strictly define the fields that can be bound from user input.
- Utilize `@ConstructorBinding` in Spring Boot to enforce immutability and control which properties are set during object creation.
- Leverage Spring's validation framework (`@Validated`, `@Valid`) to enforce constraints on input data.
- Avoid directly binding request parameters to domain entities.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfigured Spring Security](./attack_surfaces/misconfigured_spring_security.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from incorrect or insufficient configuration of Spring Security.

**How Spring Contributes:**
- Spring Security provides a powerful framework for authentication and authorization, but its flexibility also means misconfigurations are possible.
- Default configurations might not be secure enough for all applications.

**Example:** A developer fails to configure CSRF protection, making the application vulnerable to cross-site request forgery attacks. Or, overly permissive access rules allow unauthorized users to access sensitive endpoints.

**Impact:** High - Unauthorized access, privilege escalation, data breaches.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Follow Spring Security best practices and recommendations.
- Implement robust authentication and authorization rules based on the principle of least privilege.
- Enable and properly configure CSRF protection.
- Secure session management (e.g., using `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags for cookies).
- Regularly review and audit Spring Security configurations.
- Consider using Spring Security's default secure configurations as a starting point and customize as needed.

## Attack Surface: [Exposed Spring Boot Actuator Endpoints (if enabled)](./attack_surfaces/exposed_spring_boot_actuator_endpoints__if_enabled_.md)

**Description:** Unsecured or improperly secured Spring Boot Actuator endpoints exposing sensitive information or allowing administrative actions.

**How Spring Contributes:**
- Spring Boot Actuator provides endpoints for monitoring and managing applications.
- If these endpoints are accessible without proper authentication and authorization, they can be exploited.

**Example:** An attacker accesses the `/actuator/env` endpoint to view environment variables, potentially revealing database credentials or API keys. Or, they access `/actuator/shutdown` to terminate the application.

**Impact:** Medium to High - Information disclosure, denial of service, potential for further exploitation depending on the exposed information.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Secure Actuator endpoints using Spring Security.
- Disable or restrict access to sensitive endpoints in production environments.
- Use Spring Boot Actuator's built-in security features (e.g., HTTP basic authentication).
- Consider exposing Actuator endpoints only over a secure internal network.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

**Description:** Injecting malicious code into template engines used by Spring MVC to render views.

**How Spring Contributes:**
- Spring MVC integrates with various template engines (e.g., Thymeleaf, FreeMarker, Velocity).
- If user-provided input is directly embedded into templates without proper escaping or sanitization, it can lead to SSTI.

**Example:** An attacker provides a malicious payload in a URL parameter that is then used in a Thymeleaf template without proper escaping, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Impact:** High - Remote code execution, data breaches, server compromise.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Always escape user-provided data before embedding it in templates.
- Use template engines in a way that minimizes the risk of SSTI (e.g., avoid dynamic template evaluation with user input).
- Consider using logic-less templates where possible.
- Keep template engine libraries up-to-date with security patches.
