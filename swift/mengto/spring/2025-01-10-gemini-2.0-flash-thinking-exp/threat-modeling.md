# Threat Model Analysis for mengto/spring

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/dependency_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

* Description: An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in one of the Spring Framework libraries or its transitive dependencies used by the `mengto/spring` project. This could involve crafting specific HTTP requests or providing malicious input that triggers the vulnerability within the application's core framework components.
    * Impact: Remote code execution, data breaches, denial of service, or other forms of compromise, potentially allowing the attacker to gain full control over the application and the server it runs on.
    * Affected Component: Spring Core, Spring Beans, Spring Context, Spring Web MVC (DispatcherServlet, HandlerMapping, etc.), or any other vulnerable dependency used by the project.
    * Risk Severity: Critical.
    * Mitigation Strategies:
        * Regularly update the Spring Framework and all its dependencies to the latest stable versions.
        * Utilize dependency management tools (like Maven or Gradle) with vulnerability scanning plugins to identify and address known vulnerabilities.
        * Monitor security advisories for Spring and its dependencies and promptly apply necessary patches.

## Threat: [Mass Assignment Exploitation](./threats/mass_assignment_exploitation.md)

* Description: An attacker manipulates HTTP request parameters to modify object properties that were not intended to be user-modifiable in the controllers or data binding mechanisms of the `mengto/spring` application. By sending crafted requests with unexpected parameter names, they can potentially bypass business logic or security checks.
    * Impact: Unauthorized modification of data, privilege escalation (if roles or permissions are modified), bypassing security controls, potentially leading to data breaches or manipulation of application state.
    * Affected Component: Spring MVC Data Binding mechanism within the controllers of the `mengto/spring` application, particularly if request parameters are directly bound to domain objects without proper safeguards.
    * Risk Severity: High.
    * Mitigation Strategies:
        * Use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) to explicitly define which fields can be bound from requests in the `mengto/spring` controllers.
        * Avoid directly binding request parameters to sensitive domain objects.
        * Implement proper input validation and sanitization within the controllers and service layers of the `mengto/spring` application.
        * Consider using the `@Bind annotation with allowed fields or similar mechanisms for finer-grained control over data binding (if applicable in the Spring version used).

## Threat: [Spring Expression Language (SpEL) Injection](./threats/spring_expression_language__spel__injection.md)

* Description: An attacker injects malicious code into a SpEL expression that is evaluated by the `mengto/spring` application. This could occur if user-controlled input is directly incorporated into SpEL expressions within annotations (like `@Value`) or in Spring Security expressions used in the application's configuration.
    * Impact: Remote code execution, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server running the `mengto/spring` application, leading to complete system compromise.
    * Affected Component: Spring Expression Language (SpEL) evaluator used within the `mengto/spring` application's configuration or potentially within controller logic if SpEL is used for dynamic evaluations.
    * Risk Severity: Critical.
    * Mitigation Strategies:
        * Avoid using user-controlled input directly in SpEL expressions within the `mengto/spring` application.
        * If SpEL is absolutely necessary with user input, sanitize and validate the input rigorously before incorporating it into expressions.
        * Consider alternative approaches that do not involve dynamic expression evaluation where possible in the `mengto/spring` application.

## Threat: [Insecure Default Configuration of Spring Security](./threats/insecure_default_configuration_of_spring_security.md)

* Description: An attacker exploits default configurations or misconfigurations in Spring Security within the `mengto/spring` application that leave it vulnerable. This could include permissive access rules, weak authentication mechanisms, or missing security headers.
    * Impact: Unauthorized access to protected resources, data breaches, account takeover within the `mengto/spring` application, and other security compromises.
    * Affected Component: Spring Security configuration within the `mengto/spring` application, including security filter chain definitions, authentication providers, and authorization rules.
    * Risk Severity: High to Critical (depending on the specific misconfiguration).
    * Mitigation Strategies:
        * Follow Spring Security's best practices for configuration within the `mengto/spring` application.
        * Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.
        * Explicitly define access rules and restrict access to sensitive endpoints in the `mengto/spring` application.
        * Configure appropriate security headers (e.g., Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, Strict-Transport-Security) in the `mengto/spring` application.
        * Regularly review and test Spring Security configurations in the `mengto/spring` application.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information via Spring Boot Actuator Endpoints](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_via_spring_boot_actuator_endpoints.md)

* Description: An attacker gains unauthorized access to Spring Boot Actuator endpoints in the `mengto/spring` application that expose sensitive information about the application's configuration, environment, or internal state.
    * Impact: Information disclosure, which can be used to further attack the `mengto/spring` application or gain insights into its infrastructure. This can include environment variables, configuration details, and internal metrics.
    * Affected Component: Spring Boot Actuator, specifically the various endpoints like `/env`, `/beans`, `/configprops`, `/health` if they are not properly secured in the `mengto/spring` application.
    * Risk Severity: High (if sensitive information like API keys or database credentials are exposed).
    * Mitigation Strategies:
        * Secure Actuator endpoints using Spring Security within the `mengto/spring` application.
        * Restrict access to Actuator endpoints to authorized users or internal networks.
        * Disable or customize sensitive Actuator endpoints in production environments for the `mengto/spring` application.
        * Consider using Spring Boot Admin for centralized management with enhanced security.
