# Attack Surface Analysis for mengto/spring

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Deserialization via Vulnerable Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/insecure_deserialization_via_vulnerable_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in deserialization libraries (like Jackson, XStream) present in Spring application dependencies when processing untrusted data. Leads to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
*   **How Spring Contributes:** Spring applications rely on numerous dependencies, and Spring Boot's dependency management can include vulnerable deserialization libraries if not actively managed.
*   **Example:** Crafted JSON payload sent to a Spring MVC REST endpoint using Jackson, triggering deserialization vulnerability in a vulnerable Jackson version, leading to RCE.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), data breach, complete system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Scanning:** Regularly scan dependencies for vulnerabilities.
    *   **Dependency Updates:** Keep deserialization libraries and all dependencies updated to patched versions.
    *   **Secure Deserialization:** Avoid deserializing untrusted data if possible. If necessary, use safe serialization practices and validate input.

## Attack Surface: [Spring Expression Language (SpEL) Injection](./attack_surfaces/spring_expression_language__spel__injection.md)

*   **Description:** Injecting malicious SpEL expressions into application inputs evaluated by Spring. Leads to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or Remote Code Execution (RCE).
*   **How Spring Contributes:** Spring uses SpEL in Spring Security annotations, Spring Integration, and configuration. User-controlled input in SpEL expressions without sanitization is vulnerable.
*   **Example:** Malicious SpEL expression in user input used in `@PreAuthorize` annotation, bypassing authorization or executing arbitrary code.
*   **Impact:** Authentication bypass, authorization bypass, Remote Code Execution (RCE), data breach.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid SpEL with User Input:**  Do not use SpEL expressions directly incorporating user-controlled input.
    *   **Input Sanitization (Complex and Discouraged):** If unavoidable, rigorously sanitize user input intended for SpEL, which is error-prone.
    *   **Secure Alternatives:** Use safer alternatives to dynamic expression evaluation.

## Attack Surface: [Data Binding Vulnerabilities (Mass Assignment)](./attack_surfaces/data_binding_vulnerabilities__mass_assignment_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting Spring MVC's data binding to modify unintended object properties via request parameters. Leads to unauthorized data manipulation or privilege escalation.
*   **How Spring Contributes:** Spring MVC automatically binds request parameters to object properties. Misconfiguration allows binding to sensitive fields not intended for user modification.
*   **Example:** Modifying `isAdmin` property of a User object via request parameter due to unrestricted data binding, leading to privilege escalation.
*   **Impact:** Authorization bypass, data manipulation, privilege escalation, data integrity compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs):** Bind request parameters to DTOs, not directly to domain objects.
    *   **Explicitly Define Bindable Fields:** Control data binding to only allowed fields.
    *   **Validation with `@Validated`:** Use validation annotations to enforce input constraints.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal via Static Resource Handling](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_via_static_resource_handling.md)

*   **Description:** Accessing files outside intended static resource directories by manipulating file paths in requests. Exposes sensitive files.
*   **How Spring Contributes:** Misconfigured `ResourceHttpRequestHandler` in Spring MVC can allow path traversal if it doesn't restrict access to specific directories and sanitize file paths.
*   **Example:** Requesting `/static/../../../../etc/passwd` to access `/etc/passwd` due to misconfigured static resource handling.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, access to sensitive files, potential further exploitation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Properly Configure Resource Handlers:** Restrict `ResourceHttpRequestHandler` to specific directories and prevent parent directory traversal.
    *   **Restrict Access:** Limit access to defined resource locations only.
    *   **Avoid Serving Sensitive Files:** Do not serve sensitive files as static resources.
    *   **Input Validation on File Paths:** Validate and sanitize file paths if constructed from user input.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication Bypass due to Misconfiguration (Spring Security)](./attack_surfaces/authentication_bypass_due_to_misconfiguration__spring_security_.md)

*   **Description:** Bypassing authentication due to incorrect or overly permissive Spring Security configurations. Allows unauthorized access to protected resources.
*   **How Spring Contributes:** Spring Security's flexible configuration can lead to misconfigurations like overly permissive rules or incorrect URL patterns, causing bypasses.
*   **Example:** Using `permitAll()` for protected URL patterns or incorrect `antMatchers`, allowing unauthenticated access to sensitive resources.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to application functionality and data, complete compromise of protected resources.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Careful Security Rule Configuration:** Thoroughly review and test Spring Security rules.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Apply least privilege in security rules, avoiding overly permissive configurations.
    *   **Regular Configuration Review:** Periodically audit Spring Security configurations.
    *   **Secure Actuator Endpoints:** Secure Spring Boot Actuator endpoints.
    *   **Robust Authentication Mechanisms:** Use strong, well-tested authentication mechanisms.

## Attack Surface: [Authorization Bypass due to Role/Authority Mismanagement (Spring Security)](./attack_surfaces/authorization_bypass_due_to_roleauthority_mismanagement__spring_security_.md)

*   **Description:** Bypassing authorization checks due to incorrect role/authority assignments or flawed Spring Security authorization logic. Allows unauthorized actions.
*   **How Spring Contributes:** Misuse of Spring Security authorization annotations, incorrect role management, or flawed logic can lead to bypasses.
*   **Example:** Flawed role assignment logic allowing regular users to get 'ADMIN' role, bypassing `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")` protection.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, privilege escalation, data manipulation, security policy violation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Robust Role Management:** Establish a clear and well-defined role/authority system.
    *   **Proper Authorization Annotations:** Use Spring Security annotations correctly and consistently.
    *   **Regular Authorization Logic Review:** Audit authorization logic for flaws.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Apply least privilege in authorization.
    *   **Consistent Authorization Checks:** Ensure consistent authorization checks across the application.

## Attack Surface: [Exposed Actuator Endpoints (Spring Boot Actuator)](./attack_surfaces/exposed_actuator_endpoints__spring_boot_actuator_.md)

*   **Description:** Accessing sensitive information via unauthenticated or improperly secured Spring Boot Actuator endpoints.
*   **How Spring Contributes:** Spring Boot Actuator exposes endpoints by default, and misconfiguration can leave them unauthenticated, revealing sensitive application details.
*   **Example:** Unauthenticated `/actuator/env` endpoint exposing environment variables with sensitive credentials.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential for further attacks, unauthorized access to management functionality.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Actuator Endpoints:** Always secure Actuator endpoints with authentication and authorization.
    *   **Disable in Production (If Unneeded):** Disable Actuator endpoints in production if not required.
    *   **Restrict Access:** Limit access to authorized users/networks.
    *   **Customize Endpoints:** Minimize exposed information by customizing endpoints.
    *   **Monitor Access:** Monitor Actuator endpoint access logs.
