# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project appears to be a basic example of a Spring Boot web application.  Assuming this is intended as a template or a starting point for more complex applications, the primary business priority is to demonstrate a functional and well-structured Spring Boot application.  The goal is likely educational or to provide a foundation for future development.

Most important business risks that need to be addressed:
- Risk of insecure coding practices being propagated if this example is used as a template without proper security review.
- Risk of demonstrating outdated or vulnerable dependencies if the project is not regularly maintained.
- Risk of misinterpretation of the example as production-ready without further hardening and security measures.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Spring Security dependency included in `pom.xml`, suggesting intent to implement authentication and authorization. (Implemented in: `pom.xml`)
- security control: Basic structure for a web application, allowing for implementation of standard security practices. (Implemented in: Project structure)

Accepted risks:
- accepted risk: Example application likely does not have comprehensive security controls implemented out-of-the-box.
- accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in dependencies if not regularly updated.
- accepted risk: Lack of input validation and sanitization in example code.

Recommended security controls:
- security control: Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms using Spring Security.
- security control: Implement input validation and sanitization for all user inputs.
- security control: Regularly update dependencies to address known vulnerabilities.
- security control: Integrate static application security testing (SAST) into the build process.
- security control: Implement secure logging and monitoring practices.

Security requirements:
- Authentication:
    - Requirement: The application should support user authentication to verify the identity of users accessing the application.
    - Requirement: Consider different authentication methods (e.g., username/password, OAuth 2.0) based on the intended use case.
- Authorization:
    - Requirement: The application should implement authorization to control access to different parts of the application based on user roles or permissions.
    - Requirement: Define clear roles and permissions based on the application's functionality.
- Input Validation:
    - Requirement: All user inputs should be validated to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).
    - Requirement: Implement both client-side and server-side validation.
- Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Sensitive data at rest and in transit should be encrypted.
    - Requirement: Use HTTPS for all communication to protect data in transit.
    - Requirement: Consider encrypting sensitive data in the database if applicable.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes we are trying to protect:
- For an example application, there are no critical business processes in a real-world sense. However, if this were a template for other applications, the critical process would be demonstrating a secure and functional application foundation.  In a broader context, for applications built using this template, critical business processes would depend on the specific application's purpose (e.g., user management, data processing, e-commerce transactions).

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- In this example, there is likely no sensitive data being handled.  However, in a real application built upon this foundation, data sensitivity would vary.  Potential data types and sensitivities could include:
    - User credentials (highly sensitive)
    - Personal user data (sensitive depending on type - PII, GDPR considerations)
    - Application data (sensitivity depends on business context)

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What is the intended purpose of this Spring Boot example beyond being a basic template?
- Are there specific security requirements or compliance standards that need to be considered?
- What is the target deployment environment for applications built using this template?
- Is there any specific data that this example application is intended to handle or demonstrate handling?

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE: Assumed to be an educational example or template, not a production application in itself. Business priority is demonstrating functionality and good structure.
- SECURITY POSTURE: Assumed basic security considerations are important, but comprehensive security is not the primary focus of the example itself. Security should be a key consideration for applications built using this as a template.
- DESIGN: Assumed a standard web application architecture with a browser client and a Spring Boot backend. Deployment is assumed to be cloud-based for scalability and availability. Build process is assumed to be automated using CI/CD practices.
