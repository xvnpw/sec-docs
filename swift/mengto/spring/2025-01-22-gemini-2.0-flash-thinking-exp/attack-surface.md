# Attack Surface Analysis for mengto/spring

## Attack Surface: [1. Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/1__dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of known security vulnerabilities within Spring Framework libraries or their transitive dependencies. Spring's extensive use of dependencies means vulnerabilities here directly impact applications.
*   **Spring Contribution:** Spring applications rely on a vast ecosystem of libraries managed through dependency management tools. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies are a direct attack surface for Spring applications.
*   **Example:** A Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in an older version of the Spring Framework itself, or in a commonly used library like Jackson (for JSON processing) that Spring utilizes.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), Information Disclosure, depending on the specific vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** to **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Regularly update Spring Framework and all dependencies to the latest versions.
        *   Implement automated dependency scanning tools in the CI/CD pipeline.
        *   Monitor security advisories for Spring Framework and its dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [2. Expression Language (SpEL) Injection](./attack_surfaces/2__expression_language__spel__injection.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of Spring Expression Language (SpEL) injection vulnerabilities.  Spring's use of SpEL for dynamic expressions creates a direct pathway for code injection if user input is improperly handled.
*   **Spring Contribution:** Spring Framework's core functionality includes SpEL for configuration and dynamic logic.  Unsafe use of SpEL with user input directly leads to this vulnerability.
*   **Example:** An application uses user-provided input to construct a SpEL expression for dynamic filtering. An attacker injects a malicious SpEL expression to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Complete Server Compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Strongly avoid** using user input directly within SpEL expressions.
        *   If SpEL is necessary with user input, rigorously sanitize and validate the input.
        *   Consider safer alternatives to SpEL when handling user input.

## Attack Surface: [3. Spring Security Misconfigurations (Permissive Rules, Authentication/Authorization Bypass)](./attack_surfaces/3__spring_security_misconfigurations__permissive_rules__authenticationauthorization_bypass_.md)

*   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities arising from misconfigurations within Spring Security, leading to unintended access or bypass of authentication and authorization mechanisms. Spring Security's complexity can lead to configuration errors.
*   **Spring Contribution:** Spring Security is the standard framework for securing Spring applications. Misconfigurations in its rules or custom implementations directly weaken application security.
*   **Example:**
    *   **Permissive Rules:**  Accidentally allowing anonymous access to administrative endpoints due to an incorrect Spring Security rule.
    *   **Authentication Bypass:** Flaws in custom Spring Security authentication logic that can be bypassed.
    *   **Authorization Bypass:** Incorrectly implemented Spring Security authorization checks allowing unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized Access, Data Breach, Privilege Escalation, Complete Application Compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement a "deny by default" security policy in Spring Security.
        *   Carefully define and test security rules.
        *   Thoroughly test authentication and authorization logic.
        *   Regularly review Spring Security configurations and access rules.

## Attack Surface: [4. Spring Data Query Injection](./attack_surfaces/4__spring_data_query_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Query injection vulnerabilities when using Spring Data (JPA, MongoDB, etc.) due to unsafe dynamic query construction with user input. Spring Data's query features can be misused to create injection points.
*   **Spring Contribution:** Spring Data simplifies database interactions, but dynamic query construction based on user input, facilitated by Spring Data features, can introduce injection risks.
*   **Example:** An application using Spring Data JPA constructs JPQL queries by directly concatenating user-provided search terms, leading to SQL injection.
*   **Impact:** Data Breach, Data Manipulation, Potential Data Loss, Unauthorized Access.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Always use parameterized queries or named parameters** with Spring Data.
        *   Avoid constructing dynamic queries by concatenating user input directly.
        *   Utilize Spring Data's query derivation and specification features for safer query construction.

## Attack Surface: [5. Spring Boot Actuator Endpoints (If Exposed and Unsecured)](./attack_surfaces/5__spring_boot_actuator_endpoints__if_exposed_and_unsecured_.md)

*   **Description:** Unsecured or improperly secured Spring Boot Actuator endpoints expose sensitive application information and management functions, potentially leading to severe security breaches. Spring Boot's default inclusion of Actuator can be a risk if not secured.
*   **Spring Contribution:** Spring Boot Actuator, while beneficial for monitoring, becomes a critical attack surface if exposed without proper authentication and authorization, a direct consequence of Spring Boot's design.
*   **Example:** Exposing `/actuator/env` without authentication, allowing attackers to view environment variables containing sensitive credentials. Exploiting `/actuator/jolokia` for RCE in vulnerable configurations.
*   **Impact:** Information Disclosure, Configuration Manipulation, Denial of Service (DoS), Potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE).
*   **Risk Severity:** **Medium** to **Critical** (depending on exposed endpoints and security).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Secure Actuator endpoints** using Spring Security Actuator.
        *   **Disable or restrict access to sensitive endpoints in production.**
        *   Expose actuator endpoints only on internal networks or dedicated management networks.

## Attack Surface: [6. Spring Boot DevTools Enabled in Production](./attack_surfaces/6__spring_boot_devtools_enabled_in_production.md)

*   **Description:** Enabling Spring Boot DevTools in production environments introduces critical security risks due to exposed development-time functionalities. Spring Boot's profile system can lead to accidental DevTools inclusion in production.
*   **Spring Contribution:** Spring Boot DevTools, intended for development, is automatically included in development profiles.  Failure to properly exclude it in production deployments, a configuration aspect of Spring Boot, creates a major vulnerability.
*   **Example:** DevTools enabled in production allows access to sensitive information, application restarts, and potentially RCE through LiveReload or other DevTools features.
*   **Impact:** Information Disclosure, Denial of Service (DoS), Remote Code Execution (RCE).
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Ensure Spring Boot DevTools is disabled in production environments.**
        *   Verify application packaging and deployment configurations to exclude DevTools in production builds.

## Attack Surface: [7. Spring Cloud Component Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/7__spring_cloud_component_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of known security vulnerabilities within Spring Cloud components. Spring Cloud's components, being part of the Spring ecosystem, introduce their own set of vulnerabilities.
*   **Spring Contribution:** Spring Cloud components are integral parts of the Spring ecosystem for building microservices and distributed systems. Vulnerabilities in these components directly impact applications using Spring Cloud.
*   **Example:** RCE vulnerabilities in Spring Cloud Gateway or Spring Cloud Config Server, allowing attackers to compromise the application infrastructure.
*   **Impact:** Application Compromise, Infrastructure Compromise, Data Breach, Service Disruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Regularly update Spring Cloud components to the latest versions.
        *   Monitor security advisories for Spring Cloud projects.
        *   Securely configure Spring Cloud components, especially those exposed externally.
