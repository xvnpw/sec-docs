# Threat Model Analysis for mengto/spring

## Threat: [Vulnerable Dependency Exploitation](./threats/vulnerable_dependency_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known security vulnerability in a third-party library or a Spring Framework module used by the application. This could involve sending specially crafted requests or data to trigger the vulnerability. For example, exploiting a vulnerability in Jackson for deserialization or Log4j for log injection, or a vulnerability within a core Spring Framework library itself.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), Data Breach, Information Disclosure, depending on the specific vulnerability.  Complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying server.
*   **Affected Spring Component:** Dependency Management (Maven/Gradle), Spring Framework Core, Spring MVC, Spring Boot, and any Spring module relying on vulnerable dependencies.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement dependency vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipeline (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk).
    *   Regularly update Spring Framework and all dependencies to the latest stable versions.
    *   Monitor Spring Security advisories and CVE databases for used libraries and Spring Framework itself.
    *   Use Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools for dependency management.

## Threat: [Spring Security Misconfiguration - Permissive Access Control](./threats/spring_security_misconfiguration_-_permissive_access_control.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to sensitive resources or functionalities due to overly permissive or incorrectly configured Spring Security rules. This could involve bypassing authentication or authorization checks due to misconfigured `HttpSecurity` rules, incorrect use of annotations like `@permitAll`, or flawed custom security logic within Spring Security configuration.
*   **Impact:** Authorization Bypass, Unauthorized Access to Resources, Data Breach, Privilege Escalation. Attackers can access administrative panels, sensitive data, or perform actions they are not supposed to.
*   **Affected Spring Component:** Spring Security (HttpSecurity, AuthenticationManager, AuthorizationManager, annotations like `@PreAuthorize`, `@Secured`, `@RolesAllowed`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly review and test Spring Security configurations.
    *   Implement the principle of least privilege in access control rules.
    *   Use role-based access control (RBAC) where appropriate.
    *   Enforce authentication and authorization for all sensitive endpoints using Spring Security features.
    *   Regularly audit security configurations.

## Threat: [Exposed Spring Boot Actuator Endpoint - Application Manipulation (Shutdown)](./threats/exposed_spring_boot_actuator_endpoint_-_application_manipulation__shutdown_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker accesses a publicly exposed and unsecured `/actuator/shutdown` endpoint. This allows them to remotely shut down the Spring Boot application, causing a Denial of Service. This is a direct consequence of Spring Boot Actuator's design and default exposure if not secured.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS). Application becomes unavailable, disrupting services and potentially causing financial or reputational damage.
*   **Affected Spring Component:** Spring Boot Actuator (shutdown endpoint `/shutdown`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure Actuator endpoints using Spring Security.
    *   Disable the shutdown endpoint in production using `management.endpoint.shutdown.enabled=false`.
    *   Restrict access to Actuator endpoints based on roles and IP addresses using Spring Boot Actuator configuration.

## Threat: [Spring Expression Language (SpEL) Injection](./threats/spring_expression_language__spel__injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious code into a Spring Expression Language (SpEL) expression that is evaluated by the application. This is possible if user-controlled input is directly used within SpEL expressions, for example, in `@PreAuthorize` annotations or custom SpEL evaluation logic. This is a vulnerability stemming from the design and capabilities of the Spring Expression Language itself.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Authentication Bypass, Authorization Bypass. Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially gaining full control of the application and server.
*   **Affected Spring Component:** Spring Expression Language (SpEL), Spring Security annotations (`@PreAuthorize`, `@PostAuthorize`), Spring Integration, and any code using `SpelExpressionParser`.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid using user-controlled input directly in SpEL expressions.
    *   If user input must be used, implement very strict input validation and sanitization. Consider using a restricted SpEL context or a safer expression language.
    *   Regularly audit code for potential SpEL injection points.

## Threat: [Deserialization Vulnerability (Jackson Library - within Spring Context)](./threats/deserialization_vulnerability__jackson_library_-_within_spring_context_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a malicious serialized object (e.g., JSON payload) to the application, which is deserialized by Jackson (a common JSON processing library used in Spring MVC and WebFlux). If Jackson or a related library has a deserialization vulnerability, it can lead to Remote Code Execution when the malicious object is deserialized. While Jackson is a separate library, its tight integration and common usage within Spring applications makes this a relevant Spring-context threat.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE). Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server by sending a crafted JSON payload.
*   **Affected Spring Component:** Jackson library (used by Spring MVC for JSON processing), Spring MVC, Spring WebFlux.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Jackson and other serialization libraries updated to the latest versions.
    *   Avoid deserializing untrusted data if possible.
    *   If deserialization of untrusted data is necessary, implement robust input validation and consider using deserialization filters or safer serialization formats.
