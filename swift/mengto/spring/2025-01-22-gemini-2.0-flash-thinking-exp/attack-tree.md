## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries (dependencies) used by the Spring application.
*   **Critical Node: Exploit Known Vulnerability (CVE) in Dependency:**
    *   Attackers target dependencies with publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs).
    *   Tools and databases (like CVE databases, NVD, and vulnerability scanners) are used to identify vulnerable dependencies.
    *   Exploits for these vulnerabilities are often readily available or easy to adapt.
*   **High-Risk Path: Remote Code Execution (RCE) via vulnerable library:**
    *   Successful exploitation of a dependency vulnerability often leads to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
    *   RCE allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to full system compromise.
    *   Impact is extremely high, as the attacker gains complete control.
    *   Effort and skill level can be relatively low if exploits are available.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Spring Framework Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_spring_framework_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities within the Spring Framework itself.
*   **Critical Node: Exploit Identified Spring Vulnerability:**
    *   Attackers target known CVEs in the Spring Framework version used by the application.
    *   They may also discover new vulnerabilities through static or dynamic analysis.
    *   Exploits for Spring Framework vulnerabilities can be highly impactful due to the framework's central role.
*   **Critical Node: Spring MVC/WebFlux Vulnerabilities (e.g., Parameter Binding, Data Binding, SpEL Injection):**
    *   Spring MVC and WebFlux handle web requests and data binding, making them potential vulnerability points.
    *   **High-Risk Path: Exploit Spring Expression Language (SpEL) Injection:**
        *   SpEL injection occurs when user-controlled input is used to construct and evaluate SpEL expressions.
        *   Successful SpEL injection allows for arbitrary code execution on the server.
        *   Impact is very high (RCE).
        *   Detection can be challenging without specific SpEL injection detection mechanisms.
*   **Critical Node: Spring Security Vulnerabilities (e.g., Authentication Bypass, Authorization Bypass):**
    *   Spring Security is responsible for authentication and authorization. Vulnerabilities here can be critical.
    *   **High-Risk Path: Exploit Authentication Bypass:**
        *   Authentication bypass allows attackers to completely circumvent authentication mechanisms.
        *   This grants full, unauthorized access to the application.
        *   Impact is extremely high (full access).
    *   **High-Risk Path: Exploit Authorization Bypass:**
        *   Authorization bypass allows attackers to access resources or functionalities they are not supposed to access.
        *   Impact is high (unauthorized access, potential data breach).
*   **Critical Node: Spring Boot Actuator Vulnerabilities (if exposed):**
    *   Spring Boot Actuators provide management and monitoring endpoints. If exposed without proper security, they become high-risk.
    *   **High-Risk Path: Information Disclosure via Actuator Endpoints:**
        *   Exposed actuator endpoints can reveal sensitive information like configuration details, environment variables, and metrics.
        *   This information can aid further attacks.
        *   Impact is medium (information disclosure).
    *   **High-Risk Path: Configuration Manipulation via Actuator Endpoints (if write-enabled and insecure):**
        *   If actuator endpoints are write-enabled and insecure, attackers can modify application configuration.
        *   This can lead to service disruption, backdoor creation, or privilege escalation.
        *   Impact is high (service disruption, backdoor).

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Spring Configuration Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_spring_configuration_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting misconfigurations in the Spring application's setup.
*   **Critical Node: Exploit Misconfiguration:**
    *   Misconfigurations are common and often overlooked, making them a significant attack vector.
    *   Attackers look for insecure settings in application context files, Spring Security configurations, and Spring Boot configuration files.
*   **High-Risk Path: Insecure Default Configurations:**
    *   Relying on default configurations without hardening them for production can introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   Defaults are often designed for ease of use, not security.
    *   Impact depends on the specific insecure default.
*   **High-Risk Path: Exposed Actuator Endpoints (without proper authentication):**
    *   Reiterating the high risk of exposed and insecure Actuator endpoints due to configuration errors.
    *   Impact ranges from information disclosure to RCE (as detailed above).
*   **High-Risk Path: Weak Security Configurations:**
    *   Weaknesses in Spring Security configurations, such as flawed authentication or authorization rules, are critical.
    *   **High-Risk Path: Weak Authentication Mechanisms:**
        *   Using weak or easily bypassed authentication methods (e.g., default credentials, weak password policies).
        *   Impact is high (full access).
    *   **High-Risk Path: Insecure Authorization Rules:**
        *   Overly permissive or flawed authorization rules that allow unauthorized access to resources.
        *   Impact is medium (unauthorized access).
*   **High-Risk Path: Sensitive Data Exposure in Configuration Files:**
    *   Accidentally or mistakenly storing sensitive data (credentials, API keys) directly in configuration files.
    *   If these files are accessible (e.g., through misconfigured access control or repository exposure), attackers can easily steal sensitive information.
    *   Impact is high (credential compromise, API key theft).
