# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 3.1.3 - Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE)

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the attack path "3.1.3. Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE)" within the context of a Spring application (potentially using the `spring-data-rest` component).  We aim to understand the specific vulnerabilities, exploitation techniques, and effective mitigation strategies related to this attack vector.  This analysis will inform development and security practices to prevent RCE vulnerabilities.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on RCE vulnerabilities arising from unsafe deserialization within a Spring application, particularly when interacting with Spring Data REST endpoints.  It considers:

*   Vulnerable versions of Spring Data REST and underlying serialization/deserialization libraries (e.g., Jackson, older Java serialization mechanisms).
*   The process of crafting malicious serialized objects.
*   The interaction between an attacker's request and the application's deserialization process.
*   The impact of successful RCE exploitation.
*   Concrete mitigation techniques applicable to Spring applications.

This analysis *does not* cover other types of RCE vulnerabilities (e.g., those stemming from command injection, template injection, or vulnerabilities in other parts of the application stack). It also assumes the application is using Java.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Vulnerability Research:**  Identify specific CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related to deserialization vulnerabilities in Spring Data REST, Jackson, and other relevant libraries.  This includes researching past exploits and proof-of-concept code.
2.  **Code Review (Hypothetical):**  Analyze hypothetical (or, if available, real-world) code snippets demonstrating vulnerable Spring Data REST endpoint configurations and deserialization practices.
3.  **Exploitation Scenario Walkthrough:**  Describe a step-by-step scenario of how an attacker could exploit a deserialization vulnerability to achieve RCE.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Analysis:**  Evaluate the effectiveness of various mitigation techniques, including their limitations and potential bypasses.  This will involve examining Spring's security features and best practices.
5.  **Tooling and Testing:** Identify tools and techniques that can be used to detect and prevent deserialization vulnerabilities during development and testing.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 3.1.3

### 4.1. Vulnerability Research

Several CVEs have highlighted deserialization vulnerabilities in components used by Spring applications.  Key examples include:

*   **CVE-2017-8046 (Spring Data REST):**  This critical vulnerability allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code by sending specially crafted JSON payloads to Spring Data REST endpoints.  The vulnerability stemmed from the way Spring Data REST handled PATCH requests and deserialized data using Jackson's `ObjectMapper`.  The fix involved restricting the types that could be deserialized.
*   **CVE-2019-3772 (Jackson databind):**  This and numerous other Jackson databind CVEs (e.g., CVE-2017-7525, CVE-2017-17485, CVE-2018-7489) demonstrate the ongoing risk of deserialization vulnerabilities in widely used libraries.  These vulnerabilities often involve "gadget chains" â€“ sequences of classes that, when deserialized in a specific order, can lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   **CVE-2016-3720 (Spring Framework):** This vulnerability in Spring Framework's `SerializationUtils` allowed for unsafe deserialization of Java objects. While not directly tied to Spring Data REST, it highlights the broader risk of Java's built-in serialization mechanism.
* **CVE-2023-20863 (Spring Framework):** Spring Framework Deserialization RCE.

These CVEs demonstrate that deserialization vulnerabilities are a recurring problem, requiring constant vigilance and updates.

### 4.2. Hypothetical Code Review

Consider the following (simplified) vulnerable Spring Data REST endpoint:

```java
@RepositoryRestController
public class VulnerableController {

    @Autowired
    private ObjectMapper objectMapper; // Injected ObjectMapper

    @PatchMapping("/users/{id}")
    public ResponseEntity<?> patchUser(@PathVariable Long id, @RequestBody String jsonPayload) throws Exception {

        // VULNERABLE: Directly deserializing untrusted input
        User updatedUser = objectMapper.readValue(jsonPayload, User.class);

        // ... (process updatedUser) ...

        return ResponseEntity.ok().build();
    }
}
```

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Direct Deserialization of Untrusted Input:** The `@RequestBody String jsonPayload` is directly deserialized into a `User` object using `objectMapper.readValue()`.  This is the core vulnerability.  An attacker can control the `jsonPayload` and include malicious data.
*   **Lack of Type Validation:** There's no validation or restriction on the types that can be deserialized.  This allows an attacker to potentially deserialize arbitrary classes, not just `User`.
*   **Default ObjectMapper Configuration:**  The `ObjectMapper` is likely using a default configuration, which might be vulnerable to known gadget chains.

### 4.3. Exploitation Scenario Walkthrough

1.  **Reconnaissance:** The attacker identifies the Spring Data REST endpoint `/users/{id}` and determines that it accepts PATCH requests with a JSON payload.
2.  **Gadget Chain Discovery:** The attacker researches known gadget chains for the specific version of Jackson (or other deserialization library) used by the application.  Tools like `ysoserial` can be used to generate payloads for known gadget chains.
3.  **Payload Crafting:** The attacker uses `ysoserial` (or a similar tool) to create a serialized object containing a malicious gadget chain.  This chain, when deserialized, will execute a command (e.g., `touch /tmp/pwned`).
4.  **Request Sending:** The attacker sends a PATCH request to `/users/1` (the ID doesn't matter in this case) with the crafted JSON payload.  The payload might look something like this (simplified and encoded for clarity):

    ```json
    {
      "someField": "someValue",
      "maliciousField": {
        "@class": "com.vulnerable.GadgetClass",
        "property1": "value1",
        "command": "touch /tmp/pwned"
      }
    }
    ```

    The `@class` field (or a similar mechanism, depending on the specific vulnerability) instructs the deserializer to instantiate a class other than `User`.
5.  **Deserialization and Execution:** The application receives the request, and the `objectMapper.readValue()` method attempts to deserialize the payload.  Because of the `@class` field and the vulnerable configuration, the malicious `GadgetClass` is instantiated, and its methods are executed as part of the deserialization process.  This triggers the execution of the attacker's command (`touch /tmp/pwned`).
6.  **Confirmation:** The attacker checks for the existence of the `/tmp/pwned` file (or uses another method to confirm code execution).

### 4.4. Mitigation Strategy Analysis

Several mitigation strategies can be employed, with varying levels of effectiveness:

*   **Avoid Unsafe Deserialization (Best Practice):** The most effective mitigation is to avoid deserializing untrusted data whenever possible.  If you don't need to deserialize complex objects from user input, don't.  Consider using simpler data formats (like plain JSON) and manually extracting the required values.

*   **Use Safe Deserialization Libraries:** If deserialization is necessary, use libraries that are designed to be secure against deserialization attacks.  This might involve:
    *   **Jackson with Safe Configuration:** Configure Jackson's `ObjectMapper` to use a whitelist of allowed classes for deserialization.  This prevents the instantiation of arbitrary classes.  Example:

        ```java
        ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
        mapper.enableDefaultTyping(DefaultTyping.NON_FINAL, JsonTypeInfo.As.PROPERTY); // DANGEROUS - DO NOT USE
        //Instead, use a whitelist:
        BasicPolymorphicTypeValidator ptv = BasicPolymorphicTypeValidator.builder()
            .allowIfSubType("com.example.myapp.domain.") // Allow classes in this package
            .build();
        mapper.activateDefaultTyping(ptv, ObjectMapper.DefaultTyping.NON_FINAL, JsonTypeInfo.As.PROPERTY);
        ```
    *   **Alternatives to Java Serialization:** Consider using alternative serialization formats like JSON (without type information) or Protocol Buffers, which are generally less susceptible to deserialization vulnerabilities.

*   **Keep Libraries Up-to-Date (Essential):** Regularly update all dependencies, including Spring Data REST, Jackson, and any other libraries involved in serialization/deserialization.  This is crucial to patch known vulnerabilities.  Use dependency management tools (like Maven or Gradle) and vulnerability scanning tools (like OWASP Dependency-Check) to automate this process.

*   **Input Validation (Defense in Depth):** Validate and sanitize all incoming data, even if it's expected to be serialized.  This can help prevent attackers from injecting malicious data that might bypass other security measures.  However, input validation alone is *not* sufficient to prevent deserialization vulnerabilities.

*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can be configured to detect and block malicious payloads that are characteristic of deserialization attacks.  However, WAF rules can often be bypassed, so this should not be the only line of defense.

*   **Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Regularly conduct security audits and penetration tests to identify and address vulnerabilities, including deserialization issues.

### 4.5. Tooling and Testing

*   **Static Analysis Tools:** Tools like FindSecBugs, SonarQube, and Fortify can detect potential deserialization vulnerabilities during static code analysis.
*   **Dynamic Analysis Tools:** Tools like OWASP ZAP and Burp Suite can be used to test for deserialization vulnerabilities during dynamic application security testing (DAST).
*   **`ysoserial`:** This tool is used to generate payloads for known deserialization gadget chains.  It's useful for testing and demonstrating vulnerabilities, but should only be used in controlled environments.
*   **Dependency Checkers:** Tools like OWASP Dependency-Check and Snyk can identify vulnerable dependencies in your project.
*   **Jailbreak Techniques:** Research and understand common techniques used to bypass deserialization whitelists and other security measures. This knowledge helps in designing more robust defenses.
*   **Unit and Integration Tests:** Write unit and integration tests that specifically attempt to exploit deserialization vulnerabilities. This helps ensure that your mitigation strategies are effective. For example, create tests that send malicious payloads to your endpoints and verify that they are rejected or handled safely.

## 5. Conclusion

Deserialization vulnerabilities, particularly those leading to RCE, pose a significant threat to Spring applications.  The attack path 3.1.3 highlights the critical importance of secure coding practices, proper configuration of serialization libraries, and continuous security monitoring.  By avoiding unsafe deserialization whenever possible, using secure deserialization libraries with whitelisting, keeping dependencies up-to-date, and employing a layered security approach, developers can significantly reduce the risk of RCE exploits.  Regular security audits, penetration testing, and the use of appropriate security tools are essential for maintaining a strong security posture.
