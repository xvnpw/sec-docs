## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Spring Expression Language (SpEL) Injection [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_spring_expression_language__spel__injection__high-risk_.md)

*   **1.1.3. Execute arbitrary code (RCE) or access sensitive data via SpEL. [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:**  An attacker successfully injects a malicious SpEL payload into an application that uses SpEL to evaluate user-provided input without proper validation or sanitization. This typically occurs in web forms or URL parameters within Spring MVC or Thymeleaf templates.
    *   **How it works:**
        *   The attacker crafts a SpEL expression designed to execute system commands or access internal objects/data.  Examples: `T(java.lang.Runtime).getRuntime().exec('command')`, `${systemProperties}`.
        *   The attacker submits this payload through a vulnerable input field.
        *   The application, lacking proper input validation, passes the malicious SpEL expression to the SpEL evaluator.
        *   The SpEL evaluator executes the attacker's code, leading to RCE or unauthorized data access.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:**  Validate *all* user input using a whitelist approach (allow only known-good characters and patterns).  Reject any input that doesn't conform to the expected format.
        *   **Input Sanitization:**  Escape or encode any special characters that have meaning within SpEL.
        *   **Avoid Dynamic SpEL:**  Minimize the use of dynamically generated SpEL expressions based on user input.  If unavoidable, use a tightly controlled context with limited access to objects and methods.
        *   **Whitelisting SpEL Functions:**  If you must use SpEL, restrict the available functions and objects to the absolute minimum required.
        *   **Use a Safer Templating Engine:** Consider alternatives to Thymeleaf that don't rely on SpEL for dynamic content generation if SpEL's full power isn't needed.

*   **1.3.3. Exfiltrate data or modify database content beyond intended scope. [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects a malicious SpEL payload into a Spring Data repository query (often through the `@Query` annotation) that uses dynamic SpEL expressions.
    *   **How it works:**
        *   The application uses a Spring Data repository with a method annotated with `@Query` that incorporates user input into a SpEL expression *without* proper sanitization.
        *   The attacker provides crafted input that manipulates the SpEL expression to alter the query's logic.
        *   The modified query executes against the database, potentially returning data the attacker shouldn't have access to or modifying data in unintended ways.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Avoid Dynamic SpEL in `@Query`:**  Prefer using JPQL or Criteria API for dynamic queries, and *always* use parameterized queries or named parameters.  *Never* directly concatenate user input into the query string.
        *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  If dynamic SpEL is absolutely necessary, rigorously validate and sanitize all user input before incorporating it into the SpEL expression.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Ensure the database user account used by the application has only the minimum necessary permissions.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Leverage Spring Security Misconfigurations [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2__leverage_spring_security_misconfigurations__high-risk_.md)

*   **2.1.4. Bypass authentication using known default accounts or weak passwords. [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access by exploiting default credentials (e.g., "admin/admin", "user/password") that were not changed during deployment or by guessing weak passwords due to a lax password policy.
    *   **How it works:**
        *   The attacker attempts to log in using common default credentials.
        *   Or, the attacker uses password guessing or brute-force techniques against accounts with weak passwords.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Change Default Credentials:**  *Always* change default credentials immediately after installation or deployment.
        *   **Strong Password Policy:**  Enforce a strong password policy that requires a minimum length, complexity (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols), and regular password changes.
        *   **Account Lockout:**  Implement account lockout after a certain number of failed login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.
        *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Implement MFA to add an extra layer of security.

*   **2.3.3. Perform state-changing actions on behalf of the victim user. [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:**  An attacker exploits a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability to trick a logged-in user into performing actions they did not intend. This happens when CSRF protection is disabled or misconfigured.
    *   **How it works:**
        *   The attacker crafts a malicious website or email containing a hidden request to the vulnerable application.
        *   The victim user, who is already authenticated to the vulnerable application, visits the attacker's website or clicks the malicious link.
        *   The user's browser, unknowingly, sends the forged request to the vulnerable application.
        *   The application, lacking CSRF protection, processes the request as if it came from the legitimate user, performing the attacker-specified action (e.g., changing email, transferring funds).
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Enable CSRF Protection:**  Enable Spring Security's built-in CSRF protection.  It's usually enabled by default, but ensure it hasn't been accidentally disabled.
        *   **Synchronizer Token Pattern:**  Ensure that the application uses the synchronizer token pattern correctly.  This involves generating a unique, unpredictable token for each session and including it in all state-changing requests.
        *   **Double Submit Cookie:** Consider using the double-submit cookie pattern as an additional defense, especially for applications that cannot easily use the synchronizer token pattern.

*   **2.4.3. Access resources or execute actions without proper authorization. [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to resources or functionality they should not be authorized to use, due to missing or incorrectly configured authorization checks.
    *   **How it works:**
        *   The application fails to properly check user roles or permissions before granting access to a resource or allowing an action to be performed.  This can be due to missing `@PreAuthorize`, `@PostAuthorize`, or `@Secured` annotations, or incorrect configuration of role-based access control (RBAC).
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Consistent Authorization Checks:**  Apply authorization checks consistently across all sensitive endpoints and methods.  Use `@PreAuthorize`, `@PostAuthorize`, or `@Secured` annotations to enforce role-based or permission-based access control.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant users only the minimum necessary permissions to perform their tasks.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits and code reviews to ensure that authorization checks are correctly implemented and enforced.

*   **2.5.2. Access sensitive information like environment variables, database credentials, or heap dumps. [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** An attacker accesses sensitive information exposed through unprotected Spring Boot Actuator endpoints.
    *   **How it works:**
        *   The application exposes Actuator endpoints (e.g., `/actuator/env`, `/actuator/heapdump`, `/actuator/configprops`) without proper authentication or authorization.
        *   The attacker sends HTTP requests to these endpoints and retrieves sensitive information.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Secure Actuator Endpoints:**  Secure Actuator endpoints using Spring Security.  Require authentication and authorization for access.
        *   **Disable Unnecessary Endpoints:**  Disable any Actuator endpoints that are not strictly required for production monitoring.
        *   **Restrict Access by IP Address:**  If possible, restrict access to Actuator endpoints to specific IP addresses (e.g., monitoring servers).
        *   **Customize Endpoint Exposure:** Use `management.endpoints.web.exposure.include` and `management.endpoints.web.exposure.exclude` properties to control which endpoints are exposed.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Spring Data Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_spring_data_vulnerabilities.md)

*    **3.1.3. Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE). [CRITICAL]**
    *    **Description:** An attacker sends a crafted request containing a malicious serialized object to a Spring Data REST endpoint, triggering unsafe deserialization and leading to remote code execution.
    *    **How it works:**
        *   The application uses a vulnerable version of a library that performs unsafe deserialization of user-provided data (e.g., an older version of Jackson or a library with a known deserialization vulnerability).
        *   The attacker crafts a malicious serialized object that, when deserialized, executes arbitrary code.
        *   The attacker sends this object as part of a request to a Spring Data REST endpoint.
        *   The application deserializes the object, triggering the execution of the attacker's code.
    *    **Mitigation:**
        *   **Avoid Unsafe Deserialization:** Avoid deserializing untrusted data whenever possible.
        *   **Use Safe Deserialization Libraries:** Use secure deserialization libraries and configure them to prevent unsafe deserialization.  For example, use a whitelist of allowed classes for deserialization.
        *   **Keep Libraries Up-to-Date:** Regularly update all dependencies, including Spring Data REST and any libraries used for serialization/deserialization, to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize all incoming data, even if it's expected to be serialized.

*   **3.2.3. Exfiltrate data, modify database content, or gain database access. [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a SQL injection vulnerability in a custom Spring Data repository implementation that uses string concatenation to build SQL queries.
    *   **How it works:**
        *   The application uses a custom repository implementation with a method that constructs SQL queries by concatenating user input *without* using parameterized queries or prepared statements.
        *   The attacker provides crafted input that includes malicious SQL code.
        *   The application executes the concatenated query, including the attacker's SQL code, leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or even database server compromise.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Parameterized Queries:** *Always* use parameterized queries or prepared statements when constructing SQL queries.  This prevents attackers from injecting malicious SQL code.
        *   **ORM Framework:** Utilize the features of your ORM framework (e.g., JPA, Hibernate) to build queries safely.
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize all user input, even if you're using parameterized queries, as an additional layer of defense.

*   **3.3.3 Bypass intended data access restrictions or retrieve unauthorized data. [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** Similar to SQL injection, but targets NoSQL databases (like MongoDB) when using native queries in Spring Data without proper sanitization.
    *   **How it works:**
        *   The application uses native queries (e.g., with `@Query` in Spring Data MongoDB) and constructs these queries using unsanitized user input.
        *   The attacker crafts input that manipulates the query logic, allowing them to bypass intended filters or access data they shouldn't.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Use QueryDSL or Criteria API:** Prefer using type-safe query builders like QueryDSL or the Criteria API provided by Spring Data, which are less susceptible to injection.
        *   **Parameterized Queries (where applicable):** If using native queries, use parameterized queries or the equivalent mechanism provided by your NoSQL database driver to prevent injection.
        *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Rigorously validate and sanitize all user input before incorporating it into any query, even if using parameterized queries.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Spring Boot Auto-Configuration Weaknesses [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_spring_boot_auto-configuration_weaknesses__high-risk_.md)

*   **4.2.3. Achieve RCE, data breaches, or other attacks depending on the vulnerability. [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in a dependency managed by Spring Boot.
    *   **How it works:**
        *   The application uses a Spring Boot version that includes a vulnerable dependency (e.g., a library with a known RCE vulnerability).
        *   The attacker identifies the vulnerability (e.g., through public vulnerability databases) and crafts an exploit.
        *   The attacker sends the exploit to the application, triggering the vulnerability and achieving RCE, data exfiltration, or other malicious actions.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Dependency Scanning:** Use a software composition analysis (SCA) tool or dependency vulnerability scanner (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk, Dependabot) to identify vulnerable dependencies.
        *   **Regular Updates:**  Regularly update Spring Boot and all its managed dependencies to the latest stable versions.  Subscribe to security advisories for Spring and related projects.
        *   **Vulnerability Management Process:**  Establish a process for promptly addressing identified vulnerabilities, including patching, upgrading, or mitigating the risk.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Exploit Spring Cloud Vulnerabilities (if used)](./attack_tree_paths/5__exploit_spring_cloud_vulnerabilities__if_used_.md)

*   **5.1.3. Retrieve sensitive configuration files or other system files. [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a path traversal vulnerability in Spring Cloud Config Server to access files outside the intended configuration directory.
    *   **How it works:**
        *   The application uses a vulnerable version of Spring Cloud Config Server.
        *   The attacker crafts a request with ".." sequences in the URL to navigate to directories outside the configured configuration repository.
        *   The server, lacking proper input validation, serves the requested file, potentially exposing sensitive configuration data or other system files.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Update Spring Cloud Config Server:** Update to a patched version of Spring Cloud Config Server that addresses the path traversal vulnerability.
        *   **Input Validation:**  Implement input validation to prevent path traversal attacks.  Reject any requests containing ".." or other suspicious path segments.
        *   **Least Privilege:**  Ensure that the user account running the Config Server has only the minimum necessary file system permissions.

*   **5.2.3. Achieve RCE or bypass security restrictions. [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects a malicious SpEL payload into a Spring Cloud Gateway route that uses dynamic SpEL expressions.
    *   **How it works:**
        *   The application uses Spring Cloud Gateway with routes that dynamically generate SpEL expressions based on user input (e.g., in filters or predicates).
        *   The attacker crafts a request with a malicious SpEL payload in a header or parameter.
        *   The gateway, lacking proper input validation, evaluates the malicious SpEL expression, leading to RCE or bypassing security restrictions.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Avoid Dynamic SpEL:** Avoid using dynamically generated SpEL expressions in Spring Cloud Gateway routes.  If unavoidable, use a tightly controlled context with limited access.
        *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Rigorously validate and sanitize all user input before incorporating it into any SpEL expression.
        *   **Whitelisting SpEL Functions:** Restrict the available SpEL functions and objects to the absolute minimum required.
        *   **Update Spring Cloud Gateway:** Keep Spring Cloud Gateway up-to-date to address any known SpEL injection vulnerabilities.

*   **5.3.3. Disrupt service discovery, routing, or other microservices functionalities. [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in other Spring Cloud components (like Eureka for service discovery or Zuul for routing) to disrupt the microservices architecture.
    *   **How it works:** The specifics depend on the particular vulnerability in the component. It could involve sending malformed requests, exploiting known bugs, or leveraging misconfigurations.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Keep Components Updated:** Regularly update all Spring Cloud components to the latest stable versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Security Hardening:** Follow security best practices for configuring each component. This includes proper authentication, authorization, and input validation.
        *   **Monitoring:** Monitor the health and behavior of your Spring Cloud components to detect any anomalies or suspicious activity.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use vulnerability scanners to identify potential weaknesses in your Spring Cloud infrastructure.
