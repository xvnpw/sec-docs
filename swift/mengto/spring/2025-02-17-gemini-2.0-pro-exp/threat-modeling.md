# Threat Model Analysis for mengto/spring

## Threat: [In-Memory Code Modification](./threats/in-memory_code_modification.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with local access (compromised account, malware) or a compromised dependency injects malicious code *directly into the running Spring process*. Because Spring preloads and keeps the Rails application running in memory, this injected code persists across requests, creating a highly effective and persistent backdoor. The attacker gains full control over the application's behavior, allowing data theft, manipulation, or further system compromise.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Complete and persistent compromise of application integrity.
        *   Data breaches (reading, modifying, deleting sensitive data).
        *   Potential for lateral movement to other systems.
        *   Long-term, undetected backdoor.
    *   **Affected Spring Component:** `Spring::ApplicationManager` (and, by extension, all loaded Rails application code). This is the core component responsible for managing the preloaded application instance in memory.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mandatory Regular Restarts:** Implement a *strict* policy of restarting Spring frequently (e.g., daily, after significant code changes, after gem updates). This is the *primary* defense, clearing in-memory modifications. Use `spring stop` followed by restarting the Rails server.
        *   **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Use FIM tools to monitor critical application files. While the attack is in-memory, changes to the *source* files should still trigger alerts.
        *   **Rigorous Dependency Management:** Employ `bundler-audit` and keep all dependencies (including Spring) meticulously updated. Use a `Gemfile.lock` for consistent dependency versions.
        *   **Least Privilege Principle:** Run Spring (and the Rails app) with the *absolute minimum* necessary privileges. Never run as root.
        *   **Code Reviews (Preventative):** Thorough code reviews help identify vulnerabilities that *could* be exploited for code injection.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Command Execution via Spring's Client-Server](./threats/unauthorized_command_execution_via_spring's_client-server.md)

*   **Description:** Spring uses a client-server model. The `spring` command (client) communicates with the background Spring server process. An attacker who compromises the communication channel (e.g., local man-in-the-middle, social engineering to run a malicious command) can execute arbitrary commands *within the context of the preloaded application*. This bypasses typical file-based protections.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Arbitrary code execution within the application, leading to data breaches, system compromise, or other malicious actions.
        *   Similar impact to in-memory modification, but potentially easier to exploit if the communication is not secured.
    *   **Affected Spring Component:** `Spring::Client` and `Spring::Server`. These components manage the communication between the `spring` command and the background process.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Restrict Socket Permissions:** Ensure the local socket file used for Spring's communication has highly restrictive permissions, preventing unauthorized access.
        *   **Developer Awareness Training:** Educate developers about the risks of running untrusted commands or scripts, especially those interacting with Spring.
        *   **Process Monitoring:** Actively monitor running processes for suspicious activity related to Spring, including unexpected child processes.
        *   **Regular Spring Restarts:** Frequent restarts (as with in-memory modification) limit the window of opportunity for persistent command execution.

## Threat: [Vulnerability in Spring Leading to Code Execution](./threats/vulnerability_in_spring_leading_to_code_execution.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability *within Spring itself* (e.g., buffer overflow, command injection) is exploited by an attacker to gain code execution on the developer's machine. This is a direct threat stemming from a flaw in Spring's code.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Code execution on the developer's machine, potentially leading to complete system compromise. The severity depends on the vulnerability and Spring's privileges.
    *   **Affected Spring Component:** Any component of Spring could be vulnerable.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (Potentially Critical, depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Immediate Updates:** Keep Spring *absolutely up-to-date*. Use `bundle update spring` regularly and *immediately* upon the release of security patches.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Run Spring with the *minimum* necessary privileges. Never run as root. This limits the impact of a successful exploit.
        *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Actively monitor for security advisories and vulnerability reports related to Spring. Subscribe to relevant mailing lists or security feeds.
        *   **(Optional) Security Audits:** If resources permit, consider periodic security audits of Spring's codebase.
