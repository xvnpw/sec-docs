* **Insecure Deserialization:**
    * **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the deserialization process to execute arbitrary code.
    * **How Spring Contributes:** Spring's dependency injection and object management can involve deserializing objects from various sources. If these sources are untrusted and the deserialization process isn't secured, attackers can craft malicious serialized objects.
    * **Example:** An attacker sends a crafted serialized Java object to an endpoint that Spring deserializes, leading to code execution on the server. This could happen if `@RequestBody` is used with an insecurely configured `ObjectMapper`.
    * **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing the attacker to gain full control of the server.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources if possible.
        * If deserialization is necessary, use secure deserialization libraries or mechanisms.
        * Configure Spring's `ObjectMapper` to disable default typing or use a safe type hierarchy.
        * Implement input validation even before deserialization.
        * Regularly update Spring and its dependencies.

* **Spring Expression Language (SpEL) Injection:**
    * **Description:** Injecting malicious SpEL expressions into parts of the application that evaluate them, leading to code execution or information disclosure.
    * **How Spring Contributes:** Spring uses SpEL in various features like `@Value` annotations, Spring Security expressions, and dynamic queries. If user-controlled input is directly incorporated into SpEL expressions without sanitization, it becomes a vulnerability.
    * **Example:** An attacker manipulates a URL parameter that is used within a `@Value` annotation, injecting a SpEL expression that executes a system command.
    * **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), information disclosure, denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid using user-controlled input directly in SpEL expressions.
        * If necessary, sanitize user input rigorously before using it in SpEL.
        * Consider alternative approaches that don't involve dynamic SpEL evaluation.
        * Apply the principle of least privilege when granting permissions to SpEL evaluation contexts.

* **Spring MVC Data Binding Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Description:** Exploiting how Spring MVC automatically binds request parameters to method arguments or objects to inject malicious data or trigger unexpected behavior.
    * **How Spring Contributes:** Spring MVC's convenient data binding feature can become a vulnerability if input validation is insufficient. Attackers can manipulate request parameters to set unintended fields or values.
    * **Example:** An attacker modifies a request parameter to set an `isAdmin` flag to `true` on a user object during data binding, bypassing authorization checks.
    * **Impact:** Privilege escalation, data manipulation, application logic bypass.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) to explicitly define the structure of expected input and prevent mass assignment.
        * Implement robust input validation using Spring's validation annotations (`@NotNull`, `@Size`, etc.) or custom validators.
        * Avoid directly binding request parameters to sensitive domain objects.
        * Sanitize and validate all user input on the server-side.

* **Path Traversal via Request Mapping:**
    * **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in how Spring MVC maps requests to handlers to access files or directories outside the intended application scope.
    * **How Spring Contributes:** If request mappings are not carefully defined and validated, attackers can manipulate URLs to include path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to access sensitive files.
    * **Example:** An attacker crafts a URL like `/download?file=../../../../etc/passwd` to attempt to download the server's password file.
    * **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential for remote code execution if executable files are accessed.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid using user-controlled input directly in file paths within request handlers.
        * Implement strict input validation and sanitization for file paths.
        * Use whitelisting to allow access only to specific files or directories.
        * Ensure that the application server is configured to prevent access to sensitive directories.

* **Spring Security Misconfigurations:**
    * **Description:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities arising from incorrect or insecure configurations of Spring Security.
    * **How Spring Contributes:** Spring Security provides a powerful framework for authentication and authorization, but misconfigurations can lead to significant security flaws.
    * **Example:**  Disabling CSRF protection without understanding the implications, using default credentials, or having overly permissive access rules.
    * **Impact:** Authentication bypass, authorization bypass, CSRF attacks, session fixation.
    * **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the misconfiguration).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Follow Spring Security best practices and documentation.
        * Implement CSRF protection for state-changing requests.
        * Use strong and unique credentials.
        * Define granular and least-privilege access rules.
        * Regularly review and audit Spring Security configurations.
        * Secure session management (e.g., using HTTPOnly and Secure flags).

* **Exposed Spring Actuator Endpoints:**
    * **Description:** Gaining unauthorized access to Spring Boot Actuator endpoints, which can reveal sensitive information or allow for application manipulation.
    * **How Spring Contributes:** Spring Boot Actuator provides endpoints for monitoring and managing the application. If these endpoints are not properly secured, they become a target for attackers.
    * **Example:** An attacker accesses the `/env` endpoint to view environment variables, potentially revealing database credentials or API keys.
    * **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential for remote code execution or application manipulation depending on the exposed endpoints.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Secure Actuator endpoints using Spring Security.
        * Disable or restrict access to sensitive endpoints in production environments.
        * Use management port configuration to separate management traffic.
        * Consider using Spring Boot Admin for centralized management with enhanced security.
