# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
 - Enhance user experience in iOS and iPadOS applications by automatically managing keyboard interactions.
 - Improve application usability by preventing the software keyboard from obscuring text fields and text views.
 - Simplify development process for iOS developers by providing a reusable component for keyboard management, reducing the need for custom implementations.
 - Increase developer productivity by offering a well-tested and maintained solution, allowing developers to focus on application-specific logic rather than keyboard handling intricacies.

- Business Risks:
 - Potential for library defects to negatively impact user experience in applications using the library, leading to user dissatisfaction.
 - Risk of compatibility issues with future iOS/iPadOS updates, requiring ongoing maintenance and updates to the library.
 - Dependency on a third-party library introduces a potential point of failure or delay in application development if the library is not maintained or becomes unavailable.
 - Limited business impact from security vulnerabilities in the library itself, as it primarily deals with UI interactions and does not handle sensitive data directly. However, vulnerabilities could be exploited to cause denial of service or unexpected UI behavior within applications using the library.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
 - security control: Code hosted on GitHub, providing version control and transparency. (Implemented: GitHub Repository)
 - security control: Open-source license (MIT License), allowing for community review and contributions. (Implemented: LICENSE file in repository)
 - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability identification and patching.
 - accepted risk: Limited formal security testing or audits of the library code.

- Recommended Security Controls:
 - security control: Implement automated dependency scanning to identify and address vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies used by the library.
 - security control: Integrate static application security testing (SAST) tools into the development workflow to automatically detect potential security flaws in the library code.
 - security control: Establish a process for reporting and responding to security vulnerabilities, including a security policy and contact information.
 - security control: Consider code signing the library releases to ensure integrity and authenticity of the distributed component.

- Security Requirements:
 - Authentication: Not applicable. The library itself does not handle authentication. Applications using the library are responsible for their own authentication mechanisms.
 - Authorization: Not applicable. The library does not handle authorization. Applications using the library are responsible for their own authorization mechanisms.
 - Input Validation: The library should handle UI events and input data from text fields and text views safely. While the primary input is UI events, the library should avoid assumptions about the format or content of text data to prevent unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities in applications using it.
 - Cryptography: Not applicable. The library does not require cryptographic operations. Applications using the library are responsible for their own cryptographic needs.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
 - Ensuring a positive user experience in iOS/iPadOS applications by preventing keyboard obstruction of text fields.
 - Maintaining developer productivity by providing a reliable and easy-to-use keyboard management solution.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
 - Source code of the iqkeyboardmanager library: Sensitivity is moderate. Exposure could lead to cloning and redistribution, or potentially reveal implementation details that could be exploited (though unlikely for this type of library).
 - Build artifacts (compiled library): Sensitivity is low to moderate. Integrity is important to ensure users are using the intended and unmodified library.
 - No sensitive user data is processed or stored by the library itself.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
 - What is the target audience for this design document? (e.g., security team, development team, project stakeholders)
 - Are there any specific security compliance requirements that the library or applications using it must adhere to?
 - What is the process for reporting and addressing security vulnerabilities in the library?
 - Are there any existing security policies or guidelines that should be considered for this project?
 - What is the expected lifespan and maintenance plan for the iqkeyboardmanager library?

- Assumptions:
 - The primary goal of the iqkeyboardmanager library is to improve user experience and developer productivity, with security being a secondary but important consideration.
 - The library is intended for use in a wide range of iOS/iPadOS applications, from small to large scale.
 - Security vulnerabilities in the library are considered to have a relatively low direct business impact, but could indirectly affect user trust and application reputation.
 - The development and maintenance of the library are primarily driven by community contributions and the project maintainer.
 - Security best practices for open-source software development are generally followed, but may not be formally documented or rigorously enforced.
