# Threat Model Analysis for hackiftekhar/iqkeyboardmanager

## Threat: [Compromised Library Source Code](./threats/compromised_library_source_code.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises the official `IQKeyboardManager` GitHub repository or its distribution mechanism. They inject malicious code into the library. Developers unknowingly download and integrate this compromised version into their applications. Upon application installation and execution on user devices, the attacker's malicious code runs with application privileges. This could allow the attacker to perform actions such as:
    *   Stealing sensitive user data (credentials, personal information, etc.) from the application's storage or memory.
    *   Modifying application behavior to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.
    *   Gaining control over the user's device through further exploitation.
    *   Distributing malware through application updates.
*   **Impact:** **Critical**. Complete application compromise, large-scale data breach affecting application users, potential user device compromise, severe reputational damage to the application and development team.
*   **Affected Component:** Entire library codebase, specifically during the dependency integration and build process.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**. (Due to the potential for widespread and severe impact if the library is widely adopted and compromised).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Verify Library Integrity:** Before integrating, verify the integrity of the downloaded library using checksums or digital signatures if provided by the maintainers.
    *   **Use Dependency Management Tools with Security Scanning:** Employ dependency management tools (like CocoaPods, Carthage, Swift Package Manager) that offer vulnerability scanning and dependency integrity checks.
    *   **Monitor Official Repository:** Regularly monitor the official `IQKeyboardManager` GitHub repository for any unusual or suspicious activity that might indicate a compromise.
    *   **Code Reviews of Updates:**  Thoroughly review code changes in library updates, especially focusing on security-sensitive areas, before integrating new versions.
    *   **Consider Subresource Integrity (SRI) Principles:** While not directly applicable to native iOS libraries in the same way as web resources, adopt similar principles by verifying the source and integrity of the library at each update.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Library Dependencies leading to Application Compromise](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_library_dependencies_leading_to_application_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** `IQKeyboardManager` relies on third-party dependencies. These dependencies might contain security vulnerabilities. If an attacker discovers and exploits a vulnerability in a dependency used by `IQKeyboardManager`, they could indirectly compromise applications that include `IQKeyboardManager`. The attacker might leverage the vulnerability through `IQKeyboardManager`'s usage of the vulnerable dependency to:
    *   Execute arbitrary code within the application's context.
    *   Bypass security controls implemented by the application.
    *   Gain unauthorized access to application data or resources.
    *   Cause denial of service or application instability.
*   **Impact:** **High**. Potential for arbitrary code execution within the application, unauthorized access to data, significant application instability, and potential for further exploitation of user devices.
*   **Affected Component:** Third-party dependencies used by `IQKeyboardManager`, specifically the vulnerable components within those dependencies as utilized by `IQKeyboardManager`.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**. (Severity is high because exploitation can lead to significant application compromise and potentially affect a large number of users if the vulnerability is widespread and easily exploitable).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Inventory and Monitoring:** Maintain a clear inventory of all third-party dependencies used by `IQKeyboardManager`. Continuously monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for these dependencies.
    *   **Regular Dependency Scanning:** Implement automated dependency scanning tools to proactively identify known vulnerabilities in `IQKeyboardManager`'s dependencies.
    *   **Prompt Dependency Updates:**  Establish a process for promptly updating dependencies to patched versions as soon as security updates are released.
    *   **Evaluate Dependency Security Posture:**  When choosing to use `IQKeyboardManager`, consider the security track record and maintenance status of its dependencies as part of the overall risk assessment.
    *   **Isolate Library Functionality (If Possible and Necessary):** In highly sensitive applications, consider if it's possible to isolate `IQKeyboardManager`'s functionality or limit its permissions to reduce the potential impact of a dependency vulnerability. (This might be complex and require careful evaluation of the library's architecture).
