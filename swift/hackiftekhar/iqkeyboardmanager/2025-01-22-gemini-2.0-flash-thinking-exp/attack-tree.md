## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Logic Bugs in IQKeyboardManager [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_logic_bugs_in_iqkeyboardmanager__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  The attacker aims to find and trigger unexpected behavior in IQKeyboardManager due to flaws in its internal logic. This is a broad category encompassing various specific attack vectors detailed below.
*   **Impact:**  Can range from minor UI glitches to application crashes or resource exhaustion, potentially leading to denial of service or user frustration.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. Cause Incorrect View Adjustment [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__cause_incorrect_view_adjustment__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector 1.1.1: Trigger Edge Case in View Calculation:**
    *   **How:** The attacker crafts a specific UI layout that exposes weaknesses in IQKeyboardManager's algorithm for calculating view adjustments when the keyboard appears.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   Using deeply nested views.
        *   Employing complex layout constraints or auto-layout configurations.
        *   Utilizing dynamic UI elements that change size or position during runtime.
        *   Creating UI with elements near the screen edges or in unusual positions.
    *   **Result:** UI elements might be obscured by the keyboard, overlap, or be positioned incorrectly, leading to a poor user experience or potentially hiding critical information.

*   **Attack Vector 1.1.2: Manipulate View Hierarchy at Runtime:**
    *   **How:** The attacker triggers actions within the application that dynamically modify the UI view hierarchy *after* IQKeyboardManager has initialized and started managing keyboard adjustments.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   Adding or removing input fields dynamically.
        *   Changing the parent-child relationships of views containing input fields.
        *   Using asynchronous UI updates that might race conditions with IQKeyboardManager's logic.
    *   **Result:** IQKeyboardManager might lose track of input fields, apply incorrect adjustments, or fail to adjust the view at all, leading to UI issues and potential data input problems.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2. Trigger Resource Exhaustion [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2__trigger_resource_exhaustion__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector 1.2.1: Cause Infinite Loop or Excessive Calculations:**
    *   **How:** The attacker attempts to create a scenario that forces IQKeyboardManager into an inefficient algorithm, infinite loop, or excessive computational process.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   Rapidly showing and hiding the keyboard repeatedly.
        *   Triggering keyboard events in quick succession while the UI is undergoing complex animations or layout changes.
        *   Interacting with input fields in a way that causes IQKeyboardManager to recalculate view positions excessively.
    *   **Result:**  High CPU usage, memory leaks, battery drain, application unresponsiveness, or even application crashes due to resource starvation.

*   **Attack Vector 1.2.2: Exploit Memory Leaks:**
    *   **How:** The attacker performs actions that cause IQKeyboardManager to allocate memory without properly releasing it, leading to a gradual increase in memory consumption over time.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   Repeatedly focusing and unfocusing input fields.
        *   Navigating through different screens with input fields.
        *   Using the application for extended periods with frequent keyboard interactions.
    *   **Result:**  Application performance degradation over time, eventual application crash due to out-of-memory errors.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3. Exploit State Management Issues [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3__exploit_state_management_issues__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector 1.3.1: Cause State Confusion in Keyboard Tracking:**
    *   **How:** The attacker tries to confuse IQKeyboardManager's internal state management, particularly its tracking of the currently active text field and keyboard visibility.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   Rapidly switching focus between multiple input fields, especially across different parts of the UI (e.g., different view controllers, modal views).
        *   Using custom keyboard handling or keyboard accessory views that might interfere with IQKeyboardManager's state tracking.
        *   Presenting and dismissing modal views or popovers while the keyboard is visible.
    *   **Result:** IQKeyboardManager might apply adjustments to the wrong views, fail to adjust views when needed, or exhibit inconsistent keyboard behavior.

*   **Attack Vector 1.3.2: Bypass Keyboard Dismissal Logic:**
    *   **How:** The attacker attempts to dismiss the keyboard using methods or UI interactions that are outside of IQKeyboardManager's intended control flow.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   Programmatically dismissing the keyboard using system-level APIs instead of IQKeyboardManager's provided methods (if any).
        *   Using custom gesture recognizers that might intercept or interfere with IQKeyboardManager's keyboard dismissal gestures.
        *   Navigating away from a screen with an active keyboard in a way that bypasses IQKeyboardManager's dismissal logic.
    *   **Result:** The keyboard might remain visible when it should be dismissed, potentially obscuring UI elements or causing unexpected behavior when the user expects the keyboard to be gone.
