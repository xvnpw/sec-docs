# Attack Surface Analysis for hackiftekhar/iqkeyboardmanager

## Attack Surface: [Unexpected View Hierarchy Manipulation Leading to Sensitive Data Exposure](./attack_surfaces/unexpected_view_hierarchy_manipulation_leading_to_sensitive_data_exposure.md)

* **Description:** A flaw in IQKeyboardManager's view adjustment logic causes sensitive information, intended to be hidden, to become visible when the keyboard is displayed or dismissed.
    * **How IQKeyboardManager Contributes:** It actively modifies the view hierarchy's layout. A vulnerability in its calculation or implementation can lead to incorrect positioning.
    * **Example:**  When a user focuses on a text field, IQKeyboardManager incorrectly repositions a view containing sensitive data (e.g., partially masked credit card number, security code) making it fully visible.
    * **Impact:** **Critical:** Direct exposure of sensitive user data, potentially leading to financial loss, identity theft, or privacy breaches.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Implement robust UI layering and visibility controls *independent* of IQKeyboardManager. Do not rely solely on off-screen positioning for security. Thoroughly test view adjustments with sensitive data present under various keyboard states and screen sizes. Consider disabling automatic management for views containing highly sensitive information. Regularly audit the library's behavior after updates.

## Attack Surface: [Logic Flaws in Keyboard Event Handling Enabling UI Manipulation or Data Injection](./attack_surfaces/logic_flaws_in_keyboard_event_handling_enabling_ui_manipulation_or_data_injection.md)

* **Description:** Vulnerabilities in how IQKeyboardManager processes keyboard events can be exploited to manipulate the user interface in unintended ways or potentially inject data into unexpected fields.
    * **How IQKeyboardManager Contributes:** It intercepts and processes keyboard-related events to manage view adjustments. Flaws in this processing can be exploited.
    * **Example:** By sending a crafted sequence of keyboard events, an attacker could trigger IQKeyboardManager to focus on a hidden or disabled text field, allowing for unintended data input or the triggering of hidden functionalities.
    * **Impact:** **High:** Potential for unauthorized data modification, bypassing intended UI workflows, or triggering unintended actions.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Keep the library updated to benefit from bug fixes. While direct control over the library's internal event handling is limited, carefully observe and test the application's behavior with various input methods and sequences. Implement strong input validation on all user inputs, regardless of how they are entered. Consider alternative keyboard management solutions if specific vulnerabilities are identified in the library's event handling.

## Attack Surface: [Interaction with Custom Input Accessory Views Leading to Security Bypass](./attack_surfaces/interaction_with_custom_input_accessory_views_leading_to_security_bypass.md)

* **Description:** IQKeyboardManager's interaction with custom input accessory views introduces vulnerabilities that allow bypassing security measures implemented within those custom views.
    * **How IQKeyboardManager Contributes:** It manages the overall keyboard presentation, which includes potentially interacting with custom accessory views. Incompatibilities or flaws in this interaction can be exploited.
    * **Example:** An application uses a custom input accessory view for secure PIN entry. A flaw in IQKeyboardManager's handling of this view allows an attacker to bypass the custom view and input data directly into the underlying text field, circumventing the intended security measures.
    * **Impact:** **High:** Circumvention of security controls, potentially leading to unauthorized access or actions.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**  Thoroughly test the application with custom input accessory views, specifically focusing on security implications. Ensure that IQKeyboardManager's behavior does not interfere with the intended security mechanisms of the custom views. Consider disabling IQKeyboardManager for screens or input fields utilizing critical custom input accessory views where precise control is paramount.
