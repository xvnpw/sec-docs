# Threat Model Analysis for hackiftekhar/iqkeyboardmanager

## Threat: [Malicious View Shifting/Obscuration](./threats/malicious_view_shiftingobscuration.md)

**Description:** An attacker could potentially exploit vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior in `IQKeyboardManager`'s view adjustment logic to shift or obscure legitimate UI elements. This could be achieved by manipulating the application's state or triggering specific keyboard events that cause `IQKeyboardManager` to miscalculate or incorrectly reposition views. The attacker might overlay a fake UI element (e.g., a login prompt) on top of a legitimate one, tricking the user into providing sensitive information.

**Impact:** Credential theft, exposure of sensitive data, unauthorized actions performed by the user on the attacker's behalf.

**Affected Component:** `IQKeyboardManager`'s core view adjustment logic, specifically the methods responsible for calculating and applying view frame changes based on keyboard appearance. This might involve functions within modules like `IQKeyboardManager.swift` or related helper classes handling view geometry.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly test the application's UI with `IQKeyboardManager` enabled across various devices and screen sizes to identify any unexpected view behavior.
*   Implement UI integrity checks on sensitive screens (e.g., login screens) to verify the position and content of critical elements before user interaction.
*   Avoid relying solely on `IQKeyboardManager` for all UI adjustments; consider implementing additional checks and safeguards for critical UI components.
*   Regularly update `IQKeyboardManager` to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
*   Consider alternative, more controlled methods for handling keyboard appearance if the risk is deemed too high for specific sensitive views.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Undisclosed Vulnerabilities in `IQKeyboardManager`](./threats/exploitation_of_undisclosed_vulnerabilities_in__iqkeyboardmanager_.md)

**Description:** Like any software library, `IQKeyboardManager` may contain undiscovered security vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, injection flaws, logic errors). An attacker could potentially discover and exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, cause crashes, or manipulate the application's behavior.

**Impact:** Varies depending on the severity of the vulnerability, ranging from minor disruptions to complete application compromise and data breaches.

**Affected Component:** Any part of the `IQKeyboardManager` codebase containing the vulnerability. This is unpredictable until a specific vulnerability is identified.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Stay informed about known vulnerabilities in `IQKeyboardManager` by monitoring security advisories, release notes, and the library's GitHub repository.
*   Promptly update to the latest stable version of `IQKeyboardManager` to patch any identified vulnerabilities.
*   Implement general security best practices within the application to limit the potential impact of third-party library vulnerabilities (e.g., input validation, principle of least privilege, secure coding practices).
*   Consider using static and dynamic analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
