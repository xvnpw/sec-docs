## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Manipulate View Hierarchy [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_manipulate_view_hierarchy__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This attack vector involves altering the application's view hierarchy at runtime to interfere with `IQKeyboardManager`'s functionality or to achieve other malicious goals.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**
    *   **1.1.1 Inject Malicious Views:**
        *   *Exploit:* Use Objective-C runtime features (e.g., method swizzling) to insert new views into the view hierarchy. These views could obscure sensitive fields, redirect user input, or interfere with `IQKeyboardManager`'s calculations.
        *   *Likelihood:* Low
        *   *Impact:* High
        *   *Effort:* High
        *   *Skill Level:* Advanced
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium
    *   **1.1.2 Alter View Constraints:**
        *   *Exploit:* Modify Auto Layout constraints at runtime to change the position or size of views. This could cause `IQKeyboardManager` to miscalculate the required adjustments, leading to UI issues or exposing sensitive information.
        *   *Likelihood:* Low
        *   *Impact:* Medium
        *   *Effort:* High
        *   *Skill Level:* Advanced
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium
    *   **1.1.3 Subclass and Override:**
        *   *Exploit:* Create malicious subclasses of `UIView` (or related classes) and override methods used by `IQKeyboardManager` for calculations or event handling. This could give the attacker control over how the view hierarchy responds to keyboard events.
        *   *Likelihood:* Low
        *   *Impact:* High
        *   *Effort:* High
        *   *Skill Level:* Advanced
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3 Exploit Incorrect Manual Integration [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_exploit_incorrect_manual_integration__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** This attack vector targets errors made by the developer when integrating `IQKeyboardManager` into the application. These are typically due to misunderstandings of the library's API or incorrect configuration.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**
    *   **1.3.1 Misconfigured `IQKeyboardReturnKeyHandler` [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   *Exploit:* The developer might have incorrectly assigned delegates, implemented incorrect return key logic, or otherwise misconfigured the `IQKeyboardReturnKeyHandler`. This could lead to unexpected navigation, bypass of input validation, or other unintended behavior.
        *   *Likelihood:* Medium
        *   *Impact:* Low to Medium
        *   *Effort:* Low
        *   *Skill Level:* Intermediate
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Easy
    *   **1.3.2 Improper Handling of `keyboardWillShow`/`keyboardWillHide` Notifications [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   *Exploit:* If the developer manually handles keyboard notifications *in addition to* using `IQKeyboardManager`, they might introduce inconsistencies or errors. For example, failing to properly reset the UI after the keyboard hides could leave sensitive information exposed.
        *   *Likelihood:* Medium
        *   *Impact:* Low to Medium
        *   *Effort:* Low
        *   *Skill Level:* Intermediate
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Easy
    *   **1.3.3 Ignoring or Misunderstanding Library Documentation [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   *Exploit:* The developer might have overlooked or misinterpreted important aspects of the `IQKeyboardManager` documentation, leading to insecure configurations or unexpected behavior. This is a broad category encompassing various developer errors.
        *   *Likelihood:* Medium
        *   *Impact:* Variable
        *   *Effort:* Low
        *   *Skill Level:* Intermediate
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1 Keylogging (Indirectly) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_keylogging__indirectly___critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This is a highly sophisticated attack where the attacker attempts to capture user input by placing an invisible overlay over the keyboard. This is *not* a direct vulnerability of `IQKeyboardManager`, but a consequence of abusing its functionality (specifically, manipulating the view hierarchy).
*   **Exploit:**
    *   Leverage view hierarchy manipulation (1.1) to position an invisible view over the keyboard. This view would capture touch events, effectively recording every keystroke the user makes.
    *   *Likelihood:* Very Low
    *   *Impact:* Very High
    *   *Effort:* Very High
    *   *Skill Level:* Expert
    *   *Detection Difficulty:* Very Hard
