    *   Implement robust authentication mechanisms (e.g., strong passwords, multi-factor authentication) for accessing Cartography.
    *   Enforce role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict data access based on user roles and responsibilities.
    *   Secure the Cartography API with proper authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0).
    *   Regularly audit user access and permissions.

## Threat: [Data Exfiltration from Cartography Database](./threats/data_exfiltration_from_cartography_database.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the Cartography database and exfiltrates the entire infrastructure metadata dataset. This could be achieved through database vulnerabilities, compromised credentials, or insecure network access.
*   **Impact:** Massive information disclosure, providing attackers with a comprehensive blueprint of the infrastructure.
*   **Affected Cartography Component:** Database (Neo4j, S3 exports).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Harden the database server and network infrastructure.
    *   Implement strong access controls and monitoring for database access.
    *   Regularly patch and update the database software to address known vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement database activity monitoring and alerting for suspicious data access patterns.
    *   Consider data loss prevention (DLP) measures to detect and prevent data exfiltration.

## Threat: [Compromise of Cartography Collectors](./threats/compromise_of_cartography_collectors.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers compromise the systems running Cartography collectors. This allows them to exfiltrate collected data, inject malicious data, or use the collector's credentials to access and manipulate infrastructure resources directly.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, data manipulation, potential for unauthorized access and control over infrastructure resources.
*   **Affected Cartography Component:** Collectors (modules for AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.), Collector host systems.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Harden the systems running Cartography collectors according to security best practices.
    *   Minimize the privileges granted to collector service accounts to the least necessary for data collection.
    *   Implement network segmentation to isolate collector systems from sensitive infrastructure components.
    *   Regularly monitor collector systems for security vulnerabilities and intrusions.

## Threat: [Compromise of Cartography Service Account](./threats/compromise_of_cartography_service_account.md)

*   **Description:** The service account used by Cartography to collect data is compromised. Attackers can leverage these privileges to gain unauthorized access to infrastructure resources, modify configurations, or escalate privileges further within the infrastructure.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to infrastructure resources, potential for data breaches, service disruption, and privilege escalation.
*   **Affected Cartography Component:** Collectors (modules for AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.), Collector service accounts.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Minimize the privileges granted to the Cartography service account to the least necessary for data collection (Principle of Least Privilege).
    *   Securely manage and store service account credentials (e.g., using secrets management solutions).
    *   Regularly rotate service account credentials.
    *   Implement monitoring and alerting for suspicious activity from the Cartography service account.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Cartography Code](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_cartography_code.md)
