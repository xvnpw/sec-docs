## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Cartography Software Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_cartography_software_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities directly within the Cartography codebase itself.
* **How it Works:**  An attacker identifies and exploits a security flaw in Cartography's Python code, extensions, or libraries it directly manages. This could be through code analysis, fuzzing, or reverse engineering.
* **Potential Impact:**  Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), or data manipulation within Cartography's processes. RCE is the most critical outcome, allowing full system compromise.
* **Mitigation:**
    * Regular security audits and code reviews of Cartography codebase and extensions.
    * Proactive vulnerability scanning and patching.
    * Following secure coding practices in any custom Cartography extensions.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Cartography Dependencies [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_cartography_dependencies__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in third-party Python libraries that Cartography depends on (e.g., `requests`, `neo4j-driver`).
* **How it Works:** Attackers leverage publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) in Cartography's dependencies. They might target specific versions of libraries known to be vulnerable.
* **Potential Impact:**  Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), or data exfiltration, depending on the specific vulnerability in the dependency. RCE is again the most critical impact.
* **Mitigation:**
    * Maintain a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for Cartography dependencies.
    * Implement automated dependency vulnerability scanning.
    * Regularly update Cartography and its dependencies to the latest secure versions.
    * Use dependency management tools to ensure consistent and secure dependency versions.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1. Known Vulnerabilities in Python Libraries (requests, neo4j-driver, etc.) [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1__known_vulnerabilities_in_python_libraries__requests__neo4j-driver__etc____high_risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:**  Specifically targeting known vulnerabilities within Python libraries used by Cartography.
* **How it Works:** Attackers scan for applications using vulnerable versions of libraries like `requests` or `neo4j-driver`. Exploits for these vulnerabilities are often publicly available.
* **Potential Impact:**  Same as 1.2 - RCE, DoS, Data Exfiltration.
* **Mitigation:**  Same as 1.2 - SBOM, vulnerability scanning, dependency updates.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1.1. RCE via vulnerable library [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_1__rce_via_vulnerable_library__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Achieving Remote Code Execution by exploiting a vulnerability in a Python library used by Cartography.
* **How it Works:**  An attacker crafts a malicious input or triggers a specific condition that exploits a known RCE vulnerability in a dependency. This could involve manipulating network requests, data processed by the library, or other attack vectors specific to the vulnerability.
* **Potential Impact:**  Critical - Full system compromise, allowing the attacker to control the server running Cartography, access sensitive data, and potentially pivot to other systems.
* **Mitigation:**
    * **Primary:** Patch vulnerable libraries immediately.
    * **Secondary:** Implement network segmentation to limit the impact of compromise.
    * **Tertiary:** Implement robust intrusion detection and prevention systems to detect and block exploit attempts.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Abuse Cartography Configuration and Deployment [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2__abuse_cartography_configuration_and_deployment__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Exploiting weaknesses in how Cartography is configured and deployed, rather than vulnerabilities in the software itself.
* **How it Works:** Attackers target common misconfigurations, such as weak credentials, insecure network settings, or overly permissive permissions.
* **Potential Impact:**  Unauthorized access to Neo4j database, data exfiltration, data manipulation, Denial of Service, and potentially broader cloud infrastructure compromise.
* **Mitigation:**
    * Follow secure configuration and deployment best practices.
    * Implement infrastructure-as-code for consistent and auditable deployments.
    * Regularly audit Cartography and Neo4j configurations for security weaknesses.
    * Use automated configuration management tools to enforce secure settings.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1. Weak or Default Neo4j Credentials [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1__weak_or_default_neo4j_credentials__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Using weak, default, or easily guessable credentials to access the Neo4j database used by Cartography.
* **How it Works:** Attackers attempt to log in to Neo4j using common default usernames and passwords (e.g., `neo4j/neo4j`), or through brute-force attacks if weak passwords are used.
* **Potential Impact:**  High - Unauthorized access to the entire Cartography data store in Neo4j. This allows data exfiltration, manipulation, and potentially DoS by corrupting the database.
* **Mitigation:**
    * **Strong, Unique Passwords:** Enforce strong, unique passwords for Neo4j users.
    * **Password Rotation:** Implement regular password rotation policies.
    * **Key-Based Authentication:** Consider using key-based authentication if supported by Neo4j.
    * **Secure Credential Management:** Store Neo4j credentials securely using secrets management solutions, not in configuration files.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1. Unauthorized Access to Neo4j Database [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1__unauthorized_access_to_neo4j_database__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:**  Gaining unauthorized access to the Neo4j database, regardless of the specific method (weak credentials, network exposure, etc.).
* **How it Works:** Once an attacker gains access to Neo4j, they can execute Cypher queries to read, modify, or delete data.
* **Potential Impact:**  High - Data exfiltration of sensitive infrastructure information, data manipulation leading to inaccurate infrastructure views, Denial of Service by corrupting or deleting data.
* **Mitigation:**
    * **Prevent Unauthorized Access:** Implement all mitigations for weak credentials, network exposure, and other access control weaknesses.
    * **Neo4j Access Control:** Utilize Neo4j's built-in access control mechanisms to restrict user permissions within the database.
    * **Audit Logging:** Enable and monitor Neo4j audit logs to detect and investigate unauthorized access attempts.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2. Insecure Neo4j Network Exposure [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2_2__insecure_neo4j_network_exposure__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Exposing the Neo4j database ports (7687, 7474, 7473) directly to the internet or untrusted networks.
* **How it Works:** Attackers can scan for open Neo4j ports and attempt to connect directly to the database from external networks.
* **Potential Impact:**  High - Unauthorized access to Neo4j, as in 2.1.1, if coupled with weak credentials or lack of authentication.
* **Mitigation:**
    * **Network Segmentation:** Isolate Neo4j within a private network, accessible only from authorized application servers.
    * **Firewall Rules:** Implement strict firewall rules to block external access to Neo4j ports.
    * **VPN/Bastion Hosts:** Use VPNs or bastion hosts for secure remote access to Neo4j if needed for administration.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.1. Direct Internet Exposure of Neo4j port (7687, 7474, 7473) [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_1__direct_internet_exposure_of_neo4j_port__7687__7474__7473___high_risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Specifically, the misconfiguration of directly exposing Neo4j ports to the public internet.
* **How it Works:**  Cloud misconfigurations, firewall errors, or lack of awareness can lead to Neo4j ports being publicly accessible.
* **Potential Impact:**  Same as 2.2 - Unauthorized access to Neo4j.
* **Mitigation:**  Same as 2.2 - Network segmentation, firewall rules, regular security audits of network configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.3. Misconfigured Cartography Permissions [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2_3__misconfigured_cartography_permissions__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Granting Cartography overly permissive IAM roles or service principals in cloud environments (AWS, Azure, GCP).
* **How it Works:**  If Cartography is given excessive permissions, an attacker who compromises Cartography (through any means) can leverage these permissions to access and manipulate resources beyond Cartography's intended scope within the cloud provider.
* **Potential Impact:**  High to Critical - Data exfiltration from cloud providers beyond infrastructure metadata, resource manipulation (e.g., creating/deleting instances, modifying configurations), potentially leading to significant financial or operational damage.
* **Mitigation:**
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant Cartography only the minimum necessary permissions required for its data collection tasks.
    * **Regular Permission Reviews:** Periodically review and refine Cartography's IAM roles and service principals.
    * **Permission Boundaries:** Implement permission boundaries to limit the scope of Cartography's permissions.
    * **Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM):** Use CSPM tools to monitor and enforce least privilege and identify overly permissive IAM roles.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.3.1. Overly Permissive IAM Roles/Service Principals for Cartography [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2_3_1__overly_permissive_iam_rolesservice_principals_for_cartography__high_risk_path___critical_node_5ea22e1c.md)

* **Attack Vector:**  Specifically, the misconfiguration of assigning IAM roles or service principals with excessive privileges to Cartography.
* **How it Works:**  Often happens due to convenience during initial setup or lack of understanding of least privilege principles.
* **Potential Impact:**  Same as 2.3 - Broader cloud compromise.
* **Mitigation:**  Same as 2.3 - Principle of least privilege, regular reviews, permission boundaries, CSPM.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Abuse Cartography API/Interface (if application exposes API) [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/4__abuse_cartography_apiinterface__if_application_exposes_api___high_risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities or lack of security in an API that exposes Cartography data to the application or external users.
* **How it Works:** If the application developers create an API to access data stored in Neo4j by Cartography, this API becomes a new attack surface. Vulnerabilities can include lack of authentication, authorization bypass, injection flaws, or DoS vulnerabilities.
* **Potential Impact:**  Medium to High - Data exfiltration of infrastructure information via the API, potential data manipulation if the API allows write operations, Denial of Service of the API.
* **Mitigation:**
    * **Secure API Design:** Follow secure API development principles.
    * **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for the API.
    * **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all API inputs to prevent injection attacks.
    * **Rate Limiting and DoS Protection:** Implement rate limiting and other DoS prevention measures for the API.
    * **API Security Testing:** Conduct regular security testing of the API, including penetration testing and vulnerability scanning.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.1. Lack of Authentication/Authorization on Cartography API [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/4_1__lack_of_authenticationauthorization_on_cartography_api__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:**  Failing to implement proper authentication and authorization for the Cartography API.
* **How it Works:**  If the API is exposed without authentication, anyone can access it. If authorization is missing or weak, users might be able to access data they shouldn't.
* **Potential Impact:**  Medium to High - Unauthorized access to Cartography data via the API, leading to data exfiltration.
* **Mitigation:**
    * **Implement Authentication:** Use strong authentication methods like API keys, OAuth 2.0, or JWT.
    * **Implement Authorization:** Enforce granular authorization to control access to specific API endpoints and data based on user roles or permissions.
    * **Regular Security Reviews:** Review API security configurations and access controls regularly.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.1.1. Unauthorized Access to Cartography Data via API [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/4_1_1__unauthorized_access_to_cartography_data_via_api__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:**  Achieving unauthorized access to Cartography data through a poorly secured API.
* **How it Works:**  Attackers exploit the lack of authentication or authorization on the API to directly access and retrieve sensitive infrastructure information.
* **Potential Impact:**  Medium to High - Data exfiltration of infrastructure information, potentially leading to further attacks based on the exposed data.
* **Mitigation:**  Same as 4.1 - Implement authentication and authorization, regular security reviews.
