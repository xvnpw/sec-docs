### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 2.3.1. Overly Permissive IAM Roles/Service Principals for Cartography

#### 4.1. Detailed Explanation of the Attack Vector

The core attack vector lies in the **misconfiguration of IAM roles or service principals** used by Cartography.  This misconfiguration manifests as granting permissions that exceed what Cartography *actually needs* to perform its intended functions.

**Specifically, this means:**

* **Granting broad "wildcard" permissions:**  Instead of specifying granular permissions for specific resources and actions, administrators might use wildcard permissions like `"*"` or broad service-level permissions (e.g., `ec2:*`, `s3:*`, `storage:*`).
* **Assigning overly powerful pre-defined roles:**  Using managed policies or built-in roles that grant significantly more permissions than required (e.g., `AdministratorAccess`, `Contributor`, `Owner`).
* **Accumulation of unnecessary permissions over time:**  Permissions might be added incrementally for troubleshooting or new features without subsequent review and removal of redundant or excessive permissions.
* **Lack of understanding of least privilege:**  Administrators may not fully understand the principle of least privilege or the specific permissions Cartography requires, leading to over-provisioning out of convenience or perceived necessity.

This misconfiguration creates an opportunity for attackers to leverage Cartography's compromised credentials (if they are able to gain access to them) to perform actions far beyond the intended scope of Cartography's operation.

#### 4.2. Step-by-Step Breakdown of "How it Works"

1. **Initial Misconfiguration:**  During the setup or configuration of Cartography, an administrator grants an IAM role or service principal with overly permissive permissions to allow Cartography to collect data from the cloud environment. This might be done quickly for initial setup or due to a lack of understanding of least privilege.

2. **Compromise of Cartography Instance/Credentials (Out of Scope of this Path, but relevant context):**  While this specific attack path focuses on *misconfiguration*, it's important to understand how an attacker might *use* this misconfiguration.  An attacker could potentially compromise the Cartography instance itself (e.g., through vulnerabilities in the underlying infrastructure, exposed services, or compromised credentials of the Cartography application). Alternatively, they might target the credentials used by Cartography if they are improperly stored or managed.

3. **Credential Harvesting (If Necessary):** If the attacker compromises the Cartography instance, they might attempt to harvest the IAM role credentials or service principal credentials being used by Cartography. This could involve accessing configuration files, environment variables, or leveraging instance metadata services (in cloud environments).

4. **Exploitation of Overly Permissive Permissions:**  Once the attacker has access to the Cartography's credentials (or if they directly compromise the Cartography instance and leverage its assumed role), they can now utilize the *excessive permissions* granted to that role/principal.

5. **Malicious Actions:**  With overly permissive permissions, the attacker can perform a wide range of malicious actions, depending on the specific permissions granted. Examples include:

    * **Data Exfiltration:** Accessing and downloading sensitive data from storage services (e.g., S3 buckets, Azure Blob Storage, GCP Cloud Storage), databases, or other cloud resources that Cartography has access to.
    * **Resource Manipulation/Destruction:** Modifying or deleting critical cloud resources (e.g., EC2 instances, VMs, databases, network configurations) if Cartography's role has permissions to do so.
    * **Privilege Escalation:** Using the compromised role to further escalate privileges within the cloud environment, potentially by creating new IAM users or roles with even broader permissions, or by modifying existing IAM policies.
    * **Lateral Movement:**  Using the compromised role to access other cloud services or resources that were not originally intended to be within Cartography's scope, potentially pivoting to other parts of the cloud infrastructure.
    * **Denial of Service:**  Disrupting cloud services by stopping instances, deleting resources, or modifying configurations.
    * **Cryptojacking:**  Launching cryptocurrency mining instances using the compromised credentials and cloud resources.

6. **Broader Cloud Compromise:**  The cumulative effect of these malicious actions can lead to a broader cloud compromise, impacting data confidentiality, integrity, and availability, and potentially causing significant financial and reputational damage.

#### 4.3. In-depth Analysis of "Potential Impact": Broader Cloud Compromise

The "Potential Impact: Same as 2.3 - Broader cloud compromise" highlights the severity of this attack path.  "Broader cloud compromise" in this context means that an attacker, by exploiting overly permissive Cartography IAM roles/service principals, can extend their reach beyond simply accessing Cartography's data. They can potentially:

* **Gain control over critical infrastructure:**  If Cartography's role has permissions to manage compute, network, or storage resources, an attacker can disrupt operations, deploy malicious infrastructure, or exfiltrate sensitive data from various parts of the cloud environment.
* **Bypass security controls:**  Overly permissive roles can effectively bypass other security controls in place, as the attacker is operating with legitimate (albeit misconfigured) credentials. This can make detection more challenging.
* **Establish persistence:**  Attackers can use overly permissive roles to create backdoors, modify configurations for persistent access, or create new administrative accounts, ensuring continued access even after the initial compromise is detected.
* **Impact multiple services and applications:**  Cloud environments are often interconnected. Compromising a role with broad permissions can allow an attacker to pivot and impact multiple services and applications running within the same cloud account or organization.
* **Compliance violations:**  Data breaches and unauthorized access resulting from this attack path can lead to significant compliance violations and regulatory penalties.

**Example Scenario:**

Imagine Cartography is granted the `AmazonEC2FullAccess` managed policy in AWS for ease of setup.  While Cartography might only need `ec2:Describe*` permissions to inventory EC2 instances, `AmazonEC2FullAccess` allows *all* EC2 actions. If an attacker compromises Cartography's credentials, they could:

* Launch new, expensive EC2 instances for cryptojacking.
* Terminate critical production EC2 instances causing service outages.
* Modify security groups to open up unauthorized access to other resources.
* Create snapshots of EBS volumes containing sensitive data.

This example demonstrates how seemingly minor over-permissioning can have severe consequences.

#### 4.4. Specific Mitigation Strategies for Cartography

While the general mitigations mentioned (Principle of Least Privilege, Regular Reviews, Permission Boundaries, CSPM) are valid, here's how they specifically apply to Cartography deployments:

* **Principle of Least Privilege - Granular Permissions:**
    * **Identify Minimum Required Permissions:**  Thoroughly document and understand the *absolute minimum* permissions Cartography needs for each cloud service it interacts with. This should be based on its actual functionality (data collection, graph database interaction) and not on assumptions or convenience.
    * **Use Granular Policies:**  Create custom IAM policies (or equivalent in Azure/GCP) that explicitly list only the necessary permissions. Avoid wildcard permissions and broad managed policies.
    * **Service-Specific Permissions:**  Focus on service-specific permissions (e.g., `ec2:DescribeInstances`, `s3:ListBucket`, `storage.objects.get` in GCP) instead of broad service-level or wildcard permissions.
    * **Resource-Level Permissions (Where Possible):**  If feasible, further restrict permissions to specific resources (e.g., specific S3 buckets, specific resource groups) instead of granting access across the entire cloud account.

* **Regular Reviews and Audits:**
    * **Periodic IAM Role/Service Principal Reviews:**  Establish a schedule for regularly reviewing the permissions granted to Cartography's IAM roles/service principals. This should be triggered by changes in Cartography's configuration, updates, or new feature deployments.
    * **Automated Permission Auditing:**  Utilize tools (including CSPM solutions) to automatically audit and report on IAM role/service principal permissions, highlighting deviations from the principle of least privilege and potential over-permissioning.
    * **Logging and Monitoring:**  Monitor API calls made by Cartography's IAM roles/service principals to detect any unusual or unauthorized activity.

* **Permission Boundaries:**
    * **Implement Permission Boundaries (AWS):**  In AWS, consider using permission boundaries to further restrict the maximum permissions that can be granted to Cartography's IAM roles, even if a policy inadvertently grants excessive permissions. This acts as a safety net.
    * **Resource Quotas and Constraints (Azure/GCP):**  Explore similar mechanisms in Azure and GCP (like Azure Policy or GCP Organization Policies) to enforce constraints on resource access and prevent overly permissive configurations.

* **Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM):**
    * **CSPM Tool Integration:**  Integrate a CSPM solution to continuously monitor and assess the security posture of the cloud environment, including IAM configurations. CSPM tools can automatically detect overly permissive roles and provide remediation recommendations.
    * **Automated Remediation:**  Where possible, leverage CSPM tools to automatically remediate identified misconfigurations, such as overly permissive IAM roles, by suggesting or automatically applying least privilege policies.

* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**
    * **Define IAM Roles/Service Principals in IaC:**  Manage the creation and configuration of Cartography's IAM roles/service principals using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation). This promotes consistency, version control, and reviewability of IAM configurations.
    * **Code Reviews for IAM Changes:**  Implement code review processes for any changes to IAM configurations defined in IaC to ensure that least privilege principles are followed and that changes are properly vetted.

* **Principle of Segregation of Duties:**
    * **Separate Roles for Different Functions (If Applicable):**  If Cartography performs different functions with varying permission requirements (e.g., initial discovery vs. continuous monitoring), consider using separate IAM roles/service principals with more narrowly scoped permissions for each function.
