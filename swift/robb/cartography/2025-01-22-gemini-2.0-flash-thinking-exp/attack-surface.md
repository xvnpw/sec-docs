# Attack Surface Analysis for robb/cartography

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Data Source Credentials](./attack_surfaces/compromised_data_source_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to credentials (API keys, access keys, service account keys) used *by Cartography* to connect to and collect data from various cloud providers and other data sources.
*   **Cartography Contribution:** Cartography *requires* and *manages* these sensitive credentials.  Vulnerabilities in how Cartography handles or stores these credentials directly leads to this attack surface.
*   **Example:** Cartography's configuration management exposes AWS access keys in plaintext within log files or a publicly accessible directory. Attackers find these exposed keys and compromise the AWS environment.
*   **Impact:** Critical. Full compromise of cloud infrastructure, data breaches, resource manipulation, denial of service, and potential lateral movement within the cloud environment.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Credential Management within Cartography:** Implement robust secrets management *within the Cartography deployment*.  Ensure Cartography itself does not store credentials in plaintext in configuration files, logs, or memory.
    *   **Utilize Secrets Management Solutions:** Integrate Cartography with external secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, GCP Secret Manager) to retrieve credentials dynamically instead of storing them directly.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Cartography:** Grant Cartography service accounts and API keys only the minimum necessary permissions required for data collection.
    *   **Regular Security Audits of Cartography Configuration:** Regularly audit Cartography's configuration and deployment to ensure secure credential handling practices are enforced.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities present in third-party Python libraries and dependencies *used by Cartography*. Exploiting these vulnerabilities can directly compromise the Cartography application and potentially the underlying infrastructure data it manages.
*   **Cartography Contribution:** Cartography *directly depends* on numerous open-source Python libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies become vulnerabilities within the Cartography application itself.
*   **Example:** A critical remote code execution vulnerability is discovered in a Python library used by Cartography for data processing. Attackers exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious input to Cartography, gaining control of the server running Cartography and potentially accessing the Neo4j database.
*   **Impact:** High. Remote code execution on the Cartography server, data breach of collected infrastructure information, denial of service, and potential lateral movement within the network.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Automated Dependency Scanning for Cartography:** Implement automated dependency scanning tools specifically for the Cartography application to continuously monitor for known vulnerabilities in its dependencies.
    *   **Proactive Dependency Updates:** Establish a process for promptly updating Cartography's dependencies, especially security patches, as soon as they are released.
    *   **Vulnerability Monitoring and Alerting:** Set up alerts for newly discovered vulnerabilities in Cartography's dependencies to enable rapid response and patching.
    *   **Supply Chain Security Practices:**  Implement practices to verify the integrity and security of Cartography's dependencies throughout the development and deployment lifecycle.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Configuration Practices (Cartography Application)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_configuration_practices__cartography_application_.md)

*   **Description:** Insecure configuration of the *Cartography application itself*, leading to vulnerabilities that can be directly exploited to compromise Cartography and its data.
*   **Cartography Contribution:** Cartography's security posture is directly determined by its configuration. Insecure configuration choices made during deployment directly create attack vectors.
*   **Example:** Cartography's web interface (if enabled or extended) is deployed with default, weak authentication or authorization mechanisms. Attackers exploit this weak security to gain unauthorized access to Cartography's data or administrative functions.
*   **Impact:** High. Unauthorized access to Cartography's data and functionalities, potential data manipulation, denial of service, and compromise of the Cartography application itself.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Configuration by Default:**  Harden Cartography's configuration by following security best practices and avoiding insecure default settings.
    *   **Principle of Least Functionality:** Disable or remove any unnecessary features or interfaces in Cartography that are not required for its intended purpose to reduce the attack surface.
    *   **Regular Configuration Reviews:** Conduct regular security reviews of Cartography's configuration to identify and remediate any potential misconfigurations or insecure settings.
    *   **Configuration as Code and Version Control:** Manage Cartography's configuration as code and store it in version control to track changes and ensure consistent and auditable configurations.
