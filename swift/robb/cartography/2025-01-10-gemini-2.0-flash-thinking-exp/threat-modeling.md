# Threat Model Analysis for robb/cartography

## Threat: [Insecure Credential Management for Data Sources](./threats/insecure_credential_management_for_data_sources.md)

**Description:** Cartography stores credentials (API keys, access tokens, etc.) for accessing data sources in an insecure manner, such as plain text in configuration files, environment variables without proper protection, or a weakly protected secrets manager. An attacker gaining access to the Cartography host or its configuration could retrieve these credentials.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the data sources Cartography has access to, allowing the attacker to read, modify, or delete resources within those environments. This could lead to significant data breaches, service disruption, and financial loss.

**Affected Component:** Credential Loading Mechanism (within various Data Ingestion Modules)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Utilize secure secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) to store and manage credentials.
*   Avoid storing credentials directly in configuration files or environment variables.
*   Encrypt credentials at rest and in transit.
*   Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for accessing the secrets management system.
*   Regularly rotate credentials used by Cartography.

## Threat: [Insecure Storage of Collected Data](./threats/insecure_storage_of_collected_data.md)

**Description:** The database used by Cartography (e.g., Neo4j) is not properly secured, leading to unauthorized access to the collected infrastructure and security data. This includes risks like default credentials, publicly accessible instances, unpatched vulnerabilities in the database software, or insufficient access controls.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information about the organization's infrastructure, security posture, and potentially compliance status. This data could be used for further attacks or sold on the dark web.

**Affected Component:** Data Storage Module (specifically how Cartography interacts with the configured database like Neo4j)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Change default credentials for the database.
*   Ensure the database is not publicly accessible and is behind a firewall.
*   Regularly patch and update the database software.
*   Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing the database.
*   Encrypt the database at rest and in transit.
*   Regularly back up the database and store backups securely.

## Threat: [Data Breach of Cartography's Database](./threats/data_breach_of_cartography's_database.md)

**Description:** An attacker directly targets the database storing Cartography's data through methods like exploiting database vulnerabilities, SQL injection (if applicable), or gaining access to the underlying infrastructure.

**Impact:** Large-scale exposure of sensitive infrastructure and security data, potentially impacting the security of the entire organization.

**Affected Component:** Data Storage Module, Database Interaction Layer

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Follow database security best practices (as outlined in the previous threat).
*   Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) to monitor database access.
*   Regularly perform vulnerability scanning on the database infrastructure.
*   Enforce the principle of least privilege for database access.

## Threat: [Weak Authentication for Cartography Interface](./threats/weak_authentication_for_cartography_interface.md)

**Description:** If Cartography exposes a web interface or API for interaction, and this interface has weak authentication mechanisms (e.g., default credentials, lack of multi-factor authentication), unauthorized users could access and potentially manipulate the collected data or the Cartography instance itself.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive infrastructure data, potential for attackers to modify or delete data within Cartography, and the ability to disrupt Cartography's operation.

**Affected Component:** User Interface Module (if applicable), API Endpoints

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong password policies and enforce regular password changes.
*   Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all user accounts accessing Cartography.
*   Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive features and data.
*   Secure the web interface with HTTPS and proper security headers.

## Threat: [Data Tampering in the Storage Layer](./threats/data_tampering_in_the_storage_layer.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the database and modifies the collected data. This could involve altering information about resource configurations, security findings, or relationships between resources.

**Impact:** Inaccurate representation of the infrastructure, leading to incorrect security assessments, flawed decision-making, and potentially masking malicious activity.

**Affected Component:** Data Storage Module, Database Interaction Layer

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong authentication and authorization for database access.
*   Enable database auditing to track changes to the data.
*   Implement data integrity checks to detect unauthorized modifications.
*   Regularly compare the data in Cartography with the source of truth (the actual cloud environments) to identify discrepancies.
