## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Exploit overly permissive rules to gain unauthorized access

This analysis focuses on the attack path: **Exploit overly permissive rules to gain unauthorized access**, within the context of a Cartography deployment. We'll break down each step, analyze the potential vulnerabilities, and discuss mitigation strategies.

**ATTACK TREE PATH:**

**Compromise Application via Cartography -> Exploit Cartography's Data Storage -> Direct Access to Cartography's Database -> Misconfigured Database Access Control -> Exploit overly permissive rules to gain unauthorized access**

**Understanding the Context:**

* **Cartography:** An open-source Python application that consolidates and visualizes infrastructure assets and their relationships across various cloud providers and systems. It typically interacts with sensitive data to build this graph.
* **Database:** Cartography relies on a database (often Neo4j) to store the collected infrastructure data. This database is the ultimate target for the attacker in this scenario.
* **Overly Permissive Rules:** This refers to misconfigurations in the database's access control mechanisms, granting more privileges than necessary to certain users or roles.

**Detailed Analysis of Each Stage:**

**1. Compromise Application via Cartography:**

* **Description:** The attacker's initial goal is to gain a foothold within the Cartography application itself. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in Cartography's code, its dependencies, or the underlying infrastructure it runs on.
* **Potential Attack Vectors:**
    * **Web Application Vulnerabilities (if applicable):** If Cartography exposes a web interface (even for internal use), common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), or authentication bypass could be exploited.
    * **Dependency Vulnerabilities:** Outdated or vulnerable libraries used by Cartography could be exploited.
    * **API Vulnerabilities:** If Cartography exposes an API for data ingestion or management, vulnerabilities in the API endpoints or authentication mechanisms could be targeted.
    * **Credential Compromise:** Obtaining legitimate credentials for a Cartography user through phishing, social engineering, or data breaches.
    * **Supply Chain Attacks:** Compromising a component or dependency used during Cartography's development or deployment.
    * **Container/Orchestration Vulnerabilities:** If Cartography runs in containers (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes), vulnerabilities in the container runtime or orchestration platform could be exploited.
* **Impact:** Successful compromise allows the attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code, access configuration files, or interact with the database indirectly through Cartography's functionalities.

**2. Exploit Cartography's Data Storage:**

* **Description:** Once inside the Cartography application, the attacker aims to access the data Cartography collects and stores. This data often includes sensitive information about the organization's infrastructure.
* **Potential Attack Vectors:**
    * **Direct File System Access:** If the attacker gains sufficient privileges on the server running Cartography, they might be able to directly access configuration files, log files, or even the database files (if not properly secured).
    * **Exploiting Cartography's Data Access Logic:**  Flaws in how Cartography retrieves, processes, or stores data could be exploited to extract information beyond intended access controls. This could involve manipulating API calls or exploiting data sanitization issues.
    * **Abuse of Functionality:** Misusing Cartography's intended features (e.g., data export functionalities) to extract large amounts of data.
    * **Leaking Secrets:** If Cartography stores credentials or API keys in plaintext or poorly encrypted formats, the attacker could extract these secrets.
* **Impact:** Access to Cartography's data storage provides valuable information about the target's infrastructure, including server names, IP addresses, relationships between services, and potentially credentials. This information is crucial for planning further attacks.

**3. Direct Access to Cartography's Database:**

* **Description:** The attacker now attempts to directly connect to the underlying database used by Cartography, bypassing the application layer.
* **Potential Attack Vectors:**
    * **Obtained Database Credentials:** The most direct route is to acquire the database credentials used by Cartography. This could be achieved through:
        * Extracting credentials from Cartography's configuration files (if not properly secured).
        * Memory dumps of the Cartography process.
        * Exploiting vulnerabilities in Cartography that reveal these credentials.
    * **Network Access Exploitation:** If the database is accessible from the network where the compromised Cartography instance resides, the attacker might attempt to brute-force credentials or exploit known database vulnerabilities.
    * **Tunneling/Port Forwarding:** Using the compromised Cartography instance as a pivot point to tunnel into the network where the database is located.
* **Impact:** Direct database access grants the attacker the ability to interact with the data without the limitations imposed by the Cartography application. This allows for more powerful queries and data manipulation.

**4. Misconfigured Database Access Control:**

* **Description:** This stage highlights a critical security weakness in the database configuration. The database's access control mechanisms are not properly configured, allowing unauthorized access based on the attacker's acquired credentials or network position.
* **Potential Misconfigurations:**
    * **Default Credentials:** The database is using default or easily guessable credentials.
    * **Weak Passwords:** User accounts have weak or compromised passwords.
    * **Overly Broad Network Access:** The database is accessible from a wider network range than necessary.
    * **Lack of Authentication Mechanisms:** The database might not require authentication for certain connections.
    * **Insufficient Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Users or roles have excessive privileges beyond what they need for their intended functions.
* **Impact:** This misconfiguration is the key enabler for the final stage of the attack. It allows the attacker, who has gained access through the previous steps, to leverage these overly permissive rules.

**5. Exploit overly permissive rules to gain unauthorized access:**

* **Description:** The attacker leverages the identified misconfigurations in the database's access control to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or perform unauthorized actions.
* **Potential Exploitations:**
    * **Data Exfiltration:** Accessing and extracting sensitive infrastructure data stored in the database. This could include details about servers, networks, security configurations, and potentially even credentials.
    * **Data Manipulation:** Modifying or deleting data within the database, potentially disrupting Cartography's functionality or hiding the attacker's presence.
    * **Privilege Escalation:** If the attacker gains access with a user account that has overly broad privileges, they might be able to create new administrative accounts or grant themselves further permissions within the database.
    * **Lateral Movement:** Using the information gathered from the database to further compromise other systems within the network. The relationships visualized by Cartography can be particularly useful for this.
* **Impact:** This is the final objective of the attack path. The attacker gains unauthorized access to sensitive data, potentially causing significant damage, data breaches, and reputational harm.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To prevent this attack path, a multi-layered approach is necessary:

**General Security Practices for Cartography Deployments:**

* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the necessary permissions to users, applications, and services interacting with Cartography and its database.
