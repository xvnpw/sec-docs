## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Attempt Default or Common Credentials for the Database

This analysis focuses on the following attack tree path targeting an application utilizing the Cartography project (https://github.com/robb/cartography):

**Attack Tree Path:**

* **Compromise Application via Cartography**
* **Exploit Cartography's Data Storage**
* **Direct Access to Cartography's Database**
* **Weak Database Credentials**
* **Attempt default or common credentials for the database**

This path highlights a critical vulnerability stemming from insecure database credentials used by Cartography. Let's break down each stage and analyze the implications for the application.

**1. Compromise Application via Cartography:**

* **How it's achieved:** An attacker first gains a foothold in the application environment. This could happen through various means, such as:
    * **Exploiting vulnerabilities in the application itself:**  SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), remote code execution (RCE) flaws.
    * **Social engineering:** Phishing attacks targeting application users or administrators.
    * **Compromising infrastructure:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the servers, networks, or cloud environment hosting the application.
    * **Supply chain attacks:** Compromising dependencies or third-party libraries used by the application.
* **Why Cartography is relevant:** Once inside the application environment, an attacker might discover the presence of Cartography. Cartography, by its nature, collects and stores sensitive information about the infrastructure and assets connected to the application. This makes it a valuable target for further exploitation.
* **Prerequisites:**
    * Cartography is deployed and accessible within the application's environment.
    * The attacker has gained initial access to the application's environment.
* **Impact:** This initial compromise allows the attacker to explore the application's internal workings and identify potential targets, including Cartography.

**2. Exploit Cartography's Data Storage:**

* **How it's achieved:**  Having identified Cartography, the attacker now attempts to access its stored data. This can be achieved through several methods:
    * **Direct access to the Cartography instance:** If Cartography's web interface or API is exposed and lacks proper authentication or authorization, the attacker can directly access it.
    * **Accessing the underlying data store:** Cartography typically uses a database (Neo4j by default, but can be configured to use others). If the attacker can gain access to the server or container hosting the database, they might be able to directly interact with it.
    * **Exploiting vulnerabilities in Cartography itself:**  While Cartography is generally well-maintained, vulnerabilities can exist. Attackers might exploit these to gain unauthorized access to its data.
    * **Leveraging application-level vulnerabilities:**  If the application interacts with Cartography's data without proper sanitization or authorization checks, an attacker might be able to indirectly access the data through the application.
* **Why this is a critical step:** Cartography's data contains a wealth of information about the application's infrastructure, including:
    * Server details (IP addresses, hostnames, OS versions)
    * Database connections and credentials (if not properly secured)
    * Cloud resources and configurations
    * Relationships between different components
* **Prerequisites:**
    * The attacker has successfully compromised the application environment.
    * Cartography's data storage is accessible from the compromised environment.
    * Potential vulnerabilities exist in Cartography's access control mechanisms or the underlying data store.
* **Impact:** Successful exploitation of Cartography's data storage provides the attacker with valuable intelligence about the application's architecture and potential attack vectors.

**3. Direct Access to Cartography's Database:**

* **How it's achieved:** Building upon the previous step, the attacker aims for direct access to the database used by Cartography. This can be achieved through:
    * **Leveraging credentials found in Cartography's data:**  If Cartography stores database connection strings or credentials (which it ideally shouldn't), the attacker can directly use them.
    * **Exploiting vulnerabilities in the database server:** If the database server itself has vulnerabilities, the attacker might be able to exploit them to gain access.
    * **Using compromised credentials from the application environment:** If the attacker has compromised a user or service account with access to the database server, they can use those credentials.
    * **Network access:** If the database server is accessible from the compromised environment and lacks proper network segmentation or firewall rules, the attacker can attempt to connect directly.
* **Why this is a significant escalation:** Direct database access allows the attacker to bypass any application-level security measures and directly manipulate or exfiltrate Cartography's data.
* **Prerequisites:**
    * The attacker has successfully exploited Cartography's data storage.
    * The attacker has obtained valid credentials or found a way to bypass authentication for the database.
    * Network connectivity exists between the compromised environment and the database server.
* **Impact:**  Direct database access grants the attacker full control over Cartography's data, potentially leading to data breaches, modification of information, or denial of service.

**4. Weak Database Credentials:**

* **How it manifests:** This stage highlights a fundamental security flaw: the database used by Cartography is protected by weak credentials. This could mean:
    * **Default credentials:** The database is using the default username and password provided by the database vendor.
    * **Common passwords:** The password is a commonly used or easily guessable string (e.g., "password", "123456").
    * **Simple passwords:** The password lacks sufficient complexity (e.g., short length, only lowercase letters).
    * **Credentials stored insecurely:**  Credentials might be hardcoded in configuration files or stored in plain text.
* **Why this is a major vulnerability:** Weak credentials are the easiest point of entry for attackers. They require minimal effort to guess or obtain, especially if default credentials are used.
* **Prerequisites:**
    * The Cartography database is configured with weak credentials.
* **Impact:** Weak credentials significantly lower the barrier to entry for attackers attempting to access the database.

**5. Attempt default or common credentials for the database:**

* **How it's achieved:**  The attacker, having gained direct access to the database connection details (either through Cartography's data or by identifying the database server), now attempts to log in using default or common credentials. This is often done through automated tools and scripts that try a list of well-known default and common usernames and passwords.
* **Why this is the final step in this attack path:** If the database is indeed using default or common credentials, this attempt is highly likely to succeed.
* **Prerequisites:**
    * The attacker has direct access to the database connection details.
    * The database is configured with default or common credentials.
* **Impact:** Successful authentication using default or common credentials grants the attacker full access to the Cartography database.

**Overall Impact of this Attack Path:**

A successful execution of this attack path can have severe consequences:

* **Data Breach:**  The attacker gains access to sensitive information about the application's infrastructure, potentially including credentials for other systems, network configurations, and asset details. This information can be used for further attacks.
* **Lateral Movement:**  The attacker can leverage the information gathered from Cartography to move laterally within the application's environment and compromise other systems.
* **Privilege Escalation:**  Access to Cartography's database might reveal credentials or configurations that allow the attacker to escalate their privileges within the application or its infrastructure.
* **Denial of Service:** The attacker could manipulate or delete data within Cartography, disrupting its functionality and potentially impacting the application's ability to manage its assets.
* **Reputational Damage:** A security breach of this nature can severely damage the reputation of the application and the organization responsible for it.
* **Compliance Violations:** Depending on the nature of the data stored and the applicable regulations, this breach could lead to significant compliance violations and financial penalties.

**Recommendations for Mitigation:**

To prevent this attack path, the development team should implement the following measures:

* **Strong Database Credentials:**
    * **Never use default credentials.** Change them immediately upon deployment.
    * **Enforce strong password policies:**  Require complex passwords with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
    * **Implement regular password rotation:**  Force password changes at regular intervals.
    * **Consider using key-based authentication:**  For enhanced security, explore using SSH keys or other forms of key-based authentication for database access.
* **Secure Cartography Deployment:**
    * **Restrict access to Cartography's web interface and API:** Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    * **Secure the underlying database:** Follow best practices for securing the database server, including network segmentation, firewall rules, and regular security patching.
    * **Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit:** Ensure that data within the database and communication with it are encrypted.
    * **Minimize the information stored in Cartography:** Only collect and store necessary data. Avoid storing sensitive credentials directly within Cartography.
* **Secure Application Environment:**
    * **Implement robust security measures to prevent initial compromise:** Regularly scan for vulnerabilities, apply security patches promptly, and implement strong access controls.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the necessary permissions to users and services.
    * **Network Segmentation:** Isolate critical components, including the database server, within secure network segments.
    * **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Proactively identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
* **Secure Credential Management:**
    * **Avoid storing credentials in configuration files or code:** Use secure secrets management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
    * **Implement robust access control for secrets management:**  Restrict access to sensitive credentials.
* **Monitoring and Alerting:**
    * **Implement monitoring for suspicious database activity:** Detect unusual login attempts or data access patterns.
    * **Set up alerts for security events:**  Notify security teams of potential compromises.

**Conclusion:**

The attack path focusing on exploiting weak database credentials in Cartography highlights a critical security vulnerability. By failing to secure the database, the application exposes itself to significant risks. Addressing this vulnerability through strong credential management, secure deployment practices, and robust security measures is crucial for protecting the application and its data. This analysis provides a clear understanding of the attack progression and actionable recommendations for the development team to mitigate this threat effectively.
