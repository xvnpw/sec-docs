## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Injecting Malicious Queries via Cartography

This analysis delves into the specified attack path, outlining the steps an attacker might take, potential vulnerabilities at each stage, and recommendations for mitigation. We will focus on the context of an application leveraging the Cartography project (https://github.com/robb/cartography) for asset inventory and relationship mapping.

**ATTACK TREE PATH:**

**Inject malicious queries to extract sensitive information or modify data**

**<- Abuse Cartography's Query Language (e.g., Cypher)**

**<- Indirect Access via Cartography's API/Interface**

**<- Exploit Cartography's Data Storage**

**<- Compromise Application via Cartography**

**Analysis of Each Stage:**

**1. Compromise Application via Cartography:**

* **Description:** This initial stage involves an attacker gaining control or access to the application through vulnerabilities related to its integration with Cartography. The application itself might not have direct vulnerabilities, but its reliance on Cartography creates an attack surface.
* **Potential Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Weak Authentication/Authorization to Cartography:** The application might use shared secrets, default credentials, or lack proper authentication when interacting with Cartography's API or data store.
    * **Misconfigured Permissions:** The application might have overly broad permissions to access Cartography data, allowing it to retrieve or modify information it shouldn't.
    * **Vulnerable Dependencies:** If the application uses an older version of the Cartography library or other related dependencies with known vulnerabilities, attackers could exploit those to gain initial access.
    * **Network Access Control Issues:** If the network allows unauthorized access to the Cartography instance from the application's environment, attackers could potentially intercept or manipulate communication.
    * **Injection Vulnerabilities in Application's Cartography Integration:** The application might construct Cartography queries based on user input without proper sanitization, leading to injection vulnerabilities (though less common at this stage).
* **Attacker Goal:** Gain initial access to the application's environment or the Cartography instance itself.
* **Example Attack Scenarios:**
    * An attacker finds default credentials used by the application to connect to the Cartography database.
    * An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in an older version of the `cartography` Python library used by the application.
    * An attacker compromises a poorly secured server hosting the application, allowing them to access its configuration and Cartography credentials.

**2. Exploit Cartography's Data Storage:**

* **Description:** Once the application's integration with Cartography is compromised, attackers can target Cartography's underlying data storage, typically a Neo4j database.
* **Potential Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Default Neo4j Credentials:** If the default credentials for the Neo4j database haven't been changed, attackers can gain full administrative access.
    * **Weak Neo4j Authentication/Authorization:**  Even if default credentials are changed, weak passwords or overly permissive user roles can be exploited.
    * **Missing Access Controls within Neo4j:**  Lack of granular access controls within Neo4j might allow attackers to access and manipulate data they shouldn't, even with legitimate application credentials.
    * **Unpatched Neo4j Vulnerabilities:** Older versions of Neo4j might have known security flaws that attackers can exploit.
    * **Data at Rest Encryption Issues:** If the Neo4j database is not properly encrypted at rest, attackers gaining access to the storage medium could directly access sensitive information.
    * **Backup Security Issues:** If backups of the Cartography database are not securely stored, attackers could potentially access them.
* **Attacker Goal:** Gain direct access to the data stored within Cartography, bypassing the application's intended access mechanisms.
* **Example Attack Scenarios:**
    * An attacker uses default Neo4j credentials to log in and browse the entire graph database.
    * An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in the running Neo4j version to gain administrative privileges.
    * An attacker gains access to the server hosting Neo4j and retrieves an unencrypted database dump.

**3. Indirect Access via Cartography's API/Interface:**

* **Description:**  Instead of directly exploiting the data storage, attackers might leverage Cartography's API or user interface to interact with the data. This could involve using the application's compromised credentials or exploiting vulnerabilities in Cartography's own API.
* **Potential Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Missing or Weak API Authentication/Authorization:** If Cartography's API lacks proper authentication or uses weak authentication mechanisms (e.g., simple API keys without proper scoping), attackers can gain unauthorized access.
    * **Insecure API Endpoints:**  Vulnerabilities in specific API endpoints could allow attackers to bypass intended access controls or perform actions they shouldn't.
    * **Lack of Rate Limiting:** Without rate limiting, attackers could potentially brute-force credentials or overload the API.
    * **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Cartography:** If Cartography's API allows users to specify URLs or interact with external systems without proper validation, attackers could potentially perform SSRF attacks.
    * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Cartography's UI:** If Cartography's user interface is vulnerable to XSS, attackers could potentially steal credentials or manipulate user actions.
* **Attacker Goal:** Interact with Cartography's data through its intended interfaces, potentially using compromised application credentials or exploiting Cartography's own vulnerabilities.
* **Example Attack Scenarios:**
    * An attacker uses the application's leaked API key to query Cartography's API for sensitive information.
    * An attacker exploits an SSRF vulnerability in Cartography's API to access internal resources.
    * An attacker injects malicious JavaScript into Cartography's UI to steal the session cookies of legitimate users.

**4. Abuse Cartography's Query Language (e.g., Cypher):**

* **Description:** Cartography uses a query language (typically Cypher for Neo4j) to interact with its graph database. Attackers, having gained access through previous stages, can now craft malicious queries to extract or modify data.
* **Potential Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Cypher Injection:** If the application constructs Cypher queries based on user input without proper sanitization or parameterization, attackers can inject malicious Cypher code. This is analogous to SQL injection.
    * **Overly Permissive Access Controls within Neo4j:** Even with proper query construction, if the compromised user or application has overly broad permissions within Neo4j, malicious queries can be executed successfully.
    * **Lack of Input Validation on Query Parameters:** If Cartography's API or the application doesn't validate the parameters used in Cypher queries, attackers can manipulate them to achieve unintended outcomes.
* **Attacker Goal:** Execute arbitrary Cypher queries to access, modify, or delete sensitive data within the Cartography database.
* **Example Attack Scenarios:**
    * An attacker injects malicious Cypher code into a search field in the application that is used to query Cartography, allowing them to retrieve all user credentials.
    * An attacker leverages a compromised application account with write access to Cartography to modify critical relationships in the graph database, disrupting the application's functionality.
    * An attacker uses Cypher to delete sensitive data from the Cartography database, causing data loss.

**5. Inject malicious queries to extract sensitive information or modify data:**

* **Description:** This is the final goal of the attack path. By successfully abusing Cartography's query language, attackers can now achieve their objective of extracting sensitive information or modifying data within the application's ecosystem, as represented in Cartography.
* **Potential Outcomes:**
    * **Data Exfiltration:**  Retrieving sensitive information like user credentials, API keys, internal configurations, or business-critical data.
    * **Data Modification:** Altering critical data points within Cartography, which could have cascading effects on the application's understanding of its environment and potentially lead to incorrect actions.
    * **Data Deletion:**  Deleting important data, causing disruption or loss of valuable information.
    * **Privilege Escalation:**  Identifying and exploiting relationships within Cartography to gain access to more privileged resources or accounts within the application's environment.
* **Attacker Goal:** Achieve their ultimate objective of compromising the application's data or functionality.
* **Example Attack Scenarios:**
    * An attacker extracts all user credentials stored in Cartography.
    * An attacker modifies the relationships between assets in Cartography to mislead the application about its environment.
    * An attacker deletes records related to critical infrastructure components in Cartography, causing the application to malfunction.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To defend against this attack path, the development team should implement a multi-layered security approach addressing vulnerabilities at each stage:

* **Secure Application Integration with Cartography:**
    * **Implement Strong Authentication and Authorization:** Use strong, unique credentials for the application's connection to Cartography and enforce the principle of least privilege.
    * **Secure Configuration Management:** Store Cartography credentials securely (e.g., using secrets management tools) and avoid hardcoding them in the application.
    * **Keep Dependencies Up-to-Date:** Regularly update the `cartography` library and other dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
    * **Network Segmentation:** Restrict network access to the Cartography instance, allowing only authorized systems to connect.
    * **Input Validation:** Sanitize or parameterize any user input used to construct Cartography queries within the application.

* **Harden Cartography's Data Storage (Neo4j):**
    * **Change Default Credentials:** Immediately change the default credentials for the Neo4j database.
    * **Implement Strong Authentication and Authorization:** Enforce strong password policies and implement role-based access control within Neo4j, granting only necessary permissions to users and applications.
    * **Patch Neo4j Regularly:** Keep the Neo4j database updated to the latest stable version to address security vulnerabilities.
    * **Enable Data at Rest Encryption:** Encrypt the Neo4j database at rest to protect data if the storage medium is compromised.
    * **Secure Backups:** Store backups of the Cartography database securely, with appropriate access controls and encryption.

* **Secure Cartography's API and Interface:**
    * **Implement Robust API Authentication and Authorization:** Use strong authentication mechanisms for the Cartography API (e.g., API keys with proper scoping, OAuth 2.0).
    * **Secure API Endpoints:** Implement security best practices for API development, including input validation, output encoding, and protection against common web vulnerabilities.
    * **Implement Rate Limiting:** Protect the API from brute-force attacks and denial-of-service attempts by implementing rate limiting.
    * **Protect Against SSRF:**  Carefully validate any user-supplied URLs used by Cartography's API to prevent SSRF attacks.
    * **Prevent XSS:** Sanitize user input and encode output in Cartography's user interface to prevent cross-site scripting attacks.

* **Prevent Cypher Injection:**
    * **Parameterize Cypher Queries:** Always use parameterized queries when constructing Cypher statements based on user input. This prevents attackers from injecting malicious code.
    * **Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize user input before using it in Cypher queries.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the users or applications executing Cypher queries have only the necessary permissions to access and modify the required data.

* **Monitoring and Logging:**
    * **Monitor Cartography Activity:** Implement monitoring and logging for Cartography, including API access, query execution, and authentication attempts.
    * **Alerting:** Set up alerts for suspicious activity, such as failed login attempts, unusual query patterns, or unauthorized data access.

**Conclusion:**

This detailed analysis highlights the potential attack vectors involved in compromising an application through its integration with Cartography. By understanding the vulnerabilities at each stage, the development team can implement targeted mitigation strategies to significantly reduce the risk of this attack path being successful. A proactive and layered security approach, focusing on secure configuration, strong authentication, input validation, and regular patching, is crucial for protecting sensitive information and maintaining the integrity of the application.
