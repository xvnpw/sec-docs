## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Cartography Software Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_cartography_software_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Exploiting security flaws directly within the Cartography codebase or its extensions.
* **Breakdown:**
    * **1.1. Exploit Known Cartography Vulnerabilities (If any exist - check CVEs, GitHub issues):**
        * **1.1.1. Remote Code Execution (RCE) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            * **Description:**  Attacker finds and exploits a vulnerability in Cartography that allows them to execute arbitrary code on the server running Cartography. This could be due to insecure deserialization, command injection, or other code execution flaws.
            * **Impact:**  Critical. Full compromise of the Cartography server and potentially the wider infrastructure. Attacker can gain complete control, exfiltrate data, install malware, or pivot to other systems.
            * **Mitigation:**
                * **Regularly update Cartography:** Apply security patches and updates promptly.
                * **Security Audits and Code Reviews:** Conduct regular security audits and code reviews of Cartography codebase, especially if using or developing extensions.
                * **Input Sanitization and Validation:** Ensure proper input sanitization and validation in Cartography code to prevent injection vulnerabilities.

    * **1.2. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Cartography Dependencies [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **1.2.1. Known Vulnerabilities in Python Libraries (requests, neo4j-driver, etc.) [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            * **1.2.1.1. RCE via vulnerable library [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                * **Description:** Attacker exploits a known vulnerability in one of Cartography's Python dependencies (e.g., `requests`, `neo4j-driver`, etc.) that allows for Remote Code Execution.
                * **Impact:** Critical. Similar to RCE in Cartography itself, leading to full system compromise.
                * **Mitigation:**
                    * **Dependency Scanning:** Implement automated dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in Cartography's dependencies.
                    * **Dependency Updates:** Keep all Python dependencies updated to the latest secure versions. Use dependency management tools to track and manage updates.
                    * **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Integrate SCA into the development pipeline to continuously monitor and manage open-source components and their vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Abuse Cartography Configuration and Deployment [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2__abuse_cartography_configuration_and_deployment__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Exploiting misconfigurations or insecure deployment practices related to Cartography and its dependencies (especially Neo4j).
* **Breakdown:**
    * **2.1. Weak or Default Neo4j Credentials [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **2.1.1. Unauthorized Access to Neo4j Database [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            * **Description:** Attacker attempts to log in to the Neo4j database used by Cartography using default credentials (e.g., `neo4j:neo4j`) or easily guessable passwords.
            * **Impact:** High. Unauthorized access to all infrastructure data collected by Cartography stored in Neo4j. Data exfiltration, manipulation, or DoS by corrupting the database are possible.
            * **Mitigation:**
                * **Strong Neo4j Passwords:** Enforce strong, unique passwords for Neo4j users.
                * **Credential Rotation:** Regularly rotate Neo4j passwords.
                * **Key-Based Authentication:** Consider using key-based authentication for Neo4j if supported and applicable.
                * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Limit Neo4j user permissions to only what is necessary for Cartography.

    * **2.2. Insecure Neo4j Network Exposure [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * **2.2.1. Direct Internet Exposure of Neo4j port (7687, 7474, 7473) [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            * **Description:** Neo4j ports (7687 for Bolt, 7474 for HTTP, 7473 for HTTPS) are directly exposed to the internet, allowing attackers to attempt to connect and access the database from anywhere.
            * **Impact:** High.  If Neo4j is internet-accessible, and especially if weak credentials are used, it's a direct path to unauthorized database access.
            * **Mitigation:**
                * **Network Segmentation:** Isolate Neo4j within a private network. It should only be accessible from the Cartography application server(s).
                * **Firewall Rules:** Implement strict firewall rules to block external access to Neo4j ports.
                * **VPN or Bastion Host:** Use a VPN or bastion host for secure administrative access to Neo4j if remote management is required.

    * **2.3. Misconfigured Cartography Permissions [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **2.3.1. Overly Permissive IAM Roles/Service Principals for Cartography [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            * **Description:** The IAM roles or service principals used by Cartography to access cloud provider APIs are granted excessive permissions beyond what is strictly necessary for data collection.
            * **Impact:** High to Critical. If Cartography's credentials are compromised (e.g., through server compromise or credential leakage), an attacker can leverage these overly permissive permissions to access and potentially manipulate resources across the entire cloud environment, far beyond the intended scope of Cartography.
            * **Mitigation:**
                * **Principle of Least Privilege (IAM):** Grant Cartography IAM roles/service principals only the absolute minimum permissions required to collect necessary data from cloud providers.
                * **Regular IAM Review:** Periodically review and refine Cartography's IAM permissions to ensure they remain minimal and appropriate.
                * **Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM):** Utilize CSPM tools to monitor and enforce least privilege and identify overly permissive IAM configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Abuse Cartography API/Interface (if application exposes API) [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/4__abuse_cartography_apiinterface__if_application_exposes_api___high_risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in a custom API built on top of Cartography data, if the application exposes such an API.
* **Breakdown:**
    * **4.1. Lack of Authentication/Authorization on Cartography API [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **4.1.1. Unauthorized Access to Cartography Data via API [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            * **Description:**  The application exposes an API that provides access to Cartography data, but this API lacks proper authentication and authorization mechanisms. Anyone with network access to the API can retrieve sensitive infrastructure information.
            * **Impact:** Medium to High. Data exfiltration of infrastructure information via the API. Depending on the sensitivity of the exposed data, this can be a significant breach.
            * **Mitigation:**
                * **API Authentication:** Implement robust authentication mechanisms for the API (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0, JWT).
                * **API Authorization:** Enforce granular authorization to control access to specific API endpoints and data based on user roles or permissions.
                * **API Security Testing:** Conduct security testing and penetration testing on the API to identify and remediate authentication and authorization vulnerabilities.
