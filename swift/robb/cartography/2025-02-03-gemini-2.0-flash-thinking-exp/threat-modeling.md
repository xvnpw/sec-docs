# Threat Model Analysis for robb/cartography

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Cartography Database](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_cartography_database.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Database Access
*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the database (Neo4j or other) storing Cartography data. This could be achieved through exploiting database vulnerabilities, weak database credentials, or network access misconfigurations. Once accessed, the attacker can read, modify, or delete sensitive infrastructure metadata.
*   **Impact:** **Critical**. Full infrastructure visibility for attacker, potential data breach of sensitive configuration details, manipulation of data leading to inaccurate security assessments, potential for data deletion causing loss of visibility.
*   **Affected Cartography Component:** Database (Neo4j or other) and potentially Cartography API if used for database access.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong database access controls (authentication, authorization).
    *   Use network segmentation to isolate the database server.
    *   Encrypt database at rest and in transit.
    *   Regularly audit database access logs.
    *   Keep database software up-to-date with security patches.
    *   Use strong, unique database credentials and rotate them regularly.

## Threat: [Exposure of Cartography API Endpoints](./threats/exposure_of_cartography_api_endpoints.md)

*   **Threat:** Unsecured API Access
*   **Description:** If Cartography exposes an API, attackers could exploit vulnerabilities in the API itself (e.g., injection flaws, broken authentication) or weak API security measures (e.g., lack of authentication, weak authorization) to access sensitive infrastructure metadata. Attackers could use this API to query, modify, or exfiltrate data.
*   **Impact:** **High**. Unauthorized access to infrastructure metadata, potential data breach, manipulation of data via API calls, depending on API functionality.
*   **Affected Cartography Component:** Cartography API (if exposed).
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure API endpoints with robust authentication (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0).
    *   Implement strong authorization mechanisms to control access to specific API functions and data.
    *   Apply input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks.
    *   Implement rate limiting to mitigate brute-force and DoS attacks.
    *   Regularly audit and pen-test API endpoints.
    *   Consider limiting API exposure to internal networks only.

## Threat: [Leaked Configuration Credentials](./threats/leaked_configuration_credentials.md)

*   **Threat:** Credential Leakage in Configuration
*   **Description:** Cartography configuration files might contain sensitive credentials (API keys, service account keys) for accessing cloud providers and other data sources. If these files are exposed through insecure storage, misconfigured access controls, or accidental commits to version control, attackers can extract these credentials. With compromised credentials, attackers can gain unauthorized access to the connected infrastructure.
*   **Impact:** **Critical**. Direct access to cloud infrastructure and other connected systems, potential for data breaches, resource manipulation, and service disruption in the compromised infrastructure.
*   **Affected Cartography Component:** Configuration loading and management modules, potentially all modules that use credentials.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never** store credentials directly in configuration files or code.
    *   Utilize secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) to store and manage credentials.
    *   Implement strict access control for configuration files.
    *   Regularly rotate credentials used by Cartography.
    *   Use environment variables or secure configuration providers for credential injection.
    *   Scan repositories and storage for accidentally committed credentials.

## Threat: [Data Exfiltration from Cartography Database](./threats/data_exfiltration_from_cartography_database.md)

*   **Threat:** Database Data Exfiltration
*   **Description:** Even with access controls, vulnerabilities in the database software or the application using Cartography could be exploited to exfiltrate the collected infrastructure metadata. Attackers could leverage SQL injection, database software vulnerabilities, or application logic flaws to extract data from the database.
*   **Impact:** **High**. Data breach of sensitive infrastructure metadata, potential exposure of vulnerabilities and attack vectors within the infrastructure.
*   **Affected Cartography Component:** Database (Neo4j or other), database interaction modules.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep database software and Cartography dependencies up-to-date with security patches.
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks.
    *   Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems to monitor for suspicious database activity.
    *   Monitor network traffic for unusual data egress.
    *   Regularly perform security audits and penetration testing of the database and application.

## Threat: [Compromised Cartography Credentials](./threats/compromised_cartography_credentials.md)

*   **Threat:** Cartography Credential Compromise
*   **Description:** If the credentials used by Cartography to access infrastructure are compromised (e.g., through phishing, malware, or insider threat), attackers can impersonate Cartography and gain the same level of access to your infrastructure. This allows them to perform unauthorized actions, modify configurations, or exfiltrate data directly from the source systems as if they were Cartography.
*   **Impact:** **Critical**. Full access to infrastructure as Cartography, potential for widespread damage, data breaches, resource manipulation, and service disruption in the compromised infrastructure.
*   **Affected Cartography Component:** All modules that use credentials to access external systems (e.g., cloud provider modules).
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Follow credential management best practices (secrets management, rotation, least privilege).
    *   Regularly audit the permissions granted to Cartography's credentials and enforce least privilege.
    *   Implement monitoring and alerting for suspicious activity from Cartography's accounts in the target infrastructure.
    *   Use dedicated service accounts with restricted permissions for Cartography.
    *   Educate personnel about phishing and social engineering attacks.

## Threat: [Tampering with Cartography Configuration/Code](./threats/tampering_with_cartography_configurationcode.md)

*   **Threat:** Configuration/Code Tampering
*   **Description:** If an attacker gains access to the Cartography server or deployment environment (e.g., through compromised server credentials or container escape), they could tamper with Cartography's configuration files or code. This allows them to disable security features, modify data collection behavior, introduce backdoors, or exfiltrate data.
*   **Impact:** **High**. Complete compromise of Cartography functionality, potential for data breaches, manipulation of collected data, introduction of malicious functionality, and disruption of security monitoring.
*   **Affected Cartography Component:** All components, especially configuration loading, core modules, and deployment scripts.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong access controls for the Cartography server and deployment environment.
    *   Use integrity monitoring tools (e.g., file integrity monitoring) to detect unauthorized changes to files.
    *   Implement code signing and verification processes for Cartography deployments.
    *   Follow secure deployment practices (least privilege, immutable infrastructure).

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Dependency Vulnerabilities
*   **Description:** Cartography relies on numerous open-source libraries and dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies (Python libraries, Neo4j drivers, etc.) could be exploited to compromise Cartography itself or the underlying system. Attackers could exploit known vulnerabilities in outdated dependencies to gain code execution or access sensitive data.
*   **Impact:** **High**. Potential compromise of Cartography application and server, data breaches, code execution, and other impacts depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
*   **Affected Cartography Component:** All components relying on external dependencies.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly scan Cartography's dependencies for vulnerabilities using software composition analysis (SCA) tools.
    *   Keep dependencies up-to-date with security patches.
    *   Implement a vulnerability management process for dependencies.
    *   Use dependency pinning to ensure consistent and controlled dependency versions.

## Threat: [Malicious Supply Chain Packages](./threats/malicious_supply_chain_packages.md)
