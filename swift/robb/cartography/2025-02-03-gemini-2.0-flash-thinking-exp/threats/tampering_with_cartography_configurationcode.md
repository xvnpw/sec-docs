### 2. Deep Analysis of "Tampering with Cartography Configuration/Code" Threat

**2.1 Attack Vector Analysis:**

An attacker could potentially tamper with Cartography's configuration or code through various attack vectors, depending on the deployment environment and security posture. These vectors can be broadly categorized as follows:

*   **Compromised Server/Host Access:**
    *   **Stolen Credentials:** Attackers could obtain valid credentials (e.g., SSH keys, passwords) for the server or virtual machine hosting Cartography. This could be achieved through phishing, credential stuffing, or exploiting vulnerabilities in credential management systems.
    *   **Exploited Server Vulnerabilities:** Unpatched vulnerabilities in the operating system, web server (if applicable), or other software running on the Cartography server could be exploited to gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Container Escape (if containerized):** If Cartography is deployed in containers, vulnerabilities in the container runtime or misconfigurations could allow an attacker to escape the container and gain access to the host system.
    *   **Physical Access (less likely in cloud environments, but relevant for on-premise deployments):** In scenarios where physical access to the server room is not adequately controlled, a malicious actor could directly access the server.

*   **Compromised Deployment Pipeline:**
    *   **Compromised CI/CD System:** If the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline used to deploy Cartography is compromised, attackers could inject malicious code or configuration changes into the deployment process.
    *   **Compromised Version Control System (VCS):** If the VCS repository (e.g., Git) containing Cartography's code and configuration is compromised, attackers could directly modify the source code and configuration, which would then be deployed.
    *   **Compromised Artifact Repository:** If an artifact repository (e.g., Docker Registry, package repository) used to store Cartography deployment artifacts is compromised, attackers could replace legitimate artifacts with malicious ones.

*   **Insider Threats:**
    *   **Malicious Insiders:** Individuals with legitimate access to Cartography systems or deployment environments could intentionally tamper with configuration or code for malicious purposes.
    *   **Negligent Insiders:** Unintentional misconfigurations or accidental code changes by authorized personnel could also lead to tampering-like scenarios, although not malicious in intent.

**2.2 Detailed Impact Analysis:**

The impact of successful configuration or code tampering in Cartography is indeed **High**, and can manifest in several critical ways:

*   **Complete Compromise of Cartography Functionality:**
    *   **Disabling Security Features:** Attackers could disable critical security features within Cartography, such as authentication, authorization, logging, or data encryption. This would effectively blind security teams and remove safeguards.
    *   **Stopping Data Collection:** Tampering could halt Cartography's data collection processes, leading to gaps in security visibility and hindering threat detection and incident response capabilities.
    *   **Application Downtime/Denial of Service:** Malicious code or configuration changes could destabilize Cartography, leading to application crashes, performance degradation, or complete denial of service, disrupting security monitoring operations.

*   **Potential for Data Breaches:**
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers could modify Cartography's code to exfiltrate collected data to external systems under their control. This could include sensitive information about the organization's infrastructure, assets, and security posture.
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Tampering could grant attackers unauthorized access to the data stored by Cartography, allowing them to view, modify, or delete sensitive information.

*   **Manipulation of Collected Data:**
    *   **False Data Injection:** Attackers could inject false or misleading data into Cartography's data stores. This could be used to create blind spots for real attacks, generate false positives to overwhelm security teams, or manipulate security dashboards and reports.
    *   **Data Omission/Filtering:** Attackers could modify data collection logic to selectively omit or filter out specific types of data, potentially hiding malicious activity or vulnerabilities from security monitoring.

*   **Introduction of Malicious Functionality (Backdoors):**
    *   **Persistent Backdoors:** Attackers could introduce persistent backdoors into Cartography's code or configuration, allowing them to maintain long-term unauthorized access to the system and potentially pivot to other systems within the organization's network.
    *   **Logic Bombs/Time Bombs:** Malicious code could be introduced to execute specific actions at a later time or under certain conditions, causing delayed disruption or damage.

*   **Disruption of Security Monitoring and Incident Response:**
    *   **Reduced Visibility:** Tampering can significantly reduce the effectiveness of security monitoring by disabling features, manipulating data, or causing downtime.
    *   **Delayed Incident Detection and Response:** Compromised Cartography systems may fail to detect or alert on security incidents, delaying incident response and increasing the potential for damage.
    *   **Erosion of Trust in Security Data:** If the integrity of Cartography's data is compromised, security teams may lose trust in the information it provides, hindering their ability to make informed security decisions.

**2.3 Affected Cartography Components (Deep Dive):**

While the threat description correctly states that "All components" can be affected, certain components are more critical and vulnerable to tampering:

*   **Configuration Loading and Parsing Modules:**
    *   These modules are responsible for reading and interpreting configuration files (e.g., YAML, JSON). Tampering with these modules could allow attackers to bypass configuration settings, inject malicious configurations, or cause configuration parsing errors leading to application failure.
    *   **Location:** Typically found in the core initialization or setup sections of the Cartography codebase.

*   **Core Data Ingestion Modules:**
    *   These modules handle the collection and processing of data from various sources (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP APIs). Tampering here could disrupt data collection, manipulate collected data, or introduce malicious data injection.
    *   **Location:** Modules responsible for interacting with external APIs and data sources, often organized by provider (e.g., `cartography/intel/aws.py`).

*   **Database Interaction Modules:**
    *   Modules that interact with the database (e.g., Neo4j) to store and retrieve collected data. Tampering could lead to data manipulation, unauthorized data access, or database corruption.
    *   **Location:** Modules handling database connections and queries, often within the core or data storage layers.

*   **Deployment Scripts and Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC):**
    *   Scripts used for deploying and managing Cartography infrastructure (e.g., Ansible playbooks, Terraform configurations, Dockerfiles). Tampering with these scripts could lead to the deployment of compromised Cartography instances or the introduction of backdoors at the infrastructure level.
    *   **Location:** Typically found in deployment directories or repositories separate from the core Cartography codebase, but crucial for secure deployment.

*   **Web UI Components (if any):**
    *   If Cartography includes a web user interface, these components could be targeted for tampering to inject malicious scripts, deface the UI, or gain access to user sessions.
    *   **Location:**  Frontend code, backend API endpoints, and server-side rendering logic if a web UI exists. (Note: Cartography is primarily a data collection and analysis tool, and may not have a complex web UI, but this should be considered if one is present or added in the future).

**2.4 Risk Severity Justification:**

The **High** risk severity is justified due to the potential for:

*   **Significant Impact on Security Posture:** Tampering directly undermines the core function of Cartography, which is to provide security visibility and intelligence. A compromised Cartography system becomes unreliable and potentially harmful.
*   **Broad Impact Across the Organization:** The data collected by Cartography often spans across the entire organization's cloud and on-premise infrastructure. Compromising Cartography can therefore have wide-ranging security implications.
*   **Difficulty in Detection:** Subtle configuration or code tampering can be difficult to detect, especially if attackers are careful to avoid causing obvious errors or disruptions. This allows the compromise to persist for longer periods, increasing the potential for damage.
*   **Potential for Escalation:** A compromised Cartography system can be used as a stepping stone to further attacks on other systems within the organization's network.
