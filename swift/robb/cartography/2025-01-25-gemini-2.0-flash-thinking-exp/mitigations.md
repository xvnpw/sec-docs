## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Robust Access Control for Cartography Data](./mitigation_strategies/implement_robust_access_control_for_cartography_data.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Robust Access Control for Cartography Data
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify authorized users and applications** that need to access the Cartography-populated Neo4j database and exported data.
    2.  **Leverage Neo4j's Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to define granular permissions. Create roles like `cartography-read-only` for users needing to view data and `cartography-admin` for Cartography management.
    3.  **Assign users and applications to appropriate Neo4j roles.** Ensure only necessary personnel have access to sensitive infrastructure data collected by Cartography.
    4.  **If exposing Cartography data via an API, implement strong authentication and authorization.**  Use API keys or OAuth 2.0 and enforce role-based access to API endpoints serving Cartography data.
    5.  **Regularly review Neo4j and API access logs** to audit access patterns and detect unauthorized attempts to view or modify Cartography data.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Cartography Data (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized viewing of sensitive infrastructure information collected and stored by Cartography in Neo4j.
    *   **Data Breach of Cartography Information (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of exfiltration of Cartography data due to compromised accounts or systems.
    *   **Insider Threat Exploiting Cartography Data (Medium Severity):** Limits potential misuse of Cartography data by internal users with excessive permissions.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access:** High reduction in risk by controlling who can see Cartography's insights.
    *   **Data Breach:** Medium reduction by limiting access points to Cartography's data store.
    *   **Insider Threat:** Medium reduction by enforcing least privilege within the Cartography data context.
