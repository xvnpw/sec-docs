# Deep Analysis: Principle of Least Privilege for Cartography API Credentials

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness, implementation status, and potential improvements for the "Principle of Least Privilege for API Credentials" mitigation strategy as applied to our Cartography deployment.  This analysis aims to identify specific action items to enhance the security posture of our Cartography instance and the cloud environments it interacts with.  We will focus on reducing the attack surface and minimizing the potential impact of credential compromise or misuse.

## 2. Scope

This analysis covers the following aspects:

*   **AWS IAM Policies and Roles:**  The current and proposed IAM configurations used by Cartography to access AWS resources.
*   **GCP Service Accounts and Roles:**  The current and proposed GCP configurations used by Cartography.
*   **Azure Service Principals and Roles:** The current and proposed Azure configurations used by Cartography.
*   **Cartography Configuration:** How Cartography is configured to utilize the defined credentials (AWS, GCP, Azure).
*   **Resource Access Requirements:**  A detailed inventory of the specific cloud resources Cartography *needs* to access for its intended functionality.
*   **Review Process:**  The existing or proposed process for regularly reviewing and updating permissions.
*   **Threat Modeling:**  Re-evaluation of the threats mitigated by this strategy in light of the proposed improvements.

This analysis *excludes* the following:

*   Security of the Cartography codebase itself (vulnerability scanning, etc.).  We assume the software is up-to-date and patched.
*   Network security configurations (firewalls, VPCs, etc.), although these are important complementary controls.
*   Authentication and authorization *within* Cartography (user access to the Cartography UI or API).

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Requirements Gathering:**  Re-confirm the specific cloud resources Cartography needs to access based on current usage and planned features.  This will involve reviewing Cartography's documentation, examining existing data, and consulting with the teams using Cartography.
2.  **Current State Assessment:**  Document the *exact* current IAM policies/roles (AWS), service account roles (GCP), and service principal roles (Azure) used by Cartography.  This includes extracting the JSON policy documents and analyzing the permissions granted.  We will also document how Cartography is configured to use these credentials.
3.  **Gap Analysis:**  Compare the current state (Step 2) with the requirements (Step 1).  Identify any excessive permissions granted.  This is the core of identifying the "least privilege" violations.
4.  **Policy Design:**  Create *new*, custom IAM policies/roles (AWS), service account roles (GCP), and service principal roles (Azure) that grant only the minimum necessary permissions identified in Step 3.  This will involve using the cloud provider's policy editors and/or JSON/YAML definitions.
5.  **Configuration Update Plan:**  Outline the steps required to update Cartography's configuration to use the new, least-privilege credentials.  This will include considerations for minimizing downtime and ensuring a smooth transition.
6.  **Review Process Definition:**  Establish a concrete process for regularly reviewing and updating the permissions.  This will include specifying the frequency, responsible parties, and documentation requirements.
7.  **Threat Model Re-evaluation:**  Revisit the threat model to assess the reduced risk levels after implementing the refined policies.

### 4.1 Requirements Gathering (Detailed Resource Access)

This section needs to be populated with the *actual* resources Cartography accesses.  This is a crucial step and requires investigation.  Here's an example, assuming we *only* need EC2 and S3, and *only* in specific regions:

**AWS:**

*   **EC2:**
    *   `ec2:DescribeInstances` (region: us-east-1, us-west-2)
    *   `ec2:DescribeImages` (region: us-east-1, us-west-2)
    *   `ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups` (region: us-east-1, us-west-2)
    *   `ec2:DescribeVolumes` (region: us-east-1, us-west-2)
    *   `ec2:DescribeSnapshots` (region: us-east-1, us-west-2)
    *   `ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces` (region: us-east-1, us-west-2)
    *   `ec2:DescribeAddresses` (region: us-east-1, us-west-2)
*   **S3:**
    *   `s3:ListBucket` (Resource: `arn:aws:s3:::cartography-data-*`, `arn:aws:s3:::another-bucket-*`)
    *   `s3:GetObject` (Resource: `arn:aws:s3:::cartography-data-*/*`, `arn:aws:s3:::another-bucket-*/*`)
    *   `s3:GetBucketLocation` (Resource: `arn:aws:s3:::cartography-data-*`, `arn:aws:s3:::another-bucket-*`)

**GCP:**

*   **Compute Engine:**
    *   `compute.instances.list`
    *   `compute.images.list`
    *   `compute.disks.list`
    *   `compute.networks.list`
    *   `compute.firewalls.list`
*   **Cloud Storage:**
    *   `storage.buckets.list`
    *   `storage.objects.list`
    *   `storage.buckets.get`

**Azure:**

*   **Compute:**
    *   `Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/read`
    *   `Microsoft.Compute/images/read`
    *   `Microsoft.Compute/disks/read`
*   **Network:**
    *   `Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/read`
    *   `Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces/read`
*   **Storage:**
    *   `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/read`
    *   `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/listKeys/action` (Potentially avoidable if we can use a SAS token instead)
    *   `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/read`

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Resource ARNs/IDs:**  Whenever possible, we should restrict permissions to specific resource ARNs or IDs, rather than granting access to all resources of a given type.  This requires careful inventorying.
*   **API Call Analysis:**  We might need to use cloud provider tools (e.g., AWS CloudTrail, GCP Cloud Logging, Azure Activity Log) to monitor Cartography's API calls and identify *exactly* which permissions are being used.  This can help us fine-tune the policies further.
*   **Cartography Modules:**  Different Cartography modules might require different permissions.  We need to consider which modules we are using.

### 4.2 Current State Assessment

This section documents the *current* permissions.  Based on the "Currently Implemented" example, we have:

**AWS:**

*   IAM Role: `CartographyRole` (Example Name)
*   Attached Policies:
    *   `AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess` (AWS Managed Policy)
    *   `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess` (AWS Managed Policy)

**GCP:**

*   Service Account: `cartography-service-account@<project-id>.iam.gserviceaccount.com` (Example)
*   Roles:
    *   `roles/compute.viewer` (Predefined Role)
    *   `roles/storage.objectViewer` (Predefined Role)

**Azure:**

*   Service Principal: `CartographyServicePrincipal` (Example)
*   Roles:
    *   `Reader` (Built-in Role - *Too Broad*)

**Cartography Configuration:**

*   **AWS:**  Cartography is configured to assume the `CartographyRole` (e.g., via environment variables or configuration files).
*   **GCP:** Cartography is configured to use the `cartography-service-account` (e.g., via the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable).
*   **Azure:** Cartography is configured to use the `CartographyServicePrincipal` (e.g., via environment variables for client ID, client secret, and tenant ID).

### 4.3 Gap Analysis

This is where we identify the over-provisioning:

**AWS:**

*   `AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess` grants access to *all* EC2 actions, not just the `Describe*` actions we need.  This is a significant violation of least privilege.
*   `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess` grants access to *all* S3 buckets and actions, not just the specific buckets and `ListBucket`/`GetObject` actions we need.

**GCP:**

*   `roles/compute.viewer` is likely too broad.  We need to examine the specific permissions it grants and compare them to our requirements.
*   `roles/storage.objectViewer` might be appropriate, but we should still verify.

**Azure:**

*   `Reader` role is *far* too broad.  It grants read access to virtually all resources in the subscription.  This is a major security risk.

### 4.4 Policy Design (Proposed Policies)

This section provides example *new* policies.  These are based on the example requirements in 4.1.  **These need to be adjusted based on your actual requirements.**

**AWS (Custom IAM Policy - JSON):**

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowEC2Describe",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:DescribeInstances",
                "ec2:DescribeImages",
                "ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups",
                "ec2:DescribeVolumes",
                "ec2:DescribeSnapshots",
                "ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces",
                "ec2:DescribeAddresses"
            ],
            "Resource": "*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "aws:RequestedRegion": [
                        "us-east-1",
                        "us-west-2"
                    ]
                }
            }
        },
        {
            "Sid": "AllowS3ListAndGet",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:GetBucketLocation"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::cartography-data-*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::another-bucket-*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

**GCP (Custom Role - YAML):**

```yaml
title: Cartography Custom Role
description: Least privilege role for Cartography
stage: GA
includedPermissions:
- compute.instances.list
- compute.images.list
- compute.disks.list
- compute.networks.list
- compute.firewalls.list
- storage.buckets.list
- storage.objects.list
- storage.buckets.get
```

**Azure (Custom Role Definition - JSON):**

```json
{
  "Name": "Cartography Custom Role",
  "IsCustom": true,
  "Description": "Least privilege role for Cartography in Azure.",
  "Actions": [
    "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/read",
    "Microsoft.Compute/images/read",
    "Microsoft.Compute/disks/read",
    "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/read",
    "Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces/read",
    "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/read",
    "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/read"
  ],
    "NotActions": [],
  "DataActions": [],
  "NotDataActions": [],
  "AssignableScopes": [
    "/subscriptions/<your-subscription-id>"
  ]
}
```
**Important:** For Azure, investigate using SAS tokens for storage access to avoid `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/listKeys/action`.

### 4.5 Configuration Update Plan

1.  **Create New Policies/Roles:** Create the new custom policies/roles in AWS, GCP, and Azure, as defined in 4.4.
2.  **Test in a Non-Production Environment:**  Create a *separate* Cartography instance (or use a separate configuration) that points to a non-production environment.  Configure this instance to use the new credentials.  Thoroughly test Cartography's functionality to ensure it works as expected.
3.  **Update Production Cartography:**  Once testing is complete, update the production Cartography instance's configuration to use the new credentials.  This might involve:
    *   Updating environment variables.
    *   Modifying configuration files.
    *   Restarting the Cartography service.
4.  **Monitor:**  After the update, closely monitor Cartography's logs and cloud provider audit logs to ensure there are no permission errors.
5.  **Rollback Plan:**  Have a plan to quickly revert to the old credentials if any issues arise.

### 4.6 Review Process Definition

*   **Frequency:** Every 6 months.
*   **Responsible Parties:**  The Security Team and the DevOps team responsible for Cartography.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Review Cartography's usage and requirements.
    2.  Examine cloud provider audit logs (CloudTrail, Cloud Logging, Activity Log) to identify any unused permissions.
    3.  Update the custom policies/roles as needed.
    4.  Document the review and any changes made.
*   **Tools:** Use a calendar reminder or a ticketing system to track the review schedule.

### 4.7 Threat Model Re-evaluation

| Threat                                       | Original Severity | Original Impact | Mitigated Impact | New Severity |
| :-------------------------------------------- | :---------------- | :-------------- | :--------------- | :----------- |
| Compromise of Cartography instance/credentials | High              | High            | Low              | Low          |
| Accidental misconfiguration/misuse           | Medium            | Medium          | Low              | Low          |
| Insider threat with access to credentials    | Medium            | Medium          | Low              | Low          |

By implementing the principle of least privilege, we significantly reduce the impact of all three threats, resulting in a lower overall severity. The attacker's capabilities are limited to read-only access to a *subset* of resources, preventing data modification, deletion, or resource creation.

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

The "Principle of Least Privilege for API Credentials" is a critical mitigation strategy for Cartography.  The current implementation is insufficient, relying on overly permissive managed policies.  This deep analysis has identified specific gaps and provided concrete steps to create custom, least-privilege policies for AWS, GCP, and Azure.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Implement the custom policies defined in Section 4.4 (after adjusting them to your specific requirements).** This is the highest priority action.
2.  **Follow the Configuration Update Plan (Section 4.5) to safely deploy the new policies.**
3.  **Establish and adhere to the Review Process (Section 4.6) to ensure ongoing compliance with the principle of least privilege.**
4.  **Use cloud provider monitoring tools (CloudTrail, Cloud Logging, Activity Log) to continuously refine the policies and identify any unused permissions.**
5.  **Consider using more granular resource-level restrictions (ARNs, resource IDs) whenever possible.**
6. **For Azure, prioritize investigating the use of SAS tokens for storage access to avoid granting the `listKeys` permission.**

By implementing these recommendations, we can significantly enhance the security of our Cartography deployment and reduce the risk of data breaches and unauthorized resource access.
