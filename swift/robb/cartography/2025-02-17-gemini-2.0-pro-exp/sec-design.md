Okay, let's create a design document for the Cartography project.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Cartography is a Python tool that consolidates infrastructure assets and the relationships between them in an intuitive graph view powered by Neo4j. It's used internally at Lyft. Given its purpose and the nature of the information it handles, the business posture can be characterized as follows:

Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a clear and comprehensive view of infrastructure assets and their relationships.
*   Enable efficient querying and analysis of infrastructure data.
*   Support security and compliance efforts by providing visibility into the infrastructure landscape.
*   Facilitate infrastructure management and troubleshooting.
*   Automate the process of infrastructure discovery and mapping.

Business Risks:

*   Data Breach: Unauthorized access to the Neo4j database could expose sensitive information about the organization's infrastructure.
*   Data Integrity: Inaccurate or incomplete data in Cartography could lead to incorrect decisions and potential security vulnerabilities.
*   System Availability: Downtime of Cartography could disrupt infrastructure management and security operations.
*   Misconfiguration: Incorrect configuration of Cartography or Neo4j could expose the system to attacks.
*   Dependency Risks: Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by Cartography could be exploited.
*   Compliance Violations: Failure to properly secure Cartography and the data it handles could lead to violations of regulatory requirements.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls (as inferred from the repository and common practices):

*   security control: Authentication to Neo4j: The project likely uses Neo4j's built-in authentication mechanisms (username/password, potentially with TLS). Described in Neo4j documentation.
*   security control: Authorization within Neo4j: Neo4j offers role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions. Described in Neo4j documentation.
*   security control: Python Code Security: The project is written in Python, and secure coding practices should be followed to prevent common vulnerabilities (e.g., injection, cross-site scripting). Implemented in code.
*   security control: Dependency Management: The project uses `setup.py` and `requirements.txt` to manage dependencies, which should be regularly reviewed and updated. Described in `setup.py` and `requirements.txt`.
*   security control: Docker image: Project is distributed as docker image. Described in `Dockerfile`.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Limited Input Validation: While Cartography itself primarily consumes data from other infrastructure APIs, any user-provided input (e.g., configuration files) may have limited validation, relying on the underlying APIs to handle invalid data.
*   accepted risk: Single Point of Failure: Depending on the deployment architecture, Cartography and its Neo4j database might represent a single point of failure.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Network Segmentation: Isolate the Cartography instance and Neo4j database on a separate network segment to limit exposure.
*   security control: Regular Security Audits: Conduct periodic security audits of the Cartography codebase and deployment environment.
*   security control: Intrusion Detection System (IDS): Implement an IDS to monitor network traffic and system activity for suspicious behavior.
*   security control: Secrets Management: Securely store and manage sensitive credentials (e.g., API keys, database passwords) using a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
*   security control: Input validation for configuration files.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Strong authentication mechanisms must be used for accessing the Neo4j database.
    *   Multi-factor authentication (MFA) should be considered for administrative access.
*   Authorization:
    *   RBAC should be implemented within Neo4j to restrict user access based on their roles and responsibilities.
    *   Principle of least privilege should be applied to all user accounts and service accounts.
*   Input Validation:
    *   All user-provided input (e.g., configuration files) must be validated to prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities.
    *   Data from external APIs should be treated with caution and validated where possible.
*   Cryptography:
    *   TLS should be used for all communication between Cartography and Neo4j, and any other external services.
    *   Sensitive data stored in Neo4j should be encrypted at rest.
*   Auditing:
    *   All security-relevant events should be logged and monitored.
    *   Audit logs should be protected from unauthorized access and modification.

## BUILD

The Cartography project appears to use a combination of manual and automated build processes.

Build Process:

1.  Developer: Writes code and tests locally.
2.  Version Control: Code is committed to a Git repository (GitHub).
3.  Dependency Management: `setup.py` and `requirements.txt` define project dependencies.
4.  Testing: Unit tests are run locally using `tox`.
5.  Docker Image Build: A Dockerfile is provided to build a container image. This can be done manually or automated.
6.  Artifact: The primary artifact is a Docker image.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Developer] --> B[GitHub Repository]
    B --> C[Dependency Management (setup.py, requirements.txt)]
    B --> D[Testing (tox)]
    B --> E[Dockerfile]
    E --> F[Docker Image Build]
    F --> G[Docker Image (Artifact)]
```

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   security control: Version Control (Git): Tracks code changes and enables collaboration.
*   security control: Dependency Management: `setup.py` and `requirements.txt` allow for tracking and updating dependencies.  Regularly auditing and updating these is crucial for supply chain security.
*   security control: Testing (tox):  Automated unit tests help ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
*   security control: Dockerfile: Using a well-defined Dockerfile helps ensure consistent and reproducible builds. Using minimal base images and avoiding unnecessary packages reduces the attack surface.

Recommended Improvements:

*   security control: Integrate SAST (Static Application Security Testing) tools into the build process to automatically scan for vulnerabilities in the code.
*   security control: Implement SCA (Software Composition Analysis) to identify and manage vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
*   security control: Use a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins) to automate the build, test, and deployment process.
*   security control: Sign Docker images to ensure their integrity and authenticity.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Infrastructure Monitoring and Management: Cartography provides a consolidated view of infrastructure, which is critical for monitoring, troubleshooting, and managing the infrastructure effectively.
*   Security and Compliance: Cartography helps identify potential security vulnerabilities and compliance gaps by providing visibility into the infrastructure landscape.

Data Sensitivity:

*   Infrastructure Metadata: Cartography stores metadata about infrastructure assets, including their configurations, relationships, and potentially sensitive information like IP addresses, hostnames, and security group rules. This data is considered sensitive and requires protection.
*   Credentials (Potentially): Depending on the configuration and the data sources used, Cartography might handle credentials (e.g., API keys) for accessing external APIs. These credentials must be protected with utmost care.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   What specific cloud providers and infrastructure APIs are being used with Cartography?
*   What is the expected scale of the deployment (number of assets, users, query frequency)?
*   Are there any existing security policies or compliance requirements that need to be considered?
*   What is the process for managing secrets (e.g., API keys, database passwords)?
*   Is there a monitoring and alerting system in place for Cartography and Neo4j?
*   What level of access do different users require?
*   How often data should be updated?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: The organization has a moderate to high risk aversion, given the sensitivity of infrastructure data.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: Basic security controls are in place (authentication, authorization), but there is room for improvement.
*   DESIGN: The deployment will be relatively small to medium-sized initially, with the potential for scaling up in the future. Docker Compose deployment is sufficient.
*   DESIGN: Cartography is used internally and not exposed directly to the public internet.
*   DESIGN: Neo4j database is secured with build in authentication and authorization.
