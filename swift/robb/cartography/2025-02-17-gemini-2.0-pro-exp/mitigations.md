# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for robb/cartography

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege for API Credentials](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_for_api_credentials.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Required Resources:** Analyze Cartography's documentation and your specific use case to determine the *exact* cloud resources Cartography needs to access.  For example, if you only need to inventory EC2 instances and S3 buckets, you don't need access to RDS or Lambda.
    2.  **Create Custom IAM Policies/Roles (AWS Example):**
        *   Create a new IAM policy.
        *   Use the visual editor or JSON to define permissions.
        *   For EC2, grant `ec2:DescribeInstances`, `ec2:DescribeImages`, etc.  *Avoid* `ec2:*`.
        *   For S3, grant `s3:ListBucket`, `s3:GetObject` (if needed for metadata), etc.  *Avoid* `s3:*`.
        *   If possible, restrict permissions to specific resources using ARNs (e.g., only allow access to buckets with a specific prefix).
        *   Create an IAM role and attach the policy.
        *   Configure Cartography to assume this role (e.g., using instance profiles if running on EC2, or using AWS credentials with the role ARN).  This is the *direct Cartography configuration* step.
    3.  **Repeat for Other Cloud Providers (GCP, Azure):** Follow similar principles, creating custom roles with minimal read-only permissions.  The configuration of Cartography to use these credentials is the key.
    4.  **Regular Review:** Periodically (e.g., every 3-6 months) review the permissions and ensure they are still the minimum required.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Threat:** Compromise of Cartography instance or credentials leads to unauthorized resource modification (High Severity).
        *   **Impact:** Reduces the risk from High to Low. An attacker can only *read* data, not modify it.
    *   **Threat:** Accidental misconfiguration or misuse of Cartography leads to unintended resource changes (Medium Severity).
        *   **Impact:** Reduces the risk from Medium to Low. Limited permissions prevent accidental modifications.
    *   **Threat:** Insider threat with access to Cartography credentials abuses privileges (Medium Severity).
        *   **Impact:** Reduces the risk from Medium to Low. Limits the scope of potential abuse.

*   **Impact:** Significantly reduces the risk of data breaches, unauthorized resource modifications, and accidental damage. This is a *foundational* security control.

*   **Currently Implemented (Example):**
    *   Partially implemented. We have an IAM role for Cartography, but it currently has broader permissions than necessary (`AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess` and `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess`).  The Cartography configuration *points to* this role.

*   **Missing Implementation (Example):**
    *   Need to create a *custom* IAM policy with more granular permissions, specifically tailored to the resources Cartography actually needs.
    *   Need to review and refine permissions for GCP and Azure as well, and update Cartography's configuration to use those refined credentials.
    *   Need to establish a regular review process for permissions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Credential Rotation and Management](./mitigation_strategies/credential_rotation_and_management.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose a Secrets Manager:** Select a secrets management solution (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault, GCP Secret Manager).
    2.  **Store Credentials:** Store the API keys/credentials for Cartography in the chosen secrets manager.
    3.  **Configure Cartography:** Modify Cartography's configuration to retrieve credentials from the secrets manager at runtime. This is the *direct Cartography configuration* step. This usually involves using environment variables or configuration file settings specific to the secrets manager, and Cartography must be configured to read from these.
    4.  **Enable Automatic Rotation:** Configure the secrets manager to automatically rotate the credentials on a regular schedule (e.g., every 90 days). This often involves integrating with the cloud provider's IAM service.
    5.  **Test Rotation:** Thoroughly test the credential rotation process to ensure it doesn't disrupt Cartography's operation.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Threat:** Credential theft or leakage (High Severity).
        *   **Impact:** Reduces the risk from High to Medium. Regular rotation limits the window of opportunity for an attacker to use stolen credentials.
    *   **Threat:** Use of old, compromised credentials (Medium Severity).
        *   **Impact:** Reduces the risk from Medium to Low. Rotation ensures old credentials are no longer valid.

*   **Impact:** Reduces the risk of credential-based attacks and improves overall security posture.

*   **Currently Implemented (Example):**
    *   Not implemented. We are currently storing credentials in a configuration file.

*   **Missing Implementation (Example):**
    *   Need to choose and implement a secrets management solution.
    *   Need to migrate credentials to the secrets manager.
    *   Need to configure Cartography to retrieve credentials from the secrets manager *at runtime*.
    *   Need to enable and test automatic credential rotation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Minimization](./mitigation_strategies/data_minimization.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Essential Data:** Determine the *specific* cloud resources and properties you need to track for your use case. Avoid ingesting everything by default.
    2.  **Use Cartography's Configuration:** Use Cartography's command-line options or configuration file to specify:
        *   `--include-modules`: List only the modules you need (e.g., `aws`, `gcp`).  This is a *direct Cartography configuration*.
        *   `--exclude-modules`: Exclude modules you don't need. This is a *direct Cartography configuration*.
        *   `--include-resources`: List specific resource types (e.g., `aws:ec2:instance`, `aws:s3:bucket`). This is a *direct Cartography configuration*.
        *   `--exclude-resources`: Exclude resource types you don't need. This is a *direct Cartography configuration*.
    3.  **Review and Refine:** Regularly review the ingested data and adjust the configuration to further minimize the data footprint. Remove any unnecessary resource types or properties.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Threat:** Data breach exposes a large amount of sensitive data (High Severity).
        *   **Impact:** Reduces the risk from High to Medium. Minimizing the data reduces the amount of sensitive information that could be exposed.
    *   **Threat:** Storage and processing costs are higher than necessary (Low Severity).
        *   **Impact:** Reduces the risk from Low to Negligible. Minimizing data reduces storage and processing requirements.

*   **Impact:** Reduces the potential impact of a data breach and improves efficiency.

*   **Currently Implemented (Example):**
    *   Not implemented. We are currently ingesting all data from all supported modules.

*   **Missing Implementation (Example):**
    *   Need to analyze our data needs and identify the essential resources and properties.
    *   Need to configure Cartography, *using its command-line options or configuration file*, to ingest only the necessary data.
    *   Need to establish a regular review process for data minimization.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Updates and Patching (Cartography Itself)](./mitigation_strategies/regular_updates_and_patching__cartography_itself_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Subscribe to Security Advisories:** Subscribe to security advisories for Cartography.  This is crucial for being notified of vulnerabilities *in Cartography itself*.
    2.  **Establish an Update Process:** Define a process for testing and deploying updates to the *Cartography application* in a timely manner. This should include:
        *   Testing updates in a non-production environment before deploying to production.
        *   Scheduling updates during off-peak hours to minimize disruption.
        *   Having a rollback plan in case of issues.
    3.  **Automate Updates (Optional):** Consider using automated update mechanisms where appropriate (e.g., using a package manager or container orchestration system). However, always test automated updates thoroughly before deploying them to production.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Threat:** Exploitation of known vulnerabilities in the Cartography application (High Severity).
        *   **Impact:** Reduces the risk from High to Low. Regular updates and patching address known vulnerabilities *within Cartography*.

*   **Impact:** Reduces the risk of exploitation of known vulnerabilities and improves overall security posture.

*   **Currently Implemented (Example):**
    *   Partially implemented. We don't have a formal process for updating Cartography.

*   **Missing Implementation (Example):**
    *   Need to establish a formal update process for the Cartography application.
    *   Need to subscribe to security advisories specifically for Cartography.
