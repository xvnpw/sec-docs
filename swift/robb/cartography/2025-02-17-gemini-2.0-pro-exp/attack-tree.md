## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Cartography Instance [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_cartography_instance__hr_.md)

*   **1.1.3 Dependency Vulnerabilities [HR]**
    *   **1.1.3.1 Exploit known vulnerabilities in Cartography's Python dependencies. [CN]**
        *   **Description:** Attackers scan for and exploit publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in Cartography's Python dependencies (e.g., Boto3, Neo4j driver, requests). They might use automated tools or manually craft exploits.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High (depending on the specific vulnerability)
        *   **Effort:** Low (often automated tools are available)
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (with vulnerability scanning) / Medium (without)
        *   **Mitigation:** Rigorous dependency management, frequent updates, vulnerability scanning.

*   **1.1.5 Configuration Errors [HR]**
    *   **1.1.5.2 Weak or default credentials used. [CN]**
        *   **Description:** Attackers attempt to log in using default credentials (e.g., "admin/admin") or easily guessable passwords for Cartography or its associated services (Neo4j, cloud accounts).
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Very Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
        *   **Mitigation:**  Strong, unique passwords; *never* use default credentials; enforce password complexity policies.

*   **1.3 Social Engineering / Phishing [HR]**
    *   **1.3.1 Trick an administrator into revealing credentials. [CN]**
        *   **Description:** Attackers use phishing emails, phone calls, or other social engineering techniques to trick an administrator with access to Cartography into revealing their credentials or installing malware.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (with user awareness training)
        *   **Mitigation:**  User awareness training; multi-factor authentication; strong email security.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Leverage Cartography's Access [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/2__leverage_cartography's_access__hr_.md)

*   **2.1 Directly Query Neo4j Database [HR]**
    *   **2.1.1 Execute arbitrary Cypher queries. [CN]**
        *   **Description:** After compromising the Cartography instance, the attacker uses their access to execute arbitrary Cypher queries against the Neo4j database, potentially extracting all stored data or modifying it.
        *   **Likelihood:** High (if Cartography instance is compromised)
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (with query monitoring)
        *   **Mitigation:**  Least privilege access to Neo4j; query monitoring and auditing; input validation (if applicable).

*   **2.3 Use Cartography's Credentials [HR]**
    *   **2.3.1 Extract cloud provider credentials. [CN]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker extracts cloud provider credentials (AWS keys, Azure service principals, GCP service accounts) that Cartography uses or stores.  This allows them to bypass Cartography and directly access cloud resources.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (depending on how credentials are stored)
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (with access logging)
        *   **Mitigation:**  *Never* store credentials in plain text; use a secure credential management system (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault); rotate credentials regularly.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Compromise Neo4j Database [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/3__compromise_neo4j_database__hr_.md)

*   **3.1 Exploit Neo4j Vulnerabilities**
    *   **3.1.1 Exploit known vulnerabilities in the specific Neo4j version. [CN]**
        *   **Description:** Similar to Cartography's dependencies, attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in the deployed Neo4j version.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (depending on update frequency)
        *   **Impact:** High (full database access)
        *   **Effort:** Low (if using automated exploit tools)
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (with vulnerability scanning) / Medium (without)
        *   **Mitigation:** Keep Neo4j updated; vulnerability scanning; follow Neo4j security best practices.

*   **3.2 Weak Neo4j Credentials [HR]**
    *   **3.2.1 Use default or easily guessable credentials. [CN]**
        *   **Description:** Attackers gain access to Neo4j using default or weak credentials.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Very Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
        *   **Mitigation:**  Strong, unique passwords; *never* use default credentials; enforce password complexity.

*   **3.3 Neo4j Misconfiguration [HR]**
    *   **3.3.1 Neo4j exposed to the public internet. [CN]**
        *   **Description:**  The Neo4j database is directly accessible from the public internet without proper authentication or network security controls.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (with network scanning)
        *   **Mitigation:**  *Never* expose Neo4j directly to the public internet; use a firewall; configure network ACLs; use a VPN or private network.
