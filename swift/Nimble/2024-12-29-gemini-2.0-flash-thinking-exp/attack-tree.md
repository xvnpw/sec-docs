## Threat Model: Application Using Nimble - High-Risk Sub-Tree

**Attacker's Goal:** Gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or disrupt application functionality by leveraging Nimble-related vulnerabilities.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

* Compromise Application via Nimble **(CRITICAL NODE)**
    * Exploit Nimble Dependency Vulnerabilities **(HIGH RISK PATH)**
        * Exploit Vulnerable Transitive Dependencies **(CRITICAL NODE)**
    * Leverage Malicious or Poorly Written Tests **(HIGH RISK PATH)**
        * Inject Malicious Code via Tests **(CRITICAL NODE)**
    * Exploit Test Execution Environment **(HIGH RISK PATH)**
        * Gain Access to Test Environment Secrets **(CRITICAL NODE)**

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

* **Compromise Application via Nimble (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this node means the attacker has achieved their objective of gaining unauthorized access or disrupting the application by exploiting vulnerabilities related to the Nimble testing framework.

* **Exploit Nimble Dependency Vulnerabilities (HIGH RISK PATH):**
    * This attack path focuses on exploiting weaknesses in the libraries that Nimble relies upon.
    * **Exploit Vulnerable Transitive Dependencies (CRITICAL NODE):**
        * Attackers identify and exploit known vulnerabilities in libraries that Nimble depends on indirectly (dependencies of Nimble's direct dependencies).
        * This often involves using publicly available vulnerability databases and exploit tools.
        * Successful exploitation can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code, gain access to sensitive data, or cause denial of service.

* **Leverage Malicious or Poorly Written Tests (HIGH RISK PATH):**
    * This attack path exploits vulnerabilities introduced through the test code itself.
    * **Inject Malicious Code via Tests (CRITICAL NODE):**
        * Attackers introduce malicious code within the test suite. This could be done by a malicious insider or through a compromised developer account.
        * When these tests are executed (even in non-production environments), the malicious code interacts with the application, potentially performing harmful actions such as:
            * Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive data.
            * Modifying application configurations.
            * Creating backdoors for persistent access.
            * Disrupting application functionality.

* **Exploit Test Execution Environment (HIGH RISK PATH):**
    * This attack path targets the environment where Nimble tests are executed.
    * **Gain Access to Test Environment Secrets (CRITICAL NODE):**
        * Attackers compromise the test environment to gain access to sensitive credentials or configurations used by Nimble tests.
        * Test environments often contain secrets (API keys, database credentials, etc.) necessary for testing interactions with the application or external services.
        * If these secrets are the same as or similar to production secrets, attackers can use them to gain unauthorized access to production systems and data.
        * Compromise can occur through various means, including:
            * Exploiting vulnerabilities in the test environment infrastructure.
            * Weak access controls on the test environment.
            * Social engineering attacks targeting individuals with access to the test environment.
            * Misconfiguration of the test environment.
