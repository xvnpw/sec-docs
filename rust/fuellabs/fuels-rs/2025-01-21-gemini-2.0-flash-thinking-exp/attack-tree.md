## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Fuels-rs Specific Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_fuels-rs_specific_weaknesses.md)

This represents the overarching goal of exploiting vulnerabilities specifically related to the use of the Fuels-rs library. It encompasses various attack vectors that leverage the library's functionalities or the application's interaction with it.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Transaction Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__transaction_manipulation.md)

This path focuses on manipulating transactions to achieve malicious goals. Since Fuels-rs is used to construct and send transactions, vulnerabilities in how the application handles transaction creation and signing can be exploited.
        *   **Modify Transaction Parameters:** An attacker could attempt to intercept or manipulate the `TransactionRequest` object before it is signed and broadcast. This could involve changing the recipient address, the amount of assets being transferred, or the data field of the transaction to execute unintended smart contract functions.
        *   **Replay Attacks:** If the application does not implement proper nonce management or transaction expiry mechanisms, an attacker could capture a valid transaction and resubmit it multiple times. This could lead to duplicated actions, such as transferring funds multiple times when the user intended only one transfer.
        *   **Front-Running:** In a public blockchain environment, an attacker can observe pending transactions in the mempool. If a user submits a transaction, an attacker can submit a similar transaction with a higher gas price to have their transaction executed before the user's. This can be used to profit from arbitrage opportunities or to manipulate the outcome of certain on-chain actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Key Management Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path___critical_node__key_management_vulnerabilities.md)

This path highlights the critical risks associated with managing private keys, which are essential for signing transactions and controlling blockchain accounts. Compromising private keys grants an attacker full control over the associated assets and accounts.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Insecure Private Key Storage](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__insecure_private_key_storage.md)

This path focuses on vulnerabilities related to how private keys are stored by the application.
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Plaintext Storage:** Storing private keys in plaintext within the application's code, configuration files, or databases is a critical vulnerability. An attacker gaining access to these files can immediately compromise the keys.
        *   **Weak Encryption:** Encrypting private keys with weak or easily crackable encryption algorithms provides a false sense of security. Attackers with sufficient resources and knowledge can decrypt these keys.
        *   **Exposed in Memory Dumps:** If private keys are held in memory and not securely erased after use, they might be exposed in memory dumps or through memory exploitation techniques.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Private Key Leakage during Transmission](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__private_key_leakage_during_transmission.md)

Transmitting private keys over insecure channels, such as unencrypted network connections, exposes them to interception by attackers. This is a critical vulnerability that can lead to immediate compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insufficient Key Derivation Security](./attack_tree_paths/insufficient_key_derivation_security.md)

If the application uses weak or flawed methods for deriving private keys from seeds or mnemonics, attackers might be able to reverse the process and recover the private keys if they gain access to the seed or mnemonic. This includes using weak hashing algorithms or insufficient iterations in key derivation functions.
