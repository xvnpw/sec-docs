*   **Example:** A memory leak *in fuels-rs code* causes private keys to persist in memory after they should have been cleared. An attacker exploiting a separate vulnerability to access process memory could then retrieve these exposed private keys.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of user funds and assets.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Utilize secure memory management practices *within fuels-rs* for handling private keys. Employ memory scrubbing techniques to overwrite key data in memory after use.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Fuel Node Interaction](./attack_surfaces/malicious_fuel_node_interaction.md)

*   **Description:** While *fuels-rs* itself doesn't introduce malicious nodes, *fuels-rs facilitates communication* with potentially malicious or compromised Fuel nodes. If an application using *fuels-rs* connects to such a node, it can be exposed to fabricated data, manipulated application state, or denial of service attacks initiated by the node.
*   **fuels-rs Contribution:** *fuels-rs* provides the client functionalities to connect to and interact with Fuel nodes.  By enabling this connection, *fuels-rs* indirectly contributes to the attack surface if the application doesn't properly validate or choose trusted nodes.
*   **Example:** An application using *fuels-rs* is configured to connect to a rogue Fuel node controlled by an attacker. The malicious node returns fabricated balance information or intentionally delays transaction processing, leading to incorrect application behavior or denial of service for users of the application.
*   **Impact:** Data integrity compromise, application logic manipulation, denial of service, and potential for user deception.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
