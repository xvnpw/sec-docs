# BUSINESS POSTURE

The fuels-rs project is a Rust SDK for interacting with the Fuel blockchain. Its primary business goal is to facilitate and encourage the development of applications on the Fuel network by providing a robust, user-friendly, and efficient interface for developers.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Enable developers to easily build and deploy applications on the Fuel blockchain.
- Provide a high-performance and reliable SDK that leverages the speed and efficiency of the Fuel network.
- Foster a thriving developer ecosystem around Fuel by offering comprehensive and well-documented tools.
- Ensure the SDK is secure and minimizes potential vulnerabilities in applications built using it.
- Promote the adoption of the Fuel blockchain through a positive developer experience.

Most Important Business Risks:
- Low developer adoption due to SDK complexity, lack of features, or poor performance.
- Security vulnerabilities in the SDK leading to compromised applications and damage to the Fuel ecosystem's reputation.
- Instability or lack of reliability in the SDK causing development delays and frustration for developers.
- Insufficient documentation and support hindering developer onboarding and effective SDK utilization.
- Competition from other blockchain platforms and SDKs.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Publicly accessible source code repository on GitHub, enabling community review and scrutiny. (Implemented: GitHub Repository)
- security control: Issue tracking system on GitHub for reporting and managing bugs and potential security vulnerabilities. (Implemented: GitHub Issues)
- security control: Code review process via pull requests, ensuring multiple developers review code changes before merging. (Implemented: GitHub Pull Requests)
- security control: Continuous Integration (CI) using GitHub Actions for automated building, testing, and potentially linting of the codebase. (Implemented: GitHub Actions - observed in repository workflows)

Accepted Risks:
- accepted risk: Reliance on open-source community for security contributions and vulnerability reporting.
- accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities to be present in dependencies.
- accepted risk: Security of developer environments using the SDK is outside the scope of the SDK project itself.

Recommended Security Controls:
- recommended security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools in the CI pipeline to detect potential code-level vulnerabilities.
- recommended security control: Implement automated Dependency Scanning to identify and manage vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
- recommended security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the SDK by external security experts.
- recommended security control: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure and response process.
- recommended security control: Provide security guidelines and best practices for developers using the SDK to build secure applications.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication: Not directly applicable to the SDK itself, as it's a client-side library. Authentication mechanisms are expected to be handled by the applications built using the SDK and the Fuel blockchain.
- Authorization: Not directly applicable to the SDK itself. Authorization logic resides within the applications and the Fuel blockchain. The SDK should provide functionalities to interact with authorization mechanisms if needed by the Fuel blockchain.
- Input Validation: security requirement: The SDK must perform robust input validation on all data received from users and external systems to prevent injection attacks and other input-related vulnerabilities. This is crucial for functions that construct transactions or interact with the blockchain.
- Cryptography: security requirement: The SDK must utilize secure cryptographic libraries and practices for all cryptographic operations, such as signing transactions, generating keys, and handling sensitive data. Ensure proper key management and avoid insecure cryptographic algorithms or implementations.
