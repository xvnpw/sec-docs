# Threat Model Analysis for fuellabs/fuels-rs

## Threat: [Malicious Fuel Node Impersonation (Spoofing)](./threats/malicious_fuel_node_impersonation__spoofing_.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Fuel Node Impersonation (Spoofing)

    *   **Description:** An attacker sets up a rogue Fuel node and configures the application (or tricks the user) to connect to it.  The rogue node feeds the `fuels-rs` SDK with fabricated data (false confirmations, balances, block data). The attacker might use a similar-looking URL or exploit a vulnerability in the application's node selection.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Application believes false blockchain state.
        *   User fund loss due to incorrect confirmations.
        *   Incorrect application decisions based on false data.
        *   Loss of user trust.

    *   **`fuels-rs` Component Affected:**
        *   `Provider` (URL/connection configuration).
        *   Functions relying on `Provider` data: `get_balance`, `get_transaction`, `get_block`, etc.

    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Hardcode Trusted Node URLs (with caution and update mechanism):**  For high-security applications, consider hardcoding reputable node URLs. *Crucially*, include a secure mechanism to update these URLs.
        *   **Trusted Node Provider List:** Use a securely fetched and authenticated list of trusted node providers.
        *   **Quorum-Based Approach:** Connect to multiple `Provider` instances (different nodes) and require consensus (e.g., 2/3 agreement) before accepting data.
        *   **Light Client (Future):** Utilize a Fuel light client (when available) for independent blockchain data verification.
        *   **User Education:** Educate users on the risks of untrusted nodes and secure configuration.

## Threat: [Fake Contract ABI (Spoofing)](./threats/fake_contract_abi__spoofing_.md)

*   **Threat:** Fake Contract ABI (Spoofing)

    *   **Description:** An attacker provides a manipulated ABI JSON, causing `fuels-rs` to misinterpret contract calls.  This could happen through a compromised ABI server, user deception, or an application vulnerability in ABI loading.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Incorrect contract interactions.
        *   Potential exploitation of contract vulnerabilities.
        *   Application malfunction.
        *   Data corruption.

    *   **`fuels-rs` Component Affected:**
        *   `abigen!` macro.
        *   `Contract::load_from` (if loading from file).
        *   `Contract::from_json_file` (if loading from file).
        *   Functions interacting with contracts using the ABI.

    *   **Risk Severity:** High

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **`abigen!` with Embedded ABIs:** Embed the ABI JSON directly into the code using `abigen!`.  Example: `abigen!(MyContract, "path/to/abi.json");` (path relative to project root, included at compile time).
        *   **Verify ABI Hash:** Before loading from an external source, calculate the ABI's hash (e.g., SHA-256) and compare it to a known good hash from a trusted source.
        *   **Avoid Dynamic ABI Loading:** Do not load ABIs from untrusted sources at runtime. If necessary, implement strict validation and sandboxing.

## Threat: [Transaction Manipulation Before Signing (Tampering)](./threats/transaction_manipulation_before_signing__tampering_.md)

*   **Threat:** Transaction Manipulation Before Signing (Tampering)

    *   **Description:** An attacker with access to application memory or communication intercepts and modifies transaction parameters *before* `fuels-rs` signs the transaction.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Funds sent to attacker's address.
        *   Unauthorized contract calls.
        *   Loss of user funds.

    *   **`fuels-rs` Component Affected:**
        *   `Wallet::sign_transaction`
        *   `TransactionBuilder` (and related structs).
        *   Functions preparing transactions for signing.

    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Memory Management:** Leverage Rust's ownership and borrowing to minimize memory corruption. Avoid `unsafe` code unless thoroughly audited.
        *   **Hardware Wallet Integration:** Use a hardware wallet (if supported by `fuels-rs` or via a bridge) for signing.
        *   **Transaction Review:** Display a clear transaction summary to the user for confirmation before signing.
        *   **Multi-Signature Wallets:** Use multi-signature wallets for high-value transactions.
        *   **Secure Enclaves (if available):** Use secure enclaves (e.g., Intel SGX, ARM TrustZone) to protect signing.

## Threat: [Dependency Tampering (Supply Chain Attack) (Tampering)](./threats/dependency_tampering__supply_chain_attack___tampering_.md)

*   **Threat:** Dependency Tampering (Supply Chain Attack) (Tampering)

    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises a dependency of `fuels-rs` (or `fuels-rs` itself) and injects malicious code.

        *   Complete application compromise.
        *   Loss of user funds.
        *   Data theft.
        *   Reputational damage.

    *   **`fuels-rs` Component Affected:** Potentially *any* component.

        *   **Dependency Pinning:** Pin dependencies to specific versions in `Cargo.toml`. Regularly review and update.
        *   **Regular Dependency Audits:** Audit dependencies for vulnerabilities.
        *   **Private Registry (for critical dependencies):** Consider a private registry for sensitive applications.
        *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Subscribe to security advisories for `fuels-rs` and dependencies.

## Threat: [Private Key Leakage (Information Disclosure)](./threats/private_key_leakage__information_disclosure_.md)

*   **Threat:** Private Key Leakage (Information Disclosure)

    *   **Description:** The application exposes private keys through logging, error messages, insecure storage, or unencrypted transmission.

        *   Code interacting with the `Wallet` struct.

    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never Log Private Keys:** Absolutely never log private keys.
        *   **Secure Key Storage:**
            *   **Hardware Wallets:** Prioritize hardware wallets.
            *   **Operating System Keychains:** Use OS-provided secure key storage.
            *   **Encrypted Storage:** Use strong encryption with a robust KDF if storing keys in files.
            *   **Environment Variables (with caution):** Use environment variables, but be aware of limitations.
        *   **Avoid Hardcoding Keys:** Never hardcode keys in the source code.
        *   **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews.
        *   **Automated Scanning:** Use security scanning tools to detect secrets.

## Threat: [Gas Exhaustion Attacks (Denial of Service)](./threats/gas_exhaustion_attacks__denial_of_service_.md)

*   **Threat:** Gas Exhaustion Attacks (Denial of Service)

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts transactions that consume excessive gas, disrupting application functionality or causing high costs.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Application unable to interact with the network.
        *   Loss of funds due to gas fees.

        *   **Estimate Gas Costs:** Use `fuels-rs` functions to estimate gas costs *before* submission.
        *   **Monitor Gas Prices:** Monitor gas prices and adjust limits dynamically.
        *   **Circuit Breakers:** Implement circuit breakers to prevent transaction submission during high gas prices or failures.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Limit the rate of transaction submissions.
