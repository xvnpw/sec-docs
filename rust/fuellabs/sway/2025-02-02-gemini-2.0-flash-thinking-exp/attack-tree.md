## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Root: Achieve Financial Gain/Data Manipulation through Sway Application Compromise](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_root_achieve_financial_gaindata_manipulation_through_sway_application_compromise.md)

**Attack Vectors:** This is the ultimate goal, encompassing all successful attacks down the tree. Any successful exploitation of the sub-nodes leads to achieving this goal.
    * **Why Critical:** Represents the highest level objective and the target of all security efforts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: 1. Exploit Sway Language Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_1__exploit_sway_language_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vectors:** Compiler bugs, language design flaws, and incorrect usage of language features. While compiler bugs and language design flaws themselves are not high-risk paths due to lower likelihood, they are critical because they underpin all vulnerabilities related to Sway code. Incorrect usage of Sway features *is* a high-risk path branching from this critical node.
    * **Why Critical:**  Language vulnerabilities can have a widespread impact, affecting all applications built with Sway.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path & Critical Node: 1.3. Incorrect Usage of Sway Features (Developer Error)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_&_critical_node_1_3__incorrect_usage_of_sway_features__developer_error_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
        * Reentrancy vulnerabilities
        * Integer overflow/underflow
        * Access control bypass
        * Logic errors in business logic
        * Unhandled exceptions/error conditions
    * **Why High-Risk:** High likelihood due to common developer mistakes in smart contract development. High to critical impact as these vulnerabilities can directly lead to financial loss, data manipulation, or contract compromise. Relatively low to medium effort and skill level for exploitation, and medium detection difficulty, making them attractive targets for attackers.

    * **High-Risk Path: 1.3.1. Reentrancy Vulnerabilities in Sway Contracts**
        * **Attack Vectors:**  Crafting malicious contracts or transactions that trigger reentrant calls to vulnerable functions, allowing attackers to repeatedly execute code and manipulate contract state in unintended ways.
        * **Why High-Risk:** Medium-High likelihood, High impact, Low-Medium effort, Medium skill level, Medium detection difficulty. Reentrancy is a well-known smart contract vulnerability, and developers might still make mistakes in preventing it.

    * **High-Risk Path: 1.3.2. Integer Overflow/Underflow in Sway Arithmetic**
        * **Attack Vectors:** Providing inputs that cause arithmetic operations to overflow or underflow, leading to incorrect calculations, bypass of security checks, or unexpected contract behavior.
        * **Why High-Risk:** Medium likelihood, Medium-High impact, Low-Medium effort, Low-Medium skill level, Medium detection difficulty. Integer arithmetic errors are common programming mistakes, especially if input validation is insufficient.

    * **High-Risk Path: 1.3.3. Access Control Bypass in Sway Contracts**
        * **Attack Vectors:** Exploiting flaws in access control logic to gain unauthorized access to privileged functions or data, allowing attackers to perform actions they are not supposed to.
        * **Why High-Risk:** Medium-High likelihood, High impact, Medium effort, Medium skill level, Medium detection difficulty. Access control logic can be complex and prone to errors, especially in intricate contracts.

    * **High-Risk Path: 1.3.4. Logic Errors in Sway Contract Business Logic**
        * **Attack Vectors:** Identifying and exploiting flaws in the core business logic of the contract to manipulate its behavior for financial gain or data manipulation. This is highly context-dependent and relies on understanding the specific contract's purpose.
        * **Why High-Risk:** High likelihood, High-Critical impact, Medium-High effort, Medium-High skill level, Hard detection difficulty. Business logic is complex and unique, making errors highly probable and potentially very damaging.

    * **High-Risk Path: 1.3.5. Unhandled Exceptions/Error Conditions in Sway**
        * **Attack Vectors:** Triggering unhandled exceptions or error conditions in the contract to cause unexpected state changes, denial of service, or contract malfunction.
        * **Why High-Risk:** Medium likelihood, Medium impact, Low-Medium effort, Low-Medium skill level, Medium detection difficulty. Developers might overlook error handling, especially in complex or edge cases.

**Attack Vectors:** VM execution bugs, gas/resource exhaustion attacks (if applicable), memory management issues in FuelVM. While VM execution bugs and memory management issues are not high-risk paths due to lower likelihood and higher effort, they are critical because they target the underlying execution environment.
