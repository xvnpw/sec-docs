# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for fuellabs/sway

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Strict Gas Limits (Sway-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_strict_gas_limits__sway-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Analyze Gas Costs:** Use `forc build --gas-estimation` and any available Sway-specific profiling tools to get precise gas cost estimates for each function. Focus on Sway constructs like loops, storage access (reads/writes), and complex data structure manipulations.
    2.  **Set Realistic Limits (Sway Attribute):** Use the `#[payable(gas_limit = X)]` *attribute* directly in your Sway code. This is a Sway-level enforcement mechanism.  Choose `X` carefully, balancing a small safety margin with preventing DoS.
    3.  **Test with Gas Limits (Sway Testing):** Use `forc test` and ensure your test suite includes scenarios that approach the gas limits.  This verifies the limits are correctly enforced *by the FuelVM*.
    4.  **Iterate and Refine:** As the Sway compiler and FuelVM evolve, gas costs *will* change.  Re-run gas estimation and adjust the `gas_limit` attribute in your Sway code periodically.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Resource Exhaustion DoS (High Severity):** Directly prevents Sway code from executing beyond the specified gas limit, stopping DoS attacks that rely on expensive operations.
    *   **Unexpectedly High Transaction Costs (Medium Severity):** Provides a hard limit within the Sway code itself, preventing users from accidentally submitting overly expensive transactions.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Resource Exhaustion DoS:** Very high impact. This is a *primary* defense against gas-based DoS.
    *   **Unexpectedly High Transaction Costs:** High impact, as it sets a contract-enforced limit.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `#[payable(gas_limit = 500000)]` is used on the `mint` and `transfer` functions in `token.sw`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `#[payable(gas_limit = ...)]` is missing on the `approve` function.
    *   Gas cost analysis and attribute updates are needed after recent Sway code modifications.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Size Limits (Sway Code)](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_size_limits__sway_code_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sway Inputs:** For *every* Sway function, identify all input parameters (arrays, strings, structs, etc.).
    2.  **Define Constraints (Sway Types & Logic):** Use Sway's type system (e.g., fixed-size arrays `[u8; 32]`) and `require()` statements *within the Sway code* to define and enforce constraints.  Example: `require(input_array.len() <= MAX_ARRAY_LENGTH, "Input array too large");`
    3.  **Sway-Specific Checks:** Leverage Sway's features for validation. For example, if you have an `enum`, ensure input values are valid members of that enum.
    4.  **Test with Invalid Inputs (Sway Tests):** Write `forc test` cases that deliberately provide invalid inputs to your Sway functions, verifying the `require()` statements and type checks work as expected.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Resource Exhaustion DoS (High Severity):** Prevents Sway code from processing excessively large inputs that could lead to high gas consumption.
    *   **Logic Errors (Medium Severity):** Ensures Sway functions only receive data conforming to expected types and ranges, preventing unexpected behavior.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Resource Exhaustion DoS:** High impact, as it stops oversized inputs at the Sway code level.
    *   **Logic Errors:** Medium-high impact, improving the robustness of the Sway code.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `require(message.len() <= 256, "Message too long");` in `send_message` function.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Missing size limits on arrays passed to `process_data`.
    *   No validation of `user_id` string format.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use Checked Arithmetic Operations (Sway Intrinsics)](./mitigation_strategies/use_checked_arithmetic_operations__sway_intrinsics_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Arithmetic (Sway Code):** Locate *all* instances of `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` in your Sway code.
    2.  **Replace with Sway Intrinsics:** Replace *every* unchecked operator with its Sway-provided checked counterpart: `checked_add`, `checked_sub`, `checked_mul`, `checked_div`.  These are *intrinsic* to Sway.
    3.  **Handle `Option` (Sway Pattern Matching):** The checked functions return an `Option<u64>`. Use Sway's `match` statement or `unwrap_or` to handle the `None` case (overflow/underflow), typically reverting the transaction using `revert(ERROR_CODE);`.
    4.  **Test Overflow/Underflow (Sway Tests):** Write `forc test` cases that *specifically* cause overflows and underflows, verifying your Sway code handles them correctly.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Arithmetic Overflows/Underflows (High Severity):** *Completely* prevents vulnerabilities arising from integer overflows and underflows in Sway code.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Arithmetic Overflows/Underflows:** Extremely high impact. This is the *fundamental* mitigation.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `checked_add` and `checked_mul` are used in `calculate_reward`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Unchecked `-` is used in `update_balance`. This *must* be changed to `checked_sub`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Effects-Interaction Pattern (Sway Code Structure)](./mitigation_strategies/effects-interaction_pattern__sway_code_structure_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Structure Sway Functions:** Organize each Sway function in this order:
        *   **Checks (Sway `require`):** All input validation, authorization (using `msg_sender()`), and preconditions, implemented using `require()` statements in Sway.
        *   **Effects (Sway State Updates):** Modify the contract's state (storage variables) *only after* all checks pass.  Use Sway's assignment operators.
        *   **Interactions (Sway `call`):** Make external calls to *other* contracts (using Sway's `call` mechanism) *after* state updates.
    2.  **Minimize Post-Interaction State Changes (Sway Discipline):** *Strictly* avoid modifying Sway's contract state *after* an external call, unless absolutely unavoidable (and then use extreme caution and consider Sway-compatible mutexes if available).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Reentrancy-Like Issues (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk, even though Sway prevents direct reentrancy to the *same* contract.  Focuses on safe interaction *between* Sway contracts.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Reentrancy-Like Issues:** Medium-high impact, by enforcing a safe calling pattern within the Sway code.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `transfer` function mostly follows this pattern.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `claim_rewards` calls an external contract *before* updating the user's balance in Sway storage. This needs refactoring.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid Unsafe `asm` Blocks (Sway Code Choice)](./mitigation_strategies/avoid_unsafe__asm__blocks__sway_code_choice_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Prioritize Sway:** Use Sway's built-in functions, standard library, and language features *exclusively* whenever possible.
    2.  **Justification and Documentation (If Unavoidable):** If `asm` is *absolutely* required, provide a *very* strong justification and extremely detailed documentation within the Sway code itself, explaining *why* Sway's features are insufficient and outlining the `asm` block's precise behavior and risks.
    3.  **Isolation (Sway Code Organization):** Keep `asm` blocks as small and self-contained as possible within the Sway code.
    4.  **Extensive Sway-Level Testing:** Even with `asm`, write as many `forc test` cases as possible to test the surrounding Sway code and the overall contract behavior, including edge cases and potential interactions with the `asm` block.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Memory Safety Violations (High Severity):** `asm` bypasses Sway's memory safety. Avoiding it eliminates this risk entirely.
    *   **Logic Errors (High Severity):** Incorrect `asm` can cause arbitrary, hard-to-debug issues.
    *   **Non-Deterministic Behavior (Medium Severity):** `asm` might behave differently across FuelVM versions.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **All Threats:** Extremely high impact if `asm` is avoided completely.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   No `asm` blocks are currently used in the project.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   N/A (since `asm` is avoided)

## Mitigation Strategy: [Leverage Sway's Type System (Sway Type Definitions)](./mitigation_strategies/leverage_sway's_type_system__sway_type_definitions_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Custom Sway Types:** Use `struct` and `enum` extensively to create custom types that precisely model your data.  Avoid generic types (like `u64`) where a more specific Sway type (e.g., `Balance`, `UserID`) is appropriate.
    2.  **Sway Type Aliases:** Use `type` aliases to give meaningful names to complex Sway types, improving readability.
    3.  **Enforce Constraints (Sway Compiler):** Let the Sway compiler enforce type constraints.  For example, if a value should only be one of a few options, use a Sway `enum`.
    4. **Review for Shadowing (Sway Code Review):** Carefully examine your Sway code for any instances of variable shadowing.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Type Confusion Errors (Medium Severity):** The Sway compiler will prevent many type-related errors.
    *   **Logic Errors (Medium Severity):** Clearer Sway types make the code easier to understand and maintain, reducing logic errors.
    * **Shadowing-Related Bugs (Medium Severity):** Prevents unexpected behavior.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Type Confusion Errors:** High impact, as the Sway compiler enforces type safety.
    *   **Logic Errors:** Medium impact, by improving code clarity.
    * **Shadowing-Related Bugs:** Medium impact.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `struct User` and `struct Asset` are defined.
    *   `enum TransactionState` is used.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   More specific Sway types could be used in some areas (e.g., a `Balance` type instead of just `u64`).
    *   A code review focused on Sway-specific shadowing is needed.
