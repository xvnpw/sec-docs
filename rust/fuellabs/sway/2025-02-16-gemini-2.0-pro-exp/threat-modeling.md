# Threat Model Analysis for fuellabs/sway

## Threat: [Unauthorized State Modification](./threats/unauthorized_state_modification.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized State Change
*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a logic flaw or missing access control check *within the Sway code* to modify the contract's state in an unintended way. This bypasses intended restrictions implemented in Sway. The vulnerability is *specifically* in how the Sway contract handles state and permissions.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Funds stolen or misdirected.
    *   Ownership or permissions changed without authorization.
    *   Contract data corrupted, potentially leading to a complete loss of functionality.
*   **Sway Component Affected:**
    *   Functions that modify `storage` variables.
    *   Missing or incorrect `require()` statements that should enforce access control *before* state changes.
    *   Incorrect use of `msg_sender()` for authorization.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Access Control (Sway-Specific):**  Use `msg_sender()` *correctly* within Sway functions to identify the caller and enforce authorization rules.  Use `require()` statements *before any state modification* to check permissions based on `msg_sender()` or other role-based logic defined in Sway.
    *   **Input Validation (Sway-Specific):**  Thoroughly validate *all* inputs to functions that modify state, using Sway's type system and `require()` statements to enforce constraints. This includes checking data types, ranges, and lengths *within the Sway code*.
    *   **Immutability (Sway Design):** Design the Sway contract to make as much of the state immutable as possible, reducing the attack surface. This is a fundamental design principle within the Sway contract itself.

## Threat: [Reentrancy Attack](./threats/reentrancy_attack.md)

*   **Threat:** Reentrancy Exploitation
*   **Description:** An attacker uses a malicious contract to recursively call back into the vulnerable *Sway* contract *before* the initial Sway function invocation completes its state updates. This exploits the order of operations *within the Sway contract's execution*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Funds stolen from the contract.
    *   Unauthorized modification of contract state, leading to inconsistent or corrupted data.
    *   Contract becoming unusable due to corrupted state.
*   **Sway Component Affected:**
    *   Sway functions that make external calls to other contracts (especially untrusted contracts).
    *   Sway state variables (`storage`) that are modified *after* external calls within a Sway function.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern (Sway Implementation):**  Strictly follow this pattern *within the Sway code*:
        1.  **Checks:** Perform all necessary checks (input validation, authorization using `msg_sender()` and `require()`) *in Sway*.
        2.  **Effects:** Update the *Sway* contract's state (`storage` variables).
        3.  **Interactions:** Make external calls.
    *   **Reentrancy Guard (Mutex - Sway Implementation):** Implement a reentrancy guard (a boolean flag in `storage`) *within the Sway contract* to prevent recursive calls.  Set the flag to `true` before making an external call and to `false` after the call returns.  Check the flag at the beginning of the Sway function using `require()`.

## Threat: [Logic Errors (Sway-Specific)](./threats/logic_errors__sway-specific_.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploitation of Logic Flaws *within Sway Code*
*   **Description:** The *Sway* contract's code contains logical errors that allow an attacker to achieve unintended outcomes, even if there are no specific vulnerabilities like reentrancy. This is a broad category encompassing any flaw in the *Sway contract's intended behavior as expressed in Sway*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Wide range of impacts, depending on the specific logic error *within the Sway code*.  Could include funds theft, unauthorized access, data corruption, or complete contract malfunction.
*   **Sway Component Affected:**
    *   Any part of the *Sway* contract's code, including functions, control flow statements (if/else, loops), and data structure manipulations *written in Sway*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the impact)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Thorough Code Review (Sway Focus):**  Multiple developers should review the *Sway* code, specifically looking for logical errors and edge cases *in the Sway implementation*.
    *   **Extensive Testing (Sway-Specific):**  Write comprehensive unit tests, integration tests, and property-based tests *targeting the Sway code* to cover all possible execution paths and scenarios.
    *   **Formal Verification (Sway):**  Consider using formal verification tools (if/when available for Sway) to mathematically prove the correctness of critical *Sway* logic.
    *   **Simple Design (Sway):**  Keep the *Sway* contract's logic as simple and straightforward as possible.  Avoid unnecessary complexity *in the Sway code*.
    *   **Audits (Sway Expertise):** Engage professional security auditors *with expertise in Sway* to review the code.

## Threat: [Incorrect Dependency Management (Sway Dependencies)](./threats/incorrect_dependency_management__sway_dependencies_.md)

*   **Threat:** Vulnerable Sway Dependency
*   **Description:** The Sway contract relies on an external Sway library or contract (declared as a `dep` in `Forc.toml`) that contains a vulnerability. The vulnerability is *within the Sway code of the dependency*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   The vulnerability in the *Sway* dependency can be exploited to compromise the main *Sway* contract.
*   **Sway Component Affected:**
    *   `dep` declarations in `Forc.toml` (specifying Sway dependencies).
    *   Any Sway code that uses functions from the external Sway library.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use Trusted Dependencies (Sway Ecosystem):** Only use Sway dependencies from trusted sources within the Sway/Fuel ecosystem.
    *   **Audit Dependencies (Sway Code):** Review the *Sway code* of all dependencies for potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Pin Dependency Versions (Forc.toml):** Specify exact versions of Sway dependencies in `Forc.toml` to prevent unexpected updates that might introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   **Monitor for Vulnerabilities (Sway Community):** Stay informed about security vulnerabilities in your Sway dependencies through the Sway community and any vulnerability reporting channels.
    * **Fork and Maintain (Sway):** If a critical Sway dependency is unmaintained or has known vulnerabilities, consider forking the *Sway* code and maintaining your own secure version.
