# Deep Analysis: Logic Errors in Sway Contracts

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to provide the development team with a comprehensive understanding of logic errors in Sway contracts, enabling them to proactively identify, prevent, and mitigate such vulnerabilities.  This goes beyond simply stating the threat exists; we aim to equip developers with the knowledge to *reason* about potential logic flaws in their Sway code.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on logic errors *within the Sway code itself*.  It does *not* cover:

*   Vulnerabilities in the FuelVM itself.
*   Vulnerabilities in the surrounding infrastructure (e.g., client-side code, oracles).
*   Generic smart contract vulnerabilities (like reentrancy) *unless* they manifest as a specific logic error within the Sway implementation.  We're focusing on the *Sway-specific* ways logic can go wrong.

The scope includes all aspects of Sway contract code, including:

*   **Functions:**  Incorrect implementation of intended functionality.
*   **Control Flow:**  Errors in `if/else` statements, loops (`while`, `for`), and `match` expressions.
*   **Data Structures:**  Incorrect manipulation of `struct`s, `enum`s, arrays, and storage variables.
*   **State Management:**  Incorrect updates to contract state, leading to inconsistent or exploitable conditions.
*   **Arithmetic Operations:** Integer overflows/underflows, incorrect rounding, or division by zero *that result from flawed logic, not just inherent limitations*.
*   **Access Control:** Logic errors that bypass intended authorization checks.
*   **Gas Optimization (gone wrong):** Attempts to optimize gas usage that inadvertently introduce logical flaws.
* **Type Handling:** Incorrect use of Sway's type system that leads to logical inconsistencies.

### 1.3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Categorization of Logic Errors:**  We'll break down logic errors into common patterns and anti-patterns observed in Sway and general smart contract development.
2.  **Sway-Specific Examples:**  We'll provide concrete Sway code examples illustrating each category of logic error.  These examples will be as realistic as possible.
3.  **Exploitation Scenarios:**  For each example, we'll describe how an attacker might exploit the flaw.
4.  **Mitigation Techniques (Detailed):**  We'll expand on the initial mitigation strategies, providing specific guidance for Sway development.
5.  **Testing Strategies (Sway-Specific):** We'll detail how to write effective tests to catch these logic errors.
6.  **Tooling Recommendations:** We'll suggest tools that can aid in identifying and preventing logic errors.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Logic Errors

### 2.1. Categorization of Logic Errors (with Sway Examples)

Here's a breakdown of common logic error categories, with Sway-specific examples and exploitation scenarios:

**2.1.1. Incorrect State Transitions**

*   **Description:** The contract fails to properly update its state, leading to inconsistencies or allowing unintended actions.
*   **Example (Sway):**

    ```sway
    contract;

    storage {
        item_available: bool = true,
        owner: Option<Identity> = Option::None(),
    }

    abi MyContract {
        #[storage(write)]
        fn claim_item();

        #[storage(read)]
        fn is_item_available() -> bool;
    }

    impl MyContract for Contract {
        #[storage(write)]
        fn claim_item() {
            require(storage.item_available, "Item not available");
            storage.owner = Option::Some(msg_sender().unwrap());
            // Forgot to set item_available to false
        }

        #[storage(read)]
        fn is_item_available() -> bool {
            storage.item_available
        }
    }
    ```

*   **Exploitation:** Multiple users can call `claim_item()` and become the "owner" because `item_available` is never set to `false`.  This violates the intended single-owner logic.

*   **Mitigation:**  Ensure *all* relevant state variables are updated correctly in *every* state transition.  Use a state diagram to visualize the contract's state and transitions.

**2.1.2. Incorrect Access Control**

*   **Description:**  The contract fails to properly restrict access to sensitive functions or data.
*   **Example (Sway):**

    ```sway
    contract;

    storage {
        admin: Identity,
    }

    abi MyContract {
        #[storage(write)]
        fn set_admin(new_admin: Identity);

        #[storage(write)]
        fn withdraw_funds(amount: u64);
    }

    impl MyContract for Contract {
        #[storage(write)]
        fn set_admin(new_admin: Identity) {
            // Anyone can call this and become the admin!
            storage.admin = new_admin;
        }

        #[storage(write)]
        fn withdraw_funds(amount: u64) {
            require(msg_sender().unwrap() == storage.admin, "Unauthorized");
            // Transfer funds...
            transfer_to_address(amount, ContractId::from(storage.admin.try_into().unwrap()), AssetId::BASE_ASSET);
        }
    }
    ```

*   **Exploitation:**  An attacker can call `set_admin()` to make themselves the admin, then call `withdraw_funds()` to steal all the contract's funds.

*   **Mitigation:**  Use `msg_sender()` *consistently and correctly* to enforce authorization.  Consider using a dedicated access control library or pattern (e.g., Ownable).  Explicitly check for `Option::None()` when unwrapping `msg_sender()`.

**2.1.3. Incorrect Arithmetic/Numerical Handling**

*   **Description:**  Errors in calculations, especially those involving user-supplied inputs, leading to unexpected results.
*   **Example (Sway):**

    ```sway
    contract;

    abi MyContract {
        #[storage(write)]
        fn calculate_reward(user_input: u64) -> u64;
    }

    impl MyContract for Contract {
        #[storage(write)]
        fn calculate_reward(user_input: u64) -> u64 {
            // Intended: reward = user_input * 10 / 100
            // Flawed:  Integer division truncates, leading to 0 for small inputs.
            user_input * 10 / 100
        }
    }
    ```

*   **Exploitation:**  If a user provides a small `user_input` (e.g., 5), the reward will be 0 (5 * 10 / 100 = 0 in integer division).  This might be unfair or exploitable depending on the contract's logic.

*   **Mitigation:**  Be *extremely* careful with integer division.  Consider using fixed-point arithmetic libraries or techniques to handle fractions accurately.  Test with edge cases (small numbers, large numbers, zero).  Use checked arithmetic operations (`checked_add`, `checked_mul`, etc.) when available to detect overflows/underflows.

**2.1.4. Incorrect Conditional Logic**

*   **Description:** Errors in `if/else` statements, `match` expressions, or loop conditions, leading to unintended execution paths.
*   **Example (Sway):**

    ```sway
    contract;

    abi MyContract {
        #[storage(write)]
        fn process_payment(amount: u64, is_premium_user: bool);
    }

    impl MyContract for Contract {
        #[storage(write)]
        fn process_payment(amount: u64, is_premium_user: bool) {
            if amount > 100 {
                // Process large payment
            } else if is_premium_user {
                // Process premium user payment
            }
            // Missing else:  Regular users with payments <= 100 are not processed!
        }
    }
    ```

*   **Exploitation:**  Regular users making payments of 100 or less will have their payments ignored, potentially leading to loss of funds or service denial.

*   **Mitigation:**  Carefully consider *all* possible branches of conditional logic.  Use exhaustive `match` expressions where appropriate.  Write tests that cover *every* branch of your `if/else` and `match` statements.

**2.1.5. Incorrect Data Validation**

*   **Description:**  The contract fails to properly validate user-supplied inputs, leading to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
*   **Example (Sway):**

    ```sway
    contract;

    abi MyContract {
        #[storage(write)]
        fn set_data(data: b256);
    }

    impl MyContract for Contract {
        #[storage(write)]
        fn set_data(data: b256) {
            // No validation on 'data' - could be anything!
            storage.data = data;
        }
    }
    ```

*   **Exploitation:**  An attacker could provide arbitrary data, potentially corrupting the contract's state or triggering unexpected behavior in other functions that rely on `storage.data`.

*   **Mitigation:**  *Always* validate user inputs.  Check for length, range, format, and any other relevant constraints.  Use `require` statements to enforce these validations.

**2.1.6. Incorrect Use of `require` and `assert`**

* **Description:** Misuse of `require` and `assert` can lead to unexpected reverts or missed error conditions. `require` is for validating user input and external conditions, while `assert` is for internal invariants.
* **Example (Sway):**
    ```sway
    contract;

    storage {
        counter: u64,
    }

    abi MyContract {
        #[storage(write)]
        fn increment(value: u64);
    }

    impl MyContract for Contract {
        #[storage(write)]
        fn increment(value: u64) {
            // Incorrect: Should use require to validate user input
            assert(value > 0, "Value must be positive");
            storage.counter = storage.counter + value;
        }
    }
    ```
* **Exploitation:** Using `assert` for user input validation means the gas cost of the transaction up to the `assert` is still consumed, even if the assertion fails. This can be used in a denial-of-service attack.
* **Mitigation:** Use `require` for validating user inputs and external conditions. Use `assert` to check for internal program invariants that *should never* be false.

**2.1.7. Gas Optimization Errors**

* **Description:** Attempts to optimize gas usage that introduce logical flaws.
* **Example (Sway):**  (Hypothetical - specific examples depend on the optimization technique)  Imagine a scenario where a developer tries to avoid a loop by using a complex mathematical formula, but the formula is incorrect for certain edge cases.
* **Exploitation:** The edge cases where the formula is incorrect could lead to unintended behavior, potentially benefiting an attacker.
* **Mitigation:**  Prioritize *correctness* over optimization.  If you must optimize, thoroughly test the optimized code with a wide range of inputs, including edge cases.  Document the optimization and its assumptions clearly.

**2.1.8. Incorrect Type Handling**
* **Description:** Sway's strong typing can be misused, leading to logical errors.
* **Example (Sway):**
    ```sway
    contract;

    struct User {
        id: u64,
        balance: u64,
    }

    abi MyContract {
        #[storage(write)]
        fn transfer(from_id: u64, to_id: u64, amount: u64);
    }

    impl MyContract for Contract {
        #[storage(write)]
        fn transfer(from_id: u64, to_id: u64, amount: u64) {
            let mut from_user: User = storage.users.get(from_id); // Assuming a storage map
            let mut to_user: User = storage.users.get(to_id);

            // Incorrect:  If from_id == to_id, this modifies the same user twice!
            from_user.balance -= amount;
            to_user.balance += amount;

            storage.users.insert(from_id, from_user);
            storage.users.insert(to_id, to_user);
        }
    }
    ```
* **Exploitation:** If `from_id` and `to_id` are the same, the user's balance will remain unchanged (effectively a no-op), which might not be the intended behavior.  More complex scenarios could lead to more severe issues.
* **Mitigation:** Be mindful of how types are used and modified, especially when dealing with mutable data structures.  Consider using immutable data structures where appropriate.  Test for cases where IDs or other identifiers might be equal.

### 2.2. Mitigation Techniques (Detailed)

*   **Code Reviews (Sway-Focused):**
    *   Have multiple developers review the code, *specifically* looking for logic errors.
    *   Use a checklist of common Sway logic errors (like the ones listed above).
    *   Focus on the *intent* of the code, not just the syntax.  Ask: "Does this code *actually* do what it's supposed to do in all cases?"
    *   Reviewers should be familiar with Sway's specific features and limitations.

*   **Extensive Testing (Sway-Specific):**
    *   **Unit Tests:** Test individual functions with a wide range of inputs, including edge cases and invalid inputs.
    *   **Integration Tests:** Test the interaction between multiple functions and contract components.
    *   **Property-Based Testing:** Use a property-based testing framework (like `proptest` in Rust, if applicable to Sway testing) to generate random inputs and check for invariants.  For example, you could test that the total supply of a token never changes unexpectedly.
    *   **Fuzz Testing:**  Use fuzzing tools to generate random, potentially malformed inputs to test for unexpected behavior.
    *   **Test Coverage:**  Aim for 100% code coverage, ensuring that every line of code is executed by at least one test.

*   **Formal Verification (Sway):**
    *   As formal verification tools become available for Sway, use them to mathematically prove the correctness of critical parts of your contract.  This is the strongest form of verification.

*   **Simple Design (Sway):**
    *   Avoid unnecessary complexity.  The simpler the code, the easier it is to reason about and the less likely it is to contain logic errors.
    *   Use clear and descriptive variable and function names.
    *   Document your code thoroughly, explaining the *intent* of each function and the assumptions it makes.

*   **Audits (Sway Expertise):**
    *   Engage professional security auditors *with specific expertise in Sway* to review your code.  They can provide an independent assessment and identify vulnerabilities that you might have missed.

* **Use Established Design Patterns:**
    * Leverage well-known design patterns for smart contracts (e.g., Ownable, Pull-over-Push for payments) to reduce the risk of introducing custom logic errors.

### 2.3. Testing Strategies (Sway-Specific)

*   **Focus on Edge Cases:**  Test with zero values, maximum values, minimum values, and values that are just outside the expected range.
*   **Test for Invalid Inputs:**  Provide inputs that are intentionally invalid (e.g., incorrect types, out-of-range values) to ensure that your contract handles them gracefully.
*   **Test for State Transitions:**  Write tests that specifically check the contract's state before and after each function call.
*   **Test for Access Control:**  Write tests that attempt to call restricted functions from unauthorized accounts.
*   **Test for Gas Usage:**  While not directly related to logic errors, excessive gas usage can be a sign of inefficient or incorrect code.  Monitor gas usage during testing.
*   **Use the Sway Test Framework:** Utilize the built-in testing features of the Sway toolchain (e.g., `forc test`).
*   **Mock External Dependencies:** If your contract interacts with external contracts or oracles, use mocking techniques to simulate their behavior during testing.

### 2.4. Tooling Recommendations

*   **Sway Language Server:**  Use a language server that provides real-time feedback, syntax highlighting, and error checking.
*   **`forc`:**  The Sway build tool.  Use it for compiling, testing, and deploying your contracts.
*   **Static Analysis Tools:**  As they become available for Sway, use static analysis tools to automatically detect potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Fuzzing Tools:**  Explore fuzzing tools that can be adapted for Sway.
*   **Formal Verification Tools:**  Keep an eye out for formal verification tools specifically designed for Sway.
* **Slither/Oyente:** While primarily for Solidity, some checks may be adaptable or provide inspiration for Sway-specific tooling.
