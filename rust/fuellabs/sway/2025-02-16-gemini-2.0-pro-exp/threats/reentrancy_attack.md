# Deep Analysis: Reentrancy Attack in Sway Contracts

## 1. Define Objective

**Objective:** To thoroughly analyze the Reentrancy Attack threat in the context of Sway contracts, identify specific vulnerabilities, and provide actionable recommendations to mitigate the risk.  This analysis aims to provide the development team with a clear understanding of how reentrancy attacks work in Sway, how to identify susceptible code patterns, and how to implement robust defenses.  The ultimate goal is to prevent financial loss, data corruption, and contract failure due to reentrancy exploits.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on reentrancy vulnerabilities within Sway contracts.  It covers:

*   **Sway-Specific Mechanisms:**  How reentrancy manifests in the Sway language and its execution environment.
*   **Vulnerable Code Patterns:**  Identifying Sway code structures that are prone to reentrancy.
*   **Sway-Specific Mitigation Techniques:**  Implementing defenses using Sway's features and best practices.
*   **Interaction with External Contracts:**  Analyzing the risks associated with calling external contracts from within Sway.
* **Storage Variable Manipulation:** How reentrancy can affect the state of the contract.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Reentrancy attacks at the blockchain platform level (e.g., Fuel VM vulnerabilities).  We assume the underlying Fuel VM is secure.
*   Attacks that are not directly related to reentrancy (e.g., front-running, denial-of-service, integer overflows, unless they are directly used to facilitate a reentrancy attack).
*   Vulnerabilities in external contracts called by the Sway contract, *except* for how those vulnerabilities can be exploited via reentrancy.

## 3. Methodology

1.  **Threat Understanding:**  Review the provided threat description and expand upon it with concrete examples relevant to Sway.
2.  **Vulnerability Identification:**  Analyze Sway code patterns and identify specific scenarios where reentrancy is possible.  This will involve:
    *   Examining how Sway handles external calls.
    *   Analyzing how Sway manages state updates (`storage`).
    *   Identifying common coding errors that lead to reentrancy vulnerabilities.
3.  **Mitigation Analysis:**  Evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation strategies (Checks-Effects-Interactions and Reentrancy Guard) in the context of Sway.  This will involve:
    *   Providing Sway code examples demonstrating the correct implementation of these mitigations.
    *   Discussing the limitations and potential bypasses of each mitigation.
4.  **Testing Recommendations:**  Suggest specific testing strategies to detect and prevent reentrancy vulnerabilities in Sway contracts.
5.  **Documentation and Reporting:**  Present the findings in a clear and concise manner, suitable for developers and security auditors.

## 4. Deep Analysis of the Reentrancy Threat

### 4.1. Threat Understanding (Expanded)

The core of a reentrancy attack is exploiting the state changes *during* a function's execution.  In Sway, this means manipulating the contract's `storage` before the initial function call has completed.  A malicious contract can achieve this by calling back into the vulnerable Sway contract through an external call.

**Example Scenario (Sway):**

Consider a simplified Sway contract representing a bank:

```rust
contract;

storage {
    balances: StorageMap<Identity, u64> = StorageMap {},
}

abi Bank {
    #[storage(read, write)]
    fn deposit(amount: u64);

    #[storage(read, write)]
    fn withdraw(amount: u64);
}

impl Bank for Contract {
    #[storage(read, write)]
    fn deposit(amount: u64) {
        let caller = msg_sender().unwrap();
        storage.balances.insert(caller, storage.balances.get(caller).unwrap_or(0) + amount);
    }

    #[storage(read, write)]
    fn withdraw(amount: u64) {
        let caller = msg_sender().unwrap();
        let balance = storage.balances.get(caller).unwrap_or(0);
        require(balance >= amount, "Insufficient funds");

        // VULNERABILITY: External call BEFORE state update
        let receiver: Address = match caller {
            Identity::ContractId(contract_id) => contract_id.into(),
            Identity::Address(address) => address,
        };
        let call_result = call(receiver, amount, 0, 0); // Simplified call for demonstration
        require(call_result.success, "Transfer failed");

        // State update AFTER external call
        storage.balances.insert(caller, balance - amount);
    }
}
```

A malicious contract could exploit this `withdraw` function:

```rust
contract;

use ::bank::Bank; // Assuming the Bank contract's ABI is available

storage {
    bank_contract_id: ContractId,
    is_attacking: bool = false,
}

abi Attacker {
    #[storage(read, write)]
    fn attack(bank_contract_id: ContractId);

    #[storage(read, write)]
    fn receive_funds(); // This function will be called by the Bank contract
}

impl Attacker for Contract {
    #[storage(read, write)]
    fn attack(bank_contract_id: ContractId) {
        storage.bank_contract_id = bank_contract_id;
        let bank = Bank::new(bank_contract_id);
        bank.deposit{gas: 1000000}(10); // Deposit some initial funds
        bank.withdraw{gas: 1000000}(10); // Start the attack
    }

    #[storage(read, write)]
    fn receive_funds() {
        if !storage.is_attacking {
            storage.is_attacking = true;
            let bank = Bank::new(storage.bank_contract_id);
            bank.withdraw{gas: 1000000}(10); // Re-entrant call!
            storage.is_attacking = false;
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation of the Attack:**

1.  The `Attacker` contract deposits 10 coins into the `Bank`.
2.  The `Attacker` calls `Bank.withdraw(10)`.
3.  The `Bank` checks the balance (which is 10) and proceeds to the external call to the `Attacker`'s `receive_funds` function.
4.  *Before* the `Bank` updates its `balances` storage, the `Attacker`'s `receive_funds` function is executed.
5.  Inside `receive_funds`, the `Attacker` *again* calls `Bank.withdraw(10)`.
6.  The `Bank` *again* checks the balance.  Crucially, the balance is *still* 10 because the first `withdraw` call hasn't updated the storage yet.
7.  The `Bank` sends another 10 coins to the `Attacker`.
8.  The second `withdraw` call finally updates the `Bank`'s balance to 0.
9.  The first `withdraw` call *then* updates the balance to -10 (which might wrap around to a very large number, depending on the integer type).

The attacker has successfully withdrawn 20 coins, even though they only deposited 10.

### 4.2. Vulnerability Identification (Sway-Specific)

The key vulnerability in Sway is the order of operations: **external calls before state updates**.  Any Sway function that follows this pattern is potentially vulnerable:

1.  **Reads from `storage`:**  Retrieves data from the contract's state.
2.  **Makes an external call:**  Invokes a function on another contract (especially an untrusted one).
3.  **Writes to `storage`:**  Updates the contract's state *after* the external call returns.

This pattern is dangerous because the external call can re-enter the Sway contract and modify the state before the original function has finished its intended updates.

### 4.3. Mitigation Analysis (Sway-Specific)

#### 4.3.1. Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern (CEI)

This is the *primary* defense against reentrancy.  The CEI pattern dictates the following order within a Sway function:

1.  **Checks:**
    *   Input validation (e.g., `require(amount > 0, "Invalid amount");`).
    *   Authorization checks (e.g., `require(msg_sender().unwrap() == owner, "Unauthorized");`).
    *   Any other preconditions that must be true before proceeding.

2.  **Effects:**
    *   Update the contract's `storage`.  This includes *all* state changes that should occur as a result of the function call.

3.  **Interactions:**
    *   Make external calls to other contracts.

**Sway Example (Corrected `withdraw` function):**

```rust
    #[storage(read, write)]
    fn withdraw(amount: u64) {
        let caller = msg_sender().unwrap();
        let balance = storage.balances.get(caller).unwrap_or(0);

        // --- Checks ---
        require(balance >= amount, "Insufficient funds");

        // --- Effects ---
        storage.balances.insert(caller, balance - amount);

        // --- Interactions ---
        let receiver: Address = match caller {
            Identity::ContractId(contract_id) => contract_id.into(),
            Identity::Address(address) => address,
        };
        let call_result = call(receiver, amount, 0, 0); // Simplified call
        require(call_result.success, "Transfer failed");
    }
```

By updating the `storage` *before* the external call, we eliminate the reentrancy vulnerability.  Even if the called contract tries to re-enter, the balance will have already been decremented, preventing the double withdrawal.

#### 4.3.2. Reentrancy Guard (Mutex)

A reentrancy guard is a boolean flag in `storage` that acts as a lock.  It's a secondary defense, useful when the CEI pattern is difficult to apply strictly.

**Sway Example:**

```rust
contract;

storage {
    balances: StorageMap<Identity, u64> = StorageMap {},
    reentrancy_guard: bool = false,
}

abi Bank {
    #[storage(read, write)]
    fn deposit(amount: u64);

    #[storage(read, write)]
    fn withdraw(amount: u64);
}

impl Bank for Contract {
    #[storage(read, write)]
    fn deposit(amount: u64) {
        let caller = msg_sender().unwrap();
        storage.balances.insert(caller, storage.balances.get(caller).unwrap_or(0) + amount);
    }

    #[storage(read, write)]
    fn withdraw(amount: u64) {
        // --- Reentrancy Guard Check ---
        require(!storage.reentrancy_guard, "Reentrancy detected");
        storage.reentrancy_guard = true;

        let caller = msg_sender().unwrap();
        let balance = storage.balances.get(caller).unwrap_or(0);
        require(balance >= amount, "Insufficient funds");

        let receiver: Address = match caller {
            Identity::ContractId(contract_id) => contract_id.into(),
            Identity::Address(address) => address,
        };
        let call_result = call(receiver, amount, 0, 0); // Simplified call
        require(call_result.success, "Transfer failed");

        storage.balances.insert(caller, balance - amount);

        // --- Release Reentrancy Guard ---
        storage.reentrancy_guard = false;
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `reentrancy_guard` is initialized to `false`.
2.  Before any potentially vulnerable operation, we `require(!storage.reentrancy_guard, "Reentrancy detected");`.  This will revert if the guard is already `true`.
3.  We immediately set `storage.reentrancy_guard = true;` to lock the function.
4.  After the critical section (including the external call), we set `storage.reentrancy_guard = false;` to release the lock.

**Limitations of Reentrancy Guards:**

*   **Gas Costs:**  Reading and writing to `storage` consumes gas.  The reentrancy guard adds to the gas cost of the function.
*   **Single Function Protection:**  The guard only protects the function it's implemented in.  If multiple functions in the same contract are vulnerable, each needs its own guard (or a more sophisticated locking mechanism).
*   **Not a Replacement for CEI:**  The CEI pattern is still the preferred approach.  Reentrancy guards should be used as a fallback or in situations where CEI is impractical.
* **Deadlock potential:** If there is error in logic, contract can get to the state where reentrancy_guard is always true.

### 4.4. Testing Recommendations

Thorough testing is crucial for detecting reentrancy vulnerabilities.  Here are some specific testing strategies for Sway:

1.  **Unit Tests (Sway's `#[test]`):**
    *   Write unit tests that specifically attempt to trigger reentrancy.  Create mock contracts that call back into the tested function.
    *   Test with various input values and edge cases.
    *   Assert that the contract's state is correct after each operation, even in the presence of reentrant calls.

2.  **Fuzz Testing:**
    *   Use a fuzzer to generate random inputs and call sequences to the contract's functions.
    *   Monitor for unexpected state changes or reverts that might indicate a reentrancy vulnerability.

3.  **Formal Verification (Future):**
    *   As Sway's tooling matures, explore formal verification techniques to mathematically prove the absence of reentrancy vulnerabilities.

4.  **Static Analysis (Future):**
    *   Use static analysis tools (when available for Sway) to automatically detect code patterns that are prone to reentrancy.

5.  **Integration Tests:** Test interaction between multiple contracts.

**Example Unit Test (Conceptual - Sway's testing framework will evolve):**

```rust
// This is a conceptual example; Sway's testing syntax may differ
#[test]
fn test_reentrancy_attack() {
    // 1. Deploy the Bank contract.
    let bank = deploy_bank_contract();

    // 2. Deploy a malicious Attacker contract.
    let attacker = deploy_attacker_contract(bank.contract_id());

    // 3. Deposit some funds into the Bank via the Attacker.
    attacker.deposit(10);

    // 4. Attempt the reentrancy attack.
    let result = attacker.attack();

    // 5. Assert that the attack failed (e.g., the Bank's balance is correct).
    assert!(result.is_err()); // Expect an error due to the reentrancy guard or CEI
    assert_eq!(bank.get_balance(attacker.identity()), 0); // Balance should be 0, not negative
}
```

## 5. Conclusion

Reentrancy is a serious threat to Sway contracts, but it can be effectively mitigated through careful coding practices and thorough testing.  The **Checks-Effects-Interactions (CEI)** pattern is the primary defense, and it should be strictly followed whenever possible.  Reentrancy guards provide an additional layer of protection but are not a substitute for CEI.  A combination of unit testing, fuzz testing, and (in the future) formal verification and static analysis is essential to ensure the security of Sway contracts against reentrancy attacks.  Developers should prioritize understanding and implementing these mitigations to prevent financial losses and maintain the integrity of their Sway applications.
