## Attack Tree Path: [1. Sway Language Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/1__sway_language_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **1.1 Integer Overflow/Underflow:**

    *   **1.1.1 Unsigned Integer Overflow [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   **Description:** Sway uses unsigned integer types (e.g., `u64`). When a calculation results in a value larger than the maximum representable value for the type, the value "wraps around" to zero. This can lead to unexpected and exploitable behavior in contract logic.
        *   **Example:**
            ```sway
            fn vulnerable_function(amount: u64) {
                let balance: u64 = 10;
                let new_balance = balance + amount; // Potential overflow!
                if new_balance > balance {
                    // ... logic that might be bypassed due to overflow ...
                }
            }
            ```
            If `amount` is a very large number (e.g., close to `u64::MAX`), `new_balance` could become smaller than `balance` due to the wrap-around, bypassing the intended logic.
        *   **Exploitation:** An attacker could craft an input (`amount` in the example) that triggers the overflow, causing the contract to behave in a way that benefits the attacker (e.g., transferring more tokens than intended, bypassing access controls).
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Use Sway's checked arithmetic operators (`checked_add`, `checked_sub`, `checked_mul`, `checked_div`). These operators return an `Option<u64>`, which will be `None` if an overflow occurs. The contract can then handle the error appropriately.
            *   Thoroughly audit all arithmetic operations, especially those involving user-supplied input.
            *   Consider using libraries that provide safe integer types (if available).
            *   Extensive testing, including fuzzing, to identify potential overflow conditions.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. FuelVM Implementation Flaws](./attack_tree_paths/2__fuelvm_implementation_flaws.md)

*   **2.1 Gas Metering Bugs:**

    *   **2.1.2 Incorrect Gas Limit Calculation [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Description:** The FuelVM is responsible for calculating and enforcing gas limits for transactions. If there's a bug in this calculation, an attacker might be able to execute more operations than intended, potentially exceeding the intended resource limits.
        *   **Exploitation:** An attacker could craft a transaction that, due to the incorrect gas limit calculation, allows them to execute a computationally expensive operation or a sequence of operations that would normally be rejected due to exceeding the gas limit. This could lead to denial of service or, in extreme cases, potentially enable other vulnerabilities.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   This is primarily a FuelVM implementation issue.  The Fuel Labs team is responsible for addressing this.
            *   Application developers should stay updated with FuelVM releases and security advisories.
            *   Report any suspected gas calculation bugs to the Fuel Labs team immediately.
            *   Extensive testing and fuzzing of the FuelVM itself (by the Fuel Labs team) is crucial.

*   **2.3 Instruction Handling Bugs:**

    *   **2.3.1 Incorrect Opcode Handling [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Description:** The FuelVM executes bytecode instructions (opcodes). If there's a bug in the implementation of a specific opcode, the FuelVM might behave unexpectedly. This could range from incorrect calculations to memory corruption.
        *   **Exploitation:** An attacker could craft a transaction containing a specific sequence of opcodes that triggers the bug in the FuelVM's opcode handling. This could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution or manipulation of the contract's state.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   This is a FuelVM implementation issue. The Fuel Labs team is responsible for addressing this.
            *   Application developers should stay updated with FuelVM releases and security advisories.
            *   Report any suspected opcode handling bugs to the Fuel Labs team immediately.
            *   Extensive testing, fuzzing, and formal verification of the FuelVM (by the Fuel Labs team) are crucial.

    *   **2.3.2 Logic Opcode Behavior [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Description:** Similar to incorrect opcode handling, but specifically focusing on logical errors within the *intended* behavior of an opcode. Even if the opcode is "handled" correctly in terms of memory safety, a flaw in its logical implementation could lead to vulnerabilities.
        *   **Exploitation:** An attacker could craft a transaction that leverages the flawed logic of a specific opcode to achieve unintended results, such as manipulating contract state in an unauthorized way.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   This is a FuelVM implementation issue. The Fuel Labs team is responsible for addressing this.
            *   Application developers should stay updated with FuelVM releases and security advisories.
            *   Report any suspected opcode logic bugs to the Fuel Labs team immediately.
            *   Extensive testing, fuzzing, and formal verification of the FuelVM (by the Fuel Labs team) are crucial.
