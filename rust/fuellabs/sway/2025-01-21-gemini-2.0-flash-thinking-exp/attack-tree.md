## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Sway Language Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_sway_language_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

**Description:** This path focuses on exploiting inherent weaknesses or programming errors within the Sway smart contract code itself. Successful exploitation can directly manipulate the contract's state, logic, and assets.
*   **Key Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Integer Overflow/Underflow (Critical Node):**
        *   **Description:**  Arithmetic operations on integer types can result in values wrapping around their maximum or minimum limits, leading to unexpected and potentially exploitable behavior.
        *   **Impact:** Incorrect calculations can bypass access controls, manipulate balances, or cause other critical logic failures.
    *   **Reentrancy Vulnerabilities (If applicable to Sway's execution model) (Potential High-Risk Path/Critical Node):**
        *   **Description:**  If Sway's concurrency model allows, a malicious contract could recursively call functions in the target contract before the initial call completes, potentially leading to unintended state changes or asset theft.
        *   **Impact:**  Manipulation of contract state, potentially leading to unauthorized access or theft of assets.
    *   **Logic Errors in Sway Code (Critical Node & Start of High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Description:** Flaws in the contract's business logic, such as incorrect conditional statements, flawed access control mechanisms, or mishandled state transitions, can be exploited to gain unauthorized access or manipulate data.
        *   **Impact:**  Bypassing intended functionality, gaining unauthorized access, manipulating data, or causing financial loss.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Sway Compiler Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_sway_compiler_vulnerabilities.md)

**Critical Node: Generate Incorrect Bytecode**
*   **Description:** A vulnerability in the Sway compiler could lead to the generation of bytecode that does not accurately reflect the intended logic of the Sway code.
*   **Impact:** The compiled contract behaves differently than expected, potentially introducing subtle and hard-to-detect security flaws.

**Critical Node: Introduce Backdoors During Compilation**
*   **Description:** A highly sophisticated attack where the Sway compiler itself is compromised to inject malicious code into compiled contracts.
*   **Impact:**  Complete and stealthy compromise of deployed contracts, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code or manipulate state at will.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Sway Tooling Vulnerabilities (Fuel-rs SDK, Forc) (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_sway_tooling_vulnerabilities__fuel-rs_sdk__forc___high-risk_path_.md)

**Description:** This path targets vulnerabilities within the tools used to develop, build, and deploy Sway contracts. Compromising these tools can have a wide-ranging impact.
*   **Key Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks on Dependencies (Critical Node):**
        *   **Description:**  Malicious code is injected into dependencies used by Sway tooling (Forc, Fuel-rs SDK). When developers use the compromised tooling, the malicious code can be executed on their machines or injected into the build process.
        *   **Impact:**  Compromise of developer machines, injection of malicious code into deployed contracts, or theft of sensitive information.
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Forc (Sway package manager/build tool) (Critical Node & Start of High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Description:** Flaws in Forc, the Sway package manager and build tool, can be exploited to execute arbitrary code or manipulate files during the build process.
        *   **Impact:** Compromise of developer machines, injection of malicious code into the build output, or access to sensitive project files.
        *   **Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Packages (Critical Node):**
            *   **Description:**  Attackers create and publish malicious Sway packages that, when installed by developers using Forc, execute arbitrary code on their machines.
            *   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of developer machines, allowing attackers to steal credentials, inject malware, or manipulate project files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Interaction Between Application and Sway Contract (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_interaction_between_application_and_sway_contract__high-risk_path_.md)

**Description:** This path focuses on vulnerabilities arising from the communication and data exchange between the off-chain application and the on-chain Sway contract.
*   **Key Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Incorrect Data Handling by Application (Critical Node & Start of High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Description:** The application mishandles data received from the Sway contract, failing to properly validate or sanitize it before using it in further operations.
        *   **Impact:**  Vulnerabilities in the application logic itself, potentially leading to cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection (if interacting with a database), or other application-level exploits.
    *   **Trusting Untrusted Contract Data (Critical Node & Start of High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Description:** The application blindly trusts data returned by the Sway contract without proper verification. A malicious contract could return crafted data to exploit vulnerabilities in the application.
        *   **Impact:**  Execution of unintended actions, manipulation of application state, or exposure of sensitive information based on the malicious data received from the contract.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit FuelVM Vulnerabilities (Underlying Execution Environment)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_fuelvm_vulnerabilities__underlying_execution_environment_.md)

**Potential Critical Node: Trigger bugs in the Fuel Virtual Machine through specific Sway contract interactions**
*   **Description:**  A highly sophisticated attack that exploits vulnerabilities in the underlying Fuel Virtual Machine (FuelVM) by crafting specific interactions within a Sway contract.
*   **Impact:**  Potentially critical consequences for the entire Fuel blockchain, including denial of service, consensus failures, or even the ability to manipulate the blockchain's state.
