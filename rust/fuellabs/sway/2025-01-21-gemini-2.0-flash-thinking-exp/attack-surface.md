# Attack Surface Analysis for fuellabs/sway

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Sway Code Exploiting Compiler Bugs](./attack_surfaces/malicious_sway_code_exploiting_compiler_bugs.md)

**Description:**  Crafted Sway code specifically designed to trigger vulnerabilities within the `forc` compiler during the compilation process.

**How Sway Contributes:** The complexity of the Sway compiler and its parsing/code generation logic can introduce potential bugs that malicious input can exploit.

**Example:** A specially crafted Sway contract with deeply nested structures or unusual type combinations that causes the compiler to crash, hang, or generate incorrect bytecode.

**Impact:** Denial of service during development, generation of vulnerable smart contracts, potential for arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine if the compiler vulnerability is severe.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Developers should keep their `forc` compiler updated to the latest stable version, incorporating bug fixes.
*   Report any suspected compiler bugs to the Fuel Labs team with detailed reproduction steps.
*   Consider using static analysis tools on Sway code before compilation to identify potential issues that might trigger compiler bugs.

## Attack Surface: [Supply Chain Attacks on `forc` Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/supply_chain_attacks_on__forc__dependencies.md)

**Description:**  Compromise of dependencies used by the `forc` compiler, leading to the introduction of malicious code into the compilation process.

**How Sway Contributes:** `forc` relies on external libraries and dependencies for various functionalities. If these dependencies are compromised, the integrity of the compiled Sway code is at risk.

**Example:** A malicious actor gains control of a popular crate used by `forc` and injects code that modifies the output of the compiler to introduce vulnerabilities into all subsequently compiled Sway contracts.

**Impact:** Widespread compromise of Sway applications, potential for backdoors or exploits in deployed contracts, loss of user funds or data.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Fuel Labs should implement robust dependency management practices, including verifying the integrity of dependencies.
*   Developers should be aware of the dependencies used by `forc` and monitor for any security advisories related to them.
*   Consider using tools that perform security audits of project dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Integer Overflow/Underflow in Sway Contracts](./attack_surfaces/integer_overflowunderflow_in_sway_contracts.md)

**Description:**  Arithmetic operations in Sway contracts that result in values exceeding the maximum or falling below the minimum representable value for a given integer type.

**How Sway Contributes:** While Sway aims for safety, developers must still be mindful of integer limits, especially when dealing with external data or complex calculations.

**Example:** A token contract where a transfer function doesn't properly check for sufficient balance, leading to an underflow that allows a user to transfer more tokens than they own.

**Impact:** Incorrect contract state, unexpected behavior, potential for financial exploits.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Developers should use checked arithmetic operations (if available in Sway or through libraries) or implement manual checks to prevent overflows and underflows.
*   Thoroughly test contracts with boundary conditions and large values to identify potential arithmetic issues.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Sway Standard Library Functions](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_sway_standard_library_functions.md)

**Description:**  Bugs or security flaws within the built-in functions provided by the Sway standard library.

**How Sway Contributes:**  If the standard library contains vulnerabilities, any contract using those functions could be affected.

**Example:** A vulnerability in a cryptographic function within the standard library that allows for key recovery or signature forgery.

**Impact:**  Compromise of contract functionality, potential for data breaches or financial loss.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Fuel Labs should rigorously audit and test the Sway standard library for security vulnerabilities.
*   Developers should stay updated on any security advisories related to the standard library and update their compiler accordingly.
*   Consider using well-vetted external libraries for critical functionalities if the standard library's security is in question.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Handling of Private Keys during Deployment](./attack_surfaces/insecure_handling_of_private_keys_during_deployment.md)

**Description:**  Exposure or mishandling of private keys used to deploy Sway contracts to the blockchain.

**How Sway Contributes:** The deployment process inherently involves the use of private keys to sign transactions. If these keys are compromised, malicious actors can deploy or modify contracts.

**Example:** Storing private keys in version control, hardcoding them in deployment scripts, or using insecure key management practices.

**Impact:** Unauthorized deployment of malicious contracts, potential for theft of assets associated with the compromised key.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use secure key management solutions (e.g., hardware wallets, dedicated key management services).
*   Avoid storing private keys directly in code or configuration files.
*   Implement secure deployment pipelines that minimize the exposure of private keys.
