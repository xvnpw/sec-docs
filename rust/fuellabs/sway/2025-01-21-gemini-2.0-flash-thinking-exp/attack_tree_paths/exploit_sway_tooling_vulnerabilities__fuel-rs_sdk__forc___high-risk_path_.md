    *   **Using Trusted Package Registries:**  Prefer official and reputable package registries and consider using private registries for internal dependencies.
    *   **Verification of Package Integrity:**  Utilize checksums and digital signatures to verify the integrity of downloaded packages.
    *   **Regular Audits of Dependencies:** Periodically review the list of dependencies and assess their necessity and security posture.
    *   **Sandboxing and Isolation:**  Run build processes in isolated environments to limit the potential damage from compromised dependencies.

**Node 2: Vulnerabilities in Forc (Sway package manager/build tool) (Critical Node & Start of High-Risk Path)**

*   **Description:** This node focuses on inherent vulnerabilities within Forc, the core tool for managing Sway projects, including package management, building, and testing. Flaws in Forc itself can be directly exploited by attackers.
*   **Technical Mechanisms:**
    *   **Code Injection Vulnerabilities:**  Flaws in Forc's code that allow attackers to inject and execute arbitrary code during its operation. This could be through parsing vulnerabilities, insecure handling of user input, or other software bugs.
    *   **Path Traversal Vulnerabilities:**  Weaknesses that allow attackers to access files and directories outside of the intended scope, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information or the modification of critical files.
    *   **Logic Flaws:**  Errors in the design or implementation of Forc's functionality that can be exploited to manipulate the build process or gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Insecure Update Mechanisms:**  Vulnerabilities in how Forc updates itself, potentially allowing attackers to distribute malicious updates.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   **Compromise of Developer Machines:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in Forc could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the developer's machine when they use the tool.
