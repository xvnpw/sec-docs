# Threat Model Analysis for fuellabs/sway

## Threat: [Reentrancy Vulnerability](./threats/reentrancy_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a function within a Sway smart contract that makes an external call before updating its internal state. The attacker contract recursively calls the vulnerable function within the external call, potentially draining funds or manipulating state before the initial call's effects are recorded. This is a direct consequence of how Sway contracts handle external calls and state updates.

**Impact:** Loss of funds held by the contract, unexpected and potentially malicious state changes, potential denial of service if the contract's logic becomes corrupted.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement the checks-effects-interactions pattern within Sway contract code: perform state updates *before* making external calls.
* Utilize reentrancy guard patterns (e.g., using a boolean flag to prevent concurrent execution) within Sway functions.
* Carefully audit Sway contract code for potential reentrancy vulnerabilities, especially in functions interacting with other contracts.

## Threat: [Integer Overflow/Underflow](./threats/integer_overflowunderflow.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides input or triggers a calculation within a Sway smart contract that results in an integer exceeding its maximum or falling below its minimum representable value. This can lead to incorrect calculations, unexpected behavior, and potentially exploitable logic flaws within the Sway contract. For example, a token transfer calculation could wrap around, allowing an attacker to receive more tokens than intended. This is a direct consequence of Sway's low-level nature and how it handles arithmetic operations.

**Impact:** Incorrect financial calculations within the Sway contract, unexpected contract behavior, potential for unauthorized access or manipulation of assets managed by the contract.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Utilize safe math libraries or implement explicit checks for potential overflows and underflows before and after arithmetic operations within Sway contract code.
* Consider using data types with sufficient range within Sway to prevent overflows/underflows.
* Thoroughly test Sway contract calculations with boundary values.

## Threat: [Logic Errors in Smart Contracts](./threats/logic_errors_in_smart_contracts.md)

**Description:** Flaws in the design or implementation of the Sway smart contract logic allow an attacker to manipulate the contract's behavior in unintended ways. This could involve bypassing intended restrictions, accessing unauthorized functionalities, or causing the contract to enter an undesirable state. For example, incorrect conditional statements or flawed state transitions within the Sway contract code.

**Impact:** Loss of funds managed by the Sway contract, unauthorized access to data or functionalities, data corruption within the contract's storage, denial of service, or complete compromise of the contract's intended functionality.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Rigorous testing of Sway contract code with various inputs and scenarios, including edge cases.
* Thorough code reviews of Sway contracts by multiple experienced developers.
* Formal verification techniques where applicable to mathematically prove the correctness of critical Sway contract logic.
* Adherence to secure coding principles and best practices specifically for Sway development.

## Threat: [Incorrect Access Control](./threats/incorrect_access_control.md)

**Description:** The Sway contract fails to properly restrict access to sensitive functions or data. An attacker can exploit this to perform actions they are not authorized to, such as modifying critical state variables, transferring funds, or invoking administrative functions within the Sway contract. This is a direct vulnerability within the Sway contract's code.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored within the Sway contract, manipulation of the contract's state, loss of funds managed by the contract, privilege escalation allowing attackers to gain administrative control.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust access control using function modifiers or dedicated access control contracts within the Sway codebase.
* Clearly define roles and permissions within the Sway contract's logic.
* Thoroughly test access control logic within the Sway contract with different user roles and scenarios.
* Follow the principle of least privilege when designing access control mechanisms in Sway.

## Threat: [Oracle Manipulation](./threats/oracle_manipulation.md)

**Description:** If the Sway contract relies on external data feeds (oracles), an attacker might compromise the oracle or manipulate the data it provides. This can lead the Sway contract to make decisions based on false information, resulting in financial losses or other adverse outcomes dictated by the contract's logic. This threat directly impacts how the Sway contract interacts with external data.

**Impact:** Incorrect execution of the Sway contract logic, financial losses for users interacting with the contract, manipulation of on-chain events triggered by the Sway contract based on faulty data.

**Risk Severity:** High (depending on the criticality of the oracle data to the Sway contract's functionality)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* When designing Sway contracts that rely on external data, prioritize the use of reputable and decentralized oracle providers.
* Implement mechanisms within the Sway contract to verify the integrity and authenticity of oracle data (e.g., using multiple oracles, data validation checks within the contract).
* Consider using commit-reveal schemes or other techniques within the Sway contract's interaction with oracles to mitigate front-running of oracle updates.

## Threat: [Sway Compiler Bugs](./threats/sway_compiler_bugs.md)

**Description:** A bug in the Sway compiler could lead to the generation of incorrect or vulnerable bytecode, even if the source code appears to be secure. This could introduce unexpected behavior or exploitable flaws in deployed Sway contracts. This is a direct vulnerability within the Sway tooling.

**Impact:** Unpredictable behavior of deployed Sway contracts, potential for exploitation due to flaws introduced during the compilation process, even if the source code was intended to be secure.

**Risk Severity:** High (likelihood is lower, but impact can be severe)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Stay updated with the latest Sway compiler versions, as bug fixes are regularly released by the Fuel Labs team.
* Report any suspected compiler bugs to the Fuel Labs team to contribute to the security and stability of the Sway ecosystem.
* Consider using static analysis tools on the compiled bytecode of Sway contracts as an additional layer of security to detect potential compiler-introduced issues.
