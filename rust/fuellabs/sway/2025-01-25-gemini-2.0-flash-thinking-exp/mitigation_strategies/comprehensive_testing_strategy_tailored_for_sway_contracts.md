#### 4.2. Threats Mitigated

*   **Logic Errors in Sway Contracts (Severity Varies):**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  **High.** Thorough unit testing, especially focusing on Sway-specific logic and edge cases, is highly effective in detecting logic errors. Fuzzing can further enhance this by uncovering unexpected logic flaws.
    *   **Justification:**  Unit tests are designed to verify the intended logic of individual functions and modules. By writing comprehensive tests, developers can ensure that the Sway code behaves as expected under various conditions, significantly reducing the risk of logic errors.

*   **Functional Bugs in Sway Implementation (Severity Varies):**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  **High.**  Functional bugs, where the contract doesn't perform its intended function correctly, are directly addressed by unit and integration testing. Testing different scenarios and use cases ensures that the contract meets its functional requirements.
    *   **Justification:**  Testing functional requirements is the core purpose of software testing. By designing test cases that cover all intended functionalities of the Sway contracts, the strategy effectively mitigates the risk of functional bugs.

*   **Gas-Related Issues in Sway Contracts (Medium Severity):**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  **Medium to High.** Testing gas consumption can identify gas inefficiencies and potential vulnerabilities like gas exhaustion attacks. However, it might not catch all subtle gas-related issues.
    *   **Justification:**  Explicitly testing gas consumption raises awareness of gas optimization and helps developers write more efficient code. While unit tests might not perfectly simulate real-world gas costs on FuelVM, they provide valuable insights into relative gas usage and potential bottlenecks. Fuzzing, if integrated with gas analysis, could further improve the detection of gas-related vulnerabilities.
