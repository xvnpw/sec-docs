## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Sway Routing Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_sway_routing_vulnerabilities.md)

**Exploit Sway Routing Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Route Parameter Injection [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   Attackers manipulate parameters within route definitions (e.g., `/users/{id}`) by injecting malicious code or unexpected values.
        *   Goal: Bypass authorization checks, access unintended resources, trigger errors, or execute arbitrary code.
        *   Example: Injecting `../admin` into a parameter to access administrative functions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Sway Middleware Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_sway_middleware_vulnerabilities.md)

**Exploit Sway Middleware Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Middleware Bypass [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   Attackers craft requests to circumvent the intended checks implemented by middleware components.
        *   Goal: Access protected resources or functionalities without proper authorization or validation.
        *   Example: Sending a request without a required authentication header, hoping the middleware doesn't enforce it correctly.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Sway Request Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_sway_request_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

**Exploit Sway Request Handling Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Input Validation Failures in Request Parsing [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   Sway's request parsing lacks sufficient validation, allowing attackers to inject malicious payloads.
        *   Goal: Execute arbitrary code, access sensitive data, or manipulate the application's state.
        *   Examples:
            *   **Inject Malicious Payloads via Request Body [CRITICAL NODE]:** Injecting SQL queries, command-line instructions, or other code within the request body.
            *   Exploiting vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) by injecting malicious scripts through request parameters or body.
    *   **Insecure File Upload Handling (if implemented via Sway) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   The application allows file uploads through Sway without proper validation and security measures.
        *   Goal: Upload malicious files (e.g., web shells, malware) to gain control of the server or compromise other users.
        *   Example: Uploading a PHP script that allows remote command execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Sway Response Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_sway_response_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

**Exploit Sway Response Handling Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Template Engine Vulnerabilities (if Sway integrates a vulnerable engine) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   If Sway uses a template engine for rendering responses, vulnerabilities in the engine can be exploited.
        *   Goal: Inject malicious code into templates, leading to server-side code execution or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
        *   Example: Injecting template language directives that execute system commands.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Sway's Internal Implementation Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_sway's_internal_implementation_vulnerabilities.md)

**Exploit Sway's Internal Implementation Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Logic Errors in Core Sway Functionality [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   Bugs or flaws exist within Sway's core code logic.
        *   Goal: Trigger unexpected behavior, bypass security checks, or cause a denial of service.
        *   Example: A flaw in Sway's session management leading to privilege escalation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies of Sway (Indirectly)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies_of_sway__indirectly_.md)

**Exploit Dependencies of Sway (Indirectly) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   Vulnerabilities exist in the Go standard library or other third-party libraries used by Sway.
    *   Goal: Exploit these known vulnerabilities to compromise the application.
    *   Example: A known security flaw in a specific version of a library used by Sway that allows remote code execution.
