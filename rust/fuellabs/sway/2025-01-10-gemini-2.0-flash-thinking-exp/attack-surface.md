# Attack Surface Analysis for fuellabs/sway

## Attack Surface: [Memory Safety Issues](./attack_surfaces/memory_safety_issues.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from incorrect memory management, leading to potential crashes, data corruption, or arbitrary code execution.

**How Sway Contributes:** While Sway aims for memory safety, it's a relatively new language. Potential bugs in the compiler or runtime environment could lead to unsafe memory access if not rigorously tested and audited.

**Example:** A compiler bug in `forc` leads to the generation of bytecode that allows writing beyond the bounds of an allocated memory region.

**Impact:** Contract failure, unpredictable behavior, potential for malicious code injection if combined with other vulnerabilities.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Attack Surface: [Integer Overflow/Underflow](./attack_surfaces/integer_overflowunderflow.md)

**Description:** Arithmetic operations on integer types exceeding their maximum or minimum representable values, leading to unexpected behavior and potential exploits.

**How Sway Contributes:** Standard integer types in Sway are susceptible to overflow/underflow if not handled carefully. Developers must be mindful of potential overflows when performing arithmetic operations, especially with user-supplied inputs or calculations involving large numbers.

**Example:** A Sway contract calculates a reward based on user input without checking for potential overflows. A malicious user provides a large input, causing an overflow and resulting in a much smaller reward being calculated than intended.

**Impact:** Financial loss, incorrect state updates, denial of service if overflows lead to unexpected program behavior.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Attack Surface: [Compiler Vulnerabilities (`forc`)](./attack_surfaces/compiler_vulnerabilities___forc__.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities within the `forc` compiler itself that could be exploited to generate insecure or malicious bytecode.

**How Sway Contributes:** `forc` is the tool responsible for translating Sway code into executable bytecode for the FuelVM. Bugs or security flaws in `forc` can directly impact the security of all contracts compiled with the vulnerable version.

**Example:** A vulnerability in `forc` allows an attacker to craft a specific Sway code snippet that, when compiled, injects extra, unintended instructions into the resulting bytecode.

**Impact:** Generation of vulnerable contracts, potential for arbitrary code execution within the FuelVM, widespread security implications for the entire ecosystem.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Management Issues](./attack_surfaces/dependency_management_issues.md)

**Description:** Risks associated with managing external dependencies used in Sway projects, including the potential for malicious or vulnerable dependencies.

**How Sway Contributes:** Sway projects managed by `forc` rely on declaring and retrieving dependencies. Vulnerabilities in the dependency resolution process or the integrity of downloaded dependencies can introduce security risks.

**Example:** A malicious actor publishes a crate with a similar name to a legitimate dependency, and a developer inadvertently includes the malicious crate in their Sway project, unknowingly introducing malicious code.

**Impact:** Inclusion of vulnerable or malicious code in deployed contracts, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, or other exploits.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Attack Surface: [Reentrancy (Sway Context)](./attack_surfaces/reentrancy__sway_context_.md)

**Description:** A contract calling itself or another contract in a loop before the initial call completes, potentially leading to unexpected state changes or resource exhaustion. While FuelVM's UTXO model mitigates some traditional reentrancy issues, certain cross-contract call patterns can still introduce vulnerabilities.

**How Sway Contributes:** The way Sway handles cross-contract calls and state updates needs careful design to prevent reentrancy-like scenarios where a contract's state is modified in unexpected ways due to recursive or interleaved calls.

**Example:** Contract A calls Contract B, and Contract B, through its logic, calls back into Contract A before Contract A has finished its initial operation and updated its state. This could be exploited to withdraw funds multiple times.

**Impact:** Incorrect state updates, potential for asset theft or manipulation, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Attack Surface: [Cryptographic Vulnerabilities (if implemented in Sway)](./attack_surfaces/cryptographic_vulnerabilities__if_implemented_in_sway_.md)

**Description:** Weaknesses or flaws in cryptographic implementations within Sway contracts.

**How Sway Contributes:** If Sway developers implement custom cryptographic functions or rely on potentially flawed cryptographic libraries (if any are directly usable), vulnerabilities can arise.

**Example:** A Sway contract implements a custom random number generation function that is predictable, allowing an attacker to guess future random values and exploit the contract's logic.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access, manipulation of cryptographic signatures or verifications.

**Risk Severity:** Critical (if core security relies on flawed cryptography)
