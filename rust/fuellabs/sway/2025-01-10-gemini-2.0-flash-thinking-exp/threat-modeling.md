# Threat Model Analysis for fuellabs/sway

## Threat: [Malicious Compiler Injection](./threats/malicious_compiler_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker could compromise the Sway compiler or associated build tools within the `fuellabs/sway` repository or its build infrastructure. This allows them to inject malicious code into the compiled contract bytecode without the developer's knowledge. The injected code would execute when the contract is deployed and interacted with.

**Impact:**  The deployed contract could perform unauthorized actions, steal assets, leak sensitive information, or become unusable. This could severely damage the application's integrity and user trust.

**Affected Component:** `forc` (Fuel Orchestrator - the Sway build toolchain within the `fuellabs/sway` repository).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Maintain a secure development and build environment for the `fuellabs/sway` repository.
*   Implement rigorous code review processes for changes to the compiler and build tools.
*   Utilize automated security testing and static analysis tools within the `fuellabs/sway` development pipeline.
*   Provide official, verified releases of the Sway compiler and build tools with checksum verification for users.

## Threat: [Dependency Poisoning](./threats/dependency_poisoning.md)

**Description:** An attacker could upload a malicious package to a crate registry (like `crates.io` if Sway adopts it) with a name similar to a legitimate dependency used by the Sway project, potentially exploiting vulnerabilities in how Sway's dependency management (within `forc`) resolves and fetches dependencies.

**Impact:** The malicious dependency's code would be included in the compiled contract, potentially leading to any of the impacts described in the "Malicious Compiler Injection" threat.

**Affected Component:** Sway's dependency management system (potentially integrated with `forc` within the `fuellabs/sway` repository).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement mechanisms within `forc` to verify the authenticity and integrity of downloaded dependencies.
*   Provide guidance and tooling for developers to carefully review dependencies.
*   Consider using a curated list of trusted dependencies or a private registry.

## Threat: [Integer Overflow/Underflow Exploitation](./threats/integer_overflowunderflow_exploitation.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts inputs that cause integer variables in a Sway contract to overflow (exceed their maximum value) or underflow (go below their minimum value). This relies on the specific implementation of arithmetic operations within the Sway language and its virtual machine (FuelVM, part of the broader Fuel ecosystem but directly related to how Sway code is executed). This can lead to unexpected and incorrect calculations, especially in financial logic or access control mechanisms.

**Impact:** Incorrect calculation of balances, unauthorized access due to flawed permission checks, or manipulation of contract state based on incorrect arithmetic.

**Affected Component:** Sway Language - Arithmetic Operations (defined within the `fuellabs/sway` repository), FuelVM - Integer Handling (implementation details related to Sway execution).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Provide and promote the use of safe math libraries within the Sway standard library (part of `fuellabs/sway`).
*   Educate developers on the risks of integer overflows/underflows and best practices for preventing them in Sway.
*   Consider compiler-level checks or warnings for potential overflow/underflow scenarios.

## Threat: [Reentrancy Attack](./threats/reentrancy_attack.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability where a Sway contract makes an external call to another contract, and the called contract maliciously calls back into the original contract *before* the initial transaction is completed. This exploits the transaction execution model of the FuelVM, where Sway contracts are executed. This can lead to the original contract's state being manipulated in an unintended way, often allowing the attacker to withdraw more funds than intended.

**Impact:**  Draining of contract funds, manipulation of contract state leading to unauthorized actions.

**Affected Component:** Sway Language - External Contract Calls (language feature defined in `fuellabs/sway`), FuelVM - Transaction Execution (how Sway contracts interact with the VM).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Emphasize and document the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern as a best practice in Sway development documentation.
*   Potentially provide language-level constructs or libraries within Sway to facilitate reentrancy protection.
*   Educate developers on the risks and mitigation strategies for reentrancy vulnerabilities in Sway.

## Threat: [Logic Errors in Access Control](./threats/logic_errors_in_access_control.md)

**Description:** An attacker identifies flaws in the Sway contract's logic (written using Sway language features) that govern access to certain functions or data. They then craft transactions that exploit these flaws to gain unauthorized access, allowing them to perform actions they shouldn't be able to.

**Impact:** Unauthorized modification of contract state, access to sensitive data, theft of assets, or disruption of contract functionality.

**Affected Component:** Sway Contract Logic - Conditional Statements, Role-Based Access Control implementations (using Sway language features).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Promote secure coding practices and provide guidance on implementing robust access control in Sway.
*   Develop and share common access control patterns and libraries for Sway developers.
*   Encourage thorough testing and security audits of Sway contracts.

## Threat: [Undocumented Feature Exploitation](./threats/undocumented_feature_exploitation.md)

**Description:** An attacker discovers and exploits an undocumented or unexpected behavior within the Sway language (defined in the `fuellabs/sway` repository) or its virtual machine (FuelVM, closely tied to Sway execution). This could involve subtle interactions or edge cases that are not well understood or documented.

**Impact:**  Unforeseen vulnerabilities and potential for exploitation depending on the nature of the undocumented feature.

**Affected Component:** Sway Language Specification (within `fuellabs/sway`), FuelVM Implementation (related to Sway execution).

**Risk Severity:** Medium (initially, potentially higher if widely exploitable).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Prioritize comprehensive and accurate documentation of the Sway language and its features.
*   Encourage community feedback and bug reports to identify and address undocumented behavior.
*   Implement thorough testing of the Sway compiler and FuelVM to identify potential edge cases.

## Threat: [Evolving Language Breaking Changes](./threats/evolving_language_breaking_changes.md)

**Description:** As Sway is a relatively new language developed within the `fuellabs/sway` repository, updates and changes to the language or its tooling might introduce breaking changes that inadvertently create vulnerabilities in existing deployed contracts if they are not properly recompiled or migrated.

**Impact:** Existing contracts might become vulnerable or behave unexpectedly after language or tooling updates.

**Affected Component:** Sway Language Evolution (within `fuellabs/sway`), `forc` updates (within `fuellabs/sway`).

**Risk Severity:** Medium

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Follow semantic versioning principles for Sway releases.
*   Provide clear and comprehensive migration guides when introducing breaking changes.
*   Develop tools or mechanisms to assist developers in migrating their contracts to newer Sway versions.
*   Communicate breaking changes well in advance to the developer community.
