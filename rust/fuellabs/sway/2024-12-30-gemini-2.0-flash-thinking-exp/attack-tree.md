## High-Risk & Critical Sub-Tree: Compromising Applications Using Sway

**Objective:** Attacker's Goal: To compromise an application using the Sway smart contract language by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within Sway itself.

**High-Risk & Critical Sub-Tree:**

* (+) Compromise Application Using Sway **CRITICAL NODE**
    * (-) Exploit Vulnerabilities in Deployed Sway Contracts **CRITICAL NODE**
        * (-) Exploit Logical Flaws in Sway Contract Code **CRITICAL NODE**
            * (*) Integer Overflow/Underflow in Arithmetic Operations **HIGH RISK**
            * (*) Reentrancy Vulnerability **HIGH RISK**
    * (-) Exploit Weaknesses in the Sway Contract Deployment Process **CRITICAL NODE**
        * (-) Compromise of Deployment Keys or Credentials **HIGH RISK**

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**1. Compromise Application Using Sway (CRITICAL NODE):**

* This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success here means the attacker has achieved a significant breach of the application's security, potentially leading to financial loss, data manipulation, or complete control over the application's functionality.

**2. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Deployed Sway Contracts (CRITICAL NODE):**

* This represents the category of attacks that target the smart contract code once it is deployed on the blockchain. A successful attack here directly leverages weaknesses in the contract's logic or implementation.

**3. Exploit Logical Flaws in Sway Contract Code (CRITICAL NODE):**

* This focuses on vulnerabilities arising from errors in the design or implementation of the smart contract's logic. These flaws can be exploited to make the contract behave in unintended and harmful ways.

    * **Integer Overflow/Underflow in Arithmetic Operations (HIGH RISK):**
        * **Attack Vector:** An attacker manipulates input values to cause arithmetic operations within the Sway contract to exceed the maximum or fall below the minimum representable value for a given integer type.
        * **Consequences:** This can lead to incorrect calculations, such as unexpectedly low or high balances, bypassing access control checks that rely on these calculations, or causing other critical logic errors. For example, transferring a large amount of tokens might result in a zero balance due to underflow.

    * **Reentrancy Vulnerability (HIGH RISK):**
        * **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts a malicious contract that calls back into the vulnerable Sway contract during its own execution (before the initial call has completed). This can allow the attacker to repeatedly withdraw funds or manipulate the contract's state in an unintended sequence, potentially draining the contract's balance or corrupting its data. This often exploits the order of operations within the contract, particularly if state updates occur after external calls.

**4. Exploit Weaknesses in the Sway Contract Deployment Process (CRITICAL NODE):**

* This category of attacks targets the process of deploying the Sway contract to the blockchain. Weaknesses here can allow attackers to deploy malicious or vulnerable versions of the contract, bypassing the intended security of the contract code itself.

    * **Compromise of Deployment Keys or Credentials (HIGH RISK):**
        * **Attack Vector:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the private keys or credentials used to deploy or upgrade the Sway contract. This could be achieved through phishing, social engineering, exploiting vulnerabilities in key storage mechanisms, or insider threats.
        * **Consequences:** With control over the deployment keys, the attacker can deploy a completely malicious contract, overwrite the existing contract with a vulnerable version, or make unauthorized changes to the contract's code or parameters, effectively taking control of the application's core logic.
