**Prepared By:** Gemini (AI Language Model)

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a detailed design overview of the Sway smart contract language project, as found in the GitHub repository [https://github.com/fuellabs/sway](https://github.com/fuellabs/sway). This document aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the project's architecture, components, and data flow, which will serve as a foundation for subsequent threat modeling activities.

### 1.1. Purpose

The primary purpose of this document is to outline the design of the Sway project to facilitate threat modeling. It will identify key components, their interactions, and data flows, enabling security professionals to analyze potential vulnerabilities and attack vectors.

### 1.2. Scope

This document covers the core components of the Sway language and its associated tooling, focusing on the compilation process, deployment, and interaction with smart contracts on the FuelVM. It includes:

*   The Sway language specification and its core features.
*   The Sway compiler (`forc`) and its compilation pipeline.
*   The generated bytecode format for the FuelVM.
*   The interaction mechanisms between external entities and deployed Sway contracts via the Fuel Client SDK.
*   The lifecycle of a Sway smart contract from development to execution.

### 1.3. Goals

The goals of this design document are to:

*   Provide a clear and concise description of the Sway project's architecture and its key elements.
*   Identify the key components and their specific responsibilities within the Sway ecosystem.
*   Illustrate the data flow within the system, highlighting data transformations and interactions between components.
*   Highlight potential areas of security concern for further analysis during the threat modeling process.

## 2. Project Overview

Sway is a domain-specific language (DSL) designed for writing smart contracts that target the FuelVM, a high-performance blockchain execution layer. It aims to provide a safer and more efficient alternative to existing smart contract languages like Solidity. Sway emphasizes developer experience, security, and performance through features like static typing and a focus on memory safety.

## 3. System Architecture

The Sway ecosystem can be broadly divided into the following key components:

*   **Sway Language:** The definition of the smart contract language, including its syntax, semantics, type system, and built-in functionalities.
*   **Sway Compiler (`forc`):** The command-line tool and core component responsible for transforming Sway source code into executable bytecode for the FuelVM. This involves a multi-stage process including parsing, semantic analysis, intermediate representation generation, optimization, and code generation.
*   **FuelVM:** The virtual machine environment where the compiled Sway smart contracts are deployed and executed. It manages the execution environment, state transitions, and resource consumption (gas).
*   **Fuel Client SDK:** A set of libraries and tools that enable external applications and users to interact with deployed Sway smart contracts on the FuelVM. This includes functionalities for constructing transactions, signing them, and submitting them to the network, as well as querying contract state.
*   **Smart Contracts:** The instances of compiled Sway code that are deployed and running on the FuelVM. These contracts encapsulate the application logic and persistent state of decentralized applications.
*   **Users/Applications:** External entities (individuals, other software systems) that initiate transactions and interact with the deployed smart contracts through the Fuel Client SDK.

```

## 4. Data Flow

The typical data flow within the Sway ecosystem involves the following steps:

1. **Smart Contract Development:** A developer writes the smart contract logic using the Sway language, creating `.sw` source code files.
2. **Compilation Process:** The Sway compiler (`forc`) takes the `.sw` source code as input and performs a series of transformations:
    *   **Parsing:** The source code is parsed into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
    *   **Semantic Analysis:** The compiler performs type checking, resolves symbols, and ensures the code adheres to the language rules.
    *   **Intermediate Representation (IR) Generation:** The compiler translates the AST into an intermediate representation, which is often platform-independent.
    *   **Optimization:** The compiler applies various optimization techniques to improve the performance and efficiency of the generated bytecode.
    *   **Code Generation:** The optimized IR is translated into FuelVM bytecode.
3. **Deployment Transaction:** The generated FuelVM bytecode, along with any necessary metadata, is packaged into a deployment transaction. This transaction is constructed and signed using the Fuel Client SDK.
4. **Transaction Submission:** The deployment transaction is submitted to the FuelVM network.
5. **Contract Deployment:** The FuelVM processes the deployment transaction, allocates storage for the contract, and stores the bytecode on the blockchain.
6. **Interaction Transaction Initiation:** A user or application intends to interact with the deployed smart contract. They use the Fuel Client SDK to construct a transaction specifying the target contract, the function to be called, and any necessary input parameters.
7. **Transaction Signing:** The user or application signs the transaction using their private key.
8. **Transaction Submission:** The signed transaction is submitted to the FuelVM network.
9. **Transaction Execution:** The FuelVM receives the transaction, verifies the signature, and executes the corresponding function within the target smart contract. This execution occurs within the FuelVM's sandboxed environment.
10. **State Changes:** During execution, the smart contract may modify its internal state, which is persisted on the FuelVM.
11. **Response:** The FuelVM returns the result of the transaction execution (including any state changes or return values) to the user or application.
