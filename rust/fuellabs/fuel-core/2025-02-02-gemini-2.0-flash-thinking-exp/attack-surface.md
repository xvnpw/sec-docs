# Attack Surface Analysis for fuellabs/fuel-core

## Attack Surface: [P2P Network Denial of Service (DoS) - Connection Flooding](./attack_surfaces/p2p_network_denial_of_service__dos__-_connection_flooding.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers flood the `fuel-core` node with connection requests, overwhelming its resources and preventing legitimate peers from connecting.
*   **Fuel-Core Contribution:** `fuel-core` implements a P2P networking layer to participate in the Fuel network. This layer is inherently exposed to network-based DoS attacks due to its need to accept connections from peers.
*   **Example:** A botnet sends thousands of connection requests per second to a `fuel-core` node. The node becomes unresponsive, unable to process legitimate transactions or synchronize with the network.
*   **Impact:** Node unavailability, disruption of service, inability to participate in the Fuel network, potential financial losses if the node is critical for application functionality.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Connection Rate Limiting:** Configure `fuel-core` to limit the rate of incoming connection requests from individual IP addresses or peers (if configurable).
    *   **Connection Limits:** Set maximum connection limits within `fuel-core` configuration to prevent resource exhaustion.
    *   **Firewall Configuration:** Deploy firewalls to filter and block suspicious traffic based on IP address, port, or connection patterns *before* it reaches `fuel-core`.
    *   **Resource Monitoring:** Implement system-level monitoring to detect unusual connection patterns and trigger alerts, allowing for reactive mitigation.
    *   **Peer Reputation/Blacklisting (if available in Fuel-Core):** Utilize any peer reputation or blacklisting features provided by `fuel-core` to automatically manage peer connections.

## Attack Surface: [API GraphQL Injection](./attack_surfaces/api_graphql_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers craft malicious GraphQL queries to exploit vulnerabilities in the GraphQL API exposed by `fuel-core`.
*   **Fuel-Core Contribution:** `fuel-core` exposes a GraphQL API for interacting with the node and retrieving blockchain data.  Vulnerabilities in the implementation of this API within `fuel-core` can lead to injection attacks.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a GraphQL query that bypasses intended data access controls to retrieve sensitive information about other users or internal node state. Or, a computationally expensive query is sent to overload the node's API processing.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to sensitive information managed by the node, denial of service of the API, potential compromise of node integrity depending on the severity of the injection vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization (Fuel-Core Developers):** Fuel-core developers must implement strict input validation and sanitization for all GraphQL query parameters and variables within the `fuel-core` codebase itself.
    *   **Least Privilege Principle (Fuel-Core Developers):** Fuel-core GraphQL schema and resolvers should be designed to adhere to the principle of least privilege, only exposing necessary data and operations.
    *   **Query Complexity Limits (Fuel-Core Configuration/Developers):** Configure or implement query complexity limits within `fuel-core` to prevent resource exhaustion and DoS via complex queries.
    *   **Authentication and Authorization (Application Developers & Fuel-Core Configuration):**  Application developers using the API should implement authentication and authorization layers *on top* of the Fuel-core API if sensitive operations are exposed. Fuel-core itself might offer some basic API access controls that should be configured.
    *   **Regular Security Audits (Fuel-Core Developers & Application Developers):** Conduct regular security audits of the GraphQL API schema, resolvers, and usage patterns in applications.

## Attack Surface: [Implementation Bugs in Fuel-Core Codebase](./attack_surfaces/implementation_bugs_in_fuel-core_codebase.md)

*   **Description:** General software vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, memory leaks, logic errors, remote code execution) present in the `fuel-core` codebase itself.
*   **Fuel-Core Contribution:** As with any complex software, `fuel-core`'s codebase may contain implementation bugs that are inherent to the software development process. These bugs are directly within `fuel-core`.
*   **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability in the P2P message handling code of `fuel-core`. An attacker sends a specially crafted message that triggers the overflow, potentially leading to remote code execution on the node.
*   **Impact:** Node crashes, denial of service, data corruption, potential remote code execution, full system compromise, and potential network-wide impact if the vulnerability is widespread and exploitable across many Fuel nodes.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Coding Practices (Fuel-Core Developers):** Fuel Labs developers must rigorously adhere to secure coding practices during `fuel-core` development.
    *   **Code Reviews (Fuel-Core Developers):**  Thorough and frequent code reviews by multiple experienced developers are crucial to identify potential bugs and vulnerabilities before release.
    *   **Static and Dynamic Analysis (Fuel-Core Developers):** Fuel Labs should utilize static and dynamic analysis tools as part of their development process to automatically detect potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Fuzzing (Fuel-Core Developers):**  Extensive fuzzing of `fuel-core`'s components, especially network-facing parts and parsers, is essential to uncover robustness issues.
    *   **Bug Bounty Programs (Fuel-Core Developers):**  Maintaining a robust bug bounty program incentivizes external security researchers to find and responsibly report vulnerabilities.
    *   **Regular Security Audits (Fuel-Core Developers):** Independent security audits by reputable security firms should be conducted regularly to provide an external perspective on code security.
    *   **Prompt Security Patching (Fuel-Core Developers & Users):** Fuel Labs must have a process for quickly releasing and communicating security patches. Users must promptly apply these patches to their `fuel-core` instances.
    *   **Stay Updated with Security Advisories (Users):** Users should actively monitor Fuel Labs security advisories and communication channels for vulnerability announcements and updates.
