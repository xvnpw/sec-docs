# RISK ASSESSMENT

*   Critical business processes we are trying to protect:
    *   Transaction processing: Ensuring transactions are processed accurately, reliably, and without manipulation.
    *   Consensus mechanism: Maintaining network agreement and preventing forks or disruptions to the blockchain.
    *   State management: Protecting the integrity and consistency of the blockchain state, including accounts and balances.
    *   API availability: Ensuring the API gateway is available for developers and clients to interact with the network.
*   Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
    *   Transaction data: Contains information about transfers of value and smart contract interactions. Sensitivity: Confidentiality and integrity are critical to prevent unauthorized transactions and manipulation of financial records.
    *   Blockchain state data: Includes account balances, smart contract code and data. Sensitivity: Integrity is paramount to maintain the correctness of the blockchain ledger and prevent financial losses. Confidentiality might be relevant for certain types of smart contract data.
    *   Private keys: Used to sign transactions and control access to accounts. Sensitivity: Extremely high. Loss or compromise of private keys can lead to complete loss of funds.
    *   Node configuration and operational data: Includes node settings, logs, and monitoring data. Sensitivity: Moderate. Can reveal information about network topology and potential vulnerabilities if exposed.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

*   BUSINESS POSTURE:
    *   Question: What is the target market for fuel-core? Is it primarily focused on DeFi, gaming, or other specific use cases?
