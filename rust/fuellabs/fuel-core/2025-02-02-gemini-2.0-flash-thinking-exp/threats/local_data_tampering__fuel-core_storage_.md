### 4. Deep Analysis of Local Data Tampering (Fuel-Core Storage)

#### 4.1. Threat Actor Profile

*   **Motivation:**  Financial gain (stealing funds, manipulating transactions), disruption of service (denial of service, data corruption), reputational damage to the application, or potentially even state-sponsored actors seeking to undermine blockchain infrastructure.
*   **Capabilities:**  Requires local system access. This could be achieved by:
    *   **Insider Threat:** A malicious or negligent employee, contractor, or system administrator with legitimate access.
    *   **Compromised System:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the operating system, applications, or services running on the same system as `fuel-core`. This could be through malware, phishing, or other attack vectors leading to remote access and subsequent local privilege escalation.
    *   **Physical Access:** In scenarios where physical security is weak, an attacker could gain physical access to the server or machine running `fuel-core`.
*   **Resources:**  Vary depending on the attacker profile. Insider threats might have extensive knowledge of the system. External attackers might range from script kiddies using readily available exploits to sophisticated APT groups with advanced tools and techniques.

#### 4.2. Attack Vectors and Scenarios

An attacker with local access can employ various techniques to tamper with `fuel-core` data:

*   **Direct File Modification:**
    *   **Blockchain Database Manipulation:** Directly altering the database files to modify transaction history, account balances, or smart contract state. This could lead to double-spending, unauthorized fund transfers, or manipulation of application logic based on blockchain data.
    *   **Transaction History Tampering:** Deleting or modifying transaction history to conceal malicious activity or disrupt audit trails.
    *   **Configuration File Manipulation:** Altering `fuel-core` configuration files to change network settings, disable security features, or introduce backdoors.
    *   **Private Key Theft/Modification:** If private keys are stored locally (which is strongly discouraged in production but might occur in development or misconfigured environments), attackers could steal or replace them to gain control of associated accounts and funds.
*   **File System Level Attacks:**
    *   **Data Deletion:**  Deleting critical data files to cause denial of service or data loss.
    *   **Data Corruption:**  Intentionally corrupting data files to disrupt `fuel-core` operation or application functionality.
    *   **File Replacement:** Replacing legitimate `fuel-core` binaries or libraries with malicious versions (though this is less directly related to *data* tampering, it's a related local access threat).

**Example Attack Scenarios:**

1.  **Scenario 1: Insider Malice:** A disgruntled system administrator with access to the `fuel-core` server modifies the blockchain database to transfer funds from a user account to their own account. They then delete transaction logs to cover their tracks.
2.  **Scenario 2: Compromised Server:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a web application running on the same server as `fuel-core`. They gain root access and then modify `fuel-core`'s configuration to disable security logging and tamper with transaction history to hide evidence of their initial intrusion.
3.  **Scenario 3: Physical Access Breach:** An attacker gains physical access to the server room and boots from a USB drive to access the file system. They copy the `fuel-core` data directory, including potentially unencrypted private keys, and later use this data to compromise the blockchain network.
