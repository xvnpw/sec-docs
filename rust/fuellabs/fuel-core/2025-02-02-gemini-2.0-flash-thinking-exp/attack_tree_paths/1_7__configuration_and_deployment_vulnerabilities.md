        *   **Code Review and Testing:**  Thoroughly review code and conduct security testing to identify and remove any accidental exposure of debug functionalities in production.

*   **Open Management Ports (e.g., JMX, RMI):**
    *   **Description:**  If Fuel-Core or related Java-based tools are used, management ports like JMX or RMI might be exposed by default or through misconfiguration. These ports, if not properly secured, can be exploited to gain control over the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and the application.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers can connect to exposed management ports and exploit vulnerabilities in the management protocols or the JVM itself.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Remote code execution, full system compromise, data breaches, denial of service.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low to Moderate (if Java-based components are used and management ports are exposed).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Disable Management Ports by Default:**  Management ports should be disabled by default in production configurations.
        *   **Secure Management Ports (If Necessary):** If management ports are required, secure them with strong authentication, authorization, and TLS encryption.
        *   **Network Segmentation:**  Restrict access to management ports to trusted internal networks only.

#### 4.3. 1.7.2. Insufficient Security Hardening
