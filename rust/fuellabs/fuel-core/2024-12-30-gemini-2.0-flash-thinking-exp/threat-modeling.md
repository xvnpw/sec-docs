### High and Critical Fuel-Core Threats

This list details high and critical threats that directly involve the `fuel-core` component.

*   **Threat: Software Bugs and Vulnerabilities in Fuel-Core**
    *   **Description:** `fuel-core`, like any software, may contain undiscovered bugs or vulnerabilities (e.g., memory safety issues, logic errors) that could be exploited by attackers.
    *   **Impact:** Could lead to node crashes, state corruption, arbitrary code execution on the `fuel-core` server, or network-wide issues if consensus mechanisms are affected.
    *   **Affected Component:** Various modules within `fuel-core` (e.g., Transaction Processing, Consensus Engine, Virtual Machine).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep `fuel-core` updated to the latest stable version with security patches.
        *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases related to `fuel-core`.
        *   Consider using static and dynamic analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in `fuel-core` if possible.

*   **Threat: Denial-of-Service Attacks Against Fuel-Core**
    *   **Description:** An attacker targets the `fuel-core` node directly with a flood of requests or by exploiting resource-intensive operations, aiming to make it unavailable.
    *   **Impact:** Prevents the application from interacting with the Fuel blockchain, disrupting its functionality. Could also impact the wider Fuel network if many nodes are targeted.
    *   **Affected Component:** `fuel-core` Network Communication, Resource Management, Transaction Processing.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement firewall rules to restrict access to `fuel-core` ports.
        *   Configure resource limits within `fuel-core`.
        *   Use a reverse proxy or load balancer with DDoS protection in front of `fuel-core`.
        *   Monitor `fuel-core` resource usage and network traffic for anomalies.

*   **Threat: Consensus Layer Vulnerabilities**
    *   **Description:**  A flaw in the Fuel blockchain's consensus mechanism is exploited to manipulate the blockchain state, double-spend funds, or disrupt the network's operation.
    *   **Impact:** Severe disruption of the Fuel network, potential financial losses, and loss of trust in the blockchain.
    *   **Affected Component:** `fuel-core` Consensus Engine.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Rely on the security audits and rigorous testing performed by the Fuel Labs team.
        *   Stay informed about any reported vulnerabilities in the Fuel consensus mechanism.
        *   Ensure your `fuel-core` node is running the recommended and stable version.

*   **Threat: State Corruption**
    *   **Description:** Bugs or vulnerabilities in `fuel-core` lead to inconsistencies or errors in the node's local state database.
    *   **Impact:** Data loss, unpredictable behavior of the `fuel-core` node, and potential inconsistencies with the rest of the Fuel network.
    *   **Affected Component:** `fuel-core` State Management, Database Interaction.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly back up the `fuel-core` state database.
        *   Monitor the integrity of the state database.
        *   Ensure proper error handling and recovery mechanisms are in place within `fuel-core`.

*   **Threat: Exposed Fuel-Core Ports**
    *   **Description:** `fuel-core` ports are exposed to the public internet without proper security measures like firewalls.
    *   **Impact:** Allows attackers to directly interact with `fuel-core` and attempt to exploit vulnerabilities or launch denial-of-service attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:** Operating System Network Configuration, Firewall Rules (impacting `fuel-core`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure firewalls to restrict access to `fuel-core` ports to only trusted sources.
        *   Use network segmentation to isolate `fuel-core` within a secure network.

*   **Threat: Running Fuel-Core with Elevated Privileges**
    *   **Description:** `fuel-core` is run with unnecessary elevated privileges (e.g., root).
    *   **Impact:** If `fuel-core` is compromised, the attacker gains the privileges of the user running the process, potentially allowing them to compromise the entire system.
    *   **Affected Component:** Operating System User Permissions, `fuel-core` Process Execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Run `fuel-core` with the least privileges necessary for its operation.
        *   Create a dedicated user account for running `fuel-core`.
