# Threat Model Analysis for fuellabs/fuel-core

## Threat: [Malicious API Request Exploitation](./threats/malicious_api_request_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker crafts and sends specially formed API requests directly to the `fuel-core` node. This could involve injecting malicious payloads, exceeding expected data lengths, or exploiting known vulnerabilities in `fuel-core`'s API endpoint handling.
    *   **How:** The attacker targets publicly exposed `fuel-core` API endpoints or internal APIs if they have gained some level of network access. They experiment with request parameters and payloads to trigger unexpected behavior within `fuel-core`.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Description:** Successful exploitation could lead to denial of service of the `fuel-core` node (crashing or freezing), data corruption within the node's state managed by `fuel-core`, or in severe cases, remote code execution on the server hosting `fuel-core`.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   **Description:** Primarily affects the **API request handling modules** within `fuel-core`. This includes the code responsible for parsing incoming requests, validating parameters, and executing the corresponding logic for each API endpoint (e.g., transaction submission, block retrieval). Specific functions handling input deserialization and validation within `fuel-core` are particularly vulnerable.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization within `fuel-core` on all API endpoints.
        *   Enforce strict data type and length checks for all API parameters within `fuel-core`.
        *   Regularly update `fuel-core` to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement rate limiting within `fuel-core` on API endpoints to prevent abuse.
        *   Conduct thorough security audits and penetration testing of the `fuel-core` API.

## Threat: [API Rate Limiting Exhaustion (DoS)](./threats/api_rate_limiting_exhaustion__dos_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker floods the `fuel-core` API with a large volume of legitimate or slightly malformed requests directly to the `fuel-core` node.
    *   **How:** The attacker could use automated tools or botnets to generate a high number of requests targeting various `fuel-core` API endpoints.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Description:** This can overwhelm the `fuel-core` node itself, making it unresponsive to legitimate requests from the application and other network participants. This leads to a denial of service of the `fuel-core` node.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   **Description:** Affects the **API request handling infrastructure** and potentially the **network communication layer** of `fuel-core`. The node's ability to process and respond to requests is compromised.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust rate limiting within `fuel-core` on all public and sensitive API endpoints.
        *   Use techniques like IP address blocking or CAPTCHA within `fuel-core` for suspicious activity.
        *   Monitor API request patterns for anomalies at the `fuel-core` level.
        *   Ensure sufficient resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) are allocated to the `fuel-core` node.

## Threat: [Consensus Mechanism Exploitation](./threats/consensus_mechanism_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in the consensus mechanism implemented by `fuel-core`.
    *   **How:** This is a highly complex attack, potentially involving manipulating network timing within the `fuel-core` network, exploiting flaws in the block proposal or voting process within `fuel-core`, or leveraging a significant amount of computational power (if applicable to the specific consensus mechanism used by `fuel-core`).
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Description:** Successful exploitation could lead to blockchain forking within the Fuel network managed by `fuel-core`, double-spending attacks, or the ability to censor transactions processed by `fuel-core`. This undermines the integrity and security of the entire Fuel network.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   **Description:** Directly affects the **consensus module** within `fuel-core`, which is responsible for block validation, agreement on the state of the blockchain, and network synchronization.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Rely on the security and robustness of the `fuel-core` implementation of the consensus mechanism.
        *   Stay updated with the latest `fuel-core` releases and security audits related to the consensus protocol.
        *   Ensure a diverse and healthy network of validators (if applicable within the `fuel-core` network).
        *   Monitor network activity for signs of consensus attacks targeting `fuel-core`.

## Threat: [Networking Vulnerabilities Leading to Node Isolation or Takeover](./threats/networking_vulnerabilities_leading_to_node_isolation_or_takeover.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in `fuel-core`'s networking implementation.
    *   **How:** This could involve exploiting flaws in peer discovery within the `fuel-core` network, message handling between `fuel-core` nodes, or connection management to isolate a `fuel-core` node from the network or gain unauthorized access to its internal state.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Description:** Node isolation can prevent the `fuel-core` node from participating in the network, leading to data inconsistencies. Node takeover could allow the attacker to manipulate the `fuel-core` node's behavior or access sensitive information managed by the node.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   **Description:** Affects the **networking module** of `fuel-core`, responsible for peer-to-peer communication, message routing, and connection management between `fuel-core` nodes.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep `fuel-core` updated to patch known networking vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement network security best practices for the network where `fuel-core` is running, such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems.
        *   Carefully configure network settings for `fuel-core`.
        *   Monitor network traffic for suspicious activity involving `fuel-core` nodes.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker exploits known vulnerabilities in the third-party libraries and dependencies used by `fuel-core`.
    *   **How:** Attackers often scan for publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in common libraries and then target applications like `fuel-core` that use those vulnerable versions.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Description:** The impact can range from denial of service and information disclosure to remote code execution on the server running `fuel-core`, depending on the specific vulnerability in the dependency.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   **Description:** Affects various **modules and functionalities** within `fuel-core` that rely on the vulnerable dependency. This could be any part of the `fuel-core` codebase.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update `fuel-core` and its dependencies to the latest versions.
        *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify and address known vulnerabilities in `fuel-core`'s dependencies.
        *   Monitor security advisories for the dependencies used by `fuel-core`.
