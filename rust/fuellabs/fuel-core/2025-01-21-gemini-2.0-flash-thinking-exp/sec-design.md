    * Enforcing the safety and liveness properties inherent to the chosen consensus algorithm.

### 6.3. Execution Layer ("FuelVM")

* **Responsibilities:**
    * Executing smart contracts written in languages compatible with the FuelVM.
    * Managing the execution environment, including resource allocation and sandboxing.
    * Updating the global blockchain state based on the outcomes of transaction execution.

    * Prioritizing transactions for inclusion in the next block based on predefined criteria.
    * Implementing mechanisms to prevent spam and denial-of-service attacks targeting transaction submission.
* **Key Functions:**
    * Performing initial validation of incoming transactions (e.g., signature verification, fee checks).
    * Ordering and prioritizing transactions, often based on transaction fees or other metrics.
    * Handling transaction replacements (e.g., "replace-by-fee") and cancellations.
    * Implementing logic to evict stale, invalid, or low-priority transactions to manage resource usage.

## 7. Data Flow

The following steps describe the typical data flow involved in processing a transaction within Fuel Core:

1. **Transaction Submission:** An external client (e.g., a wallet application) submits a new transaction to the Fuel Core node via the API Layer.
2. **API Processing and Validation:** The API Layer receives the transaction, performs initial validation checks (e.g., format, signature), and then forwards the transaction to the Transaction Pool.
3. **Mempool Storage and Validation:** The Transaction Pool receives the transaction, performs more comprehensive validation (e.g., ensuring sufficient funds, nonce checks), and stores the pending transaction.
4. **Consensus Integration and Block Proposal:** The Consensus Layer selects a set of valid transactions from the Mempool to include in a new block proposal.
5. **Block Creation and Agreement:** The Consensus Layer proposes a new block containing the ordered transactions. Network nodes participate in the consensus process to reach agreement on the validity and ordering of this block.
6. **Transaction Execution:** Once a block is finalized (agreed upon by the network), the transactions within the block are passed to the Execution Layer ("FuelVM").
7. **State Update:** The FuelVM executes each transaction sequentially, potentially modifying the blockchain's state (e.g., updating account balances, contract storage).
8. **Storage Persistence:** The updated blockchain state and the newly finalized block are persisted in the Storage Layer.
9. **Client Notification (Optional):** The API Layer may optionally notify the originating client about the transaction's successful inclusion in a block.

## 8. Security Considerations

This section expands upon the initial security considerations for Fuel Core, providing more specific examples of potential threats and areas of concern. A dedicated threat model will further elaborate on these points.

* **Network Security:**
    * **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks:** Mitigation strategies are needed to prevent malicious actors from overwhelming the network with traffic, hindering legitimate operations.
    * **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** Secure communication channels using encryption (e.g., TLS) are crucial to protect data in transit between nodes.
    * **Sybil Attacks:** Mechanisms to limit the ability of a single attacker to control a large portion of the network's identity space are necessary.
* **Consensus Security:**
    * **Byzantine Fault Tolerance:** The consensus mechanism must be resilient to nodes acting maliciously or failing unpredictably.
    * **Double-Spending Prevention:** The consensus mechanism must guarantee that the same unit of digital currency cannot be spent more than once.
    * **Long-Range Attacks:**  Consideration of vulnerabilities where attackers with historical knowledge could compromise the chain.
* **Execution Security ("FuelVM"):**
    * **Smart Contract Vulnerabilities:**  The FuelVM needs to provide a secure execution environment that minimizes the impact of vulnerabilities in smart contracts (e.g., reentrancy attacks, integer overflows).
    * **Resource Exhaustion:** Mechanisms to prevent smart contracts from consuming excessive resources (e.g., gas limits) are essential.
    * **Sandboxing:**  Ensuring that smart contracts operate within isolated environments and cannot interfere with the underlying system or other contracts.
* **Storage Security:**
    * **Data Tampering:** Measures to ensure the integrity of stored blockchain data and prevent unauthorized modifications.
    * **Unauthorized Access:** Access controls and encryption mechanisms to protect sensitive data at rest.
    * **Key Management:** Secure generation, storage, and management of cryptographic keys used for signing and encryption.
* **API Security:**
    * **Authentication and Authorization:** Robust mechanisms to verify the identity of API clients and control their access to specific functionalities.
    * **Input Validation:** Rigorous validation of all data received through the API to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection).
    * **Rate Limiting:** Implementing rate limits to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks targeting the API.
* **Transaction Pool Security:**
    * **Spam Prevention:** Mechanisms to discourage the submission of a large number of low-value transactions.
    * **Transaction Manipulation:** Protection against attempts to manipulate transactions in the mempool before they are included in a block.

## 9. Deployment Considerations

Fuel Core can be deployed in various configurations, each with its own implications for security and resource requirements:

* **Standalone Node:** A single instance of Fuel Core participating in the network, potentially suitable for developers or light users. Requires careful configuration of network access and security settings.
* **Validator Node:** A node specifically configured to participate in the consensus process, requiring robust security measures and reliable infrastructure. Key management for validator nodes is critical.
* **Light Client:** A client application that interacts with the Fuel Core network without storing the entire blockchain, relying on full nodes for data. Security considerations focus on the trust relationship with the connected full nodes.
* **Integration with Existing Infrastructure:** Deploying Fuel Core within an existing cloud or on-premise infrastructure requires careful consideration of network segmentation, access control, and integration with existing security tools.

Deployment procedures should include detailed steps for secure key generation and management, network configuration, and monitoring.
