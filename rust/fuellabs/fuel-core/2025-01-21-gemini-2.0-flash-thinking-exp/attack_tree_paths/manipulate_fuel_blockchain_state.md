        *   **Impact:**  Reversal of transactions, double-spending, censorship of transactions, and potentially halting the blockchain.
        *   **Examples:**  Targeting the leader election process, manipulating vote messages, or exploiting timing vulnerabilities in the consensus protocol.
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**  Rigorous testing and formal verification of the consensus algorithm, implementing robust fault tolerance mechanisms, and ensuring a diverse and reputable set of validators.
    *   **Long-Range Attacks:**  Acquiring historical private keys of validators to forge signatures and rewrite past blockchain history.
        *   **Impact:**  Fundamentally altering the blockchain's past, potentially enabling double-spending or invalidating past transactions.
        *   **Examples:**  Compromising validator key storage, exploiting key management vulnerabilities.
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**  Implementing strong key management practices, using key rotation mechanisms, and potentially employing techniques like state pruning with cryptographic commitments.
    *   **Sybil Attacks:**  Creating a large number of fake identities to gain disproportionate influence in the consensus process.
        *   **Impact:**  Gaining control over block production and transaction ordering, potentially leading to censorship or manipulation.
        *   **Examples:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in identity verification or staking mechanisms.
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**  Implementing robust identity verification processes, using proof-of-stake mechanisms with strong slashing conditions, and limiting the influence of individual entities.

*   **Smart Contract Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Reentrancy Attacks:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in smart contracts to repeatedly withdraw funds or manipulate state before the initial transaction is finalized.
        *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized transfer of assets, manipulation of contract state.
        *   **Examples:**  Contracts that don't properly handle external calls or state updates.
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**  Following secure smart contract development practices, using reentrancy guards, and conducting thorough security audits.
    *   **Integer Overflow/Underflow:**  Causing arithmetic operations to wrap around, leading to unexpected behavior and potential state manipulation.
        *   **Impact:**  Incorrect calculation of balances or other critical values, potentially leading to unauthorized access or fund manipulation.
        *   **Examples:**  Calculations involving token transfers or contract logic that doesn't handle edge cases.
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**  Using safe math libraries, performing input validation, and carefully reviewing arithmetic operations.
