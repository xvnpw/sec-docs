# Attack Surface Analysis for fuellabs/fuel-core

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated or Misconfigured RPC Interface](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_or_misconfigured_rpc_interface.md)

*   **Description:** The Fuel-Core node exposes an RPC interface for interacting with the blockchain. If this interface is not properly secured with authentication or has overly permissive configurations, it becomes a direct entry point for attackers.
    *   **How Fuel-Core Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Fuel-Core provides the RPC interface as a core component for external interaction. Its configuration directly determines the level of access control.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could send RPC calls to query sensitive blockchain data, submit unauthorized transactions, or potentially trigger administrative functions if the RPC interface is exposed without authentication.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized transaction execution, denial of service, potential compromise of the Fuel-Core node.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Implement strong authentication:** Require API keys, JWTs, or other robust authentication mechanisms for all RPC endpoints.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Configure RPC access to grant only the necessary permissions to specific users or applications.
        *   **Network Segmentation:** Restrict access to the RPC interface to trusted networks or IP addresses.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Review RPC configurations and access controls regularly.
        *   **Disable Unnecessary Endpoints:** Disable any RPC endpoints that are not required for the application's functionality.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) on RPC Endpoints](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__on_rpc_endpoints.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can flood the Fuel-Core node's RPC interface with a large volume of requests, overwhelming its resources and making it unresponsive to legitimate requests.
    *   **How Fuel-Core Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Fuel-Core's RPC interface is designed to handle requests, and without proper rate limiting or resource management, it can be susceptible to DoS attacks.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could send a large number of requests to query blockchain data or submit transactions, consuming the node's CPU, memory, and network bandwidth.
    *   **Impact:** Application downtime, inability to interact with the blockchain, potential financial losses due to service disruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on RPC endpoints to restrict the number of requests from a single source within a given timeframe.
        *   **Request Filtering:** Filter out malicious or malformed requests before they reach the Fuel-Core node.
        *   **Resource Monitoring and Alerting:** Monitor the node's resource usage and set up alerts for unusual activity.
        *   **Load Balancing:** Distribute RPC traffic across multiple Fuel-Core nodes if the application requires high availability.
        *   **Implement Proper Timeouts:** Configure appropriate timeouts for RPC requests to prevent resources from being held indefinitely.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Fuel-Core Node](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_fuel-core_node.md)

*   **Description:** Fuel-Core relies on various third-party libraries and dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can indirectly expose the application to attacks if the Fuel-Core node is compromised.
    *   **How Fuel-Core Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Fuel-Core's dependency management directly determines which libraries are included and their versions.
    *   **Example:** A known vulnerability in a networking library used by Fuel-Core could be exploited to gain remote access to the node.
    *   **Impact:** Potential compromise of the Fuel-Core node, data breaches, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Dependency Audits:** Regularly scan Fuel-Core's dependencies for known vulnerabilities using security scanning tools.
        *   **Keep Dependencies Up-to-Date:** Update Fuel-Core and its dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Dependency Pinning:** Use dependency pinning to ensure consistent and secure versions of dependencies are used.
        *   **Supply Chain Security:** Be mindful of the sources of dependencies and potential supply chain attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Key Management for Transaction Signing](./attack_surfaces/insecure_key_management_for_transaction_signing.md)

*   **Description:** The private keys used to sign transactions interacting with Fuel-Core are critical. If these keys are compromised, attackers can impersonate legitimate users and perform unauthorized actions.
    *   **How Fuel-Core Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Fuel-Core requires the use of private keys for transaction authorization. The security of these keys is paramount for the integrity of the system.
    *   **Example:** If a user's private key is stolen, an attacker could transfer their assets or execute malicious smart contract interactions on their behalf.
    *   **Impact:** Financial losses, unauthorized actions on the blockchain, damage to reputation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Key Generation:** Use cryptographically secure methods for generating private keys.
        *   **Hardware Wallets:** Encourage or enforce the use of hardware wallets for storing private keys.
        *   **Secure Key Storage:** Implement secure storage mechanisms for private keys, such as encrypted key vaults or secure enclaves.
        *   **Multi-Signature Schemes:** Utilize multi-signature wallets for critical accounts to require multiple approvals for transactions.
        *   **Regular Key Rotation:** Implement a policy for regularly rotating private keys.
