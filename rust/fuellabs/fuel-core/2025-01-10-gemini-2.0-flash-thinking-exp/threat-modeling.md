# Threat Model Analysis for fuellabs/fuel-core

## Threat: [Data Tampering in Network Communication](./threats/data_tampering_in_network_communication.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts communication between `fuel-core` and other nodes in the Fuel network. They then modify transaction data or other messages in transit.
    *   **Impact:** Altered transactions could lead to unauthorized transfers of assets, incorrect execution of smart contracts, or disruption of network consensus.
    *   **Affected Component:** `fuel-core`'s P2P Networking module, specifically the data transmission layer.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure all network communication within the Fuel network utilizes strong encryption protocols (e.g., TLS/SSL).
        *   Implement message authentication codes (MACs) or digital signatures to verify the integrity and authenticity of messages.

## Threat: [Local Data Tampering](./threats/local_data_tampering.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the system where `fuel-core` is running and directly modifies local data files, such as the database or configuration files.
    *   **Impact:** This could lead to corruption of the local blockchain state, manipulation of `fuel-core` settings to weaken security, or injection of malicious data.
    *   **Affected Component:** `fuel-core`'s Storage module (database), Configuration module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong access controls and file system permissions on the system running `fuel-core`.
        *   Encrypt sensitive data stored locally by `fuel-core`.
        *   Regularly monitor file integrity using tools like file integrity monitors (FIM).

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion Attack on Fuel-Core](./threats/resource_exhaustion_attack_on_fuel-core.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a large number of requests or transactions directly to `fuel-core`, overwhelming its resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) and causing it to become unresponsive or crash.
    *   **Impact:** `fuel-core` becomes unavailable, disrupting the application's ability to interact with the Fuel network, leading to denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** `fuel-core`'s API Gateway, Transaction Processing module, P2P Networking module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting on incoming requests and transactions at the `fuel-core` level.
        *   Implement resource usage monitoring and alerts to detect and respond to resource exhaustion within `fuel-core`.
        *   Configure appropriate resource limits for `fuel-core`.
        *   Implement proper input validation within `fuel-core` to prevent processing of excessively large or malformed requests.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Dependencies](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** `fuel-core` relies on various third-party libraries and dependencies. These dependencies might contain security vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit to compromise `fuel-core`.
    *   **Impact:** Exploiting vulnerable dependencies could allow attackers to compromise the `fuel-core` process, potentially gaining control over the node or accessing sensitive data managed by `fuel-core`.
    *   **Affected Component:** `fuel-core`'s Build System, Dependency Management.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update `fuel-core` and its dependencies to the latest versions, which often include security patches.
        *   Utilize dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in `fuel-core`'s dependencies.
        *   Implement a process for evaluating and mitigating risks associated with new dependencies in `fuel-core`.

## Threat: [API Abuse and Unauthorized Access](./threats/api_abuse_and_unauthorized_access.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in `fuel-core`'s API authentication or authorization mechanisms could allow attackers to perform actions they are not authorized to do by directly interacting with the `fuel-core` API.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers could submit unauthorized transactions directly through `fuel-core`, query sensitive information managed by `fuel-core`, or modify `fuel-core`'s configuration.
    *   **Affected Component:** `fuel-core`'s API Gateway, Authentication/Authorization mechanisms.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication mechanisms for the `fuel-core` API (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0).
        *   Implement granular authorization controls within `fuel-core` to restrict access to specific API endpoints and actions based on user roles or permissions.
        *   Enforce rate limiting on API requests to `fuel-core` to prevent abuse.
