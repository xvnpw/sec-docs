# Attack Surface Analysis for fuellabs/fuel-core

## Attack Surface: [Malicious or Crafted JSON RPC Requests](./attack_surfaces/malicious_or_crafted_json_rpc_requests.md)

**Description:** Attackers send intentionally malformed, oversized, or logically flawed JSON RPC requests to the Fuel-Core node.

**How Fuel-Core Contributes:** Fuel-Core exposes a JSON RPC API as its primary interface for interaction. Vulnerabilities in the parsing, validation, or processing of these requests can be exploited.

**Example:** Sending an RPC request with an extremely large array as a parameter, potentially causing memory exhaustion on the Fuel-Core node.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) against the Fuel-Core node, unexpected behavior, potential for triggering vulnerabilities in the underlying code.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust input validation on the application side before sending requests to Fuel-Core.
* Configure rate limiting on the Fuel-Core node's RPC endpoint.
* Ensure Fuel-Core is updated to the latest version with known RPC vulnerabilities patched.
* Consider using schema validation for RPC requests.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Access via JSON RPC API](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_access_via_json_rpc_api.md)

**Description:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to Fuel-Core's functionalities through the JSON RPC API.

**How Fuel-Core Contributes:** If Fuel-Core implements any form of API authentication or authorization, weaknesses in this implementation can be exploited. Lack of proper access controls on RPC methods is a direct contribution.

**Example:** Exploiting a vulnerability in the authentication mechanism to bypass login or using an unprotected RPC method to perform administrative actions.

**Impact:** Unauthorized state changes on the blockchain, access to sensitive information, potential for disrupting network operations.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for the Fuel-Core RPC API (if available and configurable).
* Restrict access to the RPC endpoint to trusted sources only (e.g., through firewall rules).
* Carefully review and configure any access control settings provided by Fuel-Core.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via P2P Network](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_p2p_network.md)

**Description:** Attackers flood the Fuel-Core node with network traffic or malicious messages to overwhelm its resources and prevent legitimate peers from connecting or synchronizing.

**How Fuel-Core Contributes:** Fuel-Core participates in a peer-to-peer network for consensus and data sharing. Vulnerabilities in the networking protocol or implementation can be exploited for DoS attacks.

**Example:** Sending a large volume of connection requests or malformed peer messages to exhaust the node's network resources.

**Impact:** Inability of the Fuel-Core node to participate in the network, loss of synchronization, potential impact on application functionality relying on the node.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Configure appropriate network security measures (firewalls, intrusion detection systems).
* Implement peer whitelisting or blacklisting if supported by Fuel-Core.
* Monitor network traffic to the Fuel-Core node for suspicious patterns.
* Ensure Fuel-Core's networking components are up-to-date with security patches.

## Attack Surface: [Node/Client Software Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/nodeclient_software_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the Fuel-Core client software itself or its dependencies.

**How Fuel-Core Contributes:** The Fuel-Core binary, written in Rust, can have its own vulnerabilities. Additionally, it relies on various libraries and dependencies, which may also contain security flaws.

**Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Fuel-Core node software that could be exploited by sending a specially crafted network message.

**Impact:** Remote code execution on the Fuel-Core node, data breaches, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep the Fuel-Core software updated to the latest stable version.
* Regularly review and update the dependencies used by Fuel-Core.
* Follow security best practices for the operating system and environment where Fuel-Core is running.
