                *   Craft malicious payloads designed to exploit weaknesses in input validation.
        *   Manipulate Transaction Data before Submission:
            *   Attack Vector: Intercept or influence the creation of transactions before they are submitted to `fuel-core`, injecting malicious code or data.
            *   Conditions:
                *   Intercept the communication channel between the application and `fuel-core`.
                *   Manipulate the transaction data before it is signed and submitted.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Misconfigured or Exposed Admin Interfaces](./attack_tree_paths/access_misconfigured_or_exposed_admin_interfaces.md)

Attack Vector: Gain unauthorized access to administrative interfaces of `fuel-core` due to misconfiguration or weak credentials, allowing for full control over the node.
    *   Conditions:
        *   Identify accessible administrative interfaces (if any).
        *   Exploit weak or default credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Insecure Default Configurations](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_insecure_default_configurations.md)
