        *   Validating Fuel address formats.
        *   Ensuring data types match expected types for transaction parameters (e.g., `u64`, `Bytes`).
        *   Checking for allowed ranges and lengths for data fields as defined by Fuel transaction structures.
    3.  **Implement Validation Before Fuel-Core Submission:** Implement validation checks in your application code *before* submitting transactions to `fuel-core` via its API.
