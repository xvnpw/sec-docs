# Threat Model Analysis for burntsushi/ripgrep

## Threat: [Malicious Regular Expressions (ReDoS)](./threats/malicious_regular_expressions__redos_.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted regular expression as a search pattern. This regex can cause the `ripgrep` regular expression matching engine to enter a catastrophic backtracking state, consuming excessive CPU time and potentially leading to a denial-of-service (DoS). The attacker might inject this regex through user input fields intended for search terms that are then passed to `ripgrep`.

**Impact:** Application performance degradation or complete unavailability due to CPU exhaustion caused by `ripgrep`. This can disrupt normal operations and potentially impact other services on the same server.

**Affected Ripgrep Component:** Regular Expression Matching Engine (specifically when using the default or PCRE2 engine).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Input Validation and Sanitization: Implement strict input validation on user-provided search patterns before passing them to `ripgrep`. Consider limiting the complexity of allowed regex patterns or using a safe subset of regex syntax.
*   Timeout Mechanisms: Configure a timeout for `ripgrep` execution. If the search takes longer than the timeout, terminate the `ripgrep` process to prevent resource exhaustion.
*   Consider Alternatives: For simple string searching, consider using `ripgrep`'s fixed-string search option (`-F`/`--fixed-strings`) which avoids the complexities of regex.
*   Resource Limits: Implement resource limits (CPU time, memory) for the process running `ripgrep`.

## Threat: [Path Traversal via User-Controlled Paths](./threats/path_traversal_via_user-controlled_paths.md)

**Description:** If the application allows users to specify the directories or files that `ripgrep` should search, an attacker could manipulate these paths (e.g., using `../`) to instruct `ripgrep` to access files or directories outside of the intended scope. The attacker could potentially read sensitive configuration files, application code, or other restricted data that `ripgrep` has permissions to access.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files and directories by `ripgrep`, potentially leading to information disclosure, data breaches, or privilege escalation if exposed files contain credentials or other sensitive information.

**Affected Ripgrep Component:** File System Access (when processing user-provided paths via command-line arguments or configuration).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Path Sanitization and Validation:  Thoroughly validate and sanitize user-provided file paths before passing them to `ripgrep`. Resolve relative paths to absolute paths and ensure they fall within the expected boundaries. Implement whitelisting of allowed directories.
*   Restrict Search Scope: Limit the directories and files that `ripgrep` can access to the minimum necessary set. Avoid allowing users to specify arbitrary paths.
*   Principle of Least Privilege: Ensure the user or process running `ripgrep` has only the necessary file system permissions.

## Threat: [Abuse of Dangerous Flags/Options](./threats/abuse_of_dangerous_flagsoptions.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate the command-line flags or options passed directly to `ripgrep` to cause unintended or malicious behavior within `ripgrep`. For example, using `--files-from` with a malicious file list that `ripgrep` then attempts to process, or using `--replace` with dangerous replacement patterns that `ripgrep` executes (though less relevant in typical search scenarios).

**Impact:** Potential for information disclosure (e.g., `ripgrep` searching unintended files), data modification (if `--replace` is misused by `ripgrep`), or denial-of-service (e.g., `ripgrep` attempting to process an extremely large number of files).

**Affected Ripgrep Component:** Command-line Argument Parsing and Option Handling.

**Risk Severity:** Medium to High (depending on the specific flag abused and the context).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Restrict Flag Usage:  Do not allow users to directly control all `ripgrep` flags. Carefully select and hardcode the necessary flags within the application logic when invoking `ripgrep`.
*   Sanitize Flag Values: If user input influences flag values (e.g., a file extension filter), validate and sanitize this input thoroughly before constructing the `ripgrep` command.
*   Principle of Least Privilege for Configuration: Only configure the necessary flags and options for `ripgrep`. Avoid using flags that are not strictly required.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Search Results](./threats/information_disclosure_via_search_results.md)

**Description:** If `ripgrep` is used to search through sensitive files and the application does not handle the search results returned by `ripgrep` securely, an attacker could potentially gain access to confidential information contained within the matched lines. This occurs because `ripgrep` itself is the component that identifies and returns the matching sensitive data.

**Impact:** Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data extracted by `ripgrep`, potentially leading to privacy violations, financial loss, or reputational damage.

**Affected Ripgrep Component:** Output Handling and Result Reporting.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure Handling of Search Results: Ensure that search results returned by `ripgrep` are processed, transmitted, and stored securely by the application. Implement appropriate access controls and encryption.
*   Redact Sensitive Information: If possible, redact or filter out sensitive information from the search results after `ripgrep` has returned them, before presenting them to users.
*   Principle of Least Privilege for Access: Only authorized users should have access to the search functionality and the resulting data returned by `ripgrep`.
