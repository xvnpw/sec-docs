# Attack Surface Analysis for burntsushi/ripgrep

## Attack Surface: [Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)](./attack_surfaces/regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos_.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious user provides a specially crafted regular expression that causes `ripgrep`'s regex engine to enter a catastrophic backtracking state, consuming excessive CPU resources and potentially leading to a denial-of-service condition for the application.
    *   **How ripgrep Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `ripgrep` relies on regular expressions for its core search functionality. If the application allows users to provide search patterns directly to `ripgrep`, it becomes vulnerable to ReDoS.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides the regex `^(a+)+$`. When used against a long string of 'a's, this regex can exhibit exponential backtracking, leading to significant performance degradation.
    *   **Impact:** Application slowdown, resource exhaustion, potential crash or unresponsiveness.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Implement timeouts for regex execution within the application.
        *   **Developer:** Sanitize or validate user-provided regexes to prevent overly complex or dangerous patterns. Consider using static analysis tools to detect potentially problematic regexes.
        *   **Developer:**  If possible, offer predefined search options instead of allowing arbitrary regex input.
        *   **Developer:** Consider using alternative regex engines with better ReDoS protection if feasible (though `ripgrep`'s engine is generally robust, complex patterns can still be an issue).

## Attack Surface: [File Path Injection](./attack_surfaces/file_path_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates user-controlled input that is used to specify the directories or files `ripgrep` should search, allowing them to access or search files outside the intended scope.
    *   **How ripgrep Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `ripgrep` takes file paths or directory paths as input to define the search scope. If the application doesn't properly sanitize these paths, attackers can inject malicious paths.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides the path `../../../../etc/passwd` as a target directory, potentially allowing `ripgrep` to search within sensitive system files if the application has sufficient permissions.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential access to sensitive data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**  Avoid directly using user input to construct file paths passed to `ripgrep`.
        *   **Developer:**  Implement strict validation and sanitization of user-provided file paths. Use allow-lists of allowed directories or patterns instead of block-lists.
        *   **Developer:**  Ensure the application runs with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the scope of potential damage.
        *   **Developer:**  Use canonicalization techniques to resolve symbolic links and relative paths before passing them to `ripgrep`.
