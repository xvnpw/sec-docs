# Attack Surface Analysis for burntsushi/ripgrep

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Regular Expressions (ReDoS)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_regular_expressions__redos_.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted regular expression that causes `ripgrep`'s regex engine to consume excessive CPU time and resources, leading to a denial of service.

**How Ripgrep Contributes:** `ripgrep` uses regular expressions for pattern matching, and its regex engine (likely from the `regex` crate in Rust) is susceptible to ReDoS if complex, backtracking-heavy patterns are used against certain inputs.

**Example:** An application allows users to input search patterns. An attacker enters a regex like `(a+)+b` against a long string of 'a's. `ripgrep` will spend an exponential amount of time trying to match this pattern.

**Impact:** Denial of service, potentially crashing the application or making it unresponsive.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Implement limits on the complexity and length of user-provided regular expressions.
*   **Timeouts:** Set timeouts for `ripgrep` operations to prevent them from running indefinitely.
*   **Consider Alternative Matching Strategies:** If full regex power isn't always needed, consider simpler string searching methods for some use cases.
*   **Regex Complexity Analysis:**  Employ tools or techniques to analyze the complexity of user-provided regular expressions before passing them to `ripgrep`.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via `--exec`](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via__--exec_.md)

**Description:** If the application uses `ripgrep`'s `--exec` option (or similar execution features) and incorporates unsanitized user input into the command to be executed, an attacker can inject arbitrary commands.

**How Ripgrep Contributes:** The `--exec` feature allows `ripgrep` to execute external commands based on search results. If the arguments to this command are not carefully controlled, it becomes a vector for command injection.

**Example:** An application allows users to perform actions on found files using `--exec mv {} /tmp/`. If a filename contains backticks or other command injection characters (e.g., `file`; `rm -rf /`), the attacker can execute arbitrary commands.

**Impact:** Full system compromise, data exfiltration, data destruction, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Avoid Using `--exec` with User Input:**  If possible, avoid using `--exec` when user input is involved in constructing the command.
*   **Strict Input Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize any user input that is used in the command executed by `--exec`. Use whitelisting of allowed characters and escape potentially dangerous characters.
*   **Parameterization:** If the external command supports it, use parameterization or placeholders to pass arguments safely instead of directly embedding them in the command string.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the application and `ripgrep` with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of a successful command injection.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal via Unsanitized File Paths](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_via_unsanitized_file_paths.md)

**Description:** If the application constructs file paths based on user input and passes them to `ripgrep` (e.g., using `-g`, `--glob`, or as arguments), an attacker can manipulate the input to access files or directories outside the intended scope.

**How Ripgrep Contributes:** `ripgrep` operates on file paths provided to it. If these paths are not validated, it can be directed to search in unintended locations.

**Example:** An application allows users to specify a directory to search. An attacker provides an input like `../../../../etc/passwd`, potentially exposing sensitive system files.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, access to sensitive data, potential for further exploitation.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Validate and sanitize user-provided file paths. Ensure they conform to expected patterns and do not contain path traversal sequences like `..`.
*   **Canonicalization:**  Convert user-provided paths to their canonical form to resolve symbolic links and eliminate relative path components.
*   **Chroot Environments or Sandboxing:**  If feasible, run `ripgrep` within a chroot environment or sandbox to restrict its access to the file system.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the application and `ripgrep` process only have the necessary permissions to access the intended files and directories.
