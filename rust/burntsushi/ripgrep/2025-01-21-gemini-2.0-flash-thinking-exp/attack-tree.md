# Attack Tree Analysis for burntsushi/ripgrep

Objective: Compromise Application via Ripgrep (CRITICAL NODE)

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
* AND 1: Interact with Ripgrep (HIGH-RISK PATH START)
    * OR 1.1: Provide Input to Ripgrep (CRITICAL NODE)
        * AND 1.1.1: Malicious Search Pattern (HIGH-RISK PATH)
            * Leaf 1.1.1.1: Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) (HIGH-RISK PATH)
            * Leaf 1.1.1.2: Command Injection via Shell Interpretation (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)
        * AND 1.1.2: Malicious File Paths (HIGH-RISK PATH)
            * Leaf 1.1.2.1: Path Traversal (HIGH-RISK PATH)
```


## Attack Tree Path: [AND 1: Interact with Ripgrep (HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/and_1_interact_with_ripgrep__high-risk_path_start_.md)

* This node represents the initial interaction point where an attacker attempts to leverage ripgrep. It's the starting point for the most likely and impactful attack sequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [OR 1.1: Provide Input to Ripgrep (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/or_1_1_provide_input_to_ripgrep__critical_node_.md)

* This node is critical because providing input is the most direct and common way to influence ripgrep's behavior. It serves as the entry point for several high-risk attack paths.

## Attack Tree Path: [AND 1.1.1: Malicious Search Pattern (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/and_1_1_1_malicious_search_pattern__high-risk_path_.md)

* This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities through crafted search patterns.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leaf 1.1.1.1: Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/leaf_1_1_1_1_regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos___high-risk_path_.md)

* Attack Vector: Crafting a regular expression that causes ripgrep's regex engine to consume excessive CPU and memory, leading to a denial of service for the application.
* Likelihood: Medium
* Impact: High
* Effort: Low
* Skill Level: Medium
* Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Leaf 1.1.1.2: Command Injection via Shell Interpretation (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/leaf_1_1_1_2_command_injection_via_shell_interpretation__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

* Attack Vector: If the application uses ripgrep with options that involve shell interpretation (e.g., `shell=True` in Python's `subprocess`), a malicious search pattern can be crafted to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
* Likelihood: Low
* Impact: Critical
* Effort: Medium
* Skill Level: Medium
* Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [AND 1.1.2: Malicious File Paths (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/and_1_1_2_malicious_file_paths__high-risk_path_.md)

* This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities by manipulating the file paths provided to ripgrep.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leaf 1.1.2.1: Path Traversal (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/leaf_1_1_2_1_path_traversal__high-risk_path_.md)

* Attack Vector: Using ".." sequences or other path manipulation techniques to force ripgrep to search files and directories outside the intended scope, potentially exposing sensitive information.
* Likelihood: Medium
* Impact: Medium
* Effort: Low
* Skill Level: Beginner
* Detection Difficulty: Medium
