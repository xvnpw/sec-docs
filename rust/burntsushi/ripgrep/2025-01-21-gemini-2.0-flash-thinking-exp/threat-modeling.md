# Threat Model Analysis for burntsushi/ripgrep

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Complex Regular Expressions (ReDoS)](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_complex_regular_expressions__redos_.md)

*   **Threat:** Resource Exhaustion via Complex Regular Expressions (ReDoS)
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted, computationally expensive regular expression that causes `ripgrep`'s regex engine to consume excessive CPU and memory, leading to a denial of service. This exploits the backtracking behavior of certain regex patterns within `ripgrep`'s core functionality.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service for the web application, potentially impacting other services on the same server if resources are exhausted.
    *   **Affected Ripgrep Component:** The regex engine used by `ripgrep` (likely the `regex` crate in Rust).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement timeouts for `ripgrep` execution to prevent long-running searches.
        *   Consider limiting the complexity or length of user-provided regular expressions *before* passing them to `ripgrep`.
        *   Explore using regex engines with built-in ReDoS protection mechanisms (though `ripgrep`'s engine is generally robust against simple ReDoS).

## Threat: [Binary Tampering/Supply Chain Attack](./threats/binary_tamperingsupply_chain_attack.md)

*   **Threat:** Binary Tampering/Supply Chain Attack
    *   **Description:** An attacker replaces the legitimate `ripgrep` binary with a malicious one. This compromises the integrity of the tool itself, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running `ripgrep`. This is a direct attack on the `ripgrep` component.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the server, data breach, or any other malicious activity the attacker programs into the tampered binary.
    *   **Affected Ripgrep Component:** The `rg` executable binary itself.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Verify the integrity of the `ripgrep` binary using checksums or digital signatures.
        *   Obtain the binary from trusted sources (official releases, package managers).
        *   Implement security measures to protect the server from unauthorized access and modification.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Ripgrep Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_ripgrep_dependencies.md)

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Ripgrep Dependencies
    *   **Description:** `ripgrep` relies on underlying libraries and dependencies. If these dependencies have known vulnerabilities, they could be exploited when `ripgrep` uses those vulnerable components. This is a direct risk stemming from `ripgrep`'s dependency tree.
    *   **Impact:**  Depends on the nature of the vulnerability in the dependency, but could range from denial of service to remote code execution *within the context of `ripgrep`'s execution*.
    *   **Affected Ripgrep Component:** The dependencies used by `ripgrep`, such as the `regex` crate or other Rust libraries.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium to High (depending on the specific vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep `ripgrep` updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches in its dependencies.
        *   Regularly audit the dependencies used by `ripgrep` for known vulnerabilities.
        *   Use dependency management tools that provide vulnerability scanning.
