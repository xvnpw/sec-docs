# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for burntsushi/ripgrep

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Symlink Following](./mitigation_strategies/disable_symlink_following.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Use `-S` or `--no-follow`:**  When constructing the command-line arguments for `ripgrep`, *always* include the `-S` or `--no-follow` option.  This explicitly instructs `ripgrep` not to follow symbolic links during the search.
2.  **Avoid `--follow`:**  Do *not* use the `--follow` option.  If you *think* you need to follow symlinks, carefully reconsider, as it significantly increases the attack surface.  If it's unavoidable, see the separate "Careful Symlink Handling" strategy.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Arbitrary File Access (via Symlinks):** (Severity: **High**) - Prevents attackers from creating symbolic links that point to sensitive files or directories outside the intended search scope, which `ripgrep` would otherwise follow.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Arbitrary File Access:** Risk reduced from **High** to **Low** (if symlink following is completely disabled).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: "The `-S` option is always added to the `ripgrep` command in the `build_ripgrep_command` function within `search_utils.py`."

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: "`ripgrep` is currently invoked without the `-S` or `--no-follow` flag, meaning it follows symlinks by default."

## Mitigation Strategy: [(Conditional) Careful Symlink Handling (If Symlink Following is *Required*)](./mitigation_strategies/_conditional__careful_symlink_handling__if_symlink_following_is_required_.md)

*   **Description:** *This strategy should only be used if, after careful consideration, you have determined that following symlinks is absolutely essential.  Disabling symlink following is always the preferred and safer approach.*
    1.  **Strict Symlink Control (External to `ripgrep`):** Implement very strict controls over the creation and placement of symlinks within the directories that `ripgrep` will search. This is *not* something `ripgrep` itself can enforce; it requires external mechanisms (file system permissions, dedicated symlink directories, regular auditing).
    2.  **Use `--follow` (with Extreme Caution):** If, and *only if*, you have implemented the strict symlink controls, you can use the `--follow` option with `ripgrep`.
    3. **Path Validation After Resolution (External to `ripgrep`):** Even with `--follow`, you *must* still perform rigorous path validation *after* `ripgrep` has resolved the symlinks. This means obtaining the final target path of any followed symlinks and ensuring that this target path is within the allowed search boundaries. This is crucial and cannot be skipped.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Arbitrary File Access (via Symlinks):** (Severity: **High**) - *Reduces* the risk, but does *not* eliminate it. Symlinks inherently introduce a risk, even with careful handling.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Arbitrary File Access:** Risk reduced from **High** to **Medium** (at best). The risk remains significant because the mitigation relies on external factors and perfect implementation.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: "`--follow` is used. Symlinks are restricted to the `/data/symlinks` directory, which has limited write access.  Post-resolution path validation is performed in `validate_resolved_path`."

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: "`--follow` is used, but there are no restrictions on where symlinks can be created, and no post-resolution path validation is performed."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Explicitly Exclude Hidden Files/Directories (If Needed)](./mitigation_strategies/explicitly_exclude_hidden_filesdirectories__if_needed_.md)

*    **Description:**
    *    **Default Behavior:** `ripgrep` ignores hidden files and directories by default. This mitigation is only necessary if you need an *extra* layer of defense, or if you are concerned about users trying to explicitly specify hidden files.
    *   **Use Globs for Exclusion:** Even if a user tries to explicitly include a hidden file or directory in the search path, you can use glob patterns to *force* their exclusion. Combine this with the default behavior for a defense-in-depth approach.
        *   Add `!.*/` to exclude hidden directories.
        *   Add `!.*` to exclude hidden files.
        *   These globs should be added to the `ripgrep` command line *in addition to* any user-provided search paths.
    * **Example:** If the user provides the search path `.hidden_dir`, your final `ripgrep` command might look like: `rg --no-follow "search_term" .hidden_dir !.*/ !.*`

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure via Hidden Files:** (Severity: **Medium**) - Prevents users from explicitly searching hidden files or directories, even if they try to bypass the default `ripgrep` behavior.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced from **Medium** to **Low**.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: "The globs `!.*/` and `!.*` are always appended to the `ripgrep` command in the `construct_command` function."

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: "We rely solely on `ripgrep`'s default behavior to ignore hidden files. No explicit exclusion is performed."
