# Attack Surface Analysis for burntsushi/ripgrep

## Attack Surface: [Uncontrolled File System Access](./attack_surfaces/uncontrolled_file_system_access.md)

*   **Description:**  `ripgrep` searches the file system based on provided paths.  If these paths are not properly validated, an attacker can access unintended files, potentially outside the application's intended scope.
*   **How ripgrep contributes:** `ripgrep`'s core function is file system searching; its power becomes a liability without strict input validation and access control.
*   **Example:**  An application allows users to specify a directory.  An attacker provides `../../../../etc/passwd` (or a similar path traversal) to read system files.
*   **Impact:**  Information disclosure (sensitive data, configuration files, source code).  Potentially, system compromise if combined with other vulnerabilities.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Whitelist:**  *Only* allow access to specific, pre-approved directories.  *Never* construct paths by directly concatenating user input.
    *   **Sanitize:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize user-provided paths, removing any `..`, `.`, or other potentially dangerous characters. Use a robust path normalization library.
    *   **Chroot/Containerization:**  Run `ripgrep` in a restricted environment (chroot jail or container) to limit its file system access.
    *   **Least Privilege:**  Run `ripgrep` with the lowest possible user privileges.

## Attack Surface: [Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)](./attack_surfaces/regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos_.md)

*   **Description:**  `ripgrep` uses regular expressions for pattern matching.  Maliciously crafted regular expressions can cause excessive processing time (catastrophic backtracking), leading to a denial of service.
*   **How ripgrep contributes:** `ripgrep`'s reliance on regular expressions for its core functionality creates this vulnerability.
*   **Example:**  An attacker provides a regex like `(a+)+$` against a long string of "a" characters, causing `ripgrep` to consume excessive CPU and become unresponsive.
*   **Impact:**  Denial of Service (DoS) – the application becomes unresponsive or crashes.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Predefined Patterns:**  *Strongly prefer* allowing users to select from a predefined list of safe search patterns, rather than allowing arbitrary regular expressions.
    *   **Regex Sanitization:**  If user-provided regex is *absolutely unavoidable*, use a regex validator/sanitizer to reject potentially dangerous patterns.  This is *difficult* to do perfectly, so prioritize the previous mitigation.
    *   **Timeouts:**  Implement strict timeouts for *all* `ripgrep` executions.
    *   **Simpler Matching:**  If full regex power isn't essential, use simpler string matching (e.g., `fgrep` functionality or `ripgrep`'s literal matching options).
    * **Resource Limits:** Limit CPU and memory usage for `ripgrep` processes (e.g., using `ulimit` or container resource limits).

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion (Non-ReDoS)](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion__non-redos_.md)

*   **Description:** `ripgrep` can be forced to consume excessive resources (memory, CPU, file handles) even without malicious regex, by searching large files, many small files, or deeply nested directories.
*   **How ripgrep contributes:** `ripgrep`'s speed and efficiency can be exploited if its resource usage is not constrained.
*   **Example:** An attacker directs `ripgrep` to a directory with millions of tiny files, a very large log file, or a deeply nested directory structure (potentially involving symbolic link loops).
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) – the application or the entire system becomes unresponsive or crashes.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **`-maxdepth`:** *Always* use the `-maxdepth` option with a reasonable, application-specific limit to control recursion depth.
    *   **`-max-filesize`:** Use `-max-filesize` to limit the size of files that `ripgrep` will process.
    *   **Timeouts:** Implement strict timeouts for *all* `ripgrep` executions.
    *   **File Type/Directory Restrictions:** If feasible, restrict `ripgrep` to specific file types or directories known to contain reasonably sized files.
    *   **Rate Limiting/Queuing:** Implement rate limiting or queuing for search requests to prevent abuse.
    * **Limit number of files:** Limit the number of files that can be searched.

## Attack Surface: [Binary Planting (via `PATH`)](./attack_surfaces/binary_planting__via__path__.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker places a malicious executable named `rg` in a directory earlier in the `PATH` environment variable than the real `ripgrep` executable.  When the application tries to run `ripgrep`, it executes the attacker's code instead.
*   **How ripgrep contributes:** While a general attack, `ripgrep`'s frequent use as a subprocess makes it a likely target. The application *calls* `ripgrep`, making this relevant.
*   **Example:** An attacker places a malicious `rg` executable in `/tmp`, and the application's `PATH` includes `/tmp` before the directory containing the legitimate `ripgrep`.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the application. This is a *very* serious compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Absolute Path:** *Always* use the absolute path to the `ripgrep` executable when launching it as a subprocess. This is the most reliable mitigation.
    *   **Controlled `PATH`:** Carefully control the `PATH` environment variable, ensuring it only includes trusted directories.  *Never* include user-writable directories like `/tmp` in the `PATH`.
