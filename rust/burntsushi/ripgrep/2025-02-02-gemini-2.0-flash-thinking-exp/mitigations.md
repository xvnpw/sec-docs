## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation and Sanitization for Ripgrep Commands](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation_and_sanitization_for_ripgrep_commands.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Strict Input Validation and Sanitization for Ripgrep Commands
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Ripgrep Input Points:**  Locate all places in your application where user input or application data is used to build commands that are passed to `ripgrep`. This includes search patterns, file paths, and flags.
    2.  **Define Allowed Input for Ripgrep:** For each input point used in `ripgrep` commands, specify the valid characters, format, and length. Use allowlists where possible (e.g., allowed characters in search queries, restricted file path structures).
    3.  **Validate Ripgrep Inputs:** Implement validation checks *before* constructing the `ripgrep` command. Ensure all inputs conform to the defined allowed input rules. Reject invalid input and provide informative errors.
    4.  **Sanitize Ripgrep Inputs:** Sanitize inputs used in `ripgrep` commands to remove or escape shell metacharacters. This prevents command injection by ensuring user input is treated as data, not commands, by the shell executing `ripgrep`. Escape characters like `;`, `&`, `|`, `$`, `` ` ``, `(`, `)`, `\`, `*`, `?`, `[`, `]`, `{`, `}`, `<`, `>`, `!`, `#`, `%`, `^`, `'`, `"`.
    5.  **Regularly Review Ripgrep Input Validation:** Periodically review and update input validation and sanitization rules to address new injection techniques and ensure they remain effective for `ripgrep` command construction.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Command Injection (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from injecting arbitrary shell commands through inputs used in `ripgrep` commands, potentially leading to system compromise.
*   **Impact:** Significantly reduces command injection risk when constructing `ripgrep` commands.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented in the web application's search query field with basic HTML character sanitization, but lacks shell metacharacter sanitization for `ripgrep` commands.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Missing in file path inputs and backend processes that dynamically generate `ripgrep` commands.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Parameterization and Argument Separation for Ripgrep Execution](./mitigation_strategies/parameterization_and_argument_separation_for_ripgrep_execution.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Parameterization and Argument Separation for Ripgrep Execution
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use Argument Arrays for Ripgrep:** Instead of building the entire `ripgrep` command as a single string, utilize your programming language's features to execute external commands by providing arguments as separate elements in an array or list when calling `ripgrep`.
    2.  **Pass Ripgrep Inputs as Arguments:** Pass validated and sanitized user inputs or application data as individual arguments to the `ripgrep` command. Avoid embedding them directly into a single command string where shell interpretation can occur.
    3.  **Example (Python):** Use `subprocess.run(["rg", validated_input, "files"])` instead of `subprocess.run(f"rg '{validated_input}' files")`. This treats `validated_input` as a distinct argument for `ripgrep`.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Command Injection (High Severity):** Reduces command injection risk by preventing the shell from interpreting user input as commands when executing `ripgrep`.
*   **Impact:** Moderately reduces command injection risk when executing `ripgrep`.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. `ripgrep` commands are currently constructed as single strings.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Missing in all code sections where `ripgrep` commands are executed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Ripgrep Search Scope](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_ripgrep_search_scope.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Restrict Ripgrep Search Scope
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Allowed Ripgrep Search Directories:** Clearly define the directories that `ripgrep` is permitted to search within. This should be based on the application's intended functionality and security needs.
    2.  **Enforce Ripgrep Directory Restrictions:** In your application code, verify that user-provided file paths or directory inputs for `ripgrep` searches are within the defined allowed search directories.
    3.  **Path Prefix Validation for Ripgrep:** Validate that user-provided paths for `ripgrep` are prefixes of the allowed search directories.
    4.  **Canonicalization and Comparison for Ripgrep Paths:** Canonicalize both user-provided paths and allowed search directories before using them with `ripgrep` to resolve symbolic links and prevent traversal. Compare canonicalized paths to ensure user paths are within the allowed scope.
    5.  **Reject Out-of-Scope Ripgrep Paths:** If a user-provided path for `ripgrep` is outside the allowed search directories, reject the request and provide an error.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Path Traversal (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from using path traversal to access files outside the intended search scope when using `ripgrep`.
    *   **Arbitrary File Access (High Severity):** Mitigates unauthorized access to arbitrary files through `ripgrep`.
*   **Impact:** Significantly reduces path traversal and arbitrary file access risks when using `ripgrep`.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented with basic string prefix matching for allowed directories, but lacks robust canonicalization for `ripgrep` paths.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Missing robust path canonicalization and consistent enforcement of search scope restrictions across all `ripgrep` usage.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Path Canonicalization for Ripgrep Paths](./mitigation_strategies/path_canonicalization_for_ripgrep_paths.md)

    2.  **Apply Canonicalization to Ripgrep Paths:** Use path canonicalization functions (e.g., `realpath()`) to process these paths *immediately* after receiving them and before using them in `ripgrep` commands.
    3.  **Use Canonicalized Ripgrep Paths:**  Work with canonicalized paths throughout your application logic related to `ripgrep`. Avoid using the original, potentially uncanonicalized paths when interacting with `ripgrep`.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Path Traversal (Medium Severity):** Reduces path traversal attacks that use relative paths or symbolic links to bypass directory restrictions in `ripgrep` searches.
    *   **Arbitrary File Access (Medium Severity):** Makes it harder to manipulate paths to access unintended files through `ripgrep`.
*   **Impact:** Moderately reduces path traversal and arbitrary file access risks when using `ripgrep`.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. User-provided paths are used directly with `ripgrep` without canonicalization.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Missing in all code sections handling file paths for `ripgrep`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation for Ripgrep File Paths](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_for_ripgrep_file_paths.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Input Validation for Ripgrep File Paths
*   **Description:**

    2.  **Implement Ripgrep Path Validation Rules:** Validate user-provided file paths against these patterns before using them with `ripgrep`. Check for disallowed characters, path traversal patterns (`../`), and conformance to allowed directory structures.
    3.  **Reject Invalid Ripgrep Paths:** If a path fails validation for `ripgrep`, reject the request and provide an error message.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Path Traversal (Medium Severity):** Helps prevent path traversal attempts when users specify paths for `ripgrep`.
    *   **Arbitrary File Access (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of users providing malicious file paths to `ripgrep`.
*   **Impact:** Moderately reduces path traversal and arbitrary file access risks when using `ripgrep`.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented with basic disallowed character checks, but lacks comprehensive pattern-based validation for `ripgrep` paths.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Missing robust validation rules and consistent application of path validation for all `ripgrep` path inputs.
