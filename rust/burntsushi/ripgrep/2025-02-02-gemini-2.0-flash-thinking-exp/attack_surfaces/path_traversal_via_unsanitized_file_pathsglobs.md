## Deep Analysis: Path Traversal via Unsanitized File Paths/Globs in Applications Using Ripgrep

This document provides a deep analysis of the "Path Traversal via Unsanitized File Paths/Globs" attack surface in applications that utilize the `ripgrep` tool (https://github.com/burntsushi/ripgrep). It outlines the objective, scope, and methodology of this analysis, followed by a detailed examination of the attack surface, potential vulnerabilities, and mitigation strategies.

### 1. Define Objective

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface: Path Traversal via Unsanitized File Paths/Globs

#### 4.1. Understanding Path Traversal Vulnerabilities

Path traversal vulnerabilities, also known as directory traversal or "dot-dot-slash" vulnerabilities, arise when an application allows user-controlled input to influence file paths without proper sanitization. Attackers exploit this by injecting special characters or sequences (like `../`) into file paths to navigate outside the intended directory scope and access unauthorized files or directories on the server or system.

In the context of `ripgrep`, the tool is designed to search files based on provided paths and glob patterns. If an application directly passes user-supplied input as paths or globs to `ripgrep` without validation, it becomes susceptible to path traversal attacks.

#### 4.2. Ripgrep's Contribution to the Attack Surface

`ripgrep` itself is not inherently vulnerable to path traversal. It faithfully executes the search commands it receives. The vulnerability lies in how an application *uses* `ripgrep`.  `ripgrep`'s core functionality relies on:

*   **File Path Arguments:**  `ripgrep` takes file paths and directory paths as arguments to specify where to search.
*   **Glob Patterns:**  `ripgrep` supports glob patterns (e.g., `*.txt`, `**/*.log`) to match multiple files and directories.

If an application constructs `ripgrep` commands by directly concatenating user input with base paths or glob patterns, it creates an opportunity for attackers to manipulate these inputs and escape the intended search scope.

#### 4.3. Exploitation Scenarios and Examples

Let's illustrate with concrete examples how an attacker could exploit this vulnerability:

**Scenario 1: Basic Path Traversal with `../`**

*   **Application Intention:**  Allow users to search for files within a specific directory, e.g., `/var/app/user_data/`.
*   **Vulnerable Code (Conceptual):**

    ```python
    import subprocess

    def search_user_data(user_query, search_path_input):
        base_path = "/var/app/user_data/"
        search_path = base_path + search_path_input  # Vulnerable concatenation
        command = ["rg", user_query, search_path]
        process = subprocess.Popen(command, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
        stdout, stderr = process.communicate()
        return stdout.decode()
    ```

*   **Attack:** A malicious user provides `search_path_input` as `../../../../etc/passwd`.
*   **Resulting Command:** `rg <user_query> /var/app/user_data/../../../../etc/passwd`
*   **Outcome:** `ripgrep` will attempt to search within `/etc/passwd`, potentially exposing sensitive system information if the application then displays the output to the user.

**Scenario 2: Glob Pattern Manipulation**

*   **Application Intention:** Allow users to search within log files in `/var/log/app/` using glob patterns, but only for `.log` files.
*   **Vulnerable Code (Conceptual):**

    ```python
    import subprocess

    def search_logs(user_query, glob_pattern_input):
        base_path = "/var/log/app/"
        glob_pattern = glob_pattern_input # Potentially vulnerable if not validated
        command = ["rg", user_query, glob_pattern, base_path] # Base path appended, but glob can escape
        process = subprocess.Popen(command, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
        stdout, stderr = process.communicate()
        return stdout.decode()
    ```

*   **Attack:** A malicious user provides `glob_pattern_input` as `../../../../etc/*`.
*   **Resulting Command:** `rg <user_query> ../../../../etc/* /var/log/app/`
*   **Outcome:**  While `/var/log/app/` is still in the command, the glob pattern `../../../../etc/*` can cause `ripgrep` to traverse up and search within `/etc/`, potentially including sensitive files. The base path `/var/log/app/` might be ignored or cause errors depending on `ripgrep`'s glob processing and argument parsing, but the attacker's glob is still processed.

**Scenario 3: Symbolic Link Exploitation (Less Direct, but Possible)**

*   If the application allows users to specify directories to search and the system contains symbolic links, an attacker might be able to create a symbolic link within an allowed directory that points to a sensitive location outside the intended scope. If `ripgrep` follows symbolic links (default behavior), it could inadvertently access the target of the symbolic link. This is less directly a path traversal in the input, but a consequence of allowing traversal within a user-controlled directory that contains malicious symlinks.

#### 4.4. Impact of Successful Path Traversal

A successful path traversal attack can have significant consequences:

*   **Information Disclosure:** The most common impact is unauthorized access to sensitive files. This could include:
    *   Configuration files containing credentials, API keys, or database connection strings.
    *   Source code, revealing application logic and potential vulnerabilities.
    *   User data, violating privacy and potentially leading to compliance issues.
    *   System files like `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow` (if readable), providing information for further attacks.
*   **Privilege Escalation (Indirect):**  Access to sensitive configuration files or scripts could provide attackers with information needed to escalate privileges or gain further access to the system.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Less Likely but Possible):** In some scenarios, attempting to access a large number of files or directories outside the intended scope could potentially lead to performance degradation or resource exhaustion, indirectly causing a DoS.
*   **Further Exploitation:**  Information gained through path traversal can be used to plan and execute more sophisticated attacks.

#### 4.5. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

To effectively mitigate path traversal vulnerabilities when using `ripgrep`, applications must implement robust input validation and path handling mechanisms. Here's a detailed breakdown of the suggested strategies:

**4.5.1. Input Validation and Whitelisting:**

*   **Principle:**  The most fundamental defense is to strictly validate all user-provided input that will be used to construct file paths or glob patterns for `ripgrep`.
*   **Whitelisting Approach:** Define a whitelist of allowed base directories and file extensions.  This is generally more secure than blacklisting.
    *   **Example:** If users should only search within `/var/app/user_data/`, this should be the only allowed base directory.
    *   **File Extension Whitelisting:** If only `.txt` and `.log` files are allowed, enforce this restriction.
*   **Input Sanitization:**
    *   **Remove Path Traversal Sequences:**  Strip out sequences like `../`, `..\\`, `./`, `.\\` from user input.  However, simply removing these is often insufficient as attackers can use URL encoding (`%2e%2e%2f`) or other obfuscation techniques.
    *   **Regular Expressions:** Use regular expressions to validate input against allowed patterns. For example, ensure that paths start with an allowed base directory and only contain alphanumeric characters, underscores, hyphens, and forward slashes (within allowed limits).
*   **Reject Invalid Input:** If input does not conform to the whitelist or validation rules, reject it immediately and provide informative error messages to the user (without revealing internal path structures).

**Example (Python - Input Validation):**

```python
import os
import subprocess

ALLOWED_BASE_DIR = "/var/app/user_data"
ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = [".txt", ".log"]

def secure_search(user_query, search_path_input):
    # 1. Input Validation: Check for traversal sequences and canonicalize
    if ".." in search_path_input: # Basic check, improve with regex for robustness
        return "Error: Invalid path input."

    full_search_path = os.path.normpath(os.path.join(ALLOWED_BASE_DIR, search_path_input))

    # 2. Path Canonicalization and Whitelist Check
    if not full_search_path.startswith(os.path.normpath(ALLOWED_BASE_DIR)):
        return "Error: Path is outside allowed base directory."

    # 3. Extension Check (if applicable) - Example for single file search
    if os.path.isfile(full_search_path):
        _, ext = os.path.splitext(full_search_path)
        if ext not in ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS and ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS: # ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS can be None if not needed
            return "Error: File extension not allowed."

    command = ["rg", user_query, full_search_path]
    process = subprocess.Popen(command, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
    stdout, stderr = process.communicate()
    return stdout.decode()
```

**4.5.2. Path Canonicalization:**

*   **Principle:** Canonicalization converts a path to its absolute, normalized form, resolving symbolic links, relative paths (`.`, `..`), and redundant separators. This ensures that you are working with the actual, intended path.
*   **Implementation:** Use operating system-provided functions for path canonicalization:
    *   **Python:** `os.path.abspath()`, `os.path.realpath()`, `os.path.normpath()`
    *   **Java:** `Paths.get(path).toRealPath()`
    *   **Node.js:** `path.resolve()`, `path.normalize()`
*   **Verification:** After canonicalizing the path, compare it against the canonicalized form of the allowed base directory. Ensure that the canonicalized path starts with the canonicalized base directory. This prevents bypasses using symbolic links or other path manipulations.

**Example (Python - Canonicalization and Whitelist Check):**

```python
import os

ALLOWED_BASE_DIR = "/var/app/user_data"

def is_path_safe(user_path):
    canonical_base_dir = os.path.normpath(ALLOWED_BASE_DIR) # Canonicalize base dir once
    canonical_user_path = os.path.normpath(os.path.join(ALLOWED_BASE_DIR, user_path)) # Join and then canonicalize

    return canonical_user_path.startswith(canonical_base_dir)

# Usage:
user_input_path = "../../sensitive_data"
if is_path_safe(user_input_path):
    print("Path is safe") # This will NOT be printed
else:
    print("Path is NOT safe")

user_input_path = "valid_subdir/file.txt"
if is_path_safe(user_input_path):
    print("Path is safe") # This WILL be printed
else:
    print("Path is NOT safe")
```

**4.5.3. Restrict Search Scope (Application Logic and Ripgrep Arguments):**

*   **Principle:** Limit the scope of `ripgrep` searches based on application logic and user permissions.
*   **Application Logic:** Design the application so that users only need to access files within specific, well-defined directories. Avoid giving users broad access to the file system through `ripgrep`.
*   **Ripgrep Arguments:** Utilize `ripgrep`'s command-line arguments to further restrict the search scope:
    *   **Explicitly Specify Directories:** Instead of relying on glob patterns that might traverse upwards, explicitly provide the allowed directory paths to `ripgrep`.
    *   **`--max-depth`:**  Use `--max-depth` to limit the depth of directory traversal, preventing searches from going too far up or down the directory tree.
    *   **`--type` and `--type-not`:**  Restrict searches to specific file types using `--type <filetype>` or exclude certain types with `--type-not <filetype>`. This can help limit the attack surface by preventing access to sensitive file types.
    *   **`--no-follow`:**  Use `--no-follow` to prevent `ripgrep` from following symbolic links, mitigating the symbolic link exploitation scenario.

**Example (Ripgrep Command with Scope Restriction):**

```bash
rg "search term" --max-depth 3 --type txt /var/app/user_data/user123/
```

This command restricts the search to:

*   Files containing "search term".
*   Within `/var/app/user_data/user123/` directory.
*   Maximum directory depth of 3 levels below the base directory.
*   Only files of type `txt`.

#### 4.6. Testing and Verification

After implementing mitigation strategies, thorough testing is crucial to verify their effectiveness:

*   **Manual Testing:**  Attempt to bypass the implemented protections using various path traversal techniques (e.g., `../`, URL encoding, double encoding, long paths, symbolic links if applicable).
*   **Automated Testing:**  Integrate security tests into your CI/CD pipeline to automatically check for path traversal vulnerabilities. Tools like static analysis security testing (SAST) and dynamic analysis security testing (DAST) can be helpful.
*   **Code Reviews:**  Conduct code reviews to ensure that input validation, path canonicalization, and scope restriction are implemented correctly and consistently throughout the application.

### 5. Conclusion

By understanding the mechanisms of these attacks and implementing robust mitigation strategies – particularly input validation, path canonicalization, and scope restriction – development teams can significantly reduce this attack surface.  A layered approach, combining multiple mitigation techniques, is recommended for the most effective defense.
