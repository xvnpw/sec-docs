# Threat Model Analysis for burntsushi/ripgrep

## Threat: [Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)](./threats/regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos_.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a maliciously crafted regular expression as a search pattern. When `ripgrep` processes this regex against input data, it can lead to excessive backtracking and CPU consumption, causing a denial of service. The attacker might submit multiple such requests to amplify the impact.

**Impact:** Application performance degradation, service unavailability, resource exhaustion, denial of service for legitimate users.

**Ripgrep Component Affected:** Regex Engine (underlying regex library).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Input validation and sanitization of user-provided regular expressions.
*   Implement timeouts for `ripgrep` execution to prevent long-running regex processing.
*   Consider using regex analysis tools to detect potentially problematic regex patterns before execution.
*   Educate users on crafting efficient and safe regular expressions, or provide pre-defined, safe regex options.

## Threat: [Path Traversal via File Path Injection](./threats/path_traversal_via_file_path_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates user-provided input intended for file paths or directory paths. By injecting path traversal sequences like `../`, the attacker can force `ripgrep` to search files or directories outside the intended scope, potentially accessing sensitive files that should not be accessible.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, information disclosure, potential for further exploitation if sensitive data is revealed, compromise of confidentiality.

**Ripgrep Component Affected:** File System Access (path handling within ripgrep's core logic).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Strictly validate and sanitize user-provided file paths and directory inputs to prevent path traversal.
*   Use absolute paths and restrict the search scope to a predefined, safe directory.
*   Employ chroot or containerization to isolate the `ripgrep` process and limit file system access.
*   Avoid directly using user-provided paths; generate paths programmatically based on validated input.

## Threat: [Command Injection via Unsanitized Arguments](./threats/command_injection_via_unsanitized_arguments.md)

**Description:** If the application constructs the `ripgrep` command by directly concatenating user input without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious command arguments. This could involve injecting flags or options that alter `ripgrep`'s behavior in unintended ways or even execute arbitrary commands on the system if the application's command execution method is vulnerable.

**Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on the server, complete system compromise, data breaches, denial of service, loss of integrity and availability.

**Ripgrep Component Affected:** Command Line Argument Parsing (how the application interacts with and constructs the `ripgrep` command).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Absolutely avoid string concatenation for constructing shell commands.**
*   Utilize secure methods for executing external commands that provide parameterization or argument escaping, specific to your programming language.
*   Whitelist allowed `ripgrep` flags and options that users can utilize.
*   Strictly validate user input against the whitelist of allowed flags and options.
*   Utilize libraries or wrappers that provide safer interfaces for executing external commands and handle argument escaping automatically.

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure in Ripgrep Output](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_in_ripgrep_output.md)

**Description:** If `ripgrep` is used to search files that contain sensitive information (e.g., configuration files, logs, database backups), the output of `ripgrep`, if not handled securely, could inadvertently expose this sensitive data to unauthorized users or processes. This is especially critical if the output is logged, displayed directly to users, or stored insecurely.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of credentials, Personally Identifiable Information (PII), or other sensitive information, reputational damage, legal and regulatory repercussions.

**Ripgrep Component Affected:** Output Handling (how ripgrep formats and outputs search results, and how the application processes this output).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully consider and restrict the files and directories that `ripgrep` is allowed to search, avoiding sensitive locations unless absolutely necessary and with strong access controls.
*   Sanitize or redact sensitive information from `ripgrep` output before displaying it to users, logging it, or storing it.
*   Implement robust access controls to ensure that only authorized users can initiate `ripgrep` searches and access the results.
*   Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit to minimize the impact of potential information disclosure, even if `ripgrep` output is compromised.
