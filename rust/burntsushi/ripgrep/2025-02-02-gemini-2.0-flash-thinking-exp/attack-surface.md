# Attack Surface Analysis for burntsushi/ripgrep

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via Unsanitized Search Patterns](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_unsanitized_search_patterns.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious commands by exploiting insufficient sanitization of user-provided search patterns that are directly passed to `ripgrep`.
*   **Ripgrep Contribution:** `ripgrep` executes commands constructed by the application, including user-provided search patterns. Lack of sanitization in the application directly leads to this vulnerability when using `ripgrep`.
*   **Example:** An application constructs a command like `ripgrep "{user_input}" /path/to/search`. If a user inputs `; rm -rf /`, and the application executes this command via a shell without proper sanitization, it can lead to arbitrary command execution.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on the server, potentially leading to data breach, system compromise, denial of service, or privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate user-provided search patterns before passing them to `ripgrep`. Use allowlists for permitted characters and escape shell metacharacters if shell execution is used.
    *   **Parameterization/Prepared Statements (if possible):**  Utilize parameterized command execution methods if available in your programming environment to separate commands from user-provided data.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run `ripgrep` with minimal necessary privileges to limit the impact of successful command injection.
    *   **Avoid Shell Execution:** If possible, use libraries that allow direct process execution without invoking a shell to reduce shell injection risks.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal via Unsanitized File Paths/Globs](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_via_unsanitized_file_pathsglobs.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to files or directories outside the intended scope by manipulating file paths or glob patterns passed to `ripgrep`.
*   **Ripgrep Contribution:** `ripgrep` operates directly on file paths and glob patterns provided by the application. If the application doesn't validate these inputs, attackers can instruct `ripgrep` to access unintended areas.
*   **Example:** An application intends to allow searching within `/var/app/data`. If it naively uses user input to construct the search path, a user could input `../../../../etc/passwd` to make `ripgrep` attempt to access the password file, bypassing the intended directory restriction.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, information disclosure, potential for further exploitation if sensitive configuration files are accessed.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation and Whitelisting:**  Strictly validate user-provided file paths and glob patterns. Use whitelists to define allowed base directories and file extensions.
    *   **Path Canonicalization:** Canonicalize paths to resolve symbolic links and relative paths before passing them to `ripgrep`. Compare the canonicalized path against allowed, canonicalized base paths.
    *   **Restrict Search Scope:**  Limit the directories and file types that `ripgrep` is allowed to access based on application logic and user permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)](./attack_surfaces/regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers craft malicious regular expressions that cause `ripgrep`'s regex engine to consume excessive CPU and memory, leading to denial of service.
*   **Ripgrep Contribution:** `ripgrep`'s core functionality relies on regular expression matching.  Vulnerability to ReDoS arises when `ripgrep` processes complex or maliciously crafted regex patterns, especially if user-provided.
*   **Example:** A user provides a regex like `(a+)+$`. When `ripgrep` attempts to match this against a long string of 'a's followed by a 'b', it can trigger exponential backtracking in the regex engine, leading to CPU exhaustion and application slowdown or freeze.
*   **Impact:** Application denial of service, performance degradation, resource exhaustion, potentially impacting other services on the same system.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regex Complexity Limits:** Implement limits on the complexity of user-provided regular expressions. This can include character limits, nesting depth restrictions, or using static analysis to detect potentially problematic patterns.
    *   **Regex Timeout:** Set a timeout for regex matching operations within `ripgrep`. If a match takes longer than the timeout, terminate the operation to prevent resource exhaustion.
    *   **Safe Regex Libraries/Engines:** Consider using regex libraries or engines that are designed to be more resistant to ReDoS vulnerabilities or have built-in safeguards.
    *   **Predefined Regex Options:** Offer users a selection of predefined, safe regex options instead of allowing arbitrary regex input, where feasible for the application's functionality.
