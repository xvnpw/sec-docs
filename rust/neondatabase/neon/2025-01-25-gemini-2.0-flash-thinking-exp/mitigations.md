## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Neon API Key Management](./mitigation_strategies/secure_neon_api_key_management.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Secure Neon API Key Management

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify all locations where Neon API keys are currently stored:** This includes application code, configuration files, environment variables, CI/CD pipelines, and developer workstations.
    2.  **Eliminate hardcoded API keys:** Remove any API keys directly embedded in application code or configuration files.
    3.  **Implement a secure secret management solution:** Choose a dedicated secret management tool or service (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, Google Secret Manager) or utilize secure environment variable mechanisms provided by your deployment platform.
    4.  **Store Neon API keys in the secret management solution:**  Securely store each Neon API key within the chosen secret management system.
    5.  **Configure application to retrieve API keys from the secret management solution at runtime:** Modify your application code to dynamically fetch the Neon API key from the secret management system when needed, instead of reading it from a static location. Ensure your application is configured to connect to Neon using the retrieved API key.
    6.  **Implement access control for the secret management solution:** Restrict access to the secret management system itself, ensuring only authorized services and personnel can retrieve Neon API keys.
    7.  **Enable API key rotation:** Implement a process to regularly rotate Neon API keys. This involves generating new keys within your Neon project, updating the secret management system, and ensuring the application seamlessly uses the new keys for Neon connections.
    8.  **Audit API key usage and access:** Monitor logs from both Neon (if available for API key usage) and the secret management system to detect any unauthorized access or suspicious activity related to Neon API keys.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exposed Neon API Keys (High Severity):**  Accidental exposure of Neon API keys in code repositories, logs, or developer machines. This allows unauthorized access to the Neon database.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Neon Database (High Severity):**  Compromised Neon API keys can be used by attackers to read, modify, or delete data in the Neon database, leading to data breaches, data corruption, or service disruption.
    *   **Lateral Movement (Medium Severity):**  If Neon API keys are compromised, attackers might use them as a stepping stone to gain access to other parts of the application infrastructure or Neon project.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exposed Neon API Keys:** High Risk Reduction - Significantly reduces the risk of accidental Neon API key exposure by removing them from vulnerable locations.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Neon Database:** High Risk Reduction - Makes it much harder for attackers to obtain valid Neon API keys and access the database.
    *   **Lateral Movement:** Medium Risk Reduction - Limits the potential for lateral movement by containing Neon API key access within a secure system.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Neon API keys are currently stored as environment variables in the deployment pipeline for production. Developers might have keys in local environment variables for development.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Dedicated secret management solution is not implemented for Neon API keys. Neon API key rotation is not automated. Access control to environment variables holding Neon API keys is limited to platform level. Auditing of Neon API key usage is not fully implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Neon Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_neon_role-based_access_control__rbac_.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Implement Neon Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review existing user roles and permissions within the application:** Identify different user types and their required access levels to the Neon database.
    2.  **Map application roles to Neon roles:** Define corresponding roles within Neon's RBAC system that align with the application's user roles and access needs. Utilize Neon's built-in roles or create custom roles within Neon if necessary.
    3.  **Grant least privilege permissions within Neon RBAC:** For each Neon role, grant only the minimum necessary permissions required to perform the intended database tasks within Neon. Avoid granting overly broad Neon permissions like `superuser` unless absolutely essential.
    4.  **Assign Neon roles to users and applications:**  When creating Neon database users or configuring application connections to Neon, assign the appropriate Neon roles based on their function and required access level within Neon.
    5.  **Regularly review and audit Neon role assignments:** Periodically review the assigned Neon roles within the Neon platform to ensure they remain appropriate and aligned with current access requirements. Remove any unnecessary or excessive Neon permissions.
    6.  **Enforce Neon RBAC consistently across all Neon environments:** Apply the Neon RBAC policies consistently across development, staging, and production Neon projects to maintain a consistent security posture for your Neon databases.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation within Neon (High Severity):**  Users or applications gaining access to data or operations within Neon beyond their authorized level due to overly permissive Neon database roles.
    *   **Data Breaches due to Insider Threats within Neon (Medium Severity):**  Malicious or negligent insiders with excessive Neon database privileges could intentionally or accidentally leak or modify sensitive data within Neon.
    *   **Accidental Data Modification or Deletion within Neon (Medium Severity):**  Users or applications with overly broad write permissions within Neon could unintentionally modify or delete critical data in the Neon database.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation within Neon:** High Risk Reduction - Significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized actions within Neon by enforcing strict access control based on Neon roles.
    *   **Data Breaches due to Insider Threats within Neon:** Medium Risk Reduction - Limits the potential damage from insider threats within Neon by restricting access to only necessary data and operations within the Neon database.
    *   **Accidental Data Modification or Deletion within Neon:** Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces the likelihood of accidental data corruption within Neon by limiting write access to authorized users and applications interacting with the Neon database.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic user roles are defined in the application, but direct mapping to Neon RBAC is not fully enforced.  Default Neon roles are used, but custom Neon roles are not defined.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Detailed mapping of application roles to custom Neon roles. Granular permission configuration within Neon roles. Automated enforcement of Neon RBAC during user provisioning and application deployment. Regular audits of Neon role assignments within the Neon platform.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Neon Branch Management](./mitigation_strategies/secure_neon_branch_management.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Secure Neon Branch Management

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish clear Neon branching policies:** Define guidelines for when and how Neon branches should be created, used, and deleted. Document these policies and communicate them to the development team, specifically focusing on Neon branch usage.
    2.  **Implement access control for Neon branch operations:** Restrict who can create, access, modify, and delete Neon branches. This can be achieved through Neon's project-level access controls or by implementing workflow restrictions within your development processes that govern Neon branch management.
    3.  **Avoid storing sensitive production data in Neon development/staging branches:**  Refrain from directly copying or migrating production data to Neon development or staging branches unless absolutely necessary for testing within the Neon environment.
    4.  **Utilize data masking or anonymization for Neon non-production branches:** If production-like data is needed in Neon non-production branches, implement data masking, anonymization, or synthetic data generation techniques to protect sensitive information within the Neon database branches.
    5.  **Implement Neon branch lifecycle management:** Establish a process for regularly reviewing and deleting old or unused Neon branches to minimize potential security risks and resource consumption within the Neon project.
    6.  **Educate developers on secure Neon branching practices:** Train developers on the security implications of Neon branching, emphasizing the importance of data protection and access control in Neon branch management.
    7.  **Audit Neon branch activity:** Monitor Neon branch creation, access, and deletion events within the Neon platform to detect any unauthorized or suspicious Neon branch operations.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Exposure in Neon Development/Staging Environments (Medium to High Severity):**  Sensitive production data being inadvertently exposed in less secure Neon development or staging branches, increasing the risk of data breaches within the Neon environment.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Production Data via Neon Branches (Medium Severity):**  Attackers gaining access to production data by exploiting vulnerabilities in Neon development or staging branches that might have weaker security controls within Neon.
    *   **Data Spillage and Compliance Violations within Neon (Medium Severity):**  Uncontrolled proliferation of Neon branches containing sensitive data leading to data spillage and potential compliance violations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) within the Neon database.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Exposure in Neon Development/Staging Environments:** Medium to High Risk Reduction - Significantly reduces the risk of production data exposure in Neon non-production environments by limiting data copying and implementing data masking within Neon branches.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Production Data via Neon Branches:** Medium Risk Reduction - Makes it harder for attackers to leverage Neon development/staging branches to access production data by enforcing access control and secure branching practices within Neon.
    *   **Data Spillage and Compliance Violations within Neon:** Medium Risk Reduction - Helps to control data sprawl and reduce the risk of compliance violations by implementing Neon branch lifecycle management and data minimization in Neon non-production branches.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Neon branching is used for development and feature isolation. Basic access control is in place at the Neon project level.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Formal Neon branching policies are not documented. Granular access control for Neon branch operations is not fully implemented. Data masking/anonymization is not consistently applied in Neon non-production branches. Automated Neon branch lifecycle management is missing. Neon branch activity auditing is not implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Comprehensive Neon Logging and Monitoring](./mitigation_strategies/implement_comprehensive_neon_logging_and_monitoring.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Implement Comprehensive Neon Logging and Monitoring

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Neon database logs:** Ensure that Neon database logs are enabled within the Neon platform and configured to capture relevant security events, such as authentication attempts to Neon, authorization failures within Neon, data access within Neon, and administrative actions within Neon.
    2.  **Integrate Neon logs with a central logging system:** Forward Neon database logs from the Neon platform to a centralized logging and monitoring system (e.g., ELK stack, Splunk, Datadog, cloud provider logging services).
    3.  **Configure alerts for security-relevant Neon events:** Set up alerts within the central logging system to notify security teams of critical security events related to Neon, such as failed login attempts to Neon, suspicious queries to Neon, or unusual data access patterns within Neon.
    4.  **Monitor Neon database performance and anomalies:**  Establish baseline performance metrics for the Neon database within the Neon platform and monitor for deviations that could indicate security incidents related to Neon, such as denial-of-service attacks or data exfiltration attempts targeting Neon.
    5.  **Regularly review and analyze Neon logs:**  Periodically review Neon database logs and monitoring data to proactively identify potential security issues within Neon, investigate incidents related to Neon, and improve the security posture of your Neon usage.
    6.  **Retain Neon logs for an appropriate period:**  Define a log retention policy for Neon logs that meets compliance requirements and allows for sufficient time for security investigations and audits related to your Neon database.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Delayed Incident Detection and Response related to Neon (High Severity):**  Lack of logging and monitoring of Neon activity can significantly delay the detection of security incidents affecting your Neon database, allowing attackers more time to compromise Neon systems and data.
    *   **Insufficient Forensic Information for Neon Incidents (Medium Severity):**  Inadequate Neon logging can hinder security investigations related to Neon and make it difficult to determine the scope and impact of security incidents within your Neon database.
    *   **Unidentified Security Vulnerabilities and Misconfigurations in Neon (Medium Severity):**  Monitoring Neon logs can help identify potential security vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and unusual activity within Neon that might indicate security weaknesses in your Neon setup or the Neon platform itself.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Delayed Incident Detection and Response related to Neon:** High Risk Reduction - Significantly reduces the time to detect and respond to security incidents affecting Neon by providing real-time visibility into Neon database activity.
    *   **Insufficient Forensic Information for Neon Incidents:** Medium Risk Reduction - Improves the ability to conduct thorough security investigations related to Neon by providing detailed logs of Neon database events.
    *   **Unidentified Security Vulnerabilities and Misconfigurations in Neon:** Medium Risk Reduction - Enables proactive identification and remediation of security weaknesses within Neon through log analysis and anomaly detection of Neon activity.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic Neon logs are enabled and accessible through the Neon console.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Integration of Neon logs with a central logging system is missing. Automated alerts for security events within Neon are not configured.  Proactive Neon log analysis and monitoring for anomalies are not implemented. Log retention policy for Neon logs is not formally defined.
