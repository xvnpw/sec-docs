## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Pageserver Isolation and Hardening (Neon-Specific Aspects)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_pageserver_isolation_and_hardening__neon-specific_aspects_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Neon Configuration:** Configure the Pageserver component of Neon itself to listen only on specific network interfaces and ports, as defined by the Neon deployment configuration.  Ensure that the Pageserver is not exposed to unnecessary network traffic.
    2.  **Neon User Permissions:** Within the Pageserver's internal configuration, ensure that the Neon processes run with the least privilege necessary. Avoid running Neon processes as root.
    3.  **Neon-Specific Hardening:** Apply any hardening guidelines or recommendations provided specifically by the Neon project documentation. This might include specific configuration settings within Neon's configuration files.
    4.  **Neon Audit Logging:** Configure Neon's internal audit logging to capture all relevant events within the Pageserver.  This is distinct from OS-level audit logging.  Forward these logs to a centralized system.
    5. **Neon Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan Pageservers using vulnerability scanners, and include Neon specific CVE database.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Compromise of the Pageserver (Severity: Critical):** Directly prevents unauthorized access and control at the Neon software level.
    *   **Data Breaches (Severity: Critical):** Reduces the risk of data access through vulnerabilities in the Neon Pageserver software.
    *   **Data Corruption (Severity: Critical):** Limits the ability of an attacker to modify data via the Neon Pageserver.
    *   **Denial of Service (Severity: High):** Makes it harder to disrupt the Pageserver via Neon-specific exploits.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Compromise of the Pageserver:** Risk significantly reduced (Neon-specific aspects).
    *   **Data Breaches:** Risk significantly reduced (Neon-specific aspects).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Object Storage Configuration (Neon-Specific Aspects)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_object_storage_configuration__neon-specific_aspects_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Neon Storage Configuration:** Configure Neon (through its configuration files or management interface) to use *only* designated, secure object storage buckets (e.g., S3 buckets).  Ensure that Neon is configured to use the correct bucket names, regions, and access credentials.
    2.  **Neon-Managed Credentials:** If Neon provides a mechanism for managing object storage credentials (e.g., IAM roles for EC2 instances), use it.  Avoid hardcoding credentials or using less secure methods.
    3.  **Neon Encryption Settings (Object Storage):** Configure Neon to use server-side encryption for data stored in object storage.  Use Neon's built-in mechanisms for specifying encryption keys or key management systems (e.g., AWS KMS integration).
    4. **Neon Object Lifecycle Management:** If Neon supports it, configure object lifecycle management *through Neon's interface* to automatically delete old or unnecessary data. This ensures that the lifecycle policies are aligned with Neon's data retention requirements.
