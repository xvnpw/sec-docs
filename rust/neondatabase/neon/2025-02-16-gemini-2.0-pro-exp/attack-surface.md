# Attack Surface Analysis for neondatabase/neon

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Neon Credentials](./attack_surfaces/compromised_neon_credentials.md)

*   **1. Compromised Neon Credentials**

    *   **Description:** Unauthorized access to the Neon database due to leaked or stolen API keys, connection strings, or Neon *user account* credentials.
    *   **How Neon Contributes:** Neon's authentication relies entirely on these credentials. API keys and connection strings are *the* method for programmatic access; user accounts control console access.
    *   **Example:** A developer accidentally commits a Neon connection string to a public GitHub repository. An attacker finds the string and uses it to connect to the database.  Alternatively, an attacker phishes a Neon user's console credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Complete database compromise (data theft, modification, deletion). Potential for lateral movement if the compromised credentials have broader access.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never** commit credentials to source control. Use environment variables or dedicated secrets management services.
        *   Implement robust key rotation policies. Rotate API keys regularly.
        *   Enforce strong password policies and mandatory multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all Neon *user accounts* (console access).
        *   Use short-lived tokens instead of long-lived API keys where possible (if supported by Neon).
        *   Monitor API key usage for anomalies.
        *   Principle of Least Privilege: Grant only the *minimum* necessary permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Exploitation of Neon Platform Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/exploitation_of_neon_platform_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **2. Exploitation of Neon Platform Vulnerabilities**

    *   **Description:** Zero-day vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in Neon's own infrastructure (compute instances, API, control plane, etc.). This is a vulnerability *within* Neon itself.
    *   **How Neon Contributes:** This is inherent to using a managed service. The security of the underlying platform is Neon's responsibility.
    *   **Example:** A newly discovered vulnerability in Neon's API allows an attacker to bypass authentication and access databases belonging to other users.
    *   **Impact:** Potentially wide-ranging, from data breaches to denial-of-service, depending on the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Stay informed about Neon's security advisories and apply updates *promptly*. This is the *most critical* mitigation for a managed service.
        *   Have a robust incident response plan, including procedures for dealing with vulnerabilities in third-party services like Neon.
        *   Consider architectural approaches to reduce reliance on a single vendor (e.g., multi-cloud, database replication). This is a higher-effort, long-term mitigation.
        *   Monitor Neon's status pages and communications.

## Attack Surface: [Data Exfiltration from Compromised Neon Compute](./attack_surfaces/data_exfiltration_from_compromised_neon_compute.md)

*   **3. Data Exfiltration from Compromised Neon Compute**

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to a Neon *compute instance* (the serverless environment that executes queries) and exfiltrates data. This is an attack *on* Neon's infrastructure.
    *   **How Neon Contributes:** Neon's serverless architecture relies on these compute instances. Their security is entirely Neon's responsibility.
    *   **Example:** A zero-day vulnerability in the Postgres version used by Neon allows an attacker to gain shell access to a compute instance and copy data.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach. The attacker could potentially access data from multiple databases if the compute instance is shared.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Primarily, rely on Neon's security patching and vulnerability management. This is a core responsibility of the service provider.
        *   If Neon provides *any* visibility into compute instance activity (logs, metrics), monitor for unusual behavior (though this is unlikely to be detailed).
        *   Consider data loss prevention (DLP) solutions *if* available and applicable within the Neon environment (unlikely, but worth checking).
        *   Encrypt sensitive data at rest *within* the database itself (application-level or using `pgcrypto`). This adds a layer of defense even if the compute instance is compromised, but it's not a direct mitigation against compute compromise itself. It mitigates the *impact*.

## Attack Surface: [Network-Based Attacks (MitM) targeting Neon connection](./attack_surfaces/network-based_attacks__mitm__targeting_neon_connection.md)

* **4. Network-Based Attacks (MitM) targeting Neon connection**
 *   **Description:** Interception of communication between the application and the Neon database, despite the use of HTTPS.
    *   **How Neon Contributes:** Neon relies on network communication (over the internet) for all interactions. While Neon uses HTTPS, vulnerabilities in TLS or compromised CAs are still a risk that affects connection to Neon.
    *   **Example:** An attacker on a compromised network uses a fake certificate to perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack, intercepting the connection between the application and Neon.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker can potentially capture sensitive data in transit, including queries and results. They might also be able to modify data being sent to or from the database.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure the application uses up-to-date TLS libraries and correctly validates certificate chains.
        *   Consider certificate pinning (with careful management to avoid operational issues).
        *   Use a trusted network and avoid public Wi-Fi for sensitive operations.
        *   If supported by Neon and your cloud provider, use VPC peering or private links to establish a more secure network connection.
