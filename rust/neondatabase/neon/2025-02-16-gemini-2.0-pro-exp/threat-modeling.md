# Threat Model Analysis for neondatabase/neon

## Threat: [Unauthorized Project/Branch Access](./threats/unauthorized_projectbranch_access.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Project/Branch Access

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to a Neon project or branch they shouldn't have access to, due to misconfigured roles, a compromised user account with excessive permissions, or a vulnerability in Neon's access control.  The attacker can then read, modify, or delete data within that project/branch.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data modification, data deletion, potential denial of service (resource exhaustion).
    *   **Affected Component:** Neon Control Plane (authorization/authentication services), Project/Branch configuration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement the principle of least privilege.
        *   Regularly audit Neon project/branch permissions.
        *   Use strong passwords and multi-factor authentication (MFA) for Neon user accounts.
        *   Use separate Neon projects for different environments (dev, staging, prod).
        *   Leverage Neon's RBAC features.

## Threat: [Connection String/API Key Leakage](./threats/connection_stringapi_key_leakage.md)

*   **Threat:** Connection String/API Key Leakage

    *   **Description:** An attacker obtains a valid Neon connection string or API key through accidental code commits, insecure storage, a compromised developer machine, or a server misconfiguration.  The attacker can then connect to the Neon database and perform actions allowed by the key's permissions.
    *   **Impact:** Complete database compromise (read, write, delete).
    *   **Affected Component:** Neon Compute Endpoint (authentication), Application configuration (where the string is stored).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   *Never* hardcode connection strings in code.
        *   Use environment variables or a secure secrets management system.
        *   Rotate API keys regularly.
        *   Implement strict access controls on the secrets management system.
        *   Monitor for leaked credentials.
        *   Restrict IP addresses that can use the API key (if supported).

## Threat: [Compute Endpoint Exploitation](./threats/compute_endpoint_exploitation.md)

*   **Threat:** Compute Endpoint Exploitation

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Neon compute endpoint itself (e.g., a bug in the Postgres proxy or a network misconfiguration). This could allow bypassing authentication, executing arbitrary code, or exfiltrating data.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data modification, data deletion, denial of service, potential compromise of other systems.
    *   **Affected Component:** Neon Compute Endpoint (Postgres proxy, network configuration).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the Neon client library and related software updated.
        *   Monitor Neon's security advisories and apply patches promptly.
        *   Implement network security controls to restrict access to the compute endpoint.
        *   Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF).
        *   Monitor network traffic to/from the compute endpoint.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion (DoS)](./threats/resource_exhaustion__dos_.md)

*   **Threat:** Resource Exhaustion (DoS)

    *   **Description:** An attacker sends many requests to the Neon compute endpoint, or consumes excessive storage, to exhaust resources and cause a denial of service. This could be a targeted attack or an unintentional consequence of a poorly designed application.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, potential financial loss (if autoscaling is enabled without limits).
    *   **Affected Component:** Neon Compute Endpoint, Storage Layer, Autoscaling mechanisms.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting in the application.
        *   Set appropriate compute resource limits within Neon.
        *   Monitor resource usage and set alerts.
        *   Use Neon's autoscaling responsibly, with limits.
        *   Implement circuit breakers in the application.

## Threat: [Data Exfiltration via Compromised Compute](./threats/data_exfiltration_via_compromised_compute.md)

*   **Threat:** Data Exfiltration via Compromised Compute

    *   **Description:** If an attacker compromises the compute endpoint, they could use it to exfiltrate data from the storage layer. Even with encryption at rest, the compute endpoint has access to decrypted data.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach.
    *   **Affected Component:** Neon Compute Endpoint, Storage Layer (indirectly).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong security controls on the compute endpoint (see "Compute Endpoint Exploitation").
        *   Monitor network traffic for suspicious data transfers.
        *   Implement data loss prevention (DLP) measures, if possible.
        *   Use encryption at rest *and* in transit.

## Threat: [Neon Platform Vulnerability](./threats/neon_platform_vulnerability.md)

*   **Threat:** Neon Platform Vulnerability

    *   **Description:** A vulnerability in the Neon platform itself (control plane, compute engine, or storage management) could be exploited, leading to various negative consequences.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data modification, data deletion, denial of service, potential compromise of other systems.
    *   **Affected Component:** Varies (could be any part of the Neon platform).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Stay informed about Neon security advisories and updates.
        *   Apply updates promptly.
        *   Have a disaster recovery plan.
        *   Regularly review Neon's security documentation.
