# Threat Model Analysis for neondatabase/neon

## Threat: [Control Plane Account Takeover](./threats/control_plane_account_takeover.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to a Neon user account with administrative privileges. This could be through credential compromise or exploiting vulnerabilities in Neon's account management system. The attacker can then manipulate Neon projects, databases, and access controls.
*   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of Neon projects, leading to data breach, data loss, denial of service, and unauthorized access to sensitive information across all projects under the compromised account.
*   **Affected Neon Component:** Control Plane (User Authentication and Authorization module, Account Management APIs).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Neon Responsibility:** Implement and enforce strong Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), robust password policies, proactive security monitoring and intrusion detection on the control plane, secure API key management practices, and regular security audits and penetration testing of account management systems.
    *   **User/Developer Responsibility:**  Enable and enforce MFA for all Neon accounts, securely manage Neon API keys using secrets management solutions, regularly rotate API keys, monitor account activity for suspicious logins or actions, and adhere to strong password practices.

## Threat: [Compute Plane Instance Escape / Cross-Tenant Access](./threats/compute_plane_instance_escape__cross-tenant_access.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker successfully escapes the isolation of their Neon compute instance (endpoint). This could be achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in the container runtime, hypervisor, kernel, or other isolation mechanisms employed by Neon. Upon escape, the attacker could potentially access resources, processes, or data belonging to other Neon users or projects co-located on the same physical infrastructure.
*   **Impact:**  Data breach affecting multiple Neon users, unauthorized access to sensitive data across different tenants, potential for widespread lateral movement within Neon's infrastructure, undermining the fundamental security of the multi-tenant environment.
*   **Affected Neon Component:** Compute Plane (Container Runtime, Hypervisor, Kernel, Isolation Mechanisms).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Neon Responsibility:** Utilize robust and security-hardened containerization or virtualization technologies, implement strong kernel-level security configurations and mandatory access controls, rigorously test and audit isolation boundaries, promptly patch any identified vulnerabilities in the compute plane infrastructure, and employ intrusion detection systems within the compute plane environment.
    *   **User/Developer Responsibility:**  While direct mitigation is limited for users, maintain awareness of Neon's security posture and updates. Understand the inherent risks associated with multi-tenant cloud environments and design applications with appropriate security considerations, assuming a shared responsibility model.

## Threat: [Storage Plane Data Breach via Access Control Weakness](./threats/storage_plane_data_breach_via_access_control_weakness.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker bypasses or exploits weaknesses in the access control mechanisms protecting the Neon Storage System. This could involve exploiting authentication or authorization flaws to gain direct, unauthorized access to the underlying storage layer, bypassing the intended access paths through the compute plane.
*   **Impact:**  Massive data breach potentially affecting a large number of Neon users, direct access to raw database data at rest, potential for large-scale data exfiltration, corruption, or manipulation at the storage level, undermining the confidentiality and integrity of user data across the platform.
*   **Affected Neon Component:** Storage Plane (Access Control Modules, Authentication/Authorization Systems for Storage Access, Data Encryption at Rest mechanisms).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Neon Responsibility:** Implement extremely strict and robust access control lists (ACLs) and role-based access control (RBAC) for the storage layer, enforce strong multi-factor authentication and authorization for all storage access requests, utilize strong encryption at rest for all stored data with secure key management, implement comprehensive storage access logging and monitoring, and conduct frequent and thorough security assessments and penetration testing specifically targeting the storage layer.
    *   **User/Developer Responsibility:**  Place a high degree of trust in Neon's storage security implementation. Users should focus on general data security best practices within their applications, understanding that the underlying storage security is managed by Neon.

## Threat: [Malicious Neon Extension or Compute Plane Software Vulnerability](./threats/malicious_neon_extension_or_compute_plane_software_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a security vulnerability within Neon-provided extensions, the core Postgres server running in the compute plane, or other software components within the compute instance. This could involve exploiting known vulnerabilities in open-source components or zero-day exploits. Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution within the compute instance, privilege escalation to root, or denial of service.
*   **Impact:**  Data breach from within the database instance, denial of service for individual databases, potential for privilege escalation allowing further compromise of the compute instance, and potentially lateral movement if instance escape is also possible.
*   **Affected Neon Component:** Compute Plane (Postgres Server, Neon Extensions, Operating System within Compute Instance, Supporting Libraries).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Neon Responsibility:** Implement a rigorous Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) for all Neon-developed components, conduct regular and automated vulnerability scanning and penetration testing of the entire compute plane software stack, maintain a proactive vulnerability management program to promptly apply security patches for Postgres and all dependencies, and establish robust incident response procedures specifically for security incidents within the compute plane.
    *   **User/Developer Responsibility:** Stay informed about Neon's security updates and announcements, exercise caution when considering the use of third-party or community extensions (if such functionality becomes available), and promptly report any suspected vulnerabilities or unusual behavior within their Neon databases to Neon's security team.
