## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Neon Vulnerabilities [ROOT - CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_neon_vulnerabilities__root_-_critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This is the root goal. It encompasses all potential attacks exploiting Neon-specific weaknesses to compromise the application.
*   **Why Critical:** Success at this root level means the attacker achieves their objective, leading to data breach, service disruption, or other forms of compromise.
*   **Mitigation:** All subsequent actionable insights in the tree are aimed at mitigating this root goal.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Neon Control Plane Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] & Gain Unauthorized Access to Control Plane APIs [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_neon_control_plane_vulnerabilities__critical_node__&_gain_unauthorized_access_to_control_pla_ee0be445.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Targeting vulnerabilities in the Neon Control Plane to gain unauthorized access to its APIs. This could involve exploiting authentication flaws, API vulnerabilities, or misconfigurations.
*   **Why High-Risk & Critical:** The Control Plane manages the entire Neon project. Compromise here grants broad control, potentially affecting data, configuration, and availability. Impact is very high. Likelihood is estimated as medium due to potential API security weaknesses.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Implement robust logging and monitoring of control plane API access.
    *   Secure the control plane infrastructure and access points rigorously.
    *   Thoroughly review and test control plane authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    *   Implement multi-factor authentication for sensitive control plane operations (if applicable/exposed).
    *   Stay updated with Neon security advisories and patch control plane components promptly (if self-hosted/managed).
    *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the control plane infrastructure (if self-hosted/managed).

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Authentication/Authorization (Control Plane APIs) [CRITICAL NODE] & Exploit API Key Weaknesses [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_authenticationauthorization__control_plane_apis___critical_node__&_exploit_api_key_weaknesses_a6e86121.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Bypassing authentication and authorization mechanisms protecting the Control Plane APIs, specifically by exploiting weaknesses in API keys. This could involve weak key generation, insecure storage, or lack of rotation.
*   **Why High-Risk & Critical:** API keys are a primary authentication method for Control Plane access. Weaknesses here directly lead to unauthorized access. Likelihood is medium due to common API key security issues. Impact is high as it grants control plane access. Effort and skill are medium.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Enforce strong API key generation, rotation, and secure storage practices.
    *   Implement rate limiting and anomaly detection on API key usage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Neon Project Configuration [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_neon_project_configuration__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Once Control Plane access is gained (via previous steps), the attacker manipulates Neon project settings. This could involve disabling security features, exposing sensitive data through configuration changes, or disrupting service availability by altering resource settings.
*   **Why High-Risk & Critical:** Project configuration directly controls security posture and service availability. Malicious manipulation can have immediate and severe consequences. Likelihood is medium (if control plane access is gained). Impact is high. Effort and skill are low to medium.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Implement strong role-based access control (RBAC) within the Neon control plane.
    *   Audit and monitor changes to project security settings.
    *   Principle of least privilege for control plane access.
    *   Data masking/redaction in control plane logs and interfaces where possible.
    *   Implement resource quotas and limits within Neon project settings.
    *   Monitor resource usage and set up alerts for anomalies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify Weaknesses in Proxy Authentication [CRITICAL NODE] & Credential Leakage (Proxy Authentication) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/identify_weaknesses_in_proxy_authentication__critical_node__&_credential_leakage__proxy_authenticati_f0aa1220.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting weaknesses in the Neon Proxy's authentication mechanisms, specifically focusing on credential leakage from the application side. This involves insecure storage or handling of database credentials within the application code or configuration.
*   **Why High-Risk & Critical:**  Credential leakage is a common application-side vulnerability. If database credentials are leaked, attackers can bypass proxy authentication and potentially gain direct access to compute instances. Likelihood is medium due to common credential management issues. Impact is high (database access). Effort and skill are low to medium.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Securely manage database credentials in application code and configuration.
    *   Use connection pooling and credential management best practices.
    *   Enforce strong database credentials and secure connection practices in the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce Malicious Data Corruption [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_malicious_data_corruption__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious or malformed data into the Neon database to cause data corruption. This could be achieved through application vulnerabilities that allow bypassing input validation or data sanitization.
*   **Why High-Risk & Critical:** Data corruption can lead to application malfunction, data integrity issues, and potentially data loss. While less about unauthorized *access*, it's a significant threat to data integrity and availability. Likelihood is low to medium (depending on application security). Impact is medium to high. Effort and skill are low to medium.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Input validation and data sanitization in the application to prevent malicious data injection.
    *   Implement application-level data integrity checks and backup strategies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Neon SDK/Client Library Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] & Vulnerabilities in Neon's Provided SDKs/Libraries [CRITICAL NODE] & Exploit Known SDK/Library Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] & Code Injection (SDK Vulnerabilities) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_neon_sdkclient_library_vulnerabilities__critical_node__&_vulnerabilities_in_neon's_provided__4c5baf5a.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities within Neon's SDKs or client libraries used by the application. Specifically focusing on code injection vulnerabilities within the SDKs.
*   **Why High-Risk & Critical:** SDKs are directly integrated into the application. Vulnerabilities, especially code injection, can lead to application compromise, data access, or even RCE on the application server. Likelihood is low (for SDK vulnerabilities themselves), but impact is high. Effort and skill are medium to high.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Keep Neon SDKs updated and monitor for security advisories related to them.
    *   Treat Neon SDKs as external dependencies and apply standard dependency management security practices.
    *   Input validation when using SDK functions that construct queries or commands.
    *   Follow secure coding practices when using any external library.
