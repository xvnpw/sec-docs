# Attack Surface Analysis for neondatabase/neon

## Attack Surface: [Neon Control Plane API Authentication Bypass](./attack_surfaces/neon_control_plane_api_authentication_bypass.md)

*   Description: Attackers bypass authentication mechanisms in the Neon Control Plane API, gaining unauthorized access to manage Neon projects and infrastructure. This directly targets Neon's core management layer.
*   Neon Contribution: Neon's control plane is the central management point. Weak authentication here directly exposes all projects and Neon infrastructure under the compromised control plane instance.
*   Example: An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Neon API authentication logic, allowing them to forge API requests and assume administrative privileges without valid credentials. They can then create, delete, or modify Neon projects, access sensitive configuration, or disrupt services.
*   Impact: Full compromise of Neon projects, widespread data breaches across managed databases, complete denial of service for applications relying on Neon, and potential account takeover of Neon users.
*   Risk Severity: **Critical**
*   Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Enforce robust multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all Neon Control Plane API access and administrative interfaces.
    *   Implement strict input validation and output encoding for all API endpoints to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
    *   Conduct regular, automated security audits and penetration testing specifically targeting the Neon Control Plane API.
    *   Employ rate limiting and anomaly detection to identify and block suspicious API access patterns.
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege for API access roles, granting only necessary permissions to users and services.

## Attack Surface: [Object Storage (S3) Bucket Misconfiguration leading to Neon Data Exposure](./attack_surfaces/object_storage__s3__bucket_misconfiguration_leading_to_neon_data_exposure.md)

*   Description: Misconfiguration of the object storage service (like S3), used by Neon for persistent data storage, results in unauthorized public access to sensitive database data. This is a direct exposure of Neon's storage backend.
*   Neon Contribution: Neon's architecture relies on object storage as the primary data persistence layer. Misconfigurations in these storage buckets directly expose the entire database contents managed by Neon.
*   Example: The S3 bucket where Neon stores WAL segments and page versions is inadvertently configured with public read permissions. An attacker discovers this misconfiguration and gains access to all historical and current database data, including backups.
*   Impact: Catastrophic data breach, exposure of all application data managed by Neon, severe compliance violations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.), and irreparable reputational damage.
*   Risk Severity: **Critical**
*   Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Implement and strictly enforce private bucket policies for all object storage buckets used by Neon.
    *   Utilize AWS IAM or equivalent to control access to object storage, granting access only to authorized Neon services and administrative roles.
    *   Regularly audit object storage bucket permissions using automated tools and manual reviews.
    *   Enable object versioning and access logging for all Neon storage buckets to track access and facilitate recovery.
    *   Mandatory server-side encryption for data at rest in object storage buckets used by Neon.

## Attack Surface: [Compute Node Container Escape Vulnerabilities in Neon](./attack_surfaces/compute_node_container_escape_vulnerabilities_in_neon.md)

*   Description: Attackers exploit vulnerabilities within the container runtime environment of Neon Compute Nodes to escape container isolation and access the underlying host system. This directly compromises Neon's compute infrastructure.
*   Neon Contribution: Neon's serverless architecture relies on containerization for isolating compute nodes. Container escape vulnerabilities directly undermine this isolation and expose the underlying Neon platform.
*   Example: A vulnerability in the container runtime used by Neon is discovered. An attacker, having gained initial access to a Neon Compute Node (e.g., through SQL injection), leverages this container escape vulnerability to break out of the container and gain root access to the host machine, potentially impacting other Neon services or data.
*   Impact: Compromise of Neon's underlying infrastructure, potential lateral movement to other Neon components, data breaches affecting multiple Neon projects, and widespread denial of service.
*   Risk Severity: **High**
*   Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Employ hardened and regularly updated container runtime environments for Neon Compute Nodes.
    *   Implement strong container security configurations, including resource limits, security profiles (like seccomp and AppArmor), and network policies.
    *   Proactive vulnerability scanning and patching of the container runtime, kernel, and host operating system used by Neon.
    *   Principle of least privilege within container environments, minimizing privileges granted to processes running inside containers.
    *   Implement robust intrusion detection and prevention systems to monitor for and block container escape attempts.

## Attack Surface: [Pageserver API Vulnerabilities leading to Neon Data Corruption or Breach](./attack_surfaces/pageserver_api_vulnerabilities_leading_to_neon_data_corruption_or_breach.md)

*   Description: Exploitation of vulnerabilities in the Pageserver API, a Neon-specific component managing storage layers, allows attackers to directly manipulate or access database data bypassing standard PostgreSQL access controls.
*   Neon Contribution: The Pageserver API is a unique and critical component of Neon's architecture. Vulnerabilities here directly impact the integrity and confidentiality of data stored within Neon, representing a Neon-specific attack vector.
*   Example: An attacker identifies an injection vulnerability in the Pageserver API. They craft malicious API requests to directly modify page versions or WAL segments, leading to database corruption, data loss, or unauthorized data extraction without interacting with PostgreSQL compute nodes.
*   Impact: Data corruption and integrity issues across Neon databases, potential data breaches bypassing standard database access controls, denial of service by disrupting the storage layer, and instability of the Neon service.
*   Risk Severity: **High**
*   Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Secure the Pageserver API with strong, mutual authentication and authorization mechanisms, restricting access to only authorized Neon internal components.
    *   Rigorous security code review and penetration testing specifically targeting the Pageserver API and its interactions with storage layers.
    *   Implement comprehensive input validation and sanitization for all Pageserver API endpoints to prevent injection attacks.
    *   Enforce strict network segmentation to isolate the Pageserver API and limit its accessibility.
    *   Continuous monitoring and logging of Pageserver API activity for anomaly detection and security incident response.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Critical Neon Components](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_critical_neon_components.md)

*   Description: Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and dependencies used by core Neon components (Control Plane, Pageserver, Compute Nodes) are exploited to compromise Neon infrastructure. This is a supply chain risk directly impacting Neon's security.
*   Neon Contribution: Neon, like any complex software, relies on external libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies directly translate to vulnerabilities in Neon itself, creating a Neon-specific attack surface through its dependency chain.
*   Example: A critical vulnerability (e.g., Log4Shell-like) is discovered in a widely used library that Neon's Control Plane depends on. Attackers exploit this vulnerability to gain remote code execution on Neon's Control Plane servers, leading to widespread compromise.
*   Impact:  Compromise of core Neon infrastructure components, potential data breaches across all Neon projects, widespread denial of service, and significant disruption to the Neon service and its users.
*   Risk Severity: **High**
*   Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Maintain a detailed and up-to-date Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for all Neon components and their dependencies.
    *   Implement automated vulnerability scanning of all Neon components and their dependencies in CI/CD pipelines and production environments.
    *   Establish a rapid patch management process to quickly address and remediate identified dependency vulnerabilities.
    *   Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases relevant to Neon's dependencies.
    *   Consider using dependency pinning and reproducible builds to manage and control dependency versions and reduce supply chain risks.
