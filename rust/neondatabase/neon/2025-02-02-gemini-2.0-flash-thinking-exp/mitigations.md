# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for neondatabase/neon

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce TLS for all database connections](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_tls_for_all_database_connections.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Ensure your application's database connection library is configured to use TLS when connecting to Neon.
    2.  Verify that the connection string provided by Neon includes the `sslmode=require` parameter or equivalent setting. Neon typically enforces TLS by default, but explicit configuration is best practice.
    3.  Test the connection to Neon to confirm TLS is active.
    4.  Regularly review application configuration and connection strings to ensure TLS enforcement is maintained for Neon connections.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks (High Severity) - Interception of database credentials and sensitive data transmitted to and from Neon.
    *   Eavesdropping (High Severity) - Unauthorized viewing of sensitive data during transmission to and from Neon.
*   **Impact:**
    *   MITM attacks: High Risk Reduction - TLS encrypts the communication channel with Neon, making interception and decryption very difficult.
    *   Eavesdropping: High Risk Reduction - TLS ensures confidentiality of data in transit to and from Neon.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, enforced at the Neon connection level and within application configuration files. Neon-provided connection strings have TLS enabled.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  N/A - Currently enforced, but continuous validation in CI/CD pipelines would further strengthen this mitigation for Neon connections.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Connection Strings and Credentials for Neon using Secrets Management](./mitigation_strategies/secure_connection_strings_and_credentials_for_neon_using_secrets_management.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify all locations where Neon connection strings and database credentials are used in your application.
    2.  Replace hardcoded Neon connection strings and credentials with references to a secure secrets management system.
    3.  Configure your application to retrieve Neon connection strings and credentials from the secrets management system at runtime.
    4.  Implement strict access control policies for the secrets management system, specifically for Neon related secrets.
    5.  Regularly audit access logs of the secrets management system related to Neon secrets.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exposure of Neon Credentials in Source Code (High Severity) - Accidental or intentional exposure of Neon credentials in version control.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Exposure of Neon Credentials in Source Code: High Risk Reduction - Neon secrets are removed from code and stored securely.
    *   Credential Stuffing and Brute-Force Attacks: Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces likelihood of successful attacks on Neon due to credential leaks.
    *   Insider Threats: Medium Risk Reduction - Limits insider access to sensitive Neon credentials.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Application uses environment variables in some parts, but Neon connection strings are still partially managed in configuration files. Secrets management system is set up but not fully integrated for all Neon credentials.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Full integration of secrets manager for all Neon connection strings and database credentials across all application components, CI/CD pipelines, and development environments. Migrate existing environment variable usage for Neon to secrets manager.
