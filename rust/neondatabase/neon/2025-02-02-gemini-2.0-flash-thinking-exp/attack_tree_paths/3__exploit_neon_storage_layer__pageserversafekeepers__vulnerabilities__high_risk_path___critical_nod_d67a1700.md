### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 3. Exploit Neon Storage Layer (Pageserver/Safekeepers) Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]

This attack path focuses on directly exploiting vulnerabilities within the core storage layer of Neon, comprised of Pageservers and Safekeepers. Successful exploitation at this level can have catastrophic consequences, potentially leading to complete compromise of the database system and the data it holds.

#### 4.1. 3.1. Pageserver/Safekeeper Code Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]

This sub-path highlights vulnerabilities arising from flaws in the code of Pageserver and Safekeeper components. These are critical nodes because they represent direct weaknesses in the core logic and implementation of the storage layer.

##### 4.1.1. 3.1.1. Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities (Buffer overflows, use-after-free, etc.) [HIGH RISK PATH]

* **Description:** Memory corruption vulnerabilities occur when software incorrectly handles memory allocation or access. Common examples include:
    * **Buffer overflows:** Writing data beyond the allocated buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory regions.
    * **Use-after-free:** Accessing memory that has been previously freed, leading to unpredictable behavior and potential control-flow hijacking.
    * **Double-free:** Freeing the same memory region twice, also leading to memory corruption.
    * **Heap overflows:** Overflowing memory allocated on the heap.

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by crafting malicious inputs to Pageserver or Safekeeper that trigger the memory corruption. This input could be:
    * **Network requests:**  Maliciously crafted requests sent to Pageserver or Safekeeper APIs.
    * **Data stored in the storage layer:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities during the processing of data already present in the storage layer (though less likely for initial exploitation).
    * **Inter-process communication (IPC):** If Pageserver and Safekeepers communicate via IPC, vulnerabilities could be triggered through malicious IPC messages.

* **Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Unsafe memory handling in C/C++ code:** While Neon primarily uses Rust for Pageserver and Safekeepers, there might be dependencies or legacy code in C/C++ that could introduce memory safety issues. Even in Rust, `unsafe` blocks, if not carefully managed, can lead to memory unsafety.
    * **Lack of memory safety checks:** Insufficient bounds checking, missing validation of input sizes, or incorrect memory management practices in the code.
    * **Vulnerabilities introduced during development:**  Human error during coding, especially in complex features or performance optimizations, can inadvertently introduce memory corruption vulnerabilities.

* **Potential Impact:**
    * **Code Execution:**  Memory corruption can be leveraged to overwrite critical data structures or function pointers, allowing an attacker to gain control of the Pageserver or Safekeeper process and execute arbitrary code with the privileges of that process. This is the most severe outcome.
    * **Data Access and Corruption:**  Attackers might be able to read sensitive data from memory or corrupt data structures, leading to data breaches or data integrity issues.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):** Memory corruption can cause crashes and instability, leading to denial of service.
