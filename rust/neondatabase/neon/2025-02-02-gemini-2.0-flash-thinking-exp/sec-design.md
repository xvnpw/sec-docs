# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes we are trying to protect:

*   Data Storage and Retrieval: Ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of user data stored in Neon databases.
*   Database Service Availability: Maintaining continuous operation of the Neon platform and database services to avoid service disruptions.
*   User Authentication and Authorization: Securely verifying user identities and controlling access to Neon resources and data.
*   Branching and Versioning: Protecting the integrity and consistency of database branches and versions.
*   Control Plane Operations: Securing the management and orchestration of the Neon platform.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:

*   Customer Data: User data stored in Neon databases, including potentially sensitive personal information, financial data, application data, intellectual property. Sensitivity: High (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability).
*   Database Credentials: Passwords, API keys, and other credentials used to access Neon databases. Sensitivity: Critical (Confidentiality, Integrity).
*   Metadata: Information about Neon projects, databases, users, and configurations. Sensitivity: Medium (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability).
*   Logs and Metrics: Operational and security logs, performance metrics. Sensitivity: Medium (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability for security logs, Availability for operational logs).
*   Source Code: Neon platform source code. Sensitivity: Medium (Confidentiality, Integrity).
*   Infrastructure Configuration: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) configurations, Kubernetes manifests. Sensitivity: Medium (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability).

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   What is the specific cloud provider infrastructure used for Neon deployment (AWS, GCP, Azure)?
*   What Identity Provider is integrated for user authentication?
*   What specific monitoring and logging system is used?
*   What are the data retention policies for logs and backups?
*   What compliance certifications are relevant for Neon (e.g., SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA)?
*   What is the process for security incident response?
*   Are there specific security tools already in use (SAST, DAST, SCA, SIEM)?
*   What is the risk appetite of the organization regarding security vs. speed of development?

Assumptions:

*   Neon is deployed on a major cloud provider (AWS, GCP, or Azure).
*   Kubernetes is used for container orchestration.
*   A managed object storage service is used for the Storage Layer.
*   GitHub Actions is used for CI/CD.
*   Standard security best practices are generally followed, but there is room for improvement in implementing more proactive security controls.
*   The target audience includes developers and businesses who require a secure and reliable database service.
*   Data confidentiality, integrity, and availability are all high priorities.
