# Attack Tree Analysis for neondatabase/neon

Objective: Compromise application using Neon database by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within Neon itself.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
* Compromise Application Using Neon Weaknesses
    * AND - **[CRITICAL]** Exploit Neon Control Plane Vulnerabilities
        * OR - **[CRITICAL]** Unauthorized Access to Neon Control Plane
            * **Leakage of Neon API Keys/Credentials**
            * **Exploiting Weak Authentication/Authorization Mechanisms in Neon API**
    * AND - **[CRITICAL]** Exploit Neon Data Plane Vulnerabilities
        * OR - **[CRITICAL]** Data Breach through Neon-Specific SQL Injection or Data Manipulation
            * **Bypassing Row-Level Security (RLS) or other access controls within Neon**
    * AND - **[CRITICAL]** Exploit Client-Neon Interaction Vulnerabilities
        * OR - **[CRITICAL]** Connection String Hijacking or Leakage
            * **Leaking Neon connection string through application code, logs, or configuration files**
```


## Attack Tree Path: [Leakage of Neon API Keys/Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/leakage_of_neon_api_keyscredentials.md)

**Why High-Risk:** High Impact (full control of Neon control plane), Medium Likelihood (common misconfiguration).
    * **Potential Consequences:**
        * Unauthorized creation or deletion of Neon resources (tenants, branches).
        * Access to sensitive data within Neon databases.
        * Modification or deletion of data.
        * Denial of service by exhausting resources or terminating services.
    * **Key Mitigations:**
        * Securely store API keys using dedicated secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
        * Avoid hardcoding API keys in application code or configuration files.
        * Implement strict access controls and audit logging for API key management.
        * Regularly rotate API keys.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Weak Authentication/Authorization Mechanisms in Neon API](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_weak_authenticationauthorization_mechanisms_in_neon_api.md)

**Why High-Risk:** High Impact (full control of Neon control plane), Medium Likelihood (potential for implementation flaws).
    * **Potential Consequences:**
        * Same as "Leakage of Neon API Keys/Credentials".
    * **Key Mitigations:**
        * Adhere strictly to Neon's recommended authentication and authorization practices.
        * Implement robust input validation and sanitization for API requests.
        * Enforce the principle of least privilege for API access.
        * Regularly audit and penetration test the API endpoints.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypassing Row-Level Security (RLS) or other access controls within Neon](./attack_tree_paths/bypassing_row-level_security__rls__or_other_access_controls_within_neon.md)

**Why High-Risk:** High Impact (unauthorized access to sensitive data), Medium Likelihood (complexity of RLS configuration can lead to errors).
    * **Potential Consequences:**
        * Access to data that the application or specific users should not be able to see.
        * Data breaches and exposure of confidential information.
        * Potential for data modification or deletion based on the bypassed access.
    * **Key Mitigations:**
        * Thoroughly test and audit RLS policies and other database-level access controls.
        * Ensure RLS policies are correctly applied and cover all necessary scenarios.
        * Regularly review and update RLS policies as application requirements change.
        * Consider using parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities that could bypass RLS.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leaking Neon connection string through application code, logs, or configuration files](./attack_tree_paths/leaking_neon_connection_string_through_application_code__logs__or_configuration_files.md)

**Why High-Risk:** High Impact (direct access to the database), Medium Likelihood (common oversight).
    * **Potential Consequences:**
        * Full read and write access to the Neon database.
        * Data breaches and exfiltration of sensitive information.
        * Data modification or deletion.
        * Potential for further lateral movement if the database server is accessible from other systems.
    * **Key Mitigations:**
        * Never hardcode connection strings in application code.
        * Store connection strings securely using environment variables or dedicated secrets management solutions.
        * Ensure that application logs and configuration files do not inadvertently expose connection strings.
        * Implement strict access controls on servers and systems where connection strings are stored.
