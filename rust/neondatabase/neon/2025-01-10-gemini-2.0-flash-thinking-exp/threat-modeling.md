# Threat Model Analysis for neondatabase/neon

## Threat: [Exposed Neon Connection String](./threats/exposed_neon_connection_string.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to the Neon connection string, which includes credentials. This could happen through various means, such as finding it in the application's codebase, configuration files, environment variables, or through a compromised developer machine. With the connection string, the attacker can directly connect to the Neon database.

**Impact:** Full read and write access to the database, allowing the attacker to steal sensitive data, modify or delete data, and potentially disrupt the application's functionality.

**Affected Neon Component:** Connection handling within the application and **Neon's authentication system**.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Utilize secrets management solutions to securely store and access connection strings.
*   Avoid hardcoding connection strings in the application code.
*   Use environment variables with restricted access to store connection strings.
*   Implement proper access controls on configuration files and environment variable storage.
*   Regularly review where connection strings are stored and accessed.

## Threat: [Compromised Neon API Keys](./threats/compromised_neon_api_keys.md)

**Description:** An attacker obtains valid Neon API keys, which are used for managing Neon projects and resources programmatically. This could occur through similar methods as connection string exposure. With compromised API keys, the attacker can perform actions within the Neon platform on behalf of the legitimate user or application.

**Impact:** Ability to create, modify, or delete **Neon projects, branches, and databases** associated with the application. This can lead to data loss, service disruption, and financial impact.

**Affected Neon Component:** **Neon Control Plane API**, **Neon authentication and authorization mechanisms**.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Treat Neon API keys as highly sensitive secrets.
*   Store API keys securely using secrets management solutions.
*   Rotate API keys regularly.
*   Restrict access to API keys based on the principle of least privilege.
*   Monitor API key usage for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Data Exposure through Publicly Accessible Branches (Misconfiguration)](./threats/data_exposure_through_publicly_accessible_branches__misconfiguration_.md)

**Description:** Due to misconfiguration or a lapse in security practices, a **Neon branch** containing sensitive application data is inadvertently made publicly accessible. This could allow unauthorized individuals to access and potentially exfiltrate the data.

**Impact:** Significant data breach, violation of privacy regulations, reputational damage.

**Affected Neon Component:** **Neon access control mechanisms**, **Neon project and branch settings**.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict access controls and permissions for Neon projects and branches.
*   Regularly review and audit access settings for Neon resources.
*   Educate developers and operations teams on the importance of secure configuration.
*   Utilize Neon's features for managing access and visibility of branches.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Neon's Infrastructure Leading to Data Breach](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_neon's_infrastructure_leading_to_data_breach.md)

**Description:** Although managed by Neon, vulnerabilities in **Neon's underlying infrastructure** (e.g., in the Pageserver or Safekeepers) could be exploited by sophisticated attackers to gain unauthorized access to stored data.

**Impact:** Large-scale data breach, potential compromise of the entire Neon platform.

**Affected Neon Component:** **Neon Pageserver**, **Neon Safekeepers**, **Neon's internal infrastructure**.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Stay informed about Neon's security practices and any reported vulnerabilities.
*   Follow Neon's recommendations for securing your application's interaction with their platform.
*   Implement strong application-level security measures as a defense-in-depth strategy.
*   Consider data encryption at rest and in transit as an additional safeguard.

## Threat: [Compromised Neon User Accounts](./threats/compromised_neon_user_accounts.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to legitimate **Neon user accounts** through techniques like password guessing, phishing, or credential stuffing. With compromised accounts, they can perform actions within the Neon platform based on the permissions of the compromised user.

**Impact:** Unauthorized management of Neon resources, potential data manipulation or deletion, creation of malicious resources.

**Affected Neon Component:** **Neon authentication system**, **Neon authorization mechanisms**.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enforce strong password policies for Neon user accounts.
*   Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all Neon users.
*   Regularly review and manage user permissions within the Neon platform.
*   Educate users about phishing and other social engineering attacks.
*   Monitor user login activity for suspicious patterns.
