# Attack Surface Analysis for neondatabase/neon

## Attack Surface: [Connection String Exposure](./attack_surfaces/connection_string_exposure.md)

- **Description:** Sensitive information like database credentials (username, password, hostname) required to access Neon's compute endpoints, being exposed.
    - **How Neon Contributes to Attack Surface:** Neon requires a connection string to access its compute endpoints. The security of this string directly impacts the security of the Neon database.
    - **Example:** A developer hardcodes the Neon connection string in a Git repository, which is then accidentally made public.
    - **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the Neon database, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service.
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Utilize environment variables or secure configuration management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to store Neon connection strings.
        - Avoid hardcoding credentials directly in the application code.
        - Implement proper access controls and permissions for configuration files containing Neon connection details.
        - Regularly rotate Neon database credentials.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection via Compute Endpoints](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_via_compute_endpoints.md)

- **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's code where user-supplied data is directly incorporated into SQL queries executed against Neon's compute endpoints.
    - **How Neon Contributes to Attack Surface:** Neon's compute endpoints are the direct interface for executing SQL queries. Improper handling of user input before sending queries to Neon creates this vulnerability.
    - **Example:** A user enters malicious SQL code in a form field, which is then used in a query to Neon, allowing the attacker to bypass authentication or extract sensitive data.
    - **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion within the Neon database. Potential for privilege escalation if the database user has elevated permissions within Neon.
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - **Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements** when interacting with Neon's compute endpoints. This prevents user input from being interpreted as SQL code.
        - Implement input validation and sanitization on the application side *before* constructing queries to Neon.
        - Follow the principle of least privilege for database user accounts within Neon.
        - Utilize an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) that handles query building and parameterization securely for Neon.

## Attack Surface: [API Key Compromise (Neon Control Plane)](./attack_surfaces/api_key_compromise__neon_control_plane_.md)

- **Description:** Exposure or theft of Neon API keys used for managing Neon projects, branches, and other resources.
    - **How Neon Contributes to Attack Surface:** Neon's management API relies on API keys for authentication and authorization. Compromise of these keys grants unauthorized control over the associated Neon resources.
    - **Example:** A Neon API key is accidentally committed to a public code repository or stored insecurely on a developer's machine.
    - **Impact:** Unauthorized modification or deletion of Neon resources (databases, branches), potentially leading to data loss, service disruption, and financial implications related to the Neon service.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Store Neon API keys securely using secrets management tools.
        - Implement strict access controls for accessing and managing Neon API keys.
        - Regularly rotate Neon API keys.
        - Monitor Neon API key usage for suspicious activity.
        - Utilize Neon's IAM features to grant granular permissions based on the principle of least privilege for API key usage.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion on Compute Endpoints](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_on_compute_endpoints.md)

- **Description:**  Maliciously crafted or excessive requests targeting Neon's compute endpoints, leading to performance degradation or denial of service of the database.
    - **How Neon Contributes to Attack Surface:** Neon's compute endpoints are the processing units for database queries. Abuse of these endpoints can directly impact the availability and performance of the Neon database.
    - **Example:** An attacker sends a large number of computationally expensive queries to the Neon compute endpoint, causing it to become unresponsive and impacting the application's ability to access the database.
    - **Impact:** Application downtime, performance degradation due to Neon database unavailability, and potential financial losses due to service disruption.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Implement rate limiting on application endpoints that interact with Neon.
        - Optimize database queries for performance to reduce the load on Neon's compute endpoints.
        - Implement proper pagination and filtering for data retrieval from Neon.
        - Monitor Neon compute endpoint resource utilization and set up alerts for unusual activity.
        - Consider using connection pooling to manage database connections to Neon efficiently.
