Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving MeiliSearch, with high and critical severity:

*   **Unauthenticated Public Search API Access**
    *   **Description:** The MeiliSearch instance's search API is accessible without any authentication or authorization requirements.
    *   **How MeiliSearch Contributes:** MeiliSearch, by default, can be configured to allow unauthenticated access to its search endpoints. If not properly secured, this becomes a direct entry point.
    *   **Example:** An attacker can send arbitrary search queries to the MeiliSearch instance to enumerate indexed data, potentially revealing sensitive information that was not intended to be publicly accessible.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential exposure of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), business-sensitive data leaks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement API key-based authentication for the search API.
        *   Restrict access to the MeiliSearch instance at the network level (e.g., using firewalls).
        *   Carefully review the data being indexed and ensure no sensitive information is inadvertently exposed through search.

*   **Admin API Exposure with Weak or Default Credentials**
    *   **Description:** The MeiliSearch admin API, which allows for full control over the instance, is accessible with default API keys or without strong authentication.
    *   **How MeiliSearch Contributes:** MeiliSearch uses API keys for authentication. If the default master key is not changed or if API keys are not managed securely, it creates a significant vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the default master API key and can then create, update, or delete indexes, modify settings, and potentially exfiltrate all indexed data.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the MeiliSearch instance, data loss, data manipulation, denial of service, potential for further attacks on the application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Immediately change the default master API key upon installation.
        *   Implement a robust API key management system, including secure generation, storage, and rotation.
        *   Restrict access to the admin API to only authorized IP addresses or networks.
        *   Consider using more granular API keys with limited permissions for specific tasks.

*   **Data Injection through Indexing**
    *   **Description:**  Malicious data is injected into MeiliSearch during the indexing process, potentially leading to vulnerabilities when this data is retrieved and displayed by the application.
    *   **How MeiliSearch Contributes:** MeiliSearch indexes the data provided to it. If the application doesn't sanitize data before indexing, MeiliSearch will store and serve the potentially malicious content.
    *   **Example:** An attacker injects a document containing a malicious script. When a user searches for and views this document through the application, the script is executed in their browser (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS).
    *   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), potential for other injection attacks depending on how the application uses the indexed data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the application side *before* indexing data into MeiliSearch.
        *   Consider using MeiliSearch's features for data transformation or filtering during indexing to further sanitize data.
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) in the application to mitigate the impact of potential XSS vulnerabilities.
