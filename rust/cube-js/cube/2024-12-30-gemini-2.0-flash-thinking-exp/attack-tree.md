**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**Critical Node: Exploit API Gateway Vulnerabilities**

*   **Attack Vector: Bypass Authentication/Authorization (High-Risk Path)**
    *   Description: Attackers attempt to circumvent the mechanisms designed to verify their identity and permissions.
    *   Specific Techniques:
        *   Exploiting weak authentication mechanisms: This includes using default credentials, brute-forcing weak passwords, or exploiting vulnerabilities in custom authentication logic.
        *   Exploiting authorization flaws in the Cube.js API: This involves finding loopholes in how Cube.js grants access to data and functionality, potentially allowing unauthorized access by manipulating API requests or exploiting logic errors.
    *   Why it's High-Risk: Successful bypass grants attackers access to sensitive data and functionality, enabling further attacks.

*   **Attack Vector: Inject Malicious Queries (GraphQL Injection) (High-Risk Path)**
    *   Description: Attackers craft malicious GraphQL queries to manipulate the data access layer and potentially execute unintended database operations.
    *   Specific Techniques:
        *   Crafting malicious GraphQL queries to extract sensitive data: This involves constructing queries that bypass intended data access restrictions and retrieve confidential information from the underlying database.
        *   Crafting malicious GraphQL queries to modify data (if mutations are exposed): If GraphQL mutations are enabled and not adequately protected, attackers could potentially alter or delete data within the database.
    *   Why it's High-Risk: Successful injection can lead to critical data breaches, data corruption, or even complete database compromise.

**Critical Node: Exploit Underlying Database via Cube.js**

*   **Attack Vector: Leverage Insufficient Query Sanitization in Cube.js (High-Risk Path)**
    *   Description: Attackers exploit vulnerabilities where Cube.js fails to properly sanitize user inputs before constructing database queries, allowing for the injection of malicious SQL code.
    *   Specific Techniques:
        *   Crafting queries that bypass sanitization and execute malicious SQL: This involves carefully constructing SQL commands within user inputs that are not properly escaped or filtered by Cube.js, leading to the execution of arbitrary SQL on the database.
    *   Why it's High-Risk: Successful SQL injection can result in complete database compromise, including data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Configuration Issues**

*   **Attack Vector: Access Sensitive Configuration Data (High-Risk Path)**
    *   Description: Attackers attempt to gain access to configuration files or environment variables where sensitive information is stored.
    *   Specific Techniques:
        *   Retrieving API keys, database credentials, or other secrets from Cube.js configuration: This can involve exploiting file access vulnerabilities, accessing misconfigured servers, or leveraging information disclosure flaws.
    *   Why it's High-Risk: Access to sensitive configuration data can provide attackers with credentials and keys necessary to compromise other systems and data.

*   **Attack Vector: Leverage Default or Weak Credentials for Cube.js Admin Interface (if enabled) (High-Risk Path)**
    *   Description: Attackers attempt to log in to the Cube.js administrative interface using default or easily guessable credentials.
    *   Specific Techniques:
        *   Attempting to log in with common default usernames and passwords.
        *   Using brute-force or dictionary attacks to guess weak passwords.
    *   Why it's High-Risk: Successful login grants attackers administrative control over the Cube.js instance, allowing them to reconfigure settings, access data, or potentially pivot to other systems.
