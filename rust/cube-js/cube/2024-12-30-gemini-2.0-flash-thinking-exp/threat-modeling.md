### High and Critical Cube.js Specific Threats

Here's an updated list of high and critical threats that directly involve Cube.js:

1. **Threat:** Exposure of Data Source Credentials
    *   **Description:** An attacker might gain access to configuration files or environment variables where database or API credentials used *by Cube.js* are stored. They could then use these credentials to directly access and manipulate the underlying data sources, bypassing Cube.js entirely. This threat is directly related to how Cube.js manages and utilizes these credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the underlying data sources, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Data Source Connection Module (within Cube.js server).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize secure secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
        *   Avoid storing credentials directly in configuration files or environment variables.
        *   Implement proper access controls on configuration files and secret stores.
        *   Encrypt sensitive configuration data at rest.

2. **Threat:** Unauthorized Data Access via Cube.js GraphQL/REST API
    *   **Description:** An attacker could exploit missing or weak authentication and authorization mechanisms *in the Cube.js API layer* to query and retrieve sensitive data without proper authorization. They might enumerate endpoints or craft specific queries to access restricted information exposed through Cube.js.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive business data, potentially leading to financial loss, reputational damage, or compliance violations.
    *   **Affected Component:** API Layer (GraphQL and REST endpoints).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust authentication mechanisms (e.g., JWT, API keys) *within Cube.js*.
        *   Enforce fine-grained authorization rules based on user roles or permissions *within Cube.js's security context*.
        *   Regularly review and update access control policies *configured in Cube.js*.
        *   Disable or restrict access to the Cube.js Playground in production environments.

3. **Threat:** Query Injection through Cube.js API
    *   **Description:** An attacker could craft malicious queries through the *Cube.js API* that bypass intended restrictions or inject code into the underlying database queries. This might be possible if *Cube.js* doesn't properly sanitize or validate inputs or if there are vulnerabilities in its query generation logic.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data manipulation, or potentially even remote code execution on the database server.
    *   **Affected Component:** Query Processing Engine.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Cube.js updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
        *   Carefully review and test any custom data source integrations or pre-aggregations *within Cube.js* for potential injection vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement strong input validation on any user-provided parameters used *in Cube.js queries*.
        *   Adhere to secure coding practices when extending *Cube.js functionality*.

4. **Threat:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Custom Data Source Integrations
    *   **Description:** If custom data source integrations are used *within Cube.js*, an attacker could potentially exploit vulnerabilities to make arbitrary requests from the *Cube.js server* to internal or external resources. This could be achieved by manipulating input parameters used in the integration logic *within Cube.js*.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of internal resources, potential compromise of other systems, or data exfiltration.
    *   **Affected Component:** Custom Data Source Integration Module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully review and sanitize any user-provided input used in custom data source integrations *within Cube.js*.
        *   Implement strict allow-lists for outbound requests from the *Cube.js server*.
        *   Avoid using user-provided data directly in constructing URLs for external requests *within Cube.js integrations*.

5. **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Cube.js Dependencies
    *   **Description:** An attacker could exploit known vulnerabilities in the third-party libraries and dependencies used *by Cube.js* to compromise the *Cube.js server* or the application.
    *   **Impact:** Range of impacts depending on the specific vulnerability, potentially including remote code execution, denial of service, or data breaches.
    *   **Affected Component:** Entire Cube.js Server (due to dependency vulnerabilities).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update Cube.js and its dependencies to the latest versions.
        *   Utilize dependency scanning tools to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Monitor security advisories for Cube.js and its dependencies.
