*   **Attack Surface:** Code Injection via Data Model Definitions
    *   **Description:** Malicious actors with the ability to modify Cube.js data model definitions can inject arbitrary JavaScript code.
    *   **How Cube Contributes:** Cube.js uses JavaScript to define data models, including measures, dimensions, and joins. This allows for dynamic code execution based on these definitions.
    *   **Example:** An attacker with access to the Cube.js data model configuration injects a `require('child_process').exec('rm -rf /')` call within a measure definition. When this measure is accessed, the malicious code is executed on the Cube.js server.
    *   **Impact:** Critical - Remote code execution on the Cube.js server, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data breaches, and denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly control access to Cube.js data model configuration files and interfaces.
        *   Implement code review processes for all changes to data model definitions.
        *   Consider using a more restricted or sandboxed environment for Cube.js if dynamic code execution is a significant concern.
        *   Employ infrastructure-level security measures to limit the impact of a compromised Cube.js instance.

*   **Attack Surface:** Insecure Data Source Credentials Management
    *   **Description:** Sensitive credentials required for Cube.js to connect to data sources are stored insecurely.
    *   **How Cube Contributes:** Cube.js needs credentials (database passwords, API keys, etc.) to access and query data sources.
    *   **Example:** Database credentials for the primary data warehouse are stored in plain text within the Cube.js configuration file or environment variables without proper encryption or secret management.
    *   **Impact:** Critical - Unauthorized access to underlying data sources, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, and service disruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize secure secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) to store and manage data source credentials.
        *   Avoid storing credentials directly in configuration files or environment variables.
        *   Implement the principle of least privilege for data source access.
        *   Regularly rotate data source credentials.

*   **Attack Surface:** GraphQL Injection/SQL Injection via Cube Query Language
    *   **Description:** Attackers can craft malicious queries through the Cube.js API that are not properly sanitized and are passed down to the underlying data source, leading to injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Cube Contributes:** Cube.js translates user queries into database-specific queries. If this translation or the underlying data source interaction is not secure, injection attacks are possible.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a GraphQL query that, when translated by Cube.js, results in a malicious SQL query like `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' OR '1'='1';` bypassing authentication.
    *   **Impact:** High - Unauthorized data access, data manipulation, and potentially remote code execution on the database server, depending on the database permissions and configuration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize parameterized queries or prepared statements in the underlying data sources where possible.
        *   Implement strict input validation on any user-provided data that influences Cube.js queries.
        *   Regularly review and audit generated SQL/API calls for potential injection vulnerabilities.
        *   Apply the principle of least privilege to database user permissions used by Cube.js.

*   **Attack Surface:** Authentication and Authorization Bypass
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in Cube.js's authentication or authorization mechanisms allow attackers to bypass security controls and access data or functionalities they are not authorized for.
    *   **How Cube Contributes:** Cube.js implements its own authentication and authorization layers to control access to its API and data.
    *   **Example:** A flaw in the JWT token verification process allows an attacker to forge a valid token and gain access to the Cube.js API without proper credentials.
    *   **Impact:** High - Unauthorized access to sensitive data, ability to execute unauthorized queries, and potential for data manipulation or deletion.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure strong and well-tested authentication mechanisms are in place (e.g., robust JWT validation, OAuth 2.0).
        *   Implement fine-grained authorization controls based on roles and permissions.
        *   Regularly audit and review authentication and authorization logic for vulnerabilities.
        *   Follow security best practices for session management and token handling.
