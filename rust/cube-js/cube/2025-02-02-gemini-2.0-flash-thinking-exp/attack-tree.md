## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Cube.js API Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_cube_js_api_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target weaknesses in the Cube.js API, which is the primary interface for data access and manipulation. Successful exploitation can lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, and denial of service.

    *   **1.1. GraphQL Injection Attacks [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in how Cube.js handles GraphQL queries. Attackers inject malicious GraphQL syntax to manipulate queries, bypass security checks, or extract sensitive data.
            *   **1.1.1. Parameter Manipulation [CRITICAL]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Modifying parameters within GraphQL queries to alter the intended query logic.
                *   **Example:** Changing filter values, pagination parameters, or field selections to access data outside of authorized scope or extract more data than intended.
            *   **1.1.4. Field/Argument Injection [CRITICAL]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious code or queries into GraphQL fields or arguments. This is possible if input validation is insufficient and the application dynamically constructs queries based on user input.
                *   **Example:** Injecting SQL fragments or NoSQL operators into fields that are used in database queries, leading to database injection vulnerabilities.

    *   **1.2. Authentication and Authorization Bypass [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Circumventing or weakening the mechanisms that control access to the Cube.js API. Successful bypass allows unauthorized users to access data and functionalities.
            *   **1.2.1. Weak Authentication Mechanisms [CRITICAL]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting poorly implemented or configured authentication methods. This includes using default credentials, weak passwords, or insecure authentication protocols.
                *   **Example:** Brute-forcing weak passwords, exploiting default API keys, or bypassing insecure custom authentication implementations.
            *   **1.2.2. Authorization Logic Flaws [CRITICAL]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Identifying and exploiting errors in the authorization logic that determines user permissions. Flaws can allow users to access resources or perform actions they are not supposed to.
                *   **Example:** Exploiting logic errors in role-based access control (RBAC) implementation, permission checks that are not consistently applied, or flaws in attribute-based access control (ABAC).
            *   **1.2.4. API Key/Token Compromise (If API keys are used for Cube.js access) [CRITICAL]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Obtaining valid API keys or tokens that are used to authenticate with the Cube.js API. Compromised keys grant full API access to the attacker.
                *   **Example:** Stealing API keys from insecure storage (e.g., hardcoded in code, exposed in client-side code), guessing weak API keys, or intercepting API keys during transmission.
