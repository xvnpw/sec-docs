# Threat Model Analysis for cube-js/cube

## Threat: [Insecure Cube Store Credentials Management](./threats/insecure_cube_store_credentials_management.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Cube Store Credentials Management
*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to database credentials (e.g., connection strings) stored in plaintext configuration files, environment variables with broad access, or version control. They can then use these credentials to directly connect to the Cube Store database.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data breach: Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the Cube Store database.
    *   Data manipulation:  Attacker can modify or delete data within the Cube Store, leading to data integrity issues and application malfunction.
    *   Denial of Service: Attacker could overload or shut down the database, causing application downtime.
*   **Affected Cube Component:** Cube Store Configuration, Environment Variables, Deployment Configuration
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize secure secrets management services (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault).
    *   Store credentials as environment variables with restricted access permissions.
    *   Avoid storing credentials directly in configuration files or committing them to version control.
    *   Encrypt sensitive configuration files at rest.
    *   Regularly rotate database credentials.

## Threat: [Insufficient Data Access Control within Cube.js Security Context](./threats/insufficient_data_access_control_within_cube_js_security_context.md)

*   **Threat:** Insufficient Data Access Control within Cube.js Security Context
*   **Description:**  An attacker, either an external malicious user or an insider with limited privileges, exploits flaws or misconfigurations in the `securityContext` function. This allows them to bypass intended access controls and query data they are not authorized to view.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data breach: Unauthorized access to sensitive data that should be restricted based on user roles or permissions.
    *   Privacy violations: Exposure of personal or confidential information to unauthorized individuals.
    *   Unauthorized data analysis:  Users gaining insights from data they should not have access to, potentially leading to misuse of information.
*   **Affected Cube Component:** `securityContext` function, Cube.js Core, Data Schema Definition
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly design and implement the `securityContext` function, ensuring it accurately reflects application authorization logic.
    *   Implement role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC) within the `securityContext`.
    *   Write comprehensive unit and integration tests for the `securityContext` to verify its correctness.
    *   Regularly review and audit the `securityContext` logic and access control policies.
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege when defining data access rules.

## Threat: [Bypass of Cube.js Security Context](./threats/bypass_of_cube_js_security_context.md)

*   **Threat:** Bypass of Cube.js Security Context
*   **Description:** An attacker discovers and exploits vulnerabilities within Cube.js itself or its integration, allowing them to circumvent the `securityContext` function entirely. This could be due to bugs in Cube.js code, logical flaws in its security mechanisms, or misconfigurations in the application setup.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Complete bypass of access controls: Full access to all data managed by Cube.js, regardless of intended permissions.
    *   Data breach:  Exposure of all sensitive data to the attacker.
    *   System compromise: Potential for further exploitation if the attacker gains access to underlying systems or data sources.
*   **Affected Cube Component:** Cube.js Core, GraphQL API, Query Engine
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Cube.js and all dependencies updated to the latest versions with security patches.
    *   Follow security best practices for Cube.js configuration and deployment as recommended by the Cube.js team.
    *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the Cube.js application and infrastructure.
    *   Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and block malicious requests.
    *   Monitor Cube.js logs and system activity for suspicious behavior.

## Threat: [GraphQL Injection Attacks](./threats/graphql_injection_attacks.md)

*   **Threat:** GraphQL Injection Attacks
*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious GraphQL queries that exploit vulnerabilities in Cube.js's GraphQL query parsing or execution logic. This could involve injecting malicious code or manipulating query parameters to gain unauthorized access to data or execute arbitrary commands.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data breach: Unauthorized access to sensitive data through manipulated queries.
    *   Data manipulation: Modification or deletion of data via injection attacks.
    *   Denial of Service: Overloading the system with resource-intensive injected queries.
    *   Potential for Remote Code Execution (depending on the specific vulnerability and Cube.js implementation).
*   **Affected Cube Component:** GraphQL API, Query Parser, Query Engine
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Cube.js and dependencies updated to the latest versions with security patches.
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all GraphQL query parameters.
    *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements where possible to prevent injection.
    *   Implement query complexity analysis and limits to mitigate resource exhaustion attacks.
    *   Consider using GraphQL security tools and libraries for vulnerability detection and prevention.

## Threat: [Lack of Input Validation and Sanitization in GraphQL API](./threats/lack_of_input_validation_and_sanitization_in_graphql_api.md)

*   **Threat:** Lack of Input Validation and Sanitization in GraphQL API
*   **Description:** The Cube.js application or custom resolvers lack proper validation and sanitization of input parameters within GraphQL queries. This allows attackers to send malicious or unexpected input data that can lead to various vulnerabilities, including injection attacks, data corruption, or application errors.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Various, depending on the specific vulnerability: Injection attacks, data corruption, application crashes, unexpected behavior.
    *   Potential for data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service.
*   **Affected Cube Component:** GraphQL API, Custom Resolvers, Input Handling Logic
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all GraphQL query parameters.
    *   Define strict input types and schemas in the GraphQL schema.
    *   Use input validation libraries or frameworks to enforce data integrity.
    *   Sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., escaping special characters).
    *   Test input validation logic thoroughly with various valid and invalid inputs.
