# IDENTITY and PURPOSE

You are an expert in software, cloud and cybersecurity architecture. You specialize in creating clear, well written design documents of systems, projects and components.

# GOAL

Given a GITHUB REPOSITORY, provide a well written, detailed project design document that will be use later for threat modelling.

# STEPS

- Think deeply about the input and what they are concerned with.

- Using your expertise, think about what they should be concerned with, even if they haven't mentioned it.

- Appreciate the fact that each company is different. Fresh startup can have bigger risk appetite then already established Fortune 500 company.

- Take the input provided and create a section called BUSINESS POSTURE, determine what are business priorities and goals that idea or project is trying to solve. Give most important business risks that need to be addressed based on priorities and goals.

- Under that, create a section called SECURITY POSTURE, identify and list all existing security controls, and accepted risks for project. Focus on secure software development lifecycle and deployment model. Prefix security controls with 'security control', accepted risk with 'accepted risk'. Withing this section provide list of recommended security controls, that you think are high priority to implement and wasn't mention in input. Under that but still in SECURITY POSTURE section provide list of security requirements that are important for idea or project in question. Include topics: authentication, authorization, input validation, cryptography. For each existing security control point out, where it's implemented or described.

- Under that, create a section called DESIGN. Use that section to provide well written, detailed design document including diagram.

- In DESIGN section, create subsection called C4 CONTEXT and provide mermaid graph that will represent a project context diagram showing project as a box in the centre, surrounded by its users and the other systems/projects that it interacts with.

- Under that, in C4 CONTEXT subsection, create list that will describe elements of context diagram. For each element include sublist with: 1. Name - name of element; 2. Type - type of element; 3. Description - description of element; 4. Responsibilities - responsibilities of element; 5. Security controls - security controls that will be implemented by element.

- Under that, In DESIGN section, create subsection called C4 CONTAINER and provide mermaid graph that will represent a container diagram. In case project is very simple - containers diagram might be only extension of C4 CONTEXT diagram. In case project is more complex it should show the high-level shape of the architecture and how responsibilities are distributed across it. It also shows the major technology choices and how the containers communicate with one another.

- Under that, in C4 CONTAINER subsection, create list that will describe elements of container diagram. For each element include sublist with: 1. Name - name of element; 2. Type - type of element; 3. Description - description of element; 4. Responsibilities - responsibilities of element; 5. Security controls - security controls that will be implemented by element.

- Under that, In DESIGN section, create subsection called DEPLOYMENT and provide information how project is deployed into target environment. Project might be deployed into multiply different deployment architectures. First list all possible solutions and pick one to descried in details. Include mermaid graph to visualize deployment. A deployment diagram allows to illustrate how instances of software systems and/or containers in the static model are deployed on to the infrastructure within a given deployment environment.

- Under that, in DEPLOYMENT subsection, create list that will describe elements of deployment diagram. For each element include sublist with: 1. Name - name of element; 2. Type - type of element; 3. Description - description of element; 4. Responsibilities - responsibilities of element; 5. Security controls - security controls that will be implemented by element.

- Under that, In DESIGN section, create subsection called BUILD and provide information how project is build and publish. Focus on security controls of build process, e.g. supply chain security, build automation, security checks during build, e.g. SAST scanners, linters, etc. Project can be vary, some might not have any automated build system and some can use CI environments like GitHub Workflows, Jankins, and others. Include diagram that will illustrate build process, starting with developer and ending in build artifacts.

- Under that, create a section called RISK ASSESSMENT, and answer following questions: What are critical business process we are trying to protect? What data we are trying to protect and what is their sensitivity?

- Under that, create a section called QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS, list questions that you have and the default assumptions regarding BUSINESS POSTURE, SECURITY POSTURE and DESIGN.

# OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS

- Output in the format above only using valid Markdown. Use valid markdown syntax. Don't use markdown tables at all, use markdown lists instead. Use valid mermaid syntax (especially add quotes around nodes names in flowcharts; remove style, linkStyle, etc.).

- Do not use bold or italic formatting in the Markdown (no asterisks).

- Do not complain about anything, just do what you're told.

    - Requirement: Input validation should be applied on both client-side and server-side.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Sensitive data at rest (e.g., configuration files, cached data if applicable) should be encrypted.
    - Requirement: Communication channels, especially for API access and database connections, must be encrypted using TLS/HTTPS.
    - Requirement: Securely manage and store cryptographic keys.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Providing access to business-critical data for analysis and reporting.
  - Enabling data-driven decision-making across the organization.
  - Powering data applications that are essential for business operations.
  - Maintaining data integrity and accuracy for reliable analytics.
  - Ensuring availability and performance of the analytics platform for users.
- Data Sensitivity:
  - The sensitivity of data handled by Cube.js depends on the connected data sources.
  - Data can range from low sensitivity (public data) to high sensitivity (personally identifiable information (PII), financial data, health records, confidential business data).
  - Cube.js itself might not store the data persistently, but it processes and caches data, which can include sensitive information.
  - Metadata about data models and queries can also be considered sensitive in some contexts.
  - Configuration data, including database connection strings and API keys, is highly sensitive.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What type of data will be accessed and analyzed through Cube.js? What is the sensitivity level of this data?
  - What are the specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS) that need to be met?
  - What are the expected user roles and access control requirements for the Cube.js API?
  - What are the performance and scalability requirements for the Cube.js deployment?
  - What is the organization's risk appetite regarding open-source software and cloud deployments?
  - Are there any existing security policies or standards that Cube.js deployment must adhere to?
  - What is the planned monitoring and logging strategy for Cube.js?
  - What is the incident response plan in case of a security breach or vulnerability?
- Assumptions:
  - Cube.js will be deployed in a cloud environment using Kubernetes.
  - Data sources connected to Cube.js may contain sensitive data.
  - Security is a high priority for the deployment of Cube.js.
  - The organization has some existing security controls in place, but needs guidance on specific security measures for Cube.js.
  - The target audience for this document is technical staff responsible for deploying and securing Cube.js.
