#### 1.2.1. Weak Authentication Mechanisms [CRITICAL]

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting poorly implemented or configured authentication methods used to verify the identity of users or applications accessing the Cube.js API. This includes weaknesses in password policies, authentication protocols, and custom authentication implementations.

**Cube.js Specific Vulnerabilities & Examples:**

*   **Default Credentials:**  Using default usernames and passwords for Cube.js administrative interfaces or database connections.  *Example:*  Failing to change default credentials for database users used by Cube.js, allowing attackers to gain direct database access.
*   **Weak Passwords:**  Allowing users to set easily guessable passwords. *Example:*  Lack of password complexity requirements or password rotation policies for Cube.js users (if user management is implemented directly or integrated).
*   **Insecure Authentication Protocols:**  Using outdated or insecure authentication protocols. *Example:*  Relying solely on HTTP Basic Authentication over unencrypted HTTP, exposing credentials in transit.
*   **Missing Authentication:**  Failing to implement any authentication mechanism for critical Cube.js API endpoints. *Example:*  Exposing Cube.js API endpoints without requiring any form of authentication, allowing anyone to query data.
*   **Client-Side Authentication:**  Implementing authentication logic primarily on the client-side, which can be easily bypassed. *Example:*  Relying on JavaScript code to check authentication status without server-side verification.
*   **Session Management Issues:**  Weak session management practices, such as predictable session IDs, long session timeouts, or insecure session storage. *Example:*  Using sequential session IDs that can be easily guessed, allowing session hijacking.
*   **Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Not implementing MFA for administrative or privileged accounts, making them vulnerable to password compromise. *Example:*  Admin accounts for Cube.js or related infrastructure are only protected by a single password.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Enforce Strong Password Policies:** Implement and enforce strong password complexity requirements, password rotation policies, and account lockout mechanisms.
*   **Utilize Secure Authentication Protocols:**  Always use HTTPS for all communication with the Cube.js API. Consider using robust authentication protocols like OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect for API access control.
*   **Implement Server-Side Authentication:**  Ensure all authentication logic is enforced on the server-side and cannot be bypassed by client-side manipulation.
*   **Secure Session Management:**  Use cryptographically secure and unpredictable session IDs, implement appropriate session timeouts, and store session data securely server-side.
*   **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Enable MFA for all administrative and privileged accounts to add an extra layer of security.
*   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address weak authentication mechanisms.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant users and applications only the minimum necessary permissions to access Cube.js resources.
*   **Input Validation:**  Validate user inputs during authentication processes to prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities.

**Testing Methods:**

*   **Password Cracking:**  Attempt to crack passwords using brute-force and dictionary attacks.
*   **Credential Stuffing:**  Test for vulnerability to credential stuffing attacks using leaked credentials.
*   **Protocol Analysis:**  Analyze network traffic to identify insecure authentication protocols or credential exposure.
*   **Session Hijacking:**  Attempt to hijack user sessions by intercepting or guessing session IDs.

#### 1.2.2. Authorization Logic Flaws [CRITICAL]

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting errors or inconsistencies in the authorization logic that determines user permissions and access control within the Cube.js application. Flaws in authorization logic can allow users to access resources or perform actions they are not supposed to, even if authentication is correctly implemented.

**Cube.js Specific Vulnerabilities & Examples:**

*   **Broken Access Control (BAC):**  Failing to properly enforce access control policies, allowing users to access resources they should not. *Example:*  Users can access data cubes or queries that are intended for administrators or specific user roles.
*   **Inconsistent Permission Checks:**  Authorization checks are not consistently applied across all API endpoints or functionalities. *Example:*  Permission checks are implemented for some API endpoints but missing for others, allowing unauthorized access through unprotected endpoints.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Bypass:**  Exploiting flaws in RBAC implementation to gain elevated privileges or access resources outside of assigned roles. *Example:*  Manipulating user roles or permissions to bypass RBAC restrictions and access administrative functionalities.
*   **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) Flaws:**  Exploiting weaknesses in ABAC policies or their enforcement to gain unauthorized access based on manipulated attributes. *Example:*  Modifying user attributes or context to bypass ABAC rules and access restricted data.
*   **Parameter Tampering:**  Manipulating request parameters to bypass authorization checks. *Example:*  Changing user IDs or resource IDs in API requests to access data belonging to other users.
*   **Forced Browsing:**  Attempting to access restricted resources directly by guessing or discovering their URLs, bypassing intended access controls. *Example:*  Directly accessing Cube.js API endpoints for sensitive data without proper authorization.
*   **Vertical Privilege Escalation:**  Gaining access to higher-level privileges than intended, such as escalating from a regular user to an administrator. *Example:*  Exploiting authorization flaws to gain administrative access to Cube.js management interfaces.
*   **Horizontal Privilege Escalation:**  Accessing resources belonging to other users with the same privilege level. *Example:*  Accessing data cubes or reports belonging to other users within the same user role.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Implement Robust Authorization Framework:**  Utilize a well-defined and consistently applied authorization framework (e.g., RBAC, ABAC) throughout the Cube.js application.
*   **Centralized Authorization Logic:**  Centralize authorization logic in a dedicated module or service to ensure consistency and reduce the risk of errors.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant users and applications only the minimum necessary permissions required for their tasks.
*   **Regular Authorization Reviews:**  Periodically review and update authorization policies to ensure they are still relevant and effective.
*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Validate and sanitize all user inputs, especially parameters used in authorization decisions, to prevent parameter tampering attacks.
*   **Secure Direct Object References:**  Avoid exposing internal object IDs directly in URLs or API requests. Use indirect references or access control mechanisms to protect direct object access.
*   **Thorough Testing of Authorization Logic:**  Conduct comprehensive testing of authorization logic, including positive and negative test cases, to identify and address flaws.
*   **Code Review of Authorization Implementation:**  Perform thorough code reviews of authorization code to identify logic errors, inconsistencies, and potential bypass vulnerabilities.

*   **Parameter Tampering Testing:**  Attempt to manipulate request parameters to bypass authorization checks and access restricted resources.
*   **Forced Browsing Testing:**  Attempt to access restricted resources directly by guessing or discovering their URLs.
*   **Privilege Escalation Testing:**  Attempt to escalate privileges vertically and horizontally to gain unauthorized access.
*   **DAST for Authorization Vulnerabilities:**  Use DAST tools specifically designed to identify authorization vulnerabilities, such as broken access control and privilege escalation.
*   **Manual Penetration Testing:**  Engage security experts to perform manual penetration testing focused on authorization bypass vulnerabilities.

#### 1.2.4. API Key/Token Compromise (If API keys are used for Cube.js access) [CRITICAL]

**Attack Vector:** Obtaining valid API keys or tokens that are used to authenticate with the Cube.js API. Compromised keys grant full API access to the attacker, effectively bypassing authentication and authorization controls. This is particularly critical if API keys are used for sensitive operations or data access.

**Cube.js Specific Vulnerabilities & Examples:**

*   **Hardcoded API Keys:**  Storing API keys directly in the application code, configuration files, or environment variables without proper security measures. *Example:*  API keys are hardcoded in JavaScript code deployed to the client-side or in server-side configuration files accessible to unauthorized users.
*   **Exposed API Keys in Client-Side Code:**  Including API keys in client-side JavaScript code, making them easily accessible to anyone inspecting the web page source or network traffic. *Example:*  API keys are embedded in frontend code for direct API calls from the browser.
*   **Insecure Storage of API Keys:**  Storing API keys in insecure locations, such as publicly accessible repositories, unencrypted configuration files, or shared storage without proper access controls. *Example:*  API keys are committed to version control systems (like Git) or stored in plain text configuration files on servers.
*   **API Key Leakage through Logging or Error Messages:**  Accidentally logging API keys in application logs or exposing them in error messages. *Example:*  API keys are printed in debug logs or error responses, making them accessible to attackers who gain access to these logs.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:**  Intercepting API keys during transmission over unencrypted channels (HTTP). *Example:*  API keys are transmitted over HTTP, allowing attackers to intercept them using MITM techniques.
*   **API Key Guessing (Weak Keys):**  Using weak or predictable API key generation methods, making them susceptible to brute-force or dictionary attacks. *Example:*  API keys are generated using simple algorithms or predictable patterns, allowing attackers to guess valid keys.
*   **Lack of API Key Rotation:**  Not regularly rotating API keys, increasing the window of opportunity for attackers if a key is compromised. *Example:*  API keys are never rotated, so if a key is leaked, it remains valid indefinitely.
*   **Insufficient API Key Scope:**  Granting API keys overly broad permissions, allowing attackers to access more resources than necessary if a key is compromised. *Example:*  API keys are granted full API access instead of being scoped to specific resources or operations.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Never Hardcode API Keys:**  Avoid hardcoding API keys directly in application code or configuration files.
*   **Secure API Key Storage:**  Store API keys securely using dedicated secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) or encrypted configuration management systems.
*   **Environment Variables for API Keys:**  Utilize environment variables to inject API keys into the application at runtime, avoiding hardcoding in code.
*   **Server-Side API Key Management:**  Manage API keys securely on the server-side and avoid exposing them directly to client-side code.
*   **HTTPS for API Communication:**  Always use HTTPS for all communication with the Cube.js API to protect API keys during transmission.
*   **Strong API Key Generation:**  Generate API keys using cryptographically secure random number generators and ensure they are sufficiently long and complex.
*   **Regular API Key Rotation:**  Implement a policy for regular API key rotation to limit the impact of potential key compromise.
*   **API Key Scoping and Least Privilege:**  Scope API keys to the minimum necessary permissions and resources required for their intended use.
*   **API Key Monitoring and Auditing:**  Monitor API key usage and audit logs for suspicious activity that might indicate key compromise.
*   **Rate Limiting and Throttling:**  Implement rate limiting and throttling on API endpoints to mitigate the impact of compromised API keys being used for malicious purposes.

**Testing Methods:**

*   **Code Review for Hardcoded Keys:**  Review code and configuration files to identify any instances of hardcoded API keys.
*   **Secret Scanning Tools:**  Use automated secret scanning tools to detect API keys and other secrets in code repositories and configuration files.
*   **Network Traffic Analysis:**  Analyze network traffic to identify API key leakage in HTTP requests or responses.
*   **Log Analysis:**  Review application logs and error messages for accidental API key exposure.
*   **API Key Guessing Attacks:**  Attempt to guess API keys using brute-force or dictionary attacks (if weak key generation is suspected).
*   **Credential Stuffing (API Keys):**  Test for vulnerability to credential stuffing attacks using leaked API keys.
*   **DAST for API Key Exposure:**  Use DAST tools to identify potential API key exposure vulnerabilities in web applications.
