### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.1. GraphQL Injection Attacks [HIGH-RISK PATH]

GraphQL injection attacks exploit vulnerabilities in how a GraphQL API processes and executes queries, allowing attackers to manipulate the intended query logic and potentially gain unauthorized access to data or functionality. In the context of Cube.js, which exposes a GraphQL API for data exploration and analytics, these attacks are particularly relevant and pose a significant risk.

Cube.js relies on user-defined data schemas (cubes) and configurations to generate GraphQL queries that interact with underlying data sources. If these configurations or the query handling logic are not properly secured, they can become vulnerable to injection attacks.

#### 4.1. 1.1.1. Parameter Manipulation [CRITICAL]

*   **Attack Vector:** Parameter Manipulation involves attackers modifying parameters within GraphQL queries to alter the intended query logic. This is possible when the application relies on client-provided parameters without sufficient validation and sanitization. In Cube.js, this can manifest in various parts of the GraphQL query, including filters, measures, dimensions, time dimensions, and pagination parameters.

*   **Detailed Explanation:** GraphQL queries often accept arguments to filter, sort, paginate, and shape the data returned. Parameter Manipulation exploits the trust placed in these client-provided arguments. Attackers can modify these parameters to bypass intended access controls, retrieve data outside their authorized scope, or extract more data than intended.

*   **Cube.js Context:** Cube.js queries are constructed based on user-defined cubes and the GraphQL API it exposes.  Vulnerabilities can arise if:
    *   **Insufficient Input Validation in Cube Definitions:** If cube definitions or pre-aggregation logic do not properly validate or sanitize inputs used in filters or query parameters, they can be manipulated.
    *   **Direct Parameter Passthrough to Data Source Queries:** If Cube.js directly passes GraphQL query parameters to the underlying database query without proper sanitization or parameterization, it can lead to database-level injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Lack of Authorization Checks on Parameter Values:** Even if the overall query is authorized, insufficient checks on the *values* of parameters can allow attackers to access data they shouldn't.

*   **Vulnerability Examples:**

    *   **Filter Manipulation:** Consider a Cube.js cube for `Orders` with a filter intended to only show orders for the current user:

        ```graphql
        query {
          orders(where: { userId: { equals: "current_user_id" } }) {
            id
            orderDate
            amount
          }
        }
        ```

        An attacker could manipulate the `userId` filter parameter to access orders of other users:

        ```graphql
        query {
          orders(where: { userId: { equals: "another_user_id" } }) { // Manipulated userId
            id
            orderDate
            amount
          }
        }
        ```

        Or even bypass the filter entirely if the application logic is flawed:

        ```graphql
        query {
          orders(where: { userId: { notEquals: "current_user_id" } }) { // Negated filter to potentially bypass logic
            id
            orderDate
            amount
          }
        }
        ```

    *   **Pagination Manipulation:** If pagination parameters like `limit` and `offset` are not properly validated, an attacker could request extremely large limits to potentially overload the system or extract large datasets unintended for public access.

        ```graphql
        query {
          orders(limit: 1000000) { // Exaggerated limit
            id
            orderDate
          }
        }
        ```

*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   **Data Breach:** Access to sensitive data belonging to other users or exceeding authorized access levels.
    *   **Unauthorized Data Aggregation:** Extracting aggregated data beyond intended scope, potentially revealing business insights that should be confidential.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Revealing internal data structures or system information through manipulated queries.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**

    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Strictly validate and sanitize all input parameters received from GraphQL queries. Define allowed parameter values, data types, and ranges within Cube.js cube definitions and query logic.
    *   **Parameterized Queries:** Ensure that Cube.js and its underlying data connectors utilize parameterized queries when interacting with data sources. This prevents SQL/NoSQL injection by separating query logic from user-provided data. Cube.js generally handles this internally, but it's crucial to verify the data connector's behavior.
    *   **Authorization and Access Control:** Implement robust authorization checks at the GraphQL API level and within Cube.js cube definitions. Verify user permissions before executing queries and accessing data, even if parameters are seemingly valid.
    *   **Least Privilege Principle:** Grant users only the necessary permissions to access data and functionality. Avoid overly permissive roles that could be exploited through parameter manipulation.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on the GraphQL API to prevent attackers from making excessive requests and potentially exploiting vulnerabilities through brute-force parameter manipulation.
    *   **Monitoring and Logging:** Monitor GraphQL query logs for suspicious parameter values or patterns that might indicate parameter manipulation attempts. Log all GraphQL requests for auditing and incident response.

#### 4.2. 1.1.4. Field/Argument Injection [CRITICAL]

*   **Attack Vector:** Field/Argument Injection occurs when attackers inject malicious code or queries into GraphQL fields or arguments. This is possible if input validation is insufficient and the application dynamically constructs queries based on user input, especially when these inputs are used to define fields, arguments, or even cube names in Cube.js queries.

*   **Detailed Explanation:**  GraphQL queries are structured with fields and arguments. If an application dynamically constructs GraphQL queries based on user-provided input without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious GraphQL syntax or even database-specific code into these fields or arguments. This can lead to the execution of unintended operations, data breaches, or denial of service.

*   **Cube.js Context:** In Cube.js, Field/Argument Injection can be particularly critical because:
    *   **Dynamic Cube and Member Selection:** Cube.js allows users to dynamically select cubes, measures, and dimensions in GraphQL queries. If these selections are not properly validated, attackers could inject malicious cube or member names.
    *   **Arguments in Resolvers:** Cube.js resolvers can accept arguments that are used to fetch or process data. If these arguments are not sanitized and are used to construct database queries or other operations, injection vulnerabilities can arise.
    *   **Custom SQL/NoSQL in Cube Definitions:** While Cube.js aims to abstract away database specifics, cube definitions can sometimes include custom SQL or NoSQL fragments. If user input is incorporated into these fragments without proper sanitization, it can lead to database injection.

*   **Vulnerability Examples:**

    *   **Measure/Dimension Name Injection:** Imagine a scenario where the application allows users to select measures dynamically based on user input (e.g., through a dropdown). If the application directly uses this input in the GraphQL query without validation:

        ```graphql
        query {
          myCube {
            __typename // Assume this is always present
            ${userInputMeasure} // User-provided measure name
          }
        }
        ```

        An attacker could inject malicious GraphQL syntax instead of a valid measure name:

        ```graphql
        query {
          myCube {
            __typename
            __typename } ... on Query { users { id } } // Injection: Intended to leak user data
          }
        }
        ```
        This example attempts to use GraphQL introspection and type extension to potentially access unrelated data (users) if the application's GraphQL schema and resolver logic are not strictly controlled. While Cube.js schema generation is more structured, vulnerabilities could arise in custom resolvers or extensions.

    *   **Argument Injection in Resolvers (Hypothetical - Cube.js aims to prevent this):**  While less direct in typical Cube.js usage, if custom resolvers or extensions were implemented in a way that directly used unsanitized arguments to construct database queries, it could be vulnerable. For example, if a custom resolver took an argument intended for filtering and directly concatenated it into a SQL query:

        ```javascript
        // Hypothetical vulnerable resolver (not typical Cube.js pattern)
        const myResolver = (parent, args, context) => {
          const filter = args.filter; // Unsanitized user input
          const sqlQuery = `SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE column = '${filter}'`; // Vulnerable SQL construction
          // ... execute sqlQuery ...
        };
        ```

        An attacker could inject SQL code into the `filter` argument:

        ```graphql
        query {
          customQuery(filter: "'; DROP TABLE my_table; -- ") { // SQL Injection
            result
          }
        }
        ```

*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   **Database Injection (SQL/NoSQL):**  Directly executing malicious database commands, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service.
    *   **GraphQL Schema Manipulation (in severe cases):**  Potentially altering the GraphQL schema or resolvers if the injection is sophisticated enough and vulnerabilities exist in schema generation or extension logic (less likely in standard Cube.js usage but possible in custom extensions).
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Accessing data outside of intended scope by manipulating query logic through injected fields or arguments.
    *   **Service Disruption:** Causing errors or crashes in the Cube.js application or underlying data sources through malicious queries.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**

    *   **Strict Input Validation and Whitelisting:**  Implement rigorous input validation for all user-provided inputs that are used in GraphQL queries, especially for field names, argument names, and argument values. Whitelist allowed values and reject any input that does not conform to the expected format.
    *   **Avoid Dynamic Query Construction (where possible):** Minimize the dynamic construction of GraphQL queries based on user input. Rely on predefined queries and parameterized arguments as much as possible.
    *   **Secure Resolver Implementation:** If custom resolvers are used, ensure they are implemented securely and do not directly concatenate user input into database queries or other sensitive operations. Use parameterized queries or ORM/ODM features to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **GraphQL Schema Hardening:**  Design the GraphQL schema to minimize the attack surface. Avoid exposing overly complex or dynamic query capabilities that could be exploited. Limit introspection capabilities if not strictly necessary for clients.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement CSP headers to mitigate potential client-side injection attacks that might be triggered by server-side vulnerabilities.
    *   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential GraphQL injection vulnerabilities in Cube.js applications.
