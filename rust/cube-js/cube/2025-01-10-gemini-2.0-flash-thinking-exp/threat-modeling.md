# Threat Model Analysis for cube-js/cube

## Threat: [Insecure Cube.js API Authentication](./threats/insecure_cube_js_api_authentication.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might try to access the Cube.js API without proper credentials or by using weak or easily guessable credentials. They could attempt to brute-force API keys or exploit a lack of authentication mechanisms *specifically for the Cube.js API*.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, analytical insights, and potentially the ability to manipulate data or system configurations through the Cube.js API.
    *   **Affected Component:** Cube.js API endpoints, authentication middleware.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., API keys, tokens) *for the Cube.js API*.
        *   Enforce the use of HTTPS for all *Cube.js API* communication.
        *   Regularly rotate API keys *used by Cube.js*.
        *   Implement rate limiting and account lockout policies to prevent brute-force attacks *on the Cube.js API*.
        *   Consider using a dedicated authentication and authorization service *integrated with Cube.js*.

## Threat: [Authorization Bypass via Cube.js API](./threats/authorization_bypass_via_cube_js_api.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker, even with valid authentication, might attempt to access data or perform actions they are not authorized for *through the Cube.js API*. This could involve manipulating API requests, exploiting flaws in the Cube.js data model definitions, or bypassing row-level security configurations *within Cube.js*.
    *   **Impact:** Access to sensitive data that the attacker should not have, potentially leading to data breaches or misuse of information *through the Cube.js interface*.
    *   **Affected Component:** Cube.js data model definitions, query engine, security context handling.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust role-based access control (RBAC) *within Cube.js*.
        *   Carefully define and enforce permissions within the Cube.js data model.
        *   Thoroughly test authorization rules *within Cube.js* to ensure they function as intended.
        *   Regularly review and update authorization policies *within Cube.js*.

## Threat: [Exposure of Cube.js Credentials](./threats/exposure_of_cube_js_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might gain access to sensitive credentials *used by Cube.js* to connect to data sources (e.g., database passwords, API keys for external services). This could happen through insecure storage, accidental commits to version control, or vulnerabilities in the application's infrastructure *related to Cube.js configuration*.
    *   **Impact:** Full access to the underlying data sources *via Cube.js*, allowing the attacker to read, modify, or delete data. This could lead to significant data breaches and system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Cube.js configuration, connection logic, environment variable handling.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store sensitive credentials securely using secrets management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) *and ensure Cube.js integrates with them securely*.
        *   Avoid hardcoding credentials in the application code *that Cube.js uses*.
        *   Use environment variables for configuration *of Cube.js* and ensure they are not exposed.
        *   Implement proper access controls on configuration files *related to Cube.js* and deployment environments.
        *   Regularly scan for exposed secrets in codebase and infrastructure *related to Cube.js configuration*.

## Threat: [Data Injection through Cube.js Queries](./threats/data_injection_through_cube_js_queries.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might attempt to inject malicious code or queries through the Cube.js API, potentially exploiting weaknesses in how Cube.js handles user-provided filters or parameters. This could lead to the execution of unintended database commands *through Cube.js*.
    *   **Impact:** Modification or deletion of data in the underlying data sources, potentially leading to data corruption or loss *initiated via Cube.js*. In some cases, it could even allow for remote code execution on the database server.
    *   **Affected Component:** Cube.js query builder, API endpoints handling filters and parameters.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong input validation and sanitization for all user-provided data used in Cube.js queries.
        *   Utilize parameterized queries or prepared statements *within Cube.js's query building process* to prevent SQL injection.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring database access *for Cube.js*.

## Threat: [Data Leakage through Cube.js Caching](./threats/data_leakage_through_cube_js_caching.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might exploit vulnerabilities in Cube.js's caching mechanisms to access sensitive data stored in the cache. This could occur if the cache is not properly secured or if access controls *within Cube.js's caching layer* are insufficient.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data that was intended to be protected, potentially leading to data breaches.
    *   **Affected Component:** Cube.js caching module, cache storage mechanisms.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure that the Cube.js cache is stored securely and access is restricted to authorized processes *within the Cube.js application*.
        *   Implement appropriate access controls for cached data *within Cube.js*.
        *   Consider the sensitivity of the data being cached and adjust caching strategies accordingly *within Cube.js configuration*.
        *   Implement mechanisms to invalidate cached data when access rights change *within Cube.js*.

## Threat: [Denial of Service through Resource Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service_through_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might send a large number of requests or craft excessively complex queries through the Cube.js API to overwhelm the Cube.js server or the underlying data sources, leading to a denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Inability for legitimate users to access the application and its analytical features due to service unavailability *caused by overloading Cube.js*.
    *   **Affected Component:** Cube.js query engine, API endpoints.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting on the Cube.js API to prevent excessive requests.
        *   Set limits on query complexity and execution time *within Cube.js configuration*.
        *   Monitor resource usage *of the Cube.js instance* and implement alerting for unusual activity.
        *   Ensure the Cube.js infrastructure is adequately provisioned to handle expected load.

## Threat: [Exposure of Cube.js Admin Interface](./threats/exposure_of_cube_js_admin_interface.md)

*   **Description:** If the Cube.js admin interface is enabled in production environments and not properly secured, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to it.
    *   **Impact:** Full control over the Cube.js instance, allowing the attacker to modify configurations, access sensitive information, and potentially compromise the entire system *managed by Cube.js*.
    *   **Affected Component:** Cube.js admin interface.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Disable the Cube.js admin interface in production environments.
        *   If the admin interface is necessary, secure it with strong authentication and restrict access to authorized users only.
