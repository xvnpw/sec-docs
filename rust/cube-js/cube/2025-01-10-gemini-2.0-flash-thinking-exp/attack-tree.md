## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Data Access via Cube.js (HIGH-RISK PATH):](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_data_access_via_cube_js__high-risk_path_.md)

*   This path is marked as high-risk because it aims to achieve unauthorized access to sensitive data, a primary security concern. The likelihood of success is elevated due to common vulnerabilities in API security and the potentially high impact of data breaches.

*   **Exploit Cube.js API Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE):** This node represents a crucial point of entry for attackers seeking unauthorized access. The Cube.js API is the primary interface for data interaction, making vulnerabilities here particularly impactful.

    *   **Bypass Authentication/Authorization (CRITICAL NODE):**  Successfully bypassing authentication or authorization is a critical step that grants attackers access to the system.

        *   **Weak API Key Management:** If the application relies on API keys for Cube.js access and these keys are weak, easily guessable, or exposed (e.g., in client-side code), an attacker can bypass authentication.
        *   **Missing/Insufficient Authorization Checks:** Even with authentication, Cube.js might lack granular authorization checks, allowing users to access data they shouldn't. This could be due to misconfigured roles or a lack of validation on the server-side.

    *   **GraphQL Injection:** Cube.js uses GraphQL. If the application doesn't properly sanitize or validate inputs used in GraphQL queries, an attacker can inject malicious GraphQL fragments to access unauthorized data. This is similar to SQL injection but specific to GraphQL.
        *   **Inject Malicious GraphQL Queries:** Attackers craft malicious GraphQL queries to retrieve data they are not authorized to access by exploiting insufficient input validation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Data via Cube.js (HIGH-RISK PATH):](./attack_tree_paths/modify_data_via_cube_js__high-risk_path_.md)

*   This path is considered high-risk due to the potential for significant damage through unauthorized data modification or corruption. While some individual steps might have lower likelihoods, the impact of successful data manipulation can be severe.

*   **Exploit Cube.js API Vulnerabilities (Write Operations) (CRITICAL NODE):** If the Cube.js API exposes functionalities for writing or modifying data (e.g., through GraphQL mutations), vulnerabilities in these operations can be critical.

    *   **GraphQL Mutation Abuse:** If the Cube.js API exposes GraphQL mutations (write operations) and these are not properly secured, an attacker could execute unauthorized mutations to modify data. This requires write access being enabled and potentially vulnerable.
        *   **Execute Unauthorized Mutations (if enabled):** Attackers leverage insecurely implemented GraphQL mutations to alter data within the application's data sources.

*   **Exploit Database Connection Vulnerabilities (Indirectly via Cube.js) (CRITICAL NODE):** This node highlights the risk of vulnerabilities in Cube.js's query generation leading to database exploits.

    *   **SQL Injection via Cube.js Query Generation:** While Cube.js aims to abstract away direct SQL, vulnerabilities in its query generation logic could lead to SQL injection. If attacker-controlled inputs are not properly sanitized before being used to construct the underlying SQL queries, they could inject malicious SQL.
        *   **Craft Input Leading to Malicious SQL:** Attackers carefully craft input that, when processed by Cube.js, results in the generation of malicious SQL queries executed against the database.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Access to Underlying Infrastructure via Cube.js (HIGH-RISK PATH):](./attack_tree_paths/gain_access_to_underlying_infrastructure_via_cube_js__high-risk_path_.md)

*   This path is considered high-risk due to the potentially catastrophic impact of gaining access to the underlying infrastructure. Even with lower likelihoods for some individual steps, the ultimate goal represents a severe security breach.

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Cube.js (CRITICAL NODE):** This node highlights the risk of leveraging Cube.js to make unauthorized requests to internal systems.

    *   **Manipulate Cube.js to Make Requests to Internal Resources:** If Cube.js allows specifying external data sources or interacts with external services based on user input without proper validation, an attacker could manipulate it to make requests to internal resources that are not publicly accessible.

*   **Information Disclosure via Cube.js Configuration (CRITICAL NODE):**  This node represents the risk of exposing sensitive configuration details.

    *   **Access Sensitive Configuration Details (e.g., Database Credentials):** If the Cube.js configuration files or environment variables are exposed or accessible due to misconfiguration, an attacker could gain access to sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, or internal network details.
