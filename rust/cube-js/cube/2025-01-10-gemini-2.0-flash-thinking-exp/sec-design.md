**Description of Components:**

* **Frontend Application:** This represents the user-facing interface where analytical queries are initiated and their results are visualized. It interacts with the Cube.js API Gateway to request data. Examples include custom-built React or Vue applications, or integrated business intelligence tools.
* **Cube.js API Gateway:** This component serves as the central entry point for all client requests targeting the Cube.js system. It is responsible for handling authentication, authorization, request validation, and routing validated queries to the Query Orchestration Engine.
* **Query Orchestration Engine:** This is the core processing unit of Cube.js. It receives validated queries, translates them into the appropriate query language for the underlying Data Source (e.g., SQL), manages the optional caching layer (Cube Store), orchestrates data retrieval, and performs necessary data transformations.
* **Cube Store (Optional Caching Layer):** This optional component provides a caching mechanism to enhance query performance and reduce the load on the Data Source. It stores frequently accessed or pre-aggregated data, serving it directly to the Query Orchestration Engine when available.
* **Data Source:** This represents the underlying database, data warehouse, or data lake where the raw data resides. Cube.js connects to this source to retrieve the necessary data for fulfilling analytical queries.

## 4. Component Details

This section provides a more detailed description of each component, outlining its key responsibilities, underlying technologies, and crucial security considerations.

## 5. Data Flow

The following diagram illustrates the typical data flow for a query request within the Cube.js ecosystem, highlighting key security considerations at each step.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["'Frontend Application'"] --> B(" 'Cube.js API Gateway'\n1. Receive Request (HTTPS)")
    B --> C(" 'Query Orchestration Engine'\n2. Authenticate/Authorize Request")
    C --> D(" 'Query Orchestration Engine'\n3. Parse and Sanitize Query")
    D --> E{" 'Cube Store'\n4. Check Cache?"}
    E -- "Yes" --> F(" 'Cube Store'\n5. Return Cached Result (Encrypted?)")
    E -- "No" --> G(" 'Query Orchestration Engine'\n6. Translate to DB Query (Parameterized)")
    G --> H(" 'Data Source'\n7. Execute Query (Secure Connection)")
    H --> I(" 'Query Orchestration Engine'\n8. Receive Data (Encrypted)")
    I --> J(" 'Query Orchestration Engine'\n9. Cache Result (Optional, Encrypted)")
    J --> K(" 'Query Orchestration Engine'\n10. Transform Data")
    K --> L(" 'Cube.js API Gateway'\n11. Return Result (HTTPS)")
    L --> A
```

**Detailed Steps with Security Highlights:**

1. **Receive Request (HTTPS):** The Frontend Application sends a query request to the Cube.js API Gateway over a secure HTTPS connection, ensuring data in transit is encrypted.
2. **Authenticate/Authorize Request:** The API Gateway authenticates the user or application and authorizes the request based on predefined policies, preventing unauthorized access.
3. **Parse and Sanitize Query:** The Query Orchestration Engine parses and sanitizes the incoming query to prevent injection attacks and ensure its validity.
4. **Check Cache?:** The Query Orchestration Engine checks if the result for the query exists in the Cube Store.
5. **Return Cached Result (Encrypted?):** If the result is found in the cache, it is returned to the API Gateway. The connection to the Cube Store and the data stored within should ideally be encrypted.
6. **Translate to DB Query (Parameterized):** If the result is not in the cache, the Query Orchestration Engine translates the abstract query into a database-specific query, using parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
7. **Execute Query (Secure Connection):** The Query Orchestration Engine sends the translated query to the Data Source over a secure and encrypted connection.
8. **Receive Data (Encrypted):** The Data Source executes the query and returns the raw data to the Query Orchestration Engine over the secure connection.
9. **Cache Result (Optional, Encrypted):** The Query Orchestration Engine may cache the result in the Cube Store. The data stored in the cache should be encrypted.
10. **Transform Data:** The Query Orchestration Engine transforms and aggregates the raw data as needed.
11. **Return Result (HTTPS):** The Query Orchestration Engine sends the processed result back to the API Gateway.
12. **Return Result (HTTPS):** The API Gateway sends the result back to the Frontend Application over a secure HTTPS connection.

## 6. Deployment Architecture

Cube.js offers flexibility in deployment. Understanding the security implications of each scenario is crucial.

* **Cloud-Based Deployment:**
    * **Components:** Frontend Application (e.g., deployed on serverless platforms like Vercel or Netlify, or cloud storage like AWS S3), Cube.js API Gateway and Query Orchestration Engine (e.g., containerized on Kubernetes services like AWS EKS, Google GKE, Azure AKS, or serverless functions like AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions), Cube Store (e.g., managed caching services like AWS ElastiCache for Redis, Google Cloud Memorystore, Azure Cache for Redis), Data Source (e.g., cloud-managed databases like AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, Azure SQL Database, or data warehouses like Snowflake, BigQuery, AWS Redshift).
    * **Security Considerations:** Leveraging cloud provider security features (e.g., IAM for access control, VPCs for network isolation, security groups for firewall rules), ensuring secure configuration of cloud services, implementing encryption at rest and in transit for all components, regularly auditing cloud configurations, and adhering to cloud security best practices.
* **On-Premise Deployment:**
    * **Components:** Frontend Application (deployed on internal web servers), Cube.js API Gateway and Query Orchestration Engine (deployed on physical or virtual machines within the organization's network), Cube Store (deployed on internal servers), Data Source (on-premise database systems).
    * **Security Considerations:** Implementing robust network security measures (e.g., firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems), ensuring physical security of servers, implementing strong access controls and authentication mechanisms for all components, regularly patching and updating software, and establishing comprehensive logging and monitoring.
* **Hybrid Deployment:**
    * A combination of cloud and on-premise components, often with the Data Source residing on-premise for compliance or data sovereignty reasons, while Cube.js components are in the cloud.
    * **Security Considerations:** Establishing secure and encrypted connections between on-premise and cloud environments (e.g., VPN, Direct Connect), carefully managing network segmentation and access control across environments, addressing potential latency and bandwidth limitations, and ensuring consistent security policies across the hybrid infrastructure.
