Okay, here's a deep analysis of the provided attack tree path, focusing on the "Exploit Data Schema Leakage -> Misconfigured Pre-aggregations -> Expose Raw Data via Pre-aggs" vector within a Cube.js application.

## Deep Analysis: Exposing Raw Data via Misconfigured Pre-aggregations in Cube.js

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the vulnerabilities associated with misconfigured pre-aggregations in Cube.js, specifically how an attacker can exploit these misconfigurations to gain unauthorized access to raw, sensitive data.  We aim to identify specific scenarios, mitigation strategies, and detection techniques to enhance the security posture of Cube.js applications.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses exclusively on the attack path:  "Exploit Data Schema Leakage -> Misconfigured Pre-aggregations -> Expose Raw Data via Pre-aggs".  We will consider:

*   Cube.js versions:  While the analysis is general, we'll consider potential differences in behavior across major Cube.js versions (e.g., differences between older versions and the latest releases).  We'll assume a relatively recent version unless otherwise specified.
*   Deployment environments:  The analysis will consider common deployment scenarios (e.g., cloud-based, on-premise) and their potential impact on the vulnerability.
*   Data sources:  We'll assume a variety of potential data sources (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, BigQuery, Snowflake) and how their specific characteristics might influence the attack.
*   Pre-aggregation types:  We will consider all types of pre-aggregations available in Cube.js (e.g., `originalSql`, `rollup`, `rollupJoin`).

**Methodology:**

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  We will use the provided attack tree path as a starting point and expand upon it with concrete examples and scenarios.
2.  **Code Review (Hypothetical):**  We will analyze hypothetical Cube.js schema configurations and query patterns to identify potential vulnerabilities.  Since we don't have access to a specific application's code, we'll create representative examples.
3.  **Vulnerability Research:**  We will research known vulnerabilities and best practices related to Cube.js pre-aggregations.  This includes reviewing the official Cube.js documentation, community forums, and security advisories.
4.  **Mitigation Analysis:**  We will identify and evaluate potential mitigation strategies to prevent or reduce the risk of this attack.
5.  **Detection Analysis:**  We will explore methods for detecting attempts to exploit this vulnerability.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Tree Path

Let's break down the attack path step-by-step, providing more concrete details and examples:

**2.1. Exploit Data Schema Leakage (Prerequisite)**

While not directly part of the *core* attack path we're analyzing, schema leakage is a critical enabler.  An attacker needs *some* information about the schema to craft targeted queries.  This leakage can occur through:

*   **Error Messages:**  Verbose error messages from the Cube.js API can reveal table names, column names, or data types.  For example, an error like "Column 'user_email' not found" leaks the existence of a potentially sensitive column.
*   **Client-Side Code:**  If the Cube.js schema is partially or fully exposed in client-side JavaScript code (e.g., for UI generation), an attacker can inspect the code to understand the data structure.
*   **Documentation:**  Publicly available API documentation or internal documentation that is accidentally exposed can reveal schema details.
*   **Introspection Queries:**  If the underlying database allows introspection queries (e.g., querying `information_schema` in PostgreSQL), and Cube.js doesn't properly restrict these, an attacker might be able to discover schema information.
* **Guessing:** In some cases, attacker can guess table and column names, based on common naming conventions.

**2.2. Misconfigured Pre-aggregations**

This is the core vulnerability.  Pre-aggregations are designed to improve query performance by pre-computing and storing aggregated data.  Misconfigurations can arise in several ways:

*   **Insufficient Granularity:**  The pre-aggregation might be defined at too granular a level, effectively storing near-raw data.  For example:

    ```javascript
    // Vulnerable Cube.js Schema
    cube(`Users`, {
      // ... other definitions ...

      preAggregations: {
        userActivity: {
          type: `rollup`,
          measures: [Users.count],
          dimensions: [Users.id, Users.timestamp], // Too granular!
          timeDimension: Users.timestamp,
          granularity: `hour`, //Even hour is too granular, if we have user id
        },
      },
    });
    ```

    In this example, if `Users.id` is a unique user identifier and `Users.timestamp` records every user action, the `userActivity` pre-aggregation essentially stores a record for each user action, defeating the purpose of aggregation and exposing individual user activity.

*   **Missing Filters:**  The pre-aggregation might not include necessary filters to restrict access to sensitive data.  For example, if a pre-aggregation includes a `user_id` dimension but doesn't filter based on user roles or permissions, any user might be able to query the pre-aggregation and see data for other users.

    ```javascript
    // Vulnerable Cube.js Schema
    cube(`Orders`, {
      // ... other definitions ...

      preAggregations: {
        orderTotals: {
          type: `rollup`,
          measures: [Orders.totalAmount],
          dimensions: [Orders.userId], // No filter based on requesting user!
          timeDimension: Orders.orderDate,
          granularity: `day`,
        },
      },
    });
    ```
    Here, any authenticated user could potentially query `orderTotals` and see the total amounts for *all* users, not just their own.

*   **Incorrect `originalSql`:**  If using the `originalSql` pre-aggregation type, errors in the SQL query can lead to unintended data exposure.  This is essentially a SQL injection vulnerability within the pre-aggregation definition.

    ```javascript
    // Vulnerable Cube.js Schema
    cube(`SensitiveData`, {
      // ... other definitions ...

      preAggregations: {
        rawData: {
          type: `originalSql`,
          sql: `SELECT * FROM sensitive_table`, // Exposes the entire table!
        },
      },
    });
    ```

*   **Insecure `external` Pre-aggregations:** If using external pre-aggregations (e.g., loading data from a file), inadequate access controls on the external data source can lead to exposure.

* **Using `every` refreshKey.strategy:** If `every` strategy is used, and time window is too big, it can lead to storing raw data.

**2.3. Expose Raw Data via Pre-aggs (Exploitation)**

The attacker, having gained some knowledge of the schema and identified a misconfigured pre-aggregation, crafts queries to retrieve the raw data.  Examples:

*   **Granularity Attack:**  Using the first vulnerable example above (insufficient granularity), the attacker might issue a query like:

    ```javascript
    // Attacker's Query
    {
      measures: ["Users.count"],
      dimensions: ["Users.id", "Users.timestamp"],
      timeRange: ["2023-10-26", "2023-10-27"], // Specific time range
      granularity: "hour", // Requesting the finest granularity
    }
    ```

    This query, despite requesting a "count," would effectively return a list of user IDs and timestamps due to the pre-aggregation's design.

*   **Missing Filter Attack:**  Using the second vulnerable example (missing filters), an attacker might issue a query like:

    ```javascript
    // Attacker's Query
    {
      measures: ["Orders.totalAmount"],
      dimensions: ["Orders.userId"],
      timeRange: ["2023-01-01", "2023-12-31"],
    }
    ```

    This query would return the total order amounts for *all* users, as there's no filter restricting the results to the requesting user.

*   **`originalSql` Attack:**  With the `originalSql` vulnerability, *any* query against the `SensitiveData` cube would likely expose the raw data, as the pre-aggregation simply returns the result of `SELECT * FROM sensitive_table`.

**2.4. Data Exfiltration**

Once the attacker receives the raw data, they can exfiltrate it.  This might involve:

*   **Copying and Pasting:**  For small amounts of data, the attacker might simply copy and paste the results.
*   **Automated Scripting:**  For larger datasets, the attacker might use a script to automate the querying and data extraction process.
*   **Data Storage:**  The attacker might store the exfiltrated data in a local file, a remote database, or a cloud storage service.

### 3. Mitigation Strategies

Several strategies can mitigate the risk of this attack:

*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure that Cube.js has only the necessary database permissions.  It should not have access to tables or columns it doesn't need.
*   **Careful Pre-aggregation Design:**
    *   **Appropriate Granularity:**  Choose the coarsest granularity that meets performance requirements.  Avoid including unique identifiers in pre-aggregations unless absolutely necessary.
    *   **Mandatory Filters:**  Implement filters in pre-aggregations to restrict access based on user roles, permissions, or other relevant criteria.  Use the `filters` property within the pre-aggregation definition.  Consider using dynamic filters based on the requesting user's context (e.g., using a security context).
    *   **Avoid `originalSql` When Possible:**  Prefer `rollup` or `rollupJoin` over `originalSql` to reduce the risk of SQL injection.  If `originalSql` is necessary, thoroughly validate and sanitize the SQL query.
    *   **Secure `external` Pre-aggregations:** Ensure that external data sources used for pre-aggregations have appropriate access controls.
*   **Input Validation:**  Validate all user-supplied input to the Cube.js API to prevent attackers from injecting malicious queries or manipulating parameters.
*   **Security Context:**  Utilize Cube.js's security context feature to pass user authentication and authorization information to the backend.  This allows you to enforce access controls at the data layer.
*   **Regular Audits:**  Regularly audit your Cube.js schema and pre-aggregation definitions to identify potential misconfigurations.
*   **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting on the Cube.js API to prevent attackers from making excessive queries in a short period.
*   **Error Handling:**  Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages.  Return generic error messages to the client and log detailed errors internally.
* **Use `rowLimit`:** Set appropriate `rowLimit` for pre-aggregations.
* **Use `incremental` refreshKey.strategy:** Use incremental refresh strategy, to avoid storing raw data.
* **Use `updateWindow` refreshKey.strategy:** Use appropriate time window for refresh strategy.

### 4. Detection Techniques

Detecting attempts to exploit this vulnerability requires careful monitoring and analysis:

*   **Query Auditing:**  Log all queries made to the Cube.js API, including the user, query parameters, and response size.  Analyze these logs for unusual patterns, such as:
    *   Queries requesting unusually fine granularities.
    *   Queries accessing pre-aggregations that should not be accessible to the requesting user.
    *   Queries returning large amounts of data.
    *   Queries with unusual combinations of dimensions and measures.
*   **Anomaly Detection:**  Use machine learning or statistical techniques to identify anomalous query patterns that deviate from expected behavior.
*   **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):**  Configure an IDS to monitor network traffic for suspicious activity related to the Cube.js API.
*   **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**  Integrate Cube.js logs with a SIEM system to correlate events and identify potential attacks.
*   **Regular Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities in your Cube.js application, including misconfigured pre-aggregations.
* **Monitor refreshKey.every:** Monitor `refreshKey.every` usage, and alert if it is too big.

### 5. Conclusion

Misconfigured pre-aggregations in Cube.js represent a significant security risk, potentially leading to the exposure of raw, sensitive data. By understanding the attack vectors, implementing robust mitigation strategies, and employing effective detection techniques, organizations can significantly reduce the likelihood and impact of this type of attack.  A defense-in-depth approach, combining secure coding practices, careful configuration, and continuous monitoring, is essential for protecting sensitive data exposed through Cube.js applications.
