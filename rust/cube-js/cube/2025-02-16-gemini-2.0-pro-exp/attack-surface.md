# Attack Surface Analysis for cube-js/cube

## Attack Surface: [Data Source Credential Compromise (Cube.js Storage/Handling)](./attack_surfaces/data_source_credential_compromise__cube_js_storagehandling_.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized access to database credentials *because of how Cube.js stores or handles them*. This is distinct from general credential mismanagement; it focuses on vulnerabilities *introduced by Cube.js's configuration*.
*   **How Cube.js Contributes:** Cube.js *requires* and *uses* these credentials.  If its configuration files, environment variable handling, or internal mechanisms for accessing secrets are flawed, this creates a direct vulnerability.
*   **Example:** Cube.js is configured to read credentials from a file with overly permissive access, or a vulnerability in Cube.js's environment variable parsing allows an attacker to inject their own credentials.
*   **Impact:** Complete database compromise, bypassing all Cube.js security.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secrets Management Integration:** Use Cube.js's documented integration with secure secrets management solutions (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.).  Ensure Cube.js is *correctly* configured to use these.
    *   **Secure Configuration Practices:** Follow Cube.js's documentation *precisely* regarding secure configuration of database connections.  Avoid any undocumented or "workaround" methods.
    *   **Code Review (Cube.js Configuration):**  Thoroughly review the Cube.js configuration files and any code related to credential handling for potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Database User):** Ensure the database user configured within Cube.js has only the absolute minimum necessary permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Schema-Driven Data Exposure (Flawed Schema Design)](./attack_surfaces/schema-driven_data_exposure__flawed_schema_design_.md)

*   **Description:** Unintentional exposure of sensitive data *due to errors or omissions within the Cube.js schema definition itself*.
*   **How Cube.js Contributes:** The Cube.js schema *is* the definition of how data is exposed.  Flaws in the schema *directly* translate to data exposure vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** A `users` cube includes a `password_hash` dimension that is not marked as `shown: false`, making it accessible via the API.  Or, a join is incorrectly defined, leading to unintended data leakage across tables.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data defined within the schema.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Schema Design Best Practices:** Follow Cube.js's schema design best practices *meticulously*.  Use `shown: false` appropriately.  Carefully consider the implications of each dimension, measure, and join.
    *   **Security Context (Cube.js Feature):**  *Must* implement Cube.js's security context feature to enforce row-level and column-level security.  This is not optional for sensitive data.
    *   **Schema Validation (Automated):** Implement automated schema validation to check for common errors and enforce security policies *before* deployment.
    *   **Regular Schema Audits:** Conduct regular, thorough audits of the Cube.js schema, specifically looking for potential data exposure vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Query Complexity (Cube.js Query Translation)](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_query_complexity__cube_js_query_translation_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers craft complex queries that, *when translated by Cube.js into SQL*, overwhelm the database or Cube.js server.
*   **How Cube.js Contributes:** Cube.js *performs the translation* from its query language to SQL.  The complexity of this translation, and the potential for generating inefficient SQL, is a direct factor.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a Cube.js query with many joins and filters that, when translated, results in a highly inefficient SQL query that consumes all database resources.
*   **Impact:** Service unavailability due to resource exhaustion.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Query Cost Analysis (within Cube.js):** Implement a mechanism *within Cube.js* (potentially using a custom extension) to analyze the *estimated cost* of a query *before* sending it to the database.
    *   **Cube.js Query Timeouts:** Configure appropriate timeouts *within Cube.js* to limit the execution time of queries.
    *   **Pre-Aggregations (Cube.js Feature):**  *Heavily* utilize Cube.js's pre-aggregation feature to pre-compute common aggregations, reducing the complexity of on-demand queries.
    *   **Rate Limiting (Cube.js API):** Implement rate limiting on the Cube.js API to prevent attackers from submitting a large number of complex queries.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized API Access (Cube.js API Security)](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_api_access__cube_js_api_security_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers directly access the Cube.js API *without* proper authentication or authorization, exploiting weaknesses in *Cube.js's API security configuration*.
*   **How Cube.js Contributes:** Cube.js *provides* the API and is responsible for its security.  Misconfiguration or vulnerabilities in *its* API security mechanisms are direct attack vectors.
*   **Example:** The Cube.js API is deployed without any authentication configured, or the JWT secret used for authentication is weak or exposed.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access and potential server compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Authentication (Cube.js Configuration):**  *Must* configure strong authentication for the Cube.js API, following Cube.js's documentation precisely (JWTs, API keys, etc.).
    *   **Authorization (Cube.js Security Context):** Use Cube.js's security context to enforce fine-grained authorization rules, controlling which users/roles can access which data.
    *   **CORS (Cube.js Configuration):**  *Correctly* configure CORS within Cube.js to restrict API access to trusted origins.
    *   **Regular Security Audits (Cube.js API):** Regularly audit the Cube.js API configuration and security settings.

## Attack Surface: [Node.js and Dependency Vulnerabilities (Impacting Cube.js)](./attack_surfaces/node_js_and_dependency_vulnerabilities__impacting_cube_js_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in Node.js or *dependencies specifically used by Cube.js* that allow attackers to compromise the Cube.js server. This focuses on vulnerabilities that directly impact the running Cube.js instance.
*   **How Cube.js Contributes:** Cube.js *is* a Node.js application and *depends* on specific packages. Vulnerabilities in these *directly* affect Cube.js.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability in a Cube.js dependency used for query parsing allows an attacker to inject malicious code.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution (RCE), server compromise, data theft.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Scanning (Targeted):** Regularly scan *Cube.js's specific dependencies* for known vulnerabilities. Focus on packages used by Cube.js itself, not just general project dependencies.
    *   **Prompt Updates (Cube.js and Dependencies):** Keep Cube.js *and its dependencies* up to date. Apply security patches *immediately* when released.
    *   **Vulnerability Monitoring (Cube.js Specific):** Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases specifically for issues related to Cube.js and its core dependencies.
