## Mitigation Strategy: [Robust `checkAuth` Implementation](./mitigation_strategies/robust__checkauth__implementation.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Implement and enforce a comprehensive `checkAuth` function *within Cube.js*.

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Authentication Source:** Integrate `checkAuth` with your existing authentication system (e.g., JWT, OAuth, session-based). Pass authentication tokens/data to Cube.js.
2.  **Retrieve User Context:** Within `checkAuth`, extract user identity and relevant attributes (roles, group memberships, permissions) from the authentication token or session information *passed to Cube.js*.
3.  **Validate Authentication:** Verify the authenticity and validity of the user's credentials *within the `checkAuth` function*.
4.  **Authorize Access:** Based on the user's attributes, determine if they are authorized to access the requested data. Define access control rules within `checkAuth`.
5.  **Enforce Early Rejection:** If authentication or authorization fails, *immediately* reject the request within `checkAuth` with a clear error.
6.  **Log All Attempts:** Log all `checkAuth` attempts (successful and failed) *within the Cube.js context*, including user ID, timestamp, requested resource, and result.
7.  **Regular Audits:** Schedule regular reviews of the `checkAuth` implementation *within the Cube.js configuration*.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unauthorized Data Access (Severity: Critical):** Prevents users from accessing data they are not permitted to see.
*   **Data Exposure (Severity: Critical):** Reduces the risk of exposing sensitive data.
*   **Bypassing Security Controls (Severity: High):** Makes bypassing security harder.

**Impact:**
*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Risk reduced by 90-95%.
*   **Data Exposure:** Risk reduced by 80-90%.
*   **Bypassing Security Controls:** Risk reduced by 70-80%.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Implemented in `src/cube.js`.

*   Insufficiently granular access control.
*   No integration with existing permission system.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Granular Access Control with Query Transformations](./mitigation_strategies/granular_access_control_with_query_transformations.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Use Cube.js's `queryTransformer` to dynamically modify queries based on user context *provided by `checkAuth`*.

**Description:**
1.  **Access User Context:** Within `queryTransformer`, access the user context established in `checkAuth`.
2.  **Define Transformation Rules:** Create rules that map user attributes to query modifications *within the Cube.js schema*.
3.  **Apply Transformations:** Dynamically modify the Cube.js query object *within `queryTransformer`*.
4.  **Validate Transformed Query:** Add a validation step *within `queryTransformer`* to ensure the modified query conforms to the schema.
5.  **Centralize Logic:** Create a dedicated module or helper functions *within the Cube.js project* to manage transformations.
6.  **Test Thoroughly:** Create unit and integration tests *specifically for the Cube.js schema and `queryTransformer`*.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unauthorized Data Access (Severity: Critical):** Enforces fine-grained access control.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Pre-Aggregation Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/secure_pre-aggregation_configuration.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Carefully define and secure pre-aggregation definitions *within the Cube.js schema*.

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Sensitive Data:** Determine sensitive fields *within your Cube.js data model*.
2.  **Minimize Sensitive Data:** Avoid including sensitive fields in pre-aggregations unless necessary.
3.  **Apply `securityContext`:** If sensitive data *must* be included, use `securityContext` *within the pre-aggregation definition* for row-level security.
4.  **Regular Review:** Regularly review pre-aggregation definitions *as part of Cube.js schema maintenance*.
5.  **Monitor Usage:** Monitor pre-aggregation usage *through Cube.js's monitoring tools*.
6. **Update Strategy:** Define a clear update strategy for pre-aggregations.
7. **Limit Access:** Ensure that only authorized users can modify pre-aggregation definitions *within the Cube.js deployment*.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unauthorized Access to Pre-aggregated Data (Severity: High):** Prevents unauthorized access.
*   **Data Exposure via Pre-aggregations (Severity: High):** Reduces exposure risk.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Query Complexity Limits (using `queryTransformer`)](./mitigation_strategies/query_complexity_limits__using__querytransformer__.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Implement query complexity limits *using Cube.js's `queryTransformer`*.

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Resource-Intensive Operations:** Determine which query types are resource-intensive *within your Cube.js schema*.
2.  **Define Limits:** Set limits for dimensions, measures, filters, time range, and execution time *within the Cube.js configuration*.
3.  **Implement Limits (using `queryTransformer`):** Use `queryTransformer` to enforce these limits *within Cube.js*.
4.  **Provide Informative Error Messages:** Provide clear error messages *from Cube.js* when a query is rejected.
5.  **Monitor and Adjust:** Regularly monitor query performance *using Cube.js's monitoring capabilities* and adjust limits.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: High):** Prevents complex queries.
*   **Resource Exhaustion (Severity: Medium):** Reduces resource consumption.
*   **Performance Degradation (Severity: Medium):** Improves performance.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Cube.js Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/secure_cube_js_configuration.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Securely manage the Cube.js configuration file itself, and the values within it.

**Description:**
1. **Identify Sensitive Data:** Identify all sensitive values *within the Cube.js configuration* (e.g., database connection strings, external API keys used by Cube.js).
2. **Externalize Sensitive Values:** Remove sensitive values from the main configuration file. Use environment variables or a secure configuration management system (but ensure Cube.js is configured to *read* from these sources).
3. **Restrict File Permissions:** If using a configuration file, ensure its file permissions are restricted so that only the Cube.js process can read it.
4. **Regularly Audit Configuration:** Regularly review the *entire* Cube.js configuration for any hardcoded secrets or insecure settings.
5. **Version Control (Carefully):** If using version control, *never* commit the configuration file containing secrets. Use a template file and populate secrets during deployment.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Credential Exposure (Severity: Critical):** Prevents exposure of database credentials or other secrets used *by Cube.js*.
*   **Configuration Tampering (Severity: High):** Reduces the risk of unauthorized modification of Cube.js's behavior.

**Impact:**
*   **Credential Exposure:** Risk reduced by 95-99% (if secrets are properly externalized).
*   **Configuration Tampering:** Risk reduced by 80-90%.

**Currently Implemented:**
* Database credentials are in environment variables.

**Missing Implementation:**
* Some API keys used *within* Cube.js are hardcoded.
* No use of a configuration management system.
* No audit of configuration file permissions.
* No regular configuration audit.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Schema Validation and Strict Definitions](./mitigation_strategies/schema_validation_and_strict_definitions.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Define a strict and well-validated Cube.js schema.

**Description:**
1. **Define All Dimensions and Measures:** Explicitly define *all* allowed dimensions and measures in your Cube.js schema.  Do *not* allow dynamic or undefined dimensions/measures.
2. **Specify Data Types:**  Clearly define the data types for each dimension and measure.
3. **Use `sql` Property Carefully:** When using the `sql` property to define dimensions or measures, ensure that user input is *never* directly incorporated into the SQL string.  Use parameterized queries or Cube.js's built-in escaping mechanisms.
4. **Validate Input:** Within `queryTransformer` or other custom logic, validate that incoming query requests adhere to the defined schema. Reject any query that attempts to access undefined elements.
5. **Regularly Review Schema:** Regularly review and update the schema to ensure it remains aligned with your data model and security requirements.

**Threats Mitigated:**
* **Injection Attacks (Cube.js Specific) (Severity: High):** Prevents attackers from crafting malicious queries that exploit undefined schema elements or bypass input validation.
* **Data Exposure (Severity: Medium):** Limits the scope of data that can be accessed through the Cube.js API.
* **Unexpected Query Behavior (Severity: Medium):** Ensures that queries behave predictably and consistently.

**Impact:**
* **Injection Attacks:** Risk reduced by 80-90%.
* **Data Exposure:** Risk reduced by 60-70%.
* **Unexpected Query Behavior:** Risk reduced by 70-80%.

**Currently Implemented:**
* Basic schema definition exists.
* Data types are mostly defined.

**Missing Implementation:**
* Not all dimensions and measures are explicitly defined.
* `sql` property is used in a few places without proper sanitization.
* No validation of incoming queries against the schema within `queryTransformer`.
* No regular schema review process.
