Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Data Source Credential Leakage via Configuration Exposure" threat, tailored for a Cube.js application:

## Deep Analysis: Data Source Credential Leakage via Configuration Exposure

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Data Source Credential Leakage via Configuration Exposure" threat, identify specific vulnerabilities within a Cube.js deployment, and propose concrete, actionable steps beyond the initial mitigations to minimize the risk.  We aim to move from general best practices to specific implementation details and checks.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses on the following areas:

*   **Configuration Files:**  `cube.js`, `.env` files, and any other files used to configure Cube.js.
*   **Environment Variables:**  How environment variables are set, accessed, and managed within the deployment environment (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes, serverless functions, traditional servers).
*   **Secrets Management Integration:**  If a secrets manager is used, the analysis will cover its integration with Cube.js, including credential retrieval and rotation mechanisms.
*   **Deployment Environment:**  The specific infrastructure where Cube.js is deployed (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure, on-premise) and its inherent security features and potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Code Review:** Examination of the Cube.js application code for any custom configuration loading or handling that might introduce vulnerabilities.
*   **Access Control:** Review of user and service accounts that have access to the Cube.js deployment and configuration.

**Methodology:**

This analysis will employ a combination of the following techniques:

1.  **Threat Modeling Review:**  Re-examine the initial threat model and expand upon it with specific attack scenarios.
2.  **Static Code Analysis:**  Inspect the Cube.js application code and configuration files for potential vulnerabilities.
3.  **Dynamic Analysis (if applicable):**  If a test environment is available, perform penetration testing to simulate attacks that attempt to expose credentials.
4.  **Infrastructure Review:**  Analyze the deployment environment's security configuration, including network settings, access controls, and logging.
5.  **Secrets Management Audit:**  If a secrets manager is used, review its configuration, access policies, and audit logs.
6.  **Best Practices Checklist:**  Compare the current implementation against industry best practices for securing credentials and configurations.
7.  **Documentation Review:** Examine any existing documentation related to deployment, configuration, and security.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

**2.1 Attack Scenarios:**

Let's expand on the initial threat description with more specific attack scenarios:

*   **Scenario 1:  Web Server Misconfiguration (Directory Listing):**  A misconfigured web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) allows directory listing.  If the `cube.js` file or a `.env` file is placed in a web-accessible directory, an attacker can simply browse to that directory and download the file, revealing the credentials.

*   **Scenario 2:  Source Code Repository Leakage:**  A developer accidentally commits the `cube.js` file or a `.env` file containing credentials to a public Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).  Attackers constantly scan public repositories for leaked credentials.

*   **Scenario 3:  Server Compromise (RCE):**  An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Cube.js application or another application running on the same server to gain Remote Code Execution (RCE).  They can then read the `cube.js` file or access environment variables.

*   **Scenario 4:  Insider Threat:**  A malicious or negligent employee with access to the server or configuration files leaks the credentials.

*   **Scenario 5:  Environment Variable Exposure in Logs:**  The application inadvertently logs environment variables, including database credentials, to a log file that is accessible to unauthorized users or services.

*   **Scenario 6:  Container Image Vulnerability:** If Cube.js is deployed in a Docker container, and the base image or application dependencies have known vulnerabilities, an attacker could exploit these to gain access to the container's environment variables.

*   **Scenario 7:  CI/CD Pipeline Exposure:**  Credentials used in the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., for deploying Cube.js) are exposed due to misconfigured pipeline settings or compromised build servers.

*   **Scenario 8:  Third-Party Library Vulnerability:** A vulnerability in a third-party library used by Cube.js or its dependencies allows an attacker to read environment variables or configuration files.

**2.2 Vulnerability Analysis:**

*   **Configuration File Permissions:**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  The `cube.js` file has overly permissive file system permissions (e.g., world-readable).
    *   **Check:**  Use `ls -l cube.js` (or equivalent) to verify permissions.  The file should be readable only by the user running the Cube.js process.
    *   **Remediation:**  Use `chmod 600 cube.js` (or equivalent) to restrict access.

*   **Environment Variable Security:**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Environment variables are set in an insecure manner (e.g., in a shell script that is committed to a repository, or in a web server configuration file).
    *   **Check:**  Review how environment variables are set in the deployment environment (e.g., Dockerfile, Kubernetes deployment YAML, serverless function configuration).  Inspect any scripts used to start the Cube.js process.
    *   **Remediation:**  Use a secure method for setting environment variables, such as the platform's recommended approach (e.g., Docker secrets, Kubernetes secrets, serverless function environment variables).

*   **Secrets Management Integration:**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  The application does not properly integrate with a secrets manager, or the integration is flawed (e.g., hardcoded credentials are still present, the secrets manager itself is misconfigured).
    *   **Check:**  Review the code that retrieves credentials from the secrets manager.  Verify that the secrets manager is configured with appropriate access policies and audit logging.  Test the credential rotation mechanism.
    *   **Remediation:**  Implement proper integration with the secrets manager, following the provider's documentation.  Ensure that the application code only retrieves credentials from the secrets manager and does not fall back to hardcoded values.

*   **Code Review (Custom Configuration Loading):**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  The application uses custom code to load configuration files or environment variables, and this code contains vulnerabilities (e.g., insecure file handling, lack of input validation).
    *   **Check:**  Search the codebase for any code that reads configuration files or accesses environment variables.  Analyze this code for potential security flaws.
    *   **Remediation:**  Refactor the code to use secure methods for loading configuration and accessing environment variables.  Consider using a well-vetted configuration library.

*   **Deployment Environment:**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  The deployment environment itself has security vulnerabilities (e.g., unpatched software, open ports, weak access controls).
    *   **Check:**  Perform a security audit of the deployment environment.  Use vulnerability scanners to identify potential weaknesses.
    *   **Remediation:**  Address any identified vulnerabilities in the deployment environment.  Implement security best practices for the specific platform (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure).

* **Logging:**
    * **Vulnerability:** Application logs contain sensitive information.
    * **Check:** Review logging configuration and sample of logs.
    * **Remediation:** Configure logging to exclude sensitive data. Use a secure logging service.

**2.3 Enhanced Mitigation Strategies:**

Beyond the initial mitigations, consider these enhanced strategies:

*   **Principle of Least Privilege (Database User):**  Ensure the database user account used by Cube.js has *only* the necessary permissions.  Avoid using the database root user or a user with overly broad privileges.  Grant `SELECT` access only to the specific tables and views that Cube.js needs.  If Cube.js needs to write data, grant `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` permissions only on the necessary tables.

*   **Credential Rotation Automation:**  Implement automated credential rotation using the secrets manager's capabilities.  This reduces the window of opportunity for an attacker to exploit compromised credentials.

*   **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS):**  Deploy an IDPS to monitor network traffic and server activity for suspicious behavior that might indicate an attempt to access configuration files or environment variables.

*   **Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of the Cube.js deployment, including penetration testing and code reviews.

*   **Security Training:**  Provide security training to developers and operations staff to raise awareness of common vulnerabilities and best practices.

*   **Dependency Management:** Regularly update Cube.js and its dependencies to patch any known security vulnerabilities. Use tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to identify vulnerable packages.

*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  If Cube.js is exposed to the public internet, use a WAF to protect against common web attacks, such as directory traversal and SQL injection, which could be used to gain access to configuration files.

*   **Monitoring and Alerting:**  Configure monitoring and alerting to detect suspicious activity, such as unauthorized access to configuration files or failed login attempts to the database.
