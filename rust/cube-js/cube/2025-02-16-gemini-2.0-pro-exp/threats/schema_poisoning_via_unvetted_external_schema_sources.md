Okay, let's perform a deep analysis of the "Schema Poisoning via Unvetted External Schema Sources" threat for a Cube.js application.

## Deep Analysis: Schema Poisoning via Unvetted External Schema Sources

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to:

*   Thoroughly understand the attack vectors associated with schema poisoning.
*   Identify specific vulnerabilities within the Cube.js framework and common application configurations that could be exploited.
*   Evaluate the effectiveness of proposed mitigation strategies and recommend additional best practices.
*   Provide actionable guidance to developers to prevent this threat.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses on:

*   The Cube.js schema loading mechanism, including the `@cubejs-backend/server-core` module (and related modules).
*   The structure and content of Cube.js schema files (JavaScript or JSON).
*   Common deployment configurations and their impact on vulnerability.
*   Interaction with external data sources (databases) is *out of scope* for this specific threat, as it focuses on the schema itself, not the data source.  However, the *consequences* of a poisoned schema on data access are considered.
*   The analysis will *not* cover general web application vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF) unless they directly relate to schema loading.

**Methodology:**

1.  **Code Review:**  We will examine the relevant parts of the Cube.js source code (primarily `@cubejs-backend/server-core` and related modules) to understand how schemas are loaded, parsed, and used.  We'll look for potential vulnerabilities in this process.
2.  **Threat Modeling Refinement:** We will expand on the provided threat description, identifying specific attack scenarios and techniques.
3.  **Mitigation Strategy Evaluation:** We will critically assess the proposed mitigation strategies, considering their practicality, effectiveness, and potential limitations.
4.  **Best Practices Recommendation:** We will provide concrete recommendations and code examples to help developers implement secure schema loading practices.
5.  **Documentation Review:** We will review the official Cube.js documentation for any relevant security guidance or warnings related to schema loading.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

**2.1 Attack Vectors and Scenarios:**

*   **Scenario 1: External URL Loading:**  If the Cube.js configuration allows loading schemas from a URL (e.g., `schemaPath: 'https://example.com/malicious-schema.js'`), an attacker could host a malicious schema file on a controlled server.  This is the most direct and dangerous attack vector.

*   **Scenario 2: Compromised Internal Source:**  Even if schemas are loaded from a local file system, an attacker might gain access to the server (e.g., through a separate vulnerability) and modify a legitimate schema file or replace it with a malicious one.

*   **Scenario 3: Third-Party Repository:** If the application uses a third-party repository for schema definitions, and that repository is compromised, the application could unknowingly load a malicious schema.

*   **Scenario 4: Social Engineering:** An attacker could trick a developer into downloading and using a malicious schema file, perhaps by disguising it as a legitimate update or a helpful utility.

*   **Scenario 5: Dependency Vulnerability:** A vulnerability in a library used for schema loading (e.g., a JSON parser) could be exploited to inject malicious code.

*   **Scenario 6: Dynamic Schema Generation with User Input:** If the application dynamically generates schemas based on user input *without proper sanitization and validation*, an attacker could inject malicious code into the generated schema. This is a particularly dangerous scenario.

**2.2 Vulnerability Analysis (Code Review - Hypothetical):**

Let's assume, for the sake of this analysis, that we've reviewed the Cube.js code and identified the following (hypothetical) vulnerabilities:

*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The `schemaPath` configuration option might not perform sufficient validation on the provided path, allowing attackers to specify arbitrary file paths or URLs.
*   **Insecure Deserialization:** The code responsible for parsing the schema file (e.g., `JSON.parse` or a custom parser) might be vulnerable to injection attacks if it doesn't properly handle untrusted input.
*   **Dynamic Code Evaluation:** If the schema loading process uses `eval()` or similar functions to execute code from the schema file, this is a major vulnerability, allowing arbitrary code execution.  Cube.js *does* use JavaScript for schema definitions, so this is a critical area to examine.
*   **Missing Sandboxing:**  The schema loading process might not be isolated from the main Cube.js server process, allowing a compromised schema to affect the entire application.

**2.3 Impact Analysis (Detailed):**

*   **Data Breaches:** A malicious schema could redefine data models to expose sensitive fields that were previously hidden or restricted.  It could also modify join conditions to retrieve unauthorized data.
*   **Data Corruption:**  The attacker could alter `sql` definitions within the schema to inject malicious SQL queries that modify or delete data in the underlying database.
*   **Code Execution:**  If the schema contains malicious JavaScript code (e.g., within a `preAggregations` definition or a custom function), and Cube.js executes this code without proper sandboxing, the attacker could gain control of the Cube.js server.
*   **Denial of Service:**  A malicious schema could define computationally expensive queries or infinite loops, causing the Cube.js server to become unresponsive.
*   **Complete System Compromise:**  Successful code execution could lead to the attacker gaining full control of the server, potentially compromising other applications or data on the same machine.

### 3. Mitigation Strategy Evaluation

Let's evaluate the provided mitigation strategies and add some nuances:

*   **Strictly control schema sources:**  This is the **most crucial** mitigation.  Loading schemas *only* from trusted, local, version-controlled files is the best defense.  External URLs should be *strictly prohibited*.

*   **Implement schema validation:**  This is essential.  A JSON Schema validator can be used to enforce a predefined structure for the schema, preventing unexpected fields or data types.  However, JSON Schema alone *cannot* prevent malicious JavaScript code within string fields (e.g., within `sql` definitions).  Therefore, a custom validator is needed to:
    *   Parse the JavaScript code within the schema (using a safe parser like `acorn`).
    *   Analyze the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to detect potentially dangerous operations (e.g., accessing global variables, making network requests, using `eval`).
    *   Reject schemas that contain suspicious code.

*   **Code review:**  Regular code reviews are important, but they are not a foolproof solution.  Automated validation is more reliable.

*   **Sandboxing (if dynamic schema loading is unavoidable):**  This is a complex but potentially necessary mitigation if dynamic schema loading is required.  Options include:
    *   **Separate Process:**  Run the schema loading and processing logic in a separate process with limited privileges.  Communication with the main Cube.js process should be carefully controlled.
    *   **Virtual Machine:**  Use a virtual machine to isolate the schema loading environment completely.  This provides the strongest isolation but has higher overhead.
    *   **WebAssembly (Wasm):**  Potentially, schema processing could be done in a WebAssembly sandbox, providing a high degree of isolation and performance. This is a more advanced technique.
    * **Node.js `vm` module:** While Node.js offers a `vm` module for sandboxing, it's crucial to understand its limitations.  It's *not* a true security boundary and can be bypassed.  It should *only* be used as a defense-in-depth measure, *never* as the sole security mechanism.

*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  CSP is primarily relevant for the *frontend* of a web application, protecting against XSS.  It's less directly applicable to the backend schema loading process.  However, if schemas are somehow loaded dynamically via the frontend (which is highly discouraged), CSP could help limit the sources.

### 4. Best Practices and Recommendations

1.  **Never Load Schemas from External URLs:** This should be a hard rule.

2.  **Use a Strict Schema Validator:** Implement a custom validator that goes beyond JSON Schema validation and analyzes the JavaScript code within the schema for potential threats.

3.  **Version Control Schemas:** Store schema files in a version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes and facilitate rollbacks.

4.  **Regularly Update Cube.js:** Keep your Cube.js installation and its dependencies up to date to benefit from security patches.

5.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the Cube.js server process runs with the minimum necessary privileges.  It should not have write access to the schema files or other sensitive parts of the system.

6.  **Monitor Logs:** Monitor Cube.js logs for any suspicious activity, such as errors related to schema loading or unexpected queries.

7.  **Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of your Cube.js application and infrastructure.

8.  **Avoid Dynamic Schema Generation Based on User Input:** If you must generate schemas dynamically, *never* incorporate unsanitized user input directly into the schema.  Use a template engine with strict escaping and validation.

9.  **Consider a "Schema Registry" (for complex deployments):**  For large, complex deployments with multiple teams and schemas, consider implementing a "schema registry" â€“ a centralized, controlled repository for managing and validating schemas.

**Example (Hypothetical Custom Validator - Partial):**

```javascript
const acorn = require('acorn');
const fs = require('fs');

function validateSchema(schemaPath) {
  const schemaContent = fs.readFileSync(schemaPath, 'utf-8');
  const schema = JSON.parse(schemaContent); // Basic JSON parsing

  // Check for required fields, data types, etc. (using JSON Schema or similar)
  // ...

  // Analyze JavaScript code within the schema
  for (const cubeName in schema.cubes) {
    const cube = schema.cubes[cubeName];
    if (cube.sql) {
      analyzeJavaScriptCode(cube.sql, `Cube ${cubeName} - sql`);
    }
    if (cube.preAggregations) {
      for (const preAggName in cube.preAggregations) {
          const preAgg = cube.preAggregations[preAggName];
          if(preAgg.sql) {
            analyzeJavaScriptCode(preAgg.sql, `Cube ${cubeName} - preAggregations ${preAggName} - sql`);
          }
      }
    }
    // ... (check other fields containing JavaScript code)
  }

  return true; // Schema is valid
}

function analyzeJavaScriptCode(code, context) {
  try {
    const ast = acorn.parse(code, { ecmaVersion: 2020 });

    // Walk the AST and check for dangerous patterns
    // (This is a simplified example - a real implementation would be much more comprehensive)
    function walk(node) {
      if (node.type === 'CallExpression' && node.callee.name === 'eval') {
        throw new Error(`'eval' detected in ${context}. This is not allowed.`);
      }
      // ... (check for other dangerous functions, global variable access, etc.)

      for (const key in node) {
        if (typeof node[key] === 'object' && node[key] !== null) {
          walk(node[key]);
        }
      }
    }

    walk(ast);
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error(`Invalid JavaScript code in ${context}: ${error.message}`);
  }
}

// Example usage:
try {
    if (validateSchema('./schema/my-schema.js')) {
        console.log('Schema is valid.');
    }
} catch (error) {
    console.error('Schema validation failed:', error.message);
    process.exit(1); // Exit with an error code
}

```

This example demonstrates a basic approach to analyzing JavaScript code within the schema using `acorn`.  A real-world validator would need to be much more robust and handle a wider range of potential threats. It should also be integrated into the Cube.js build process or deployment pipeline.

### 5. Documentation Review

The official Cube.js documentation should be reviewed for any existing security recommendations related to schema loading.  If the documentation is lacking in this area, it should be updated to include clear warnings and best practices. The documentation should explicitly state that loading schemas from untrusted sources is a major security risk.

### Conclusion

Schema poisoning is a critical threat to Cube.js applications. By strictly controlling schema sources, implementing robust schema validation (including JavaScript code analysis), and following the recommended best practices, developers can significantly reduce the risk of this attack.  Sandboxing should be considered if dynamic schema loading is absolutely necessary, but it is a complex mitigation that requires careful planning and implementation. Regular security audits and updates are also essential to maintain a secure Cube.js deployment.
