Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Query Parameter Manipulation Leading to Unauthorized Data Access" threat, tailored for a development team using Cube.js:

## Deep Analysis: Query Parameter Manipulation in Cube.js

### 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**1.1. Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to:

*   Thoroughly understand the mechanisms by which query parameter manipulation can lead to unauthorized data access in a Cube.js application.
*   Identify specific vulnerabilities within a typical Cube.js implementation that could be exploited.
*   Provide actionable recommendations beyond the initial mitigation strategies to enhance the application's security posture against this threat.
*   Establish clear testing procedures to verify the effectiveness of implemented mitigations.

**1.2. Scope:**

This analysis focuses on the interaction between the application code (frontend and backend) and the Cube.js API.  It considers:

*   **Frontend:** How the application constructs and sends requests to the Cube.js API.
*   **Backend (if applicable):**  Any pre-processing or validation of Cube.js API requests performed by the application's backend.
*   **Cube.js API:**  The `/cubejs-api/v1/load` endpoint and other relevant endpoints.
*   **Cube.js Configuration:**  The `cube.js` configuration file, including data schema definitions, security context, and query transformers.
*   **Underlying Database:**  The database used by Cube.js, focusing on how parameterized queries are handled.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   General web application vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF) unless they directly contribute to query parameter manipulation.
*   Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks against the Cube.js API.
*   Vulnerabilities within the underlying database system itself (e.g., database misconfiguration).

**1.3. Methodology:**

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Threat Modeling Review:**  Revisit the initial threat description and expand upon potential attack vectors.
2.  **Code Review (Hypothetical & Example-Based):**  Analyze hypothetical and example code snippets (frontend and backend) to identify common vulnerabilities.
3.  **Cube.js Configuration Analysis:**  Examine how Cube.js features (RLS, data masking, etc.) can be used effectively and where misconfigurations might occur.
4.  **Exploitation Scenarios:**  Develop concrete examples of how an attacker might manipulate query parameters to achieve unauthorized access.
5.  **Mitigation Validation:**  Propose specific tests and checks to ensure that mitigation strategies are correctly implemented and effective.
6.  **Documentation:**  Clearly document findings, recommendations, and testing procedures.

### 2. Threat Modeling Review (Expanded)

The initial threat description provides a good starting point.  Let's expand on potential attack vectors:

*   **Filter Manipulation:**
    *   **Bypassing Restrictions:**  An attacker might try to remove or modify existing filters to access data outside their permitted scope.  For example, if a filter restricts data to `user_id = 123`, the attacker might try to remove this filter or change it to `user_id = 456`.
    *   **Type Juggling:**  If the application doesn't strictly validate data types, an attacker might try to inject unexpected values into filters.  For example, injecting a string into a numeric filter might cause unexpected behavior.
    *   **Logical Errors:**  Exploiting flaws in the application's logic for constructing filters.  For example, if the application uses a complex combination of AND/OR conditions, the attacker might find a way to manipulate these conditions to their advantage.
    *   **Enumeration:**  Trying different filter values (e.g., `user_id = 1`, `user_id = 2`, etc.) to discover valid data points.

*   **Dimension/Measure Manipulation:**
    *   **Unauthorized Dimensions:**  Requesting dimensions that the user should not have access to.  For example, requesting a `salary` dimension if the user is only authorized to see `name` and `department`.
    *   **Unauthorized Measures:**  Requesting measures that expose sensitive data.  For example, requesting a `sum(revenue)` measure if the user is only authorized to see `count(orders)`.
    *   **Dimension/Measure Enumeration:**  Trying different dimension and measure names to discover the data schema.

*   **Time Dimension Manipulation:**
    *   **Bypassing Time Restrictions:**  Modifying time dimensions (e.g., `dateRange`) to access historical data that should be restricted.
    *   **Unexpected Time Granularities:**  Requesting data at a finer granularity than allowed, potentially revealing more detailed information.

*   **Limit/Offset Manipulation:**
    *   **Data Exfiltration:**  Using large `limit` values to retrieve excessive amounts of data.
    *   **Pagination Bypass:**  Manipulating `offset` to skip over intended pagination restrictions.

*   **Exploiting `queryTransformer` Weaknesses:**
    *   **Bypassing Transformations:**  If the `queryTransformer` function has vulnerabilities, an attacker might be able to craft a query that bypasses intended transformations or injects malicious code.

### 3. Code Review (Hypothetical & Example-Based)

**3.1. Vulnerable Frontend (React Example):**

```javascript
// Vulnerable Example - Directly using user input in the query
function fetchData(userId, startDate, endDate) {
  const query = {
    measures: ['Orders.count'],
    dimensions: ['Orders.status'],
    filters: [
      { member: 'Orders.userId', operator: 'equals', values: [userId] }, // Vulnerable!
      { member: 'Orders.createdAt', operator: 'timeRange', values: [startDate, endDate] }, // Potentially vulnerable
    ],
  };

  cubejsApi.load(query).then(resultSet => {
    // ... process the data
  });
}
```

**Vulnerability:**  The `userId` is directly taken from user input and used in the `filters` array.  An attacker could easily modify this value to access data belonging to other users.  The `startDate` and `endDate` are also potentially vulnerable if not properly validated.

**3.2. Improved Frontend (React Example):**

```javascript
// Improved Example - Using a whitelist and server-side validation
function fetchData(startDate, endDate) {
  // Validate date inputs (using a library like 'date-fns' or similar)
  if (!isValidDate(startDate) || !isValidDate(endDate)) {
    throw new Error('Invalid date range');
  }

  // Construct the query with pre-defined parameters
  const query = {
    measures: ['Orders.count'],
    dimensions: ['Orders.status'],
    filters: [
      { member: 'Orders.createdAt', operator: 'timeRange', values: [startDate, endDate] },
    ],
  };

  // Send the query to the backend (which will add the user-specific filter)
  fetch('/api/orders', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ query }),
  })
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(resultSet => {
    // ... process the data
  });
}
```

**Improvement:**  This example moves the user-specific filtering to the backend.  The frontend only sends a request with validated date parameters.  The backend is responsible for adding the `Orders.userId` filter based on the authenticated user.

**3.3. Vulnerable Backend (Node.js/Express Example):**

```javascript
// Vulnerable Example - Directly passing the frontend query to Cube.js
app.post('/api/orders', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { query } = req.body;
    const resultSet = await cubejsApi.load(query); // Vulnerable!
    res.json(resultSet);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });
  }
});
```

**Vulnerability:**  The backend directly passes the query received from the frontend to the `cubejsApi.load()` method without any validation or modification.  This is highly vulnerable to parameter manipulation.

**3.4. Improved Backend (Node.js/Express Example):**

```javascript
// Improved Example - Validating and modifying the query on the backend
const allowedMeasures = ['Orders.count'];
const allowedDimensions = ['Orders.status'];

app.post('/api/orders', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { query } = req.body;

    // 1. Validate measures and dimensions
    if (!query.measures || !query.measures.every(m => allowedMeasures.includes(m))) {
      return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Invalid measures' });
    }
    if (!query.dimensions || !query.dimensions.every(d => allowedDimensions.includes(d))) {
      return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Invalid dimensions' });
    }

    // 2. Add user-specific filter (assuming user is authenticated)
    query.filters = query.filters || [];
    query.filters.push({
      member: 'Orders.userId',
      operator: 'equals',
      values: [req.user.id], // Get user ID from authentication context
    });

    // 3. Validate date range (if present)
     if (query.filters) {
        const dateFilter = query.filters.find(f => f.member === 'Orders.createdAt' && f.operator === 'timeRange');
        if (dateFilter) {
            if (!isValidDateRange(dateFilter.values[0], dateFilter.values[1])) {
                return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Invalid date range' });
            }
        }
    }

    // 4. Pass the validated and modified query to Cube.js
    const resultSet = await cubejsApi.load(query);
    res.json(resultSet);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });
  }
});
```

**Improvement:**  This backend code performs several crucial security checks:

*   **Whitelist Validation:**  It checks if the requested `measures` and `dimensions` are present in predefined whitelists (`allowedMeasures`, `allowedDimensions`).
*   **User-Specific Filtering:**  It adds a filter based on the authenticated user's ID (`req.user.id`), ensuring that users can only access their own data.
*   **Date Range Validation:** It validates the date range, if present in the query.
*   **Input Sanitization:** While not explicitly shown, you should also sanitize any string inputs to prevent potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if those values are later displayed in the UI.

### 4. Cube.js Configuration Analysis

**4.1. `securityContext`:**

The `securityContext` is crucial for implementing Row-Level Security (RLS).  It allows you to define user attributes that can be used in filters.

```javascript
// cube.js
module.exports = {
  securityContext: (req) => {
    // Get user information from the request (e.g., from JWT token)
    const user = getUserFromRequest(req);

    return {
      userId: user.id,
      role: user.role,
      // ... other user attributes
    };
  },
};
```

**Best Practices:**

*   **Securely Retrieve User Attributes:**  Ensure that the `securityContext` function retrieves user attributes from a trusted source (e.g., a validated JWT token).  Do *not* rely on user-provided data in the request body.
*   **Use Specific Attributes:**  Define specific attributes (e.g., `userId`, `departmentId`, `regionId`) rather than generic attributes (e.g., `dataAccess`).
*   **Regularly Review:**  Periodically review the `securityContext` to ensure it accurately reflects the current security requirements.

**4.2. `queryTransformer`:**

The `queryTransformer` allows you to modify the query before it's sent to the database.  This can be used to enforce additional security rules.

```javascript
// cube.js
module.exports = {
  queryTransformer: (query, { securityContext }) => {
    // Enforce RLS based on securityContext
    if (securityContext.role === 'user') {
      query.filters.push({
        member: 'Orders.userId',
        operator: 'equals',
        values: [securityContext.userId],
      });
    }

    // Prevent access to sensitive dimensions for certain roles
    if (securityContext.role !== 'admin') {
      query.dimensions = query.dimensions.filter(d => d !== 'Orders.profit');
    }

    return query;
  },
};
```

**Best Practices:**

*   **Least Privilege:**  Use the `queryTransformer` to enforce the principle of least privilege.  Only allow access to the data that is absolutely necessary for the user's role.
*   **Avoid Complex Logic:**  Keep the `queryTransformer` logic as simple and understandable as possible.  Complex logic can introduce vulnerabilities.
*   **Thorough Testing:**  Thoroughly test the `queryTransformer` with different user roles and query parameters to ensure it behaves as expected.
*   **Fail Securely:** If there's an error in the `queryTransformer`, it's generally better to deny access rather than grant access.

**4.3. Data Masking:**

Cube.js supports data masking, which allows you to redact sensitive data from query results.

```javascript
// cube.js (within a cube definition)
cube(`Orders`, {
  // ...

  dimensions: {
    creditCardNumber: {
      sql: `credit_card_number`,
      type: `string`,
      mask: (value, { securityContext }) => {
        if (securityContext.role === 'admin') {
          return value; // Admins see the full number
        } else {
          return 'XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-' + value.slice(-4); // Mask for other users
        }
      },
    },
  },
});
```

**Best Practices:**

*   **Identify Sensitive Data:**  Carefully identify all sensitive data fields that need to be masked.
*   **Role-Based Masking:**  Use the `securityContext` to implement role-based masking.  Different user roles may see different levels of masking.
*   **Consistent Masking:**  Ensure that masking is applied consistently across all relevant dimensions and measures.

### 5. Exploitation Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Bypassing User ID Filter (Frontend Manipulation)**

*   **Setup:**  The application uses the vulnerable frontend code from section 3.1.  The backend does *not* validate or modify the query.
*   **Attack:**
    1.  The attacker logs in as a regular user (e.g., `user_id = 123`).
    2.  The attacker intercepts the request to the Cube.js API using browser developer tools.
    3.  The attacker modifies the `filters` array in the request body to remove the `Orders.userId` filter or change it to `Orders.userId = 456`.
    4.  The attacker sends the modified request.
*   **Result:**  The Cube.js API processes the modified query and returns data belonging to user 456 (or all users if the filter is removed).

**Scenario 2: Accessing Unauthorized Dimension (Backend Weakness)**

*   **Setup:**  The application uses a backend that doesn't have a whitelist for dimensions.  The `securityContext` is correctly implemented, but the `queryTransformer` doesn't restrict dimensions.
*   **Attack:**
    1.  The attacker logs in as a regular user.
    2.  The attacker intercepts the request to the Cube.js API.
    3.  The attacker adds a new dimension to the `dimensions` array, such as `Orders.customerAddress`.
    4.  The attacker sends the modified request.
*   **Result:**  The Cube.js API processes the query and returns the `customerAddress` data, even though the user should not have access to it.

**Scenario 3: Time Range Manipulation (Frontend & Backend Weakness)**

*   **Setup:** The frontend doesn't validate the date range, and the backend only checks for the *presence* of a date range filter but not its validity.
*   **Attack:**
    1.  The attacker logs in.
    2.  The attacker intercepts the request.
    3.  The attacker modifies the `values` array of the `Orders.createdAt` filter to include a much wider date range (e.g., going back several years).
    4.  The attacker sends the modified request.
*   **Result:** The Cube.js API returns data from the expanded time range, potentially exposing historical data that should be restricted.

### 6. Mitigation Validation

**6.1. Unit Tests:**

*   **Backend API Tests:**
    *   Test the backend API endpoints with various valid and invalid query parameters (measures, dimensions, filters, limit, offset).
    *   Verify that the API correctly rejects requests with unauthorized parameters.
    *   Verify that the API correctly adds user-specific filters based on the authentication context.
    *   Test edge cases, such as empty arrays, null values, and unexpected data types.
    *   Test with different user roles (if applicable) to ensure that RLS is enforced correctly.

*   **`queryTransformer` Tests:**
    *   Create unit tests specifically for the `queryTransformer` function.
    *   Mock the `securityContext` and pass different query objects to the function.
    *   Verify that the `queryTransformer` correctly modifies the query based on the `securityContext`.
    *   Test with different user roles and query parameters to ensure that all security rules are enforced.

*   **Data Masking Tests:**
    *   Create unit tests for the data masking functions.
    *   Mock the `securityContext` and pass different values to the masking function.
    *   Verify that the masking function returns the expected masked value based on the `securityContext`.

**6.2. Integration Tests:**

*   **End-to-End Tests:**
    *   Create end-to-end tests that simulate user interactions with the application.
    *   Verify that users can only access the data they are authorized to see.
    *   Attempt to manipulate query parameters (e.g., using browser developer tools) and verify that the application correctly blocks these attempts.

**6.3. Security Audits:**

*   **Regular Code Reviews:**  Conduct regular code reviews, focusing on the security aspects of the Cube.js integration.
*   **Penetration Testing:**  Engage a security professional to perform penetration testing on the application.  This will help identify any vulnerabilities that were missed during development and testing.

**6.4. Monitoring and Alerting:**

*   **Log Cube.js Queries:**  Log all queries sent to the Cube.js API, including the `securityContext` and the transformed query.  This will help you identify any suspicious activity.
*   **Set Up Alerts:**  Set up alerts for any unusual query patterns or errors.  For example, you could set up an alert for queries that request a large number of rows or that contain unexpected parameters.

### 7. Documentation

*   **Security Guidelines:**  Create clear security guidelines for developers working with Cube.js.  These guidelines should cover topics such as input validation, whitelisting, RLS, data masking, and secure coding practices.
*   **Threat Model:**  Maintain an up-to-date threat model for the application, including the specific threats related to Cube.js.
*   **Test Results:**  Document the results of all unit tests, integration tests, and security audits.
*   **Incident Response Plan:**  Develop an incident response plan that outlines the steps to take in case of a security breach.

This deep analysis provides a comprehensive framework for understanding and mitigating the risk of query parameter manipulation in Cube.js applications. By implementing the recommended mitigation strategies and following the validation procedures, you can significantly enhance the security of your application and protect sensitive data. Remember that security is an ongoing process, and regular reviews and updates are essential to maintain a strong security posture.
