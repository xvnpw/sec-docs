# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for cube-js/cube

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Robust Authentication and Authorization using Cube.js Security Context](./mitigation_strategies/implement_robust_authentication_and_authorization_using_cube_js_security_context.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Robust Authentication and Authorization using Cube.js Security Context.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define User Roles/Groups:** Identify different user roles or groups relevant to data access within your application.
    2.  **Map Roles to Cube.js Security Context Function:** In your `cube.js` configuration file, define the `securityContext` function. This function should extract user roles or attributes from the incoming request (e.g., from JWT, session cookies, headers).
    3.  **Define Granular Access Policies within Security Context:** Inside the `securityContext` function, implement logic to define access policies. Use `securityContext.cube(cubeName)` and `securityContext.measure(measureName, cubeName)` to control access to specific cubes and measures based on the user's roles or attributes. Return `true` to allow access or `false` to deny.
    4.  **Apply Policies in Cube Schema:** Ensure your Cube.js schema utilizes the `securityContext` by referencing it within cube and measure definitions. This enforces the defined access policies.
    5.  **Thoroughly Test Security Context:** Write unit and integration tests to verify that the `securityContext` function correctly enforces access policies for different user roles and scenarios.
    6.  **Regularly Review and Update Policies:** Periodically review and update the `securityContext` function and access policies as user roles and data access requirements evolve within your application.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Data Access (High Severity): Prevents users from accessing Cube.js data they are not authorized to view, directly through the Cube.js API.
    *   Data Breaches (High Severity): Reduces the risk of data exposure by limiting access based on roles, even if other application layers are compromised.
    *   Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity): Restricts users with lower privileges from accessing sensitive data exposed through Cube.js.
*   **Impact:** High Reduction for Unauthorized Data Access and Data Breaches. Medium Reduction for Privilege Escalation related to Cube.js data.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic JWT authentication is used for API access, but the Cube.js `securityContext` is not yet actively enforcing granular access policies based on user roles within Cube.js itself.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Implement the `securityContext` function in `cube.js` configuration. Define specific access policies for cubes and measures within the `securityContext` function. Integrate user role information into the `securityContext` logic. Write tests to validate the implemented security context.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Cube Store Configuration (If Applicable)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_cube_store_configuration__if_applicable_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Cube Store Configuration.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Network Isolation:** If using Cube Store (e.g., Redis, Postgres for pre-aggregations), deploy it in a private network segment, inaccessible directly from the public internet. Restrict network access to only authorized Cube.js server instances.
    2.  **Restrict Cube Store Ports:** Configure firewalls to block external access to Cube Store ports (e.g., Redis port 6379, Postgres port 5432) from outside the internal network.
    3.  **Secure Cube Store Credentials:** Manage Cube Store connection credentials securely. Avoid hardcoding them in `cube.js` or application code. Utilize environment variables or a dedicated secret management service to store and retrieve these credentials.
    4.  **Cube Store Authentication and Authorization:** If your chosen Cube Store supports authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., Redis ACLs, Postgres roles), enable and configure them to further restrict access to the Cube Store itself.
    5.  **Monitor Cube Store Access Logs:** Enable and regularly monitor Cube Store access logs for any unusual or unauthorized connection attempts originating from Cube.js or other sources.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Cube Store Access (High Severity): Prevents unauthorized access to the underlying Cube Store database, bypassing Cube.js API controls.
    *   Data Breaches via Cube Store (High Severity): Reduces the risk of data leaks if the Cube Store is directly compromised, independent of Cube.js application security.
    *   Data Integrity Compromise (Medium Severity): Protects against unauthorized modification or deletion of pre-aggregated data or Cube Store metadata.
*   **Impact:** High Reduction for Unauthorized Cube Store Access and Data Breaches via Cube Store. Medium Reduction for Data Integrity Compromise within Cube Store.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Cube Store (Redis) is deployed in a separate network segment. Credentials are managed via environment variables. Cube Store specific authentication (like Redis ACLs) is not yet configured.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Implement Cube Store specific authentication and authorization (e.g., Redis ACLs). Enhance credential management by using a dedicated secret management service instead of solely relying on environment variables.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Schema Hardening and Data Exposure Minimization](./mitigation_strategies/schema_hardening_and_data_exposure_minimization.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Schema Hardening and Data Exposure Minimization.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Cube Schema for Sensitive Data:** Carefully review your `schema/` directory and Cube.js schema definitions (`.js` files). Identify any measures, dimensions, or cubes that expose sensitive or unnecessary data.
    2.  **Limit Exposed Measures and Dimensions:**  In your Cube.js schema, explicitly define only the measures and dimensions that are absolutely required for your application's analytical needs. Avoid exposing all possible data points by default.
    3.  **Data Aggregation and Abstraction in Schema:** Where feasible, modify your Cube.js schema to provide aggregated or abstracted views of sensitive data instead of exposing raw, granular details. Define measures that calculate summaries or ranges rather than direct sensitive values.
    4.  **Disable GraphQL Introspection in Production (if using GraphQL API):** If you are using the GraphQL API for Cube.js, disable introspection in production environments by setting `playground: false` and `introspection: false` in your Cube.js server configuration. This prevents attackers from easily discovering your Cube.js schema structure.
    5.  **Regular Schema Audits:** Periodically audit your Cube.js schema definitions to ensure they still adhere to the principle of least privilege and that no new or unnecessary data exposure has been introduced during development.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Data Exposure through Cube.js API (Medium to High Severity): Reduces the amount of sensitive data accessible through the Cube.js API if access controls are bypassed or vulnerabilities are found.
    *   Information Disclosure about Data Structure (Medium Severity): Limits the information available to potential attackers about your underlying data schema and sensitive fields exposed via Cube.js.
*   **Impact:** Medium to High Reduction for Data Exposure through Cube.js API. Medium Reduction for Information Disclosure related to Cube.js schema.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Cube schema is designed with some consideration for data exposure, but a formal security-focused review and explicit limitation of exposed fields based on security principles has not been fully conducted. GraphQL introspection is currently enabled in non-production environments.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Conduct a dedicated security review of the Cube.js schema to minimize exposed measures and dimensions. Explicitly limit the fields exposed in schema definitions based on necessity. Disable GraphQL introspection in production Cube.js server configuration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Parameterized Queries via Cube.js Query Builder (Implicit Enforcement)](./mitigation_strategies/parameterized_queries_via_cube_js_query_builder__implicit_enforcement_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Parameterized Queries via Cube.js Query Builder.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enforce Cube.js Query Builder Usage:**  Strictly adhere to using the Cube.js query builder for all data fetching and manipulation within your Cube.js application. Avoid writing raw SQL queries directly within Cube.js logic.
    2.  **Code Review for Raw SQL:** Conduct code reviews to ensure developers are not inadvertently introducing raw SQL queries or bypassing the Cube.js query builder in any part of the Cube.js codebase.
    3.  **Database Connection Permissions:** Configure the database user used by Cube.js with the principle of least privilege. Grant only read permissions to the necessary tables and views required by your Cube.js schema. Avoid granting write or administrative privileges unless absolutely necessary for specific Cube.js features (like pre-aggregations).
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   SQL Injection (High Severity): Prevents SQL injection vulnerabilities by ensuring all queries are parameterized through the Cube.js query builder, which is the default and recommended approach in Cube.js.
*   **Impact:** High Reduction for SQL Injection vulnerabilities within the Cube.js application.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Largely implemented. The project primarily utilizes the Cube.js query builder. Code reviews are generally practiced, but specific focus on preventing raw SQL in Cube.js context should be reinforced. Database user permissions are under review.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Reinforce code review practices to specifically check for and prevent any introduction of raw SQL queries within Cube.js logic. Finalize the database user permission review to ensure least privilege for the Cube.js database user.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Query Complexity Limits and Throttling for Cube.js API](./mitigation_strategies/query_complexity_limits_and_throttling_for_cube_js_api.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Query Complexity Limits and Throttling for Cube.js API.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Analyze Cube.js Query Performance:** Analyze the performance characteristics of common Cube.js queries in your application. Identify queries that are potentially resource-intensive and could contribute to DoS if executed excessively.
    2.  **Rate Limiting Cube.js API Endpoints:** Implement rate limiting specifically on the Cube.js API endpoints (e.g., `/cubejs-api/v1/load`). Use middleware or reverse proxy configurations to limit the number of requests from a single IP address or user within a defined time window.
    3.  **Query Timeout Configuration (Database Level):** Configure appropriate query timeouts at the database level for queries originating from Cube.js. This prevents long-running Cube.js queries from indefinitely consuming database resources.
    4.  **Resource Monitoring and Alerting (Cube.js Specific):** Enhance resource monitoring to specifically track Cube.js server and database resource usage related to Cube.js queries. Set up alerts to notify administrators of unusual resource consumption patterns that might indicate a DoS attack targeting the Cube.js API.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) - Resource Exhaustion via Cube.js API (High Severity): Prevents attackers from overwhelming the Cube.js server or backend database by sending a large volume of complex or frequent requests to the Cube.js API.
    *   Performance Degradation of Cube.js Application (Medium Severity): Mitigates performance degradation caused by resource-intensive Cube.js queries, ensuring responsiveness for legitimate users.
*   **Impact:** High Reduction for DoS - Resource Exhaustion via Cube.js API. Medium Reduction for Performance Degradation of the Cube.js application.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic rate limiting is configured at the reverse proxy level, but may not be specifically tuned for Cube.js API request patterns. Database query timeouts are configured. General resource monitoring is in place, but Cube.js specific alerts are not fully defined.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Implement more granular rate limiting specifically targeted at Cube.js API endpoints, considering typical Cube.js query patterns. Refine resource monitoring and alerting to specifically detect DoS attacks or performance issues related to Cube.js API usage.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Leverage Cube.js Caching and Pre-aggregations for Performance and Stability](./mitigation_strategies/leverage_cube_js_caching_and_pre-aggregations_for_performance_and_stability.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Leverage Cube.js Caching and Pre-aggregations.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Cube.js Caching:** Configure Cube.js caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis, in-memory) to cache query results. Select a caching strategy suitable for your application's performance and data freshness needs. Configure cache settings in your `cube.js` server configuration.
    2.  **Implement Cache Invalidation Strategies:** Define and implement appropriate cache invalidation strategies to ensure cached data is refreshed when underlying data changes. Configure cache invalidation within your Cube.js application logic or through external mechanisms if needed.
    3.  **Identify Frequent Cube.js Queries:** Analyze application usage patterns and logs to identify frequently executed Cube.js queries or data aggregations.
    4.  **Define Pre-aggregations in Cube Schema:** For frequently queried data and aggregations, define pre-aggregations within your Cube.js schema (`schema/` directory). Pre-aggregations materialize aggregated data in advance, significantly reducing database load and improving Cube.js API response times for common queries.
    5.  **Monitor Cache and Pre-aggregation Performance:** Monitor cache hit rates, pre-aggregation usage, and Cube.js API performance to ensure caching and pre-aggregations are effective and configured optimally for performance and stability.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) - Performance Based (Medium Severity): Reduces the impact of DoS attempts that rely on overwhelming the system with a high volume of requests by serving cached responses and pre-aggregated data, reducing backend load.
    *   Performance Degradation under Load (Medium Severity): Improves Cube.js application performance and responsiveness, especially during peak usage, by reducing database query load through caching and pre-aggregations.
    *   Database Overload due to Cube.js Queries (Medium Severity): Prevents database overload and potential instability caused by excessive Cube.js query load by offloading common queries to the cache and pre-aggregations.
*   **Impact:** Medium Reduction for DoS - Performance Based, Performance Degradation, and Database Overload related to Cube.js queries.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic in-memory caching might be enabled by default. Pre-aggregations are not yet actively defined and utilized in the Cube.js schema.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Configure a robust caching mechanism like Redis for production Cube.js caching. Identify and implement pre-aggregations in the Cube.js schema for frequently used queries and data aggregations. Implement cache invalidation strategies and set up monitoring for cache and pre-aggregation performance within the Cube.js application.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Configuration Management for Cube.js](./mitigation_strategies/secure_configuration_management_for_cube_js.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Configuration Management for Cube.js.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Externalize Cube.js Configuration:** Store Cube.js specific configuration settings (database connection strings, API keys used by Cube.js, Cube Store credentials, etc.) outside of the application code repository. Utilize environment variables, configuration files loaded from outside the code directory, or a dedicated configuration management service.
    2.  **Principle of Least Privilege for Cube.js Configuration Access:** Restrict access to Cube.js configuration files and environment variables to authorized personnel and systems only. Control access at the server level and through configuration management tools.
    3.  **Secure Storage for Sensitive Cube.js Configuration:** For sensitive configuration data used by Cube.js (like database passwords, API keys, Cube Store secrets), use secure storage mechanisms like environment variables with restricted access, encrypted configuration files, or dedicated secret management services. Avoid storing secrets in plain text configuration files.
    4.  **Configuration Auditing and Versioning for Cube.js:** Implement version control for Cube.js configuration files (separate from code repository if needed) and audit logs for configuration changes. Track changes to Cube.js specific settings.
    5.  **Regular Security Audits of Cube.js Configuration:** Periodically review your Cube.js configuration files and settings to ensure they adhere to security best practices and that no misconfigurations have introduced vulnerabilities specific to Cube.js.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exposure of Sensitive Cube.js Configuration Data (High Severity): Prevents accidental or intentional exposure of sensitive configuration details related to Cube.js in code repositories or logs.
    *   Unauthorized Configuration Changes to Cube.js (Medium Severity): Reduces the risk of unauthorized modifications to Cube.js application configuration that could lead to security vulnerabilities or service disruptions specifically within the Cube.js application.
*   **Impact:** High Reduction for Exposure of Sensitive Cube.js Configuration Data. Medium Reduction for Unauthorized Configuration Changes to Cube.js.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Cube.js configuration is partially externalized using environment variables. Sensitive credentials used by Cube.js are also managed via environment variables, but could be improved. Access control to environment variables is managed at the server level. Configuration auditing and versioning for Cube.js specific settings are not yet implemented.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Implement a dedicated secret management service for sensitive configuration data used by Cube.js. Implement version control and auditing specifically for Cube.js configuration changes. Conduct a security audit of the current Cube.js configuration to identify and address any potential misconfigurations specific to Cube.js.
