### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Malicious Query Definitions

**Attack Path:** Malicious Query Definitions

**Critical Node:** CRITICAL NODE

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious code directly into CubeQL query definitions. If user input is not properly sanitized before being incorporated into these queries (especially within the `sql` attribute), attackers can execute arbitrary SQL commands on the underlying database. This can lead to:
    * **Data Exfiltration:** Stealing sensitive data from the database.
    * **Data Manipulation:** Modifying or deleting data within the database.
    * **Privilege Escalation:** Gaining higher levels of access within the database.
    * **Remote Code Execution:** In some database configurations, executing operating system commands on the database server.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

This attack path highlights a classic SQL Injection vulnerability within the context of a Cube.js application. The core issue lies in the dynamic construction of SQL queries based on user-provided input without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**How the Attack Works:**

1. **Attacker Identifies Input Points:** The attacker first identifies potential areas where user input can influence the CubeQL query definitions. This could be through:
    * **Directly manipulating API requests:**  If the application exposes an API that allows users to define or modify CubeQL queries (even indirectly through UI elements), attackers can craft malicious requests.
    * **Exploiting vulnerabilities in data sources:** If Cube.js integrates with external data sources where users can influence data that is subsequently used in query definitions, this could be an entry point.
    * **Compromising developer accounts:** If an attacker gains access to developer accounts, they could directly modify the Cube schema files where query definitions reside.

2. **Malicious Payload Injection:** Once an entry point is identified, the attacker injects malicious SQL code into the user-controlled input. This code is designed to be interpreted and executed by the underlying database when the CubeQL query is processed.

3. **Exploiting the `sql` Attribute:** The `sql` attribute within a Cube's measure or dimension definition is a prime target. If user input is directly concatenated into the `sql` string without proper escaping or parameterization, the injected malicious code becomes part of the executed SQL query.

**Example Scenario:**

Imagine a Cube definition where a filter is applied based on user input:

```javascript
cube(`Orders`, {
  measures: {
    totalRevenue: {
      sql: `SUM(${Orders.price})`,
      type: `number`
    }
  },
  dimensions: {
    customerName: {
      sql: `${Orders.customer_name}`,
      type: `string`
    }
  },
  preAggregations: {
    // ...
  },
  joins: {
    // ...
  },
  filters: [
    {
      sql: `${this.customerName} = ${filterParam('customer')}` // Vulnerable point
    }
  ]
});
```

If the `filterParam('customer')` directly incorporates user input without sanitization, an attacker could provide the following input:

```
' OR 1=1 --
```

This would result in the following SQL being executed (assuming the database uses single quotes for strings):

```sql
SELECT SUM(orders.price) FROM orders WHERE orders.customer_name = '' OR 1=1 --'
```

The `OR 1=1` condition will always be true, effectively bypassing the intended filter and potentially returning all orders. The `--` comments out the remaining part of the original query, preventing syntax errors.

**Impact Analysis:**

The consequences of a successful "Malicious Query Definitions" attack can be severe:

* **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can craft SQL queries to extract sensitive data from the database, including customer information, financial records, or intellectual property. They might use `UNION ALL SELECT` statements to append their malicious data retrieval queries to the original query.
* **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database using `UPDATE`, `INSERT`, or `DELETE` statements. This can lead to data corruption, financial losses, and operational disruptions.
* **Privilege Escalation:** If the database user used by Cube.js has elevated privileges, attackers can leverage SQL injection to grant themselves or other malicious users higher levels of access within the database. This could involve creating new administrative accounts or modifying existing user permissions.
* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In certain database configurations (e.g., using stored procedures or specific database features), attackers might be able to execute operating system commands on the database server. This is a critical vulnerability that can lead to complete system compromise.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To effectively mitigate the risk of "Malicious Query Definitions" attacks, the following strategies should be implemented:

* **Input Sanitization and Validation:**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user input before it is used in CubeQL query definitions. This includes:
    * **Escaping special characters:**  Properly escape characters that have special meaning in SQL (e.g., single quotes, double quotes, backticks).
    * **Using allow lists:**  Define allowed values or patterns for user input and reject anything that doesn't conform.
    * **Data type validation:** Ensure that user input matches the expected data type.

* **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):**  Utilize parameterized queries whenever possible. This is the most effective way to prevent SQL injection. Instead of directly embedding user input into the SQL string, placeholders are used, and the values are passed separately to the database. This ensures that the input is treated as data, not executable code. While Cube.js abstracts away some direct SQL writing, ensure that any mechanisms used to dynamically build queries internally leverage parameterization.

* **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant the database user used by Cube.js only the necessary permissions to perform its intended functions. Avoid using highly privileged accounts. This limits the potential damage an attacker can cause even if SQL injection is successful.

* **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:** Conduct regular security audits and code reviews to identify potential vulnerabilities in the Cube.js application and its query definitions. Pay close attention to how user input is handled and how SQL queries are constructed.

* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Implement a WAF to filter out malicious requests before they reach the application. WAFs can detect and block common SQL injection patterns.

* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While not directly preventing SQL injection, a strong CSP can help mitigate the impact of other attacks that might be chained with SQL injection, such as cross-site scripting (XSS).

* **Regular Updates and Patching:** Keep Cube.js and all its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.

* **Secure Coding Practices:** Educate developers on secure coding practices, particularly regarding SQL injection prevention.

**Detection and Monitoring:**

Implementing robust detection and monitoring mechanisms is crucial for identifying and responding to potential attacks:

* **Database Activity Monitoring:** Monitor database logs for suspicious activity, such as unusual query patterns, failed login attempts, or attempts to access sensitive data.
* **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Deploy IDS/IPS solutions to detect and potentially block malicious SQL injection attempts.
* **Anomaly Detection:** Implement systems that can detect unusual patterns in application behavior, which might indicate an ongoing attack.
* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Aggregate security logs from various sources (application, database, network) to provide a comprehensive view of security events and facilitate incident response.

**Conclusion:**

The "Malicious Query Definitions" attack path represents a significant security risk for Cube.js applications. The potential for data exfiltration, manipulation, privilege escalation, and even remote code execution highlights the critical need for robust security measures. By implementing thorough input sanitization, utilizing parameterized queries, adhering to the principle of least privilege, and establishing comprehensive detection and monitoring mechanisms, development teams can significantly reduce the likelihood and impact of this type of attack. Prioritizing secure coding practices and regular security assessments is paramount in building a resilient and secure Cube.js application.
