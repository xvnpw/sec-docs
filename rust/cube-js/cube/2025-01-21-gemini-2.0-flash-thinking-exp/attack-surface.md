# Attack Surface Analysis for cube-js/cube

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Cube Definitions](./attack_surfaces/malicious_cube_definitions.md)

* **Description:** Attackers inject malicious logic or queries within the Cube.js schema definitions (`.cube` files).
    * **How Cube Contributes:** Cube.js relies on these definitions to understand data structure and generate queries. If these definitions are compromised, the entire data access layer can be manipulated.
    * **Example:** An attacker modifies a `.cube` file to include a `sql` definition that performs a `DELETE` operation on a sensitive table when a seemingly innocuous query is executed.
    * **Impact:** Data loss, data corruption, denial of service, potential privilege escalation if the database user has excessive permissions.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strict access control and version control for the repository containing Cube.js schema definitions.
        * Enforce code review processes for any changes to `.cube` files.
        * Use a secure CI/CD pipeline to deploy changes, minimizing manual intervention.
        * Consider using a separate, less privileged database user for Cube.js if possible.

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Cube.js API Endpoint](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_cube_js_api_endpoint.md)

* **Description:** The Cube.js API endpoint is exposed without proper authentication and authorization, allowing unauthorized access.
    * **How Cube Contributes:** Cube.js exposes a GraphQL API endpoint for querying data. If this endpoint is not secured, anyone can potentially access and query the data.
    * **Example:** An attacker directly accesses the `/cubejs-api/v1` endpoint and crafts GraphQL queries to retrieve sensitive customer data without any authentication.
    * **Impact:** Data breach, information disclosure, potential for data manipulation if mutations are enabled and unsecured.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement robust authentication mechanisms (e.g., JWT, API keys) for the Cube.js API endpoint.
        * Implement fine-grained authorization rules to control which users or applications can access specific data or perform certain actions.
        * Ensure the API endpoint is not publicly accessible if it doesn't need to be. Use network segmentation or firewalls.

## Attack Surface: [GraphQL Query Complexity Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/graphql_query_complexity_exploitation.md)

* **Description:** Attackers craft excessively complex or nested GraphQL queries to overwhelm the Cube.js server.
    * **How Cube Contributes:** Cube.js uses GraphQL, which allows for complex data retrieval in a single request. This flexibility can be abused to create resource-intensive queries.
    * **Example:** An attacker sends a deeply nested GraphQL query with numerous joins and aggregations, causing the Cube.js server to consume excessive CPU and memory, leading to a denial of service.
    * **Impact:** Denial of service, performance degradation for legitimate users.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement query complexity analysis and limits within Cube.js configuration.
        * Set timeouts for query execution.
        * Implement rate limiting on the API endpoint to prevent excessive requests.
        * Monitor server resources and set up alerts for unusual activity.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure `sql` or `preAggregations` Definitions leading to SQL Injection](./attack_surfaces/insecure__sql__or__preaggregations__definitions_leading_to_sql_injection.md)

* **Description:**  Improperly sanitized or constructed SQL within `sql` or `preAggregations` definitions can be vulnerable to SQL injection if user-provided data is incorporated without proper validation.
    * **How Cube Contributes:** While Cube.js aims to abstract SQL, developers might use raw SQL features or dynamic query generation within Cube definitions, potentially introducing vulnerabilities.
    * **Example:** A Cube definition uses a string concatenation to build a `WHERE` clause based on a user-provided filter, without proper escaping, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL.
    * **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, potential for arbitrary code execution on the database server (depending on database permissions).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid constructing SQL queries dynamically based on user input within Cube definitions whenever possible.
        * If dynamic SQL is necessary, use parameterized queries or prepared statements provided by the database driver.
        * Thoroughly validate and sanitize any user input that is used in SQL queries.
        * Regularly review Cube definitions for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.
