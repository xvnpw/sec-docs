# Threat Model Analysis for cube-js/cube

## Threat: [Information Disclosure through Overly Permissive Data Models](./threats/information_disclosure_through_overly_permissive_data_models.md)

*   **Threat:** Information Disclosure through Overly Permissive Data Models
    *   **Description:** An attacker could exploit poorly defined Cube.js data models to access sensitive information they should not have access to. This could involve crafting queries through the Cube.js API that target fields or relationships they are not authorized for. This is achieved by exploiting missing or incorrect `securityContext` rules or overly broad `sql` definitions that don't properly filter sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive customer data, financial information, or other confidential details. This can lead to compliance violations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), reputational damage, and potential legal repercussions.
    *   **Affected Component:** Cube Store (Data Model Definitions, specifically the `sql` property, `joins`, and `securityContext`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement mandatory code reviews for all data model definitions, focusing on security implications.
        *   Enforce the principle of least privilege in `securityContext` rules, granting access only to necessary data.
        *   Regularly audit and test `securityContext` configurations.
        *   Use parameterized queries and avoid constructing SQL dynamically within data models.

## Threat: [Code Injection through Unsafe Dynamic SQL Generation in Data Models](./threats/code_injection_through_unsafe_dynamic_sql_generation_in_data_models.md)

*   **Threat:** Code Injection through Unsafe Dynamic SQL Generation in Data Models
    *   **Description:** While Cube.js aims to abstract SQL, developers might introduce vulnerabilities by dynamically constructing SQL queries within the data model based on user input without proper sanitization. An attacker could inject malicious SQL code through these input points, potentially altering or accessing unauthorized data.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, potential compromise of the underlying database.
    *   **Affected Component:** Cube Store (Data Model Definitions, specifically if dynamic SQL generation is used).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid dynamic SQL generation within Cube.js data models whenever possible.
        *   If dynamic SQL is absolutely necessary, use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for any user-provided data used in query construction.

## Threat: [Insufficient Authorization Enforcement at the Cube.js API Level](./threats/insufficient_authorization_enforcement_at_the_cube_js_api_level.md)

*   **Threat:** Insufficient Authorization Enforcement at the Cube.js API Level
    *   **Description:** An attacker could bypass intended authorization controls if the application relies solely on Cube.js's built-in `securityContext` and doesn't implement additional authorization checks at the application layer. Vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in the `securityContext` could allow unauthorized access to data through the Cube.js API.
    *   **Impact:** Users accessing data they are not authorized to see, potentially leading to data breaches or misuse.
    *   **Affected Component:** Cube.js API, `securityContext`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust authorization checks at the application layer in addition to Cube.js's `securityContext`.
        *   Regularly review and audit `securityContext` rules for correctness and completeness.
        *   Consider using a dedicated authorization service or framework in conjunction with Cube.js.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data through Unsecured Cube.js API Endpoints](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_through_unsecured_cube_js_api_endpoints.md)

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Data through Unsecured Cube.js API Endpoints
    *   **Description:** An attacker could directly access Cube.js API endpoints if they are not properly secured with authentication and authorization mechanisms. This allows them to bypass the application's intended user interface and directly query data, potentially exposing sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    *   **Affected Component:** Cube.js API.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication mechanisms for the Cube.js API (e.g., API keys, JWTs).
        *   Enforce HTTPS for all communication with the Cube.js API to protect data in transit.
        *   Restrict access to the Cube.js API to authorized clients or services.

## Threat: [Exposure of API Keys or Database Credentials in Cube.js Configuration](./threats/exposure_of_api_keys_or_database_credentials_in_cube_js_configuration.md)

*   **Threat:** Exposure of API Keys or Database Credentials in Cube.js Configuration
    *   **Description:** If API keys or database credentials required by Cube.js are stored insecurely (e.g., in plain text configuration files, committed to version control), an attacker who gains access to the application's codebase or server could retrieve these credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data sources, potential for data breaches, and the ability to manipulate or delete data.
    *   **Affected Component:** Cube.js Configuration (e.g., `cube.js` file, environment variables).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use secure methods for storing and managing secrets (e.g., environment variables, dedicated secret management tools like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
        *   Avoid committing sensitive information to version control.
        *   Implement proper access controls on configuration files.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Cube.js Dependencies](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_in_cube_js_dependencies.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Cube.js Dependencies
    *   **Description:** Cube.js relies on various third-party libraries and dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited by attackers to compromise the Cube.js instance or the application using it.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for various security breaches depending on the nature of the dependency vulnerability, including remote code execution, data breaches, and denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Cube.js Dependencies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability (can be Critical or High).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update Cube.js and its dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify and monitor for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
        *   Implement a process for promptly addressing identified vulnerabilities.
