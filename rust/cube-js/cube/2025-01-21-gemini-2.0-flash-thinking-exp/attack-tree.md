## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Cube.js ***HIGH-RISK PATH***](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_cube_js_high-risk_path.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Cube.js Server Vulnerabilities **CRITICAL NODE**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_cube_js_server_vulnerabilities_critical_node.md)

This represents the broad category of attacks targeting weaknesses in the Cube.js server itself. Successful exploitation here can grant significant control to the attacker, making it a critical entry point.

## Attack Tree Path: [Code Injection ***HIGH-RISK PATH***](./attack_tree_paths/code_injection_high-risk_path.md)

This attack path involves injecting malicious code that is then executed by the Cube.js server or its underlying systems. This can lead to severe consequences like data breaches or server takeover.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Query Definitions **CRITICAL NODE**](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_query_definitions_critical_node.md)

Attackers inject malicious code directly into CubeQL query definitions. If user input is not properly sanitized before being incorporated into these queries (especially within the `sql` attribute), attackers can execute arbitrary SQL commands on the underlying database. This can lead to:
    * **Data Exfiltration:** Stealing sensitive data from the database.
    * **Data Manipulation:** Modifying or deleting data within the database.
    * **Privilege Escalation:** Gaining higher levels of access within the database.
    * **Remote Code Execution:** In some database configurations, executing operating system commands on the database server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Cube.js Core or Dependencies **CRITICAL NODE**](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_cube_js_core_or_dependencies_critical_node.md)

Cube.js, like any software, may contain security vulnerabilities in its own code or in the third-party libraries it depends on. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities through crafted API requests or other means. Successful exploitation can lead to:
    * **Remote Code Execution:** Executing arbitrary code on the Cube.js server.
    * **Denial of Service:** Crashing the server or making it unavailable.
    * **Information Disclosure:** Accessing sensitive information stored in memory or configuration files.
    * **Authentication Bypass:** Circumventing the authentication mechanisms.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypassing Security Controls ***HIGH-RISK PATH***](./attack_tree_paths/bypassing_security_controls_high-risk_path.md)

This attack path focuses on circumventing the security measures designed to protect the Cube.js application. Successful bypass can grant unauthorized access and control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Authentication Bypass **CRITICAL NODE**](./attack_tree_paths/authentication_bypass_critical_node.md)

Attackers exploit flaws in the Cube.js authentication mechanisms to gain access without providing valid credentials. This can involve:
    * **JWT (JSON Web Token) Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting weaknesses in how JWTs are generated, signed, or verified.
    * **Session Management Issues:** Hijacking or forging user sessions.
    * **Credential Stuffing/Brute-Force:** Attempting to guess valid usernames and passwords (though this is less specific to Cube.js).
    * **Exploiting Default Credentials:** If default credentials are not changed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Misconfiguration Exploitation **CRITICAL NODE**](./attack_tree_paths/misconfiguration_exploitation_critical_node.md)

Insecure default configurations or misconfigurations in the Cube.js deployment can create vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit. Examples include:
    * **Weak Secrets or API Keys:** Using easily guessable or default secrets for authentication or encryption.
    * **Exposed Internal Ports:** Leaving internal ports accessible to the public internet.
    * **Insecure CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) Settings:** Allowing unauthorized domains to access the Cube.js API.
    * **Disabled Security Features:** Failing to enable important security features.
    * **Verbose Error Messages in Production:** Exposing sensitive information in error messages.
