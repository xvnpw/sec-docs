*   **Threat:** Deserialization of Untrusted Data leading to Resource Exhaustion
    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a maliciously crafted serialized payload that, when processed by Serde's deserialization logic, causes excessive memory allocation or CPU usage. This is due to the inherent way Serde handles complex data structures during deserialization.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) - the application becomes unresponsive or crashes due to resource exhaustion, impacting availability for legitimate users.
    *   **Affected Serde Component:** `Deserializer` trait implementation (core Serde functionality).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement limits on the depth and size of deserialized data. Many Serde format crates offer configuration options that interact with Serde's core deserialization.
        *   Set timeouts for deserialization operations.
        *   Implement rate limiting on endpoints that accept serialized data.
        *   Use resource monitoring and alerting to detect abnormal resource consumption.

*   **Threat:** Information Disclosure through Serialization
    *   **Description:** The application uses Serde to serialize data structures containing sensitive information without proper filtering. Serde's serialization process faithfully converts the data into the chosen format, potentially exposing sensitive information if the output is not handled securely.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data to unauthorized parties.
    *   **Affected Serde Component:** `Serializer` trait implementation (core Serde functionality).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully review the data being serialized and ensure that sensitive information is not included unnecessarily.
        *   Use the `#[serde(skip)]` attribute or custom serialization logic within your `Serialize` implementations to exclude sensitive fields.
        *   Encrypt sensitive data before serialization if it needs to be stored or transmitted.
        *   Avoid logging or exposing serialized data containing sensitive information.
