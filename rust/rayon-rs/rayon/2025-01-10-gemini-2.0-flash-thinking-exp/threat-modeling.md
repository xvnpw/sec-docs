# Threat Model Analysis for rayon-rs/rayon

## Threat: [Data Race Exploitation](./threats/data_race_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could craft inputs or trigger specific execution paths that cause unsynchronized concurrent access to shared mutable data *within Rayon's parallel tasks*. This can lead to unpredictable behavior, data corruption, and potentially exploitable vulnerabilities like use-after-free or buffer overflows. The attacker might manipulate input data size or structure to increase the likelihood of race conditions occurring *specifically within Rayon's parallel execution*.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, incorrect data processing leading to business logic errors, potential for arbitrary code execution if memory corruption is severe enough.
    *   **Affected Rayon Component:** Primarily affects code using Rayon's parallel iterators (`par_iter`, `par_bridge`, etc.) and any shared data structures accessed within those iterations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Employ robust synchronization primitives (e.g., `Mutex`, `RwLock`, atomic operations) to protect shared mutable data accessed within Rayon's parallel closures.
        *   Favor immutable data structures and copy-on-write techniques when working with Rayon's parallel iterators.
        *   Use thread-safe data structures specifically designed for concurrent access within Rayon's parallel contexts.
        *   Thoroughly test concurrent code executed by Rayon with tools like ThreadSanitizer.
        *   Conduct careful code reviews focusing on data access patterns within parallel blocks managed by Rayon.

## Threat: [Deadlock Induced Denial of Service](./threats/deadlock_induced_denial_of_service.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could devise a scenario where parallel tasks *managed by Rayon* become deadlocked, blocking each other indefinitely. This could involve manipulating input data or triggering specific sequences of operations within the closures passed to Rayon's parallel methods that lead to circular dependencies in lock acquisition. The attacker's goal is to freeze the application and prevent it from serving legitimate requests by exploiting Rayon's parallel execution.
    *   **Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive, leading to denial of service for legitimate users.
    *   **Affected Rayon Component:** Code utilizing synchronization primitives within parallel tasks spawned by Rayon (e.g., within `for_each`, `map`, `reduce` closures).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Establish and enforce clear lock acquisition order within the closures executed by Rayon to prevent circular dependencies.
        *   Use timeouts for lock acquisition within Rayon's parallel tasks to prevent indefinite blocking.
        *   Employ techniques like lock hierarchies or try-lock mechanisms within the context of Rayon's parallel execution.
        *   Design parallel algorithms used with Rayon to minimize the need for complex locking.
        *   Monitor application threads managed by Rayon for signs of deadlocks in production.

## Threat: [Thread Pool Exhaustion Attack](./threats/thread_pool_exhaustion_attack.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could flood the application with requests or inputs that trigger the creation of a large number of parallel tasks, potentially exhausting *Rayon's global thread pool*. This would prevent legitimate tasks from being executed, effectively causing a denial of service. The attacker might exploit endpoints that perform computationally intensive tasks *using Rayon*.
    *   **Impact:** Application becomes slow or unresponsive, leading to denial of service.
    *   **Affected Rayon Component:** The global thread pool managed by Rayon.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting on API endpoints or functionalities that utilize Rayon.
        *   Set reasonable limits on the number of parallel tasks that can be spawned *by Rayon* for a given request or operation.
        *   Consider using a custom thread pool with configurable limits if fine-grained control over Rayon's thread management is needed.
        *   Monitor thread pool usage and resource consumption of Rayon.

## Threat: [Exploiting `unsafe` Code in Parallel Context](./threats/exploiting__unsafe__code_in_parallel_context.md)

*   **Description:** If `unsafe` code is used within parallel tasks *managed by Rayon*, the potential for memory safety issues and undefined behavior is amplified due to concurrent execution facilitated by Rayon. An attacker might exploit vulnerabilities within `unsafe` blocks that are exposed by parallel access orchestrated by Rayon.
    *   **Impact:** Memory corruption, arbitrary code execution, application crash.
    *   **Affected Rayon Component:** Parallel tasks spawned by Rayon that contain or interact with `unsafe` code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Minimize the use of `unsafe` code within parallel tasks executed by Rayon.
        *   Thoroughly audit and verify the correctness of `unsafe` code, especially in concurrent contexts managed by Rayon.
        *   Use memory-safe abstractions and wrappers around `unsafe` operations used within Rayon's parallel execution.
        *   Employ static analysis tools to detect potential issues in `unsafe` code used with Rayon.
