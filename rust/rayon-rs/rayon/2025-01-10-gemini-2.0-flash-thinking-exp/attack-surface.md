# Attack Surface Analysis for rayon-rs/rayon

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion via Unbounded Parallelism](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_via_unbounded_parallelism.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can manipulate input data or task generation to force the application to create an excessive number of threads, overwhelming system resources.
*   **How Rayon Contributes:** Rayon's ease of creating parallel iterators and tasks directly enables developers to implement logic that can lead to unbounded parallelism if input size isn't carefully controlled. The library makes it simple to spawn a large number of parallel operations.
*   **Example:** A data processing application uses Rayon to process elements of a user-provided list in parallel. An attacker provides an extremely large list, causing Rayon to spawn a massive number of threads, leading to CPU exhaustion and system slowdown.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), application slowdown, system instability.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization to limit the size or complexity of data that can trigger parallel tasks.
    *   Set explicit limits on the number of parallel tasks or threads that can be spawned, regardless of input size.
    *   Utilize Rayon's thread pool configuration options to control the maximum number of worker threads, preventing uncontrolled thread creation.
    *   Implement resource monitoring and circuit breakers to detect and mitigate excessive resource consumption due to parallel processing.
