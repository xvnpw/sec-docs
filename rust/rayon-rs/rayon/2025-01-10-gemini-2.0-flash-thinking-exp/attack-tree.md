## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Data Races](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploit_data_races.md)

- **Trigger Concurrent Modification of Shared Data [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    - An attacker crafts input or triggers actions that cause multiple Rayon tasks to access and modify the same memory location concurrently without proper synchronization mechanisms (like mutexes or atomic operations).
    - This can lead to unpredictable outcomes where the final state of the data depends on the non-deterministic order of thread execution.
    - **Impact:** Data corruption, application logic errors, and potentially exploitable security vulnerabilities due to inconsistent data states.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Deadlocks](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_deadlocks.md)

- **Create Circular Dependency in Task Execution [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    - An attacker manipulates the application's state or provides input that creates a circular dependency between Rayon tasks.
    - For example, Task A might be waiting for a resource held by Task B, while Task B is waiting for a resource held by Task A.
    - **Impact:** The application becomes unresponsive, leading to a denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Resource Exhaustion via Parallelism](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploit_resource_exhaustion_via_parallelism.md)

- **Launch Fork Bomb via Rayon:**
    - An attacker provides input or triggers actions that cause the application to recursively spawn an excessive number of Rayon tasks.
    - This rapidly consumes available system resources (CPU, memory, threads), leading to a denial of service.
    - **Impact:** Critical denial of service, potentially crashing the application and even the underlying system.
- **Submit Computationally Expensive Tasks in Parallel:**
    - An attacker provides input that triggers the parallel execution of numerous or extremely resource-intensive tasks using Rayon.
    - This overwhelms the system's processing capabilities, leading to performance degradation or a complete denial of service.
    - **Impact:** High denial of service, making the application unusable.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Unsafe Abstractions or APIs in Rayon](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_unsafe_abstractions_or_apis_in_rayon.md)

- **Identify Unsafe or Misused Rayon Features [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    - An attacker analyzes the application's code to identify instances where Rayon's "unsafe" features or APIs are used incorrectly.
    - This could involve misuse of `unsafe` blocks, incorrect handling of raw pointers, or improper use of channels or shared memory primitives.
    - **Impact:** Memory corruption, undefined behavior, and potentially arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Bugs or Vulnerabilities within Rayon Library Itself](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_bugs_or_vulnerabilities_within_rayon_library_itself.md)

- **Discover a Security Vulnerability in Rayon's Code [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    - A sophisticated attacker identifies a previously unknown security flaw within the Rayon library's source code.
    - This requires a deep understanding of Rayon's internals and security principles.
    - **Impact:** Critical - potential for arbitrary code execution, complete system compromise, or significant information disclosure, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
