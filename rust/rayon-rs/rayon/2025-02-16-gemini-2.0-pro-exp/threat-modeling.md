# Threat Model Analysis for rayon-rs/rayon

## Threat: [Data Race Exploitation](./threats/data_race_exploitation.md)

*   **Threat:** Data Race Exploitation
*   **Description:** An attacker provides crafted input or manipulates the application's state in a way that triggers a data race within a Rayon parallel operation. This could involve rapidly changing shared data while a parallel computation is in progress, exploiting timing windows. The attacker aims to corrupt data used in security-critical decisions (e.g., authentication checks, authorization logic, data validation).
*   **Impact:** High to Critical. Data corruption can lead to privilege escalation, bypass of security controls, arbitrary code execution (if the corrupted data influences memory management), or denial of service.
*   **Affected Rayon Component:**
    *   `par_iter_mut()`: Most vulnerable when operating on shared mutable data without proper synchronization.
    *   `par_iter()`: Vulnerable if closures capture mutable references or interact with shared mutable state through `unsafe` code.
    *   Any parallel construct (`join`, `scope`, custom thread pools) used with improperly synchronized shared mutable state.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Immutable Data:** Prefer immutable data structures for parallel computations.
    *   **Atomic Operations:** Use `std::sync::atomic` types for shared counters or flags.
    *   **Mutexes/RwLocks:** Use `std::sync::Mutex` or `std::sync::RwLock` to protect shared mutable data, ensuring locks are held *only* within the parallel closure and for the shortest possible duration.
    *   **`rayon::scope`:** Use `rayon::scope` to create a structured parallel scope, ensuring that all spawned threads complete before the scope exits, simplifying lifetime management.
    *   **ThreadSanitizer:** Run tests under ThreadSanitizer to detect data races during development.
    *   **Code Review:** Thoroughly review code for potential data races, especially in sections using `unsafe` or shared mutable state.

## Threat: [Deadlock-Induced Denial of Service](./threats/deadlock-induced_denial_of_service.md)

*   **Threat:** Deadlock-Induced Denial of Service
*   **Description:** An attacker crafts input or manipulates the application's state to trigger a deadlock between Rayon-managed threads and other application threads, or within Rayon's internal thread pool. This typically involves holding locks across parallel operations or creating circular dependencies in lock acquisition.
*   **Impact:** High. The application becomes unresponsive, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Affected Rayon Component:**
    *   Any Rayon parallel construct (`par_iter`, `par_iter_mut`, `join`, `scope`, custom thread pools) used in conjunction with external synchronization primitives (mutexes, etc.).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Locks Across Parallel Operations:**  Do *not* hold locks (mutexes, etc.) across calls to Rayon's parallel iterators or functions. Acquire and release locks *within* the parallel closure.
    *   **Consistent Locking Order:** If multiple locks are required, ensure a consistent locking order across all threads to prevent circular dependencies.
    *   **Minimize Lock Contention:** Design the parallel logic to minimize the need for shared mutable state and lock contention.
    *   **Timeout Mechanisms:** Consider using timeouts when acquiring locks to prevent indefinite blocking.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion (Thread/Memory) Denial of Service](./threats/resource_exhaustion__threadmemory__denial_of_service.md)

*   **Threat:** Resource Exhaustion (Thread/Memory) Denial of Service
*   **Description:** An attacker provides a very large input dataset or triggers a computationally intensive operation that causes Rayon to create an excessive number of threads or allocate a large amount of memory. This overwhelms system resources, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Impact:** High. The application crashes or becomes unresponsive.
*   **Affected Rayon Component:**
    *   All parallel constructs (`par_iter`, `par_iter_mut`, `join`, `scope`, etc.) are potentially affected, especially when processing unbounded input.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Bounded Thread Pool:** Use `rayon::ThreadPoolBuilder::new().num_threads(...)` to create a thread pool with a fixed, limited number of threads.
    *   **Input Validation:**  Strictly validate the size and complexity of input data.  Reject excessively large inputs.
    *   **Chunking:** Use `par_chunks` or `par_chunks_mut` to process large datasets in smaller, manageable chunks.
    *   **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor CPU, memory, and thread usage to detect and respond to potential resource exhaustion.
    * **Adaptive Parallelism (Advanced):** Consider techniques to dynamically adjust the level of parallelism based on system load.
