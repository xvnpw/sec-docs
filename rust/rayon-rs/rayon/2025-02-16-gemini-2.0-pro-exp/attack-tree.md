## Attack Tree Path: [1. Denial of Service (DoS) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1__denial_of_service__dos___critical_.md)

*   **Description:**  The attacker aims to prevent the application from functioning correctly by exhausting resources or causing it to crash. This is a critical threat because a successful DoS attack can render the application unusable.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Thread Exhaustion [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_thread_exhaustion__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** Overwhelm Rayon's thread pool, preventing legitimate tasks from being executed. This is critical because Rayon's core functionality relies on its thread pool.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2 Submit Tasks with Long-Running or Blocking Callbacks [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_submit_tasks_with_long-running_or_blocking_callbacks__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker crafts requests that cause the application to execute user-provided callbacks that either take a very long time to complete or block indefinitely (e.g., waiting on I/O without yielding). This ties up Rayon's worker threads, preventing other tasks from running.
*   **Likelihood:** High
*   **Impact:** High (complete application unresponsiveness)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Data Race DoS (Indirect) (Through Work-Stealing)](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_data_race_dos__indirect___through_work-stealing_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting data races in user-provided code to cause unexpected behavior, potentially leading to crashes or hangs. Rayon facilitates this by enabling parallel execution.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1 Trigger Data Race in User Code [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_trigger_data_race_in_user_code__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker crafts input that triggers a data race within the user-provided callback functions. This occurs if the callbacks access shared mutable state without proper synchronization.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium (crashes, incorrect results, or hangs)
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2__arbitrary_code_execution__ace___critical_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary code within the context of the application. This is a critical threat because it can lead to complete system compromise.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1 Unsafe Code Bugs in Rayon [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_unsafe_code_bugs_in_rayon__critical_.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in Rayon's `unsafe` Rust code.  `unsafe` code bypasses some of Rust's safety guarantees for performance reasons, making it a potential source of memory safety issues.
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** Very High (complete system compromise)
*   **Effort:** High
*   **Skill Level:** Expert
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2 Double-Free or Memory Corruption in Rayon [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_double-free_or_memory_corruption_in_rayon__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** A specific type of `unsafe` code bug where Rayon incorrectly manages memory, leading to double-freeing or other corruption.
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** Very High (complete system compromise)
*   **Effort:** High
*   **Skill Level:** Expert
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [2.3 Use-After-Free in Rayon's Internal Logic [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2_3_use-after-free_in_rayon's_internal_logic__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** Another specific type of `unsafe` code bug where Rayon uses memory after it has been freed.
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** Very High (complete system compromise)
*   **Effort:** High
*   **Skill Level:** Expert
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard
