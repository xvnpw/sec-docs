# Attack Surface Analysis for rayon-rs/rayon

## Attack Surface: [Data Races due to Unsound `Send`/`Sync`](./attack_surfaces/data_races_due_to_unsound__send__sync_.md)

*   **Description:** Data races occur when multiple threads access shared data concurrently, with at least one thread modifying the data, without proper synchronization. This leads to unpredictable behavior and data corruption.
*   **How Rayon Contributes:** Rayon *directly* enables parallel execution, making it far more likely to trigger latent data races that would be unlikely or impossible to hit in sequential code. Rayon's core functionality relies on the *correctness* of `Send` and `Sync` implementations for thread safety. If these are incorrect (unsound), Rayon will expose the underlying flaws.
*   **Example:**
    *   A struct containing a `Vec` is incorrectly marked as `Send` and `Sync`. Multiple Rayon threads (initiated by `par_iter_mut()`, for example) attempt to push elements onto the `Vec` concurrently without locking, leading to memory corruption.
    *   A custom data structure uses raw pointers internally and incorrectly claims to be `Send` and `Sync` without proper internal synchronization. Rayon parallelizes operations on this structure (e.g., via `par_iter()`), leading to use-after-free or double-free errors.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, program crashes, undefined behavior, potentially leading to denial of service or, in rare but possible cases, exploitable vulnerabilities (if the corruption affects control flow or memory management).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   **Strictly adhere to Rust's ownership and borrowing rules.** Avoid shared mutable state whenever possible.
        *   **Use established synchronization primitives (Mutex, RwLock, Atomic types) *correctly*** when shared mutable state is unavoidable. Carefully consider locking granularity.
        *   **Thoroughly vet all dependencies** for correct `Send` and `Sync` implementations. Use tools like `cargo-geiger`.
        *   **Prioritize well-tested and widely-used crates.**
        *   **Employ extensive testing, including stress testing and fuzzing,** to expose potential race conditions. Consider using tools like Loom.
        *   **Minimize `unsafe` code.** If `unsafe` is necessary, audit it meticulously and ensure proper synchronization.

## Attack Surface: [Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (Thread Pool Exhaustion)](./attack_surfaces/uncontrolled_resource_consumption__thread_pool_exhaustion_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could attempt to exhaust system resources (CPU, memory) by triggering excessive thread creation or by causing Rayon to perform a very large number of small tasks.
*   **How Rayon Contributes:** Rayon *directly* manages a thread pool to execute parallel tasks. While it has default limits, a misconfigured custom thread pool (using `ThreadPoolBuilder`) or carefully crafted input could lead to resource exhaustion. Rayon's *purpose* is to manage threads, so this is a direct contribution.
*   **Example:**
    *   An application uses a custom Rayon thread pool (via `ThreadPoolBuilder::new().num_threads(...)`) with a very high maximum thread limit. An attacker provides input that causes the application to spawn a massive number of tiny parallel tasks (e.g., many calls to `par_iter()` on small chunks), overwhelming the system.
    *   An application processes user-uploaded data. An attacker uploads a specially crafted file designed to trigger an extremely large number of parallel operations within Rayon, even if each individual operation is small. The application uses Rayon's default global pool, but the sheer volume of tasks still causes significant resource strain.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service (DoS) due to resource exhaustion.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   **Prefer Rayon's default global thread pool** unless a custom pool is absolutely necessary.
        *   **If a custom thread pool is required, carefully configure its maximum size** using `ThreadPoolBuilder`. Set a limit appropriate for the expected workload and system resources.
        *   **Implement input validation and sanitization** to limit the size or complexity of data that can trigger parallel processing. This is crucial for preventing DoS attacks.
        *   **Monitor thread pool usage and system resource consumption.** Implement alerting.
    *   **User/Administrator:**
        *   **Run the application with appropriate resource limits (e.g., `ulimit` on Linux).**

## Attack Surface: [Incorrect `unsafe` Code Interacting with Rayon](./attack_surfaces/incorrect__unsafe__code_interacting_with_rayon.md)

*   **Description:** `unsafe` code bypasses some of Rust's safety checks. If `unsafe` code interacts with data shared across Rayon threads without proper synchronization, it can introduce memory unsafety.
*   **How Rayon Contributes:** Rayon's parallelism *directly* increases the probability of triggering bugs in `unsafe` code that might not be apparent in sequential execution. The interaction between `unsafe` code and Rayon's parallel execution is the core issue.
*   **Example:**
    *   An `unsafe` block accesses a raw pointer that is shared between multiple Rayon threads (initiated by any parallel operation) without using atomic operations or other synchronization.
    *   An `unsafe` function incorrectly assumes exclusive access to a resource that is actually being shared by other Rayon threads due to a parallel iterator.
*   **Impact:** Memory corruption, crashes, undefined behavior, potential security vulnerabilities.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   **Minimize `unsafe` code.** Explore safe alternatives.
        *   **If `unsafe` is unavoidable, audit it extremely carefully.** Document all safety invariants.
        *   **Ensure proper synchronization within `unsafe` blocks** when interacting with data shared across Rayon threads. Use atomic operations, mutexes, etc.
        *   **Test `unsafe` code thoroughly,** especially in parallel contexts.
