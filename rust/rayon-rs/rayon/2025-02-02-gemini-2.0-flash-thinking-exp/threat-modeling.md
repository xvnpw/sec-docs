# Threat Model Analysis for rayon-rs/rayon

## Threat: [Data Races and Race Conditions](./threats/data_races_and_race_conditions.md)

*   **Threat:** Data Races and Race Conditions (Rayon Induced)
*   **Description**:
    *   **Attacker Action:**  While not directly exploited by an attacker in the traditional sense, developers using Rayon might inadvertently introduce data races due to concurrent access to shared mutable state within Rayon parallel tasks. An attacker could trigger or amplify the effects of these races by sending concurrent requests, leading to unpredictable application behavior and data corruption. Rayon's ease of use for parallelism can mask the underlying complexity of concurrent programming, increasing the risk if developers are not careful with synchronization.
    *   **How:**  Incorrectly using Rayon's parallel iterators or task parallelism without proper synchronization when accessing shared mutable data. Rayon's API encourages parallelism, but doesn't enforce safe concurrency practices, leaving room for developer error.
*   **Impact**:
    *   **Critical:** Data corruption leading to critical application failures, security bypasses, or data breaches if security decisions are based on corrupted data.
    *   **High:** Inconsistent application state causing unpredictable behavior, making the application unreliable and difficult to secure.
*   **Rayon Component Affected:**
    *   User code utilizing Rayon's parallel iteration (`par_iter`, `par_iter_mut`), parallel collections, and task parallelism (`join`, `scope`). The vulnerability lies in the *application's parallel logic built with Rayon*, not Rayon itself.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (Critical if data corruption directly leads to security breaches, High otherwise)
*   **Mitigation Strategies**:
    *   **Prioritize Immutable Data:** Design parallel tasks to operate on immutable data as much as possible to eliminate shared mutable state.
    *   **Mandatory Synchronization for Shared Mutability:** When shared mutable state is unavoidable, enforce strict synchronization using mutexes, atomic operations, or channels.  Make synchronization a core part of the parallel design.
    *   **Thorough Concurrency Testing:** Implement rigorous concurrency testing, including stress testing and race condition detection tools, specifically targeting Rayon-parallelized code paths.
    *   **Code Reviews Focused on Concurrency:** Conduct mandatory code reviews by developers experienced in concurrent programming, specifically reviewing Rayon usage for potential data races.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion (CPU, Memory) due to Uncontrolled Rayon Parallelism](./threats/resource_exhaustion__cpu__memory__due_to_uncontrolled_rayon_parallelism.md)

*   **Threat:** Resource Exhaustion (CPU, Memory) due to Uncontrolled Rayon Parallelism
*   **Description**:
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker can launch a Denial of Service (DoS) attack by exploiting the application's use of Rayon to create excessive parallelism. By sending a flood of requests, the attacker can force the application to spawn a large number of Rayon tasks, overwhelming server resources (CPU and memory). Rayon's efficiency in utilizing CPU cores, if not managed, becomes a vulnerability under attack.
    *   **How:**  Sending a high volume of requests to API endpoints or features that utilize Rayon for parallel processing without proper resource limits or request throttling. Rayon's design to maximize CPU utilization can be turned against the application in a DoS scenario.
*   **Impact**:
    *   **Critical:** Denial of Service (DoS), rendering the web application completely unavailable to legitimate users.
    *   **High:** Severe performance degradation, making the application extremely slow and unresponsive, effectively impacting availability.
*   **Rayon Component Affected:**
    *   Not a specific Rayon *component*, but the *application's architecture* that leverages Rayon for request processing or background tasks. The vulnerability is in the *uncontrolled application of Rayon's parallelism*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (Critical if DoS is easily achievable and has severe impact, High if DoS is less easily triggered but still significantly impacts availability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies**:
    *   **Strict Request Rate Limiting and Throttling:** Implement robust rate limiting and request throttling mechanisms to control the incoming request rate and prevent request floods that trigger excessive Rayon parallelism.
    *   **Resource Quotas and Limits for Parallel Tasks:**  Establish and enforce resource quotas (CPU time, memory) for Rayon-parallelized tasks to prevent individual tasks from consuming excessive resources.
    *   **Asynchronous Task Queues with Controlled Concurrency:**  Use asynchronous task queues to decouple request handling from resource-intensive Rayon processing. Limit the concurrency of the Rayon-powered worker pool processing the queue.
    *   **Circuit Breaker Pattern:** Implement circuit breaker patterns to detect and prevent cascading failures due to resource exhaustion. If resource limits are exceeded, temporarily halt or degrade service to protect overall system stability.
    *   **Horizontal Scaling and Load Balancing:** Distribute the application load across multiple servers and use load balancing to handle traffic spikes and mitigate resource exhaustion on individual servers.

This updated list focuses on the most critical and high-severity threats directly related to Rayon, emphasizing the potential for data corruption and denial of service due to improper or uncontrolled use of the library. Remember to prioritize these threats in your security assessments and mitigation efforts.
