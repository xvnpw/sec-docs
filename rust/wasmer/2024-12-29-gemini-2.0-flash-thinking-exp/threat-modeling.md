*   **Threat:** Sandbox Escape through Memory Corruption
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability within the Wasmer runtime's memory management or execution engine. By crafting a malicious Wasm module, they can trigger memory corruption that allows them to break out of the sandboxed environment. This could involve overwriting memory regions belonging to the host application or the Wasmer runtime itself.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker gains unauthorized access to the host system's resources, potentially allowing them to execute arbitrary code, read sensitive data, or compromise the entire system.
    *   **Affected Wasmer Component:** Wasmer Runtime - Memory Management, Execution Engine, Security Sandboxing
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the Wasmer runtime updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
        *   Utilize Wasmer's security features and configurations to strengthen the sandbox.
        *   Consider using hardware-based virtualization if available and supported by Wasmer for stronger isolation.
        *   Implement Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and other memory protection mechanisms on the host system.

*   **Threat:** Abuse of Exposed Host Functions
    *   **Description:** The host application exposes functions or APIs to the Wasm module to enable interaction. An attacker crafts a malicious Wasm module that exploits vulnerabilities or design flaws *within the Wasmer runtime's handling of these exposed host functions*. This could involve triggering unexpected behavior in the interface between Wasmer and the host functions, leading to unintended consequences.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker can perform actions on the host system that they are not authorized to do, such as accessing sensitive data, modifying files, or triggering unintended application behavior. The impact depends on the nature and privileges of the exposed host functions and the specific vulnerability in Wasmer's handling.
    *   **Affected Wasmer Component:** Host Function Interface (API between host and Wasm), Wasmer Runtime - Host Function Invocation
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Apply the principle of least privilege when exposing host functions. Only expose the necessary functions with the minimum required permissions.
        *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all inputs received from Wasm modules within the host functions *and ensure Wasmer correctly handles these interactions*.
        *   Implement robust error handling and input validation within the host function implementations.
        *   Regularly audit the exposed host function interface and the Wasmer runtime's interaction with it for potential vulnerabilities.

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Bugs in Wasmer's System Call Emulation (if applicable)
    *   **Description:** If Wasmer emulates system calls for the Wasm module (depending on the configuration and features used), vulnerabilities in this emulation layer could be exploited by a malicious Wasm module. This could allow the module to perform actions on the host system that it should not be able to, bypassing the intended sandboxing due to flaws in Wasmer's emulation.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker gains unauthorized access to host system resources or capabilities, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or other malicious activities.
    *   **Affected Wasmer Component:** Wasmer Runtime - System Call Emulation Layer
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Minimize the reliance on system call emulation if possible.
        *   Keep the Wasmer runtime updated to the latest version, as this layer is a potential target for security fixes.
        *   Carefully review the documentation and configuration options related to system call emulation in Wasmer.
        *   Consider alternative approaches that minimize the need for direct system calls from within the Wasm module.
