## Attack Tree Path: [1. Unauthorized File Access (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1__unauthorized_file_access__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **1.1 Bypass Access Controls (Misconfiguration)**

    *   **1.1.1. Application improperly uses `fd`'s output without sanitization or validation. (Exploit) [CRITICAL]**

        *   **Description:** The application uses the output of `fd` (e.g., a list of filenames) without properly validating or sanitizing it. This can lead to various vulnerabilities, including unauthorized file access and information disclosure.
        *   **Attack Scenario:**
            1.  The application uses `fd` to list files in a directory based on user input.
            2.  The attacker provides crafted input (e.g., `../../etc/passwd`) that attempts to traverse directories outside the intended scope.
            3.  The application does not validate the input and passes it directly to `fd`.
            4.  `fd` returns the path to the requested file (`/etc/passwd`).
            5.  The application then uses this path to access and potentially display the contents of the file to the attacker.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Implement strict input validation to ensure that user-provided input conforms to expected patterns and does not contain directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`).
            *   Use a whitelist approach to allow only specific characters and patterns in the input.
            *   Sanitize the output of `fd` before using it in any file operations or displaying it to the user.
            *   Consider using a dedicated API or library for file system operations that provides built-in security mechanisms.

    *   **1.1.4 Application uses `fd` with `--absolute-path` and does not properly validate the output, leading to potential path traversal. (Misconfiguration, Exploit) [CRITICAL]**

        *   **Description:** The application uses the `--absolute-path` option with `fd` and then uses the resulting absolute paths in file operations without proper validation. This can allow an attacker to access files outside the intended directory.
        *   **Attack Scenario:**
            1.  The application uses `fd --absolute-path` to find files based on user input.
            2.  The attacker provides input designed to manipulate the search, such as a pattern that matches a file in a different directory.
            3.  `fd` returns the absolute path to the attacker-controlled file (e.g., `/var/www/uploads/../../../etc/passwd`).
            4.  The application uses this absolute path directly in a file operation (e.g., reading or writing the file) without sanitizing it.
            5.  The attacker gains access to the sensitive file (`/etc/passwd`).
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Validate the absolute paths returned by `fd` before using them. Ensure that they fall within the expected directory structure.
            *   Use a "chroot jail" or similar mechanism to restrict the application's file system access to a specific directory.
            *   Avoid using `--absolute-path` if possible. If relative paths are sufficient, use them instead.
            *   Sanitize the output of `fd` before using it.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Command Injection (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/3__command_injection__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **3.1. Application uses `fd`'s output as input to another command without proper escaping or sanitization. [CRITICAL]**

    *   **Description:** The application uses the output of `fd` (e.g., a list of filenames) as input to another command (e.g., a shell command) without properly escaping or sanitizing the output. This is a classic command injection vulnerability.
    *   **Attack Scenario:**
        1.  The application uses `fd` to find files matching a user-provided pattern.
        2.  The application then uses the output of `fd` directly in a shell command, such as:  `rm $(fd <user_input>)`
        3.  The attacker provides input containing shell metacharacters, such as:  `*.txt; rm -rf /`
        4.  The shell command becomes: `rm $(fd *.txt; rm -rf /)`
        5.  `fd` finds files ending in `.txt`.
        6.  The shell then executes `rm -rf /`, deleting the entire file system (or as much as the user running the application has permissions to delete).
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Never** use the output of `fd` directly in a shell command without proper escaping.
        *   Use a language-specific API for executing commands that allows you to pass arguments separately from the command itself. This prevents shell interpretation of the arguments.  For example, in Python, use `subprocess.run` with a list of arguments instead of a single string.
        *   If you *must* use a shell, use a library function that properly escapes shell metacharacters.
        *   Avoid using a shell entirely if possible.

*   **3.2. Application uses `fd` with `--exec` or `--exec-batch` and does not properly validate the command or arguments. [CRITICAL]**

    *   **Description:** The application uses the `--exec` or `--exec-batch` options of `fd` to execute commands on the found files, but it does not properly validate the command or arguments, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.
    *   **Attack Scenario:**
        1.  The application allows users to specify a search pattern and a command to be executed on the matching files using `fd --exec`.
        2.  The attacker provides a malicious command, such as:  `fd . --exec "rm -rf /"`
        3.  The application passes this command directly to `fd`.
        4.  `fd` executes the attacker's command (`rm -rf /`) on all found files.
        5.  The attacker's command deletes the file system (or as much as it can).
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Avoid** using `--exec` or `--exec-batch` with user-provided input if at all possible.
        *   If you *must* use these options with user input, implement a **strict whitelist** of allowed commands and arguments.  Do not allow arbitrary commands.
        *   Thoroughly sanitize and validate any user input that is used as part of the command or arguments.
        *   Consider using a safer alternative to `--exec`, such as processing the output of `fd` within the application's code and using a secure API to perform the desired actions on the files.
