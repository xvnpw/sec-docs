# Threat Model Analysis for sharkdp/fd

## Threat: [Command Injection via Unsanitized Input](./threats/command_injection_via_unsanitized_input.md)

**Threat:** Command Injection via Unsanitized Input
    * **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input (e.g., within search patterns or directories) that, when incorporated into the `fd` command, allows them to execute arbitrary commands on the server. The application fails to properly sanitize or escape user-provided data before passing it to the shell to execute `fd`. This directly involves how the application interacts with `fd` by constructing its command.
    * **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the server, including data theft, modification, or deletion; installation of malware; denial of service.
    * **Affected `fd` Component:** Process constructing and executing the `fd` command.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid directly constructing shell commands from user input.
        * Use parameterized commands or libraries that handle command execution safely.
        * Implement strict input validation and sanitization to remove or escape potentially harmful characters.
        * Enforce the principle of least privilege for the process executing `fd`.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information Through `fd` Output](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_through__fd__output.md)

**Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Information Through `fd` Output
    * **Description:** The output of `fd`, which includes file paths and names, reveals sensitive information that the user is not authorized to access. The application displays or logs the raw output of `fd` without proper filtering. An attacker might analyze this output to discover the location or existence of sensitive files or directories. This directly involves the information returned by `fd`.
    * **Impact:** Disclosure of confidential data, potential for further exploitation based on revealed information.
    * **Affected `fd` Component:** Output stream of the `fd` command.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Filter and sanitize the output of `fd` before displaying or using it. Remove sensitive information or apply appropriate encoding (e.g., escaping).
        * Avoid logging the raw output of `fd` in production environments.
        * Implement access controls on the files and directories that `fd` might access.

## Threat: [Path Traversal Exploitation via `fd` Results](./threats/path_traversal_exploitation_via__fd__results.md)

**Threat:** Path Traversal Exploitation via `fd` Results
    * **Description:** The application uses the file paths returned by `fd` in subsequent file operations without proper validation. An attacker could manipulate the search criteria to obtain paths outside the intended scope (e.g., using relative paths like `../`) and trick the application into accessing or manipulating unintended files. This directly involves the interpretation and use of `fd`'s output.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, potential data modification or deletion.
    * **Affected `fd` Component:** Output stream of the `fd` command, and the application's logic for handling the output.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Before using any file path returned by `fd`, perform strict validation to ensure it is within the expected directory or set of allowed paths.
        * Use absolute paths whenever possible.
        * Avoid directly concatenating user input with file paths.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities within `fd`](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_within__fd_.md)

**Threat:** Exploitation of Vulnerabilities within `fd`
    * **Description:** A previously unknown security vulnerability exists within the `fd` utility itself. An attacker might craft specific input or usage patterns that trigger this vulnerability, potentially leading to unexpected behavior, crashes, or even arbitrary code execution within the context of the `fd` process. This is a direct vulnerability within the `fd` component.
    * **Impact:**  Depends on the nature of the vulnerability, ranging from denial of service to potential code execution.
    * **Affected `fd` Component:**  Any part of the `fd` utility's codebase.
    * **Risk Severity:**  Varies depending on the vulnerability, potentially Critical.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep the `fd` utility updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
        * Monitor security advisories related to `fd`.
        * Implement sandboxing or containerization for the application to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities in external tools.
