## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Malicious Input to `fd` (Critical Node):](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_malicious_input_to__fd___critical_node_.md)

This is a high-risk area because it involves attackers directly manipulating the input provided to the `fd` command. If successful, it can lead to direct command execution or access to sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Command Injection via Search Parameters (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/command_injection_via_search_parameters__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker injects shell commands into the search parameters that are passed to the `fd` command.
    * **Mechanism:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided input before incorporating it into the `fd` command string. This allows shell metacharacters and commands to be interpreted by the shell when `fd` is executed.
    * **Impact:** Successful command injection allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the application. This can lead to full system compromise, data breaches, and other malicious activities.
    * **Mitigation:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization. Use parameterized queries or escape shell metacharacters when constructing the `fd` command. Avoid directly concatenating user input into shell commands.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject shell commands into search parameters (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/inject_shell_commands_into_search_parameters__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker crafts specific search terms containing shell commands.
    * **Example:** If the application searches for files based on a user-provided name, an attacker could input `; rm -rf /` as the name. If not properly sanitized, this could result in the deletion of all files on the server.
    * **Impact:** As above, arbitrary code execution.
    * **Mitigation:** As above, focus on robust input sanitization.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit `fd`'s Execution Environment (Critical Node & High-Risk Path Start):](./attack_tree_paths/exploit__fd_'s_execution_environment__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_start_.md)

This category of attacks focuses on manipulating the environment in which the `fd` process is executed, rather than directly exploiting flaws in `fd` or the input provided to it.

## Attack Tree Path: [Binary Replacement (If application doesn't use full path) (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/binary_replacement__if_application_doesn't_use_full_path___critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker replaces the legitimate `fd` binary with a malicious executable.
    * **Mechanism:** The application relies on the `fd` executable being present in a directory listed in the system's `PATH` environment variable. If an attacker gains write access to a directory that appears earlier in the `PATH` than the actual `fd` binary, they can replace it with their own malicious version.
    * **Impact:** When the application attempts to execute `fd`, it will instead execute the attacker's malicious binary, granting the attacker control over the application's actions in the context of that execution.
    * **Mitigation:** Always use the full absolute path to the `fd` executable in the application code. Implement binary integrity checks (e.g., verifying checksums) to ensure the `fd` binary hasn't been tampered with.

**Attack Vector:** The attacker gains sufficient privileges to overwrite the `fd` executable.
    * **Example:** This could occur if the web application server itself is compromised, or if there are vulnerabilities in other services running on the same machine.
    * **Impact:** Complete control over `fd`'s execution.
    * **Mitigation:** Follow the mitigation steps for "Binary Replacement" and implement strong system-level security measures to prevent unauthorized file system access.

## Attack Tree Path: [LD_PRELOAD/Library Hijacking (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/ld_preloadlibrary_hijacking__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker manipulates environment variables, particularly `LD_PRELOAD`, to force the dynamic linker to load a malicious shared library before any other libraries when `fd` is executed.
    * **Mechanism:** The `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable allows users to specify custom shared libraries that should be loaded before the standard system libraries. An attacker can set this variable to point to a malicious library, which will then be loaded into the `fd` process's memory space.
    * **Impact:** The malicious library can intercept function calls made by `fd`, modify its behavior, and potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of the `fd` process.
    * **Mitigation:** Sanitize the execution environment of the `fd` process. Avoid executing `fd` in environments where untrusted users have control over environment variables. Consider using secure coding practices to avoid reliance on external libraries where possible, or carefully vet any dependencies.

**Attack Vector:** The attacker gains control over the environment variables under which the application executes `fd`.
    * **Example:** This could happen if the web server process itself is compromised or if there are other vulnerabilities that allow setting environment variables.
    * **Impact:** Allows loading malicious libraries into `fd`.
    * **Mitigation:** Follow the mitigation steps for "LD_PRELOAD/Library Hijacking" and implement strong system-level security to protect the application's execution environment.
