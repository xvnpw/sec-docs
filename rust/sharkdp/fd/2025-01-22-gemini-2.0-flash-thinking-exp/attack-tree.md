## Attack Tree Path: [[1.1] Path Traversal via fd [HIGH RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/_1_1__path_traversal_via_fd__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:**  This path exploits the vulnerability where user-controlled input is used to construct file paths for `fd` without proper sanitization. An attacker can inject path traversal sequences (like `../`) to make `fd` access files and directories outside the intended scope.
* **Critical Node: [1.1.1] Exploit Insufficient Input Sanitization [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Attack Description:** The core weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization. If the application directly uses user input to build file paths for `fd`, it becomes vulnerable to path traversal.
    * **Attack Step: [1.1.1.1] Inject Path Traversal Sequences (e.g., ../):** Attackers inject sequences like `../` into user input fields. When this input is used in the `fd` command, it allows navigating up the directory structure.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, potential data breach, information disclosure.
    * **Mitigation:** Implement robust input sanitization and validation for all user-provided input used in file path construction. Use allow-lists, secure path manipulation functions, and canonicalization.

* **High-Risk Path: [1.1.3] Leverage fd's `-x`/`--exec` or `-X`/`--exec-batch` with Path Traversal [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Attack Vector:** This path combines path traversal with the command execution capabilities of `fd`'s `-x` or `-X` options. If path traversal allows access to sensitive files, `-x` or `-X` can be used to execute commands on those files.
    * **Critical Node: [1.1.3] Leverage fd's `-x`/`--exec` or `-X`/`--exec-batch` with Path Traversal [CRITICAL NODE]:** The critical point is the combination of path traversal and command execution, significantly escalating the potential damage.
    * **Attack Step: [1.1.3.1] Execute Commands on Sensitive Files outside Intended Scope:**  Attackers use path traversal to target sensitive files and then use `-x` or `-X` to execute commands on them. For example, attempting to read sensitive configuration files or even execute commands as the application user.
    * **Impact:** High impact, potentially leading to full system compromise if sensitive files are targeted and commands can be executed with sufficient privileges.
    * **Mitigation:**  Avoid using `-x` or `-X` when paths are influenced by user input. If necessary, strictly control the command executed by `-x`/`-X` and ensure it cannot be manipulated by the attacker. Limit the scope of `fd` searches.

## Attack Tree Path: [[2.0] Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) [HIGH RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/_2_0__achieve_remote_code_execution__rce___high_risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** This path focuses on achieving Remote Code Execution, the most critical type of compromise. It encompasses several sub-paths related to command injection and malicious file execution via `fd`.

* **High-Risk Path: [2.1] Command Injection via fd Arguments [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Attack Vector:** This path exploits the vulnerability of command injection. If the application constructs the `fd` command string by directly concatenating unsanitized user input, attackers can inject shell commands within the `fd` arguments.
    * **Critical Node: [2.1.1] Exploit Unsanitized User Input in fd Command [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Attack Description:** The core issue is again insufficient input sanitization. If user input is directly embedded into the `fd` command string without proper escaping or parameterization, command injection becomes possible.
        * **Attack Step: [2.1.1.1] Inject Shell Commands within fd Arguments:** Attackers inject shell commands (e.g., using semicolons, pipes, or command substitution) into user input fields. When this input is used to build the `fd` command, the injected commands are executed by the shell.
        * **Impact:** Critical impact, leading to Remote Code Execution and full system compromise.
        * **Mitigation:**  Never directly concatenate user input into shell commands. Use parameterized command execution or rigorously escape shell metacharacters in user input before passing it to `fd`.

    * **High-Risk Path: [2.1.2] Leverage `-x`/`--exec` or `-X`/`--exec-batch` for Command Injection [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Even if the main `fd` command arguments are somewhat controlled, if the application uses `-x` or `-X` and the *command* executed by these options is not properly secured, an attacker might be able to inject malicious commands through filename or path manipulation.
        * **Critical Node: [2.1.2] Leverage `-x`/`--exec` or `-X`/`--exec-batch` for Command Injection [CRITICAL NODE]:** The vulnerability lies in the insecure use of `-x`/`-X` where the executed command or its arguments can be manipulated.
        * **Attack Step: [2.1.2.1] Inject Malicious Commands via Filename or Path Manipulation:** Attackers might craft filenames or paths that, when processed by the command executed via `-x`/`-X`, lead to command injection. For example, if the command is something like `process_file {}`, and the filename is crafted as `file.txt; malicious_command`, the `process_file` script might interpret the semicolon and execute the injected command.
        * **Impact:** Critical impact, leading to Remote Code Execution.
        * **Mitigation:** Secure the command executed by `-x`/`-X`. Avoid passing user-controlled data directly as arguments to this command. Validate and sanitize filenames and paths rigorously.

* **High-Risk Path: [2.2] Exploiting fd's `-x`/`--exec` or `-X`/`--exec-batch` with Malicious Files [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Attack Vector:** This path exploits the scenario where the application allows users to upload or place files, and then uses `fd` with `-x` or `-X` to execute commands on these files. Attackers can upload malicious files and trick the application into executing them.
    * **Critical Node: [2.2.1] Upload/Place Malicious Files for Execution via fd [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Attack Description:** The vulnerability arises from the combination of file upload/placement and the indiscriminate execution of files found by `fd` using `-x`/`-X`.
        * **Attack Step: [2.2.1.1] Trigger fd to Execute Malicious Code in Uploaded/Placed Files:** Attackers upload or place malicious files (e.g., scripts, executables) in directories that `fd` searches. Then, they trigger the application to run `fd` with `-x` or `-X` in a way that causes `fd` to find and execute their malicious files.
        * **Impact:** Critical impact, leading to Remote Code Execution.
        * **Mitigation:**  Strictly control file uploads and the directories that `fd` searches. Avoid using `-x` or `-X` on directories where users can upload or place files. Implement file type validation, malware scanning, and consider sandboxing for uploaded files.
