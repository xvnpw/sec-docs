# Attack Surface Analysis for sharkdp/fd

## Attack Surface: [1. Command Injection via `-x`/`--exec` and `-X`/`--exec-batch`](./attack_surfaces/1__command_injection_via__-x__--exec__and__-x__--exec-batch_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious commands into the command string executed by `fd`'s `-x` or `-X` options.
*   **How `fd` contributes to the attack surface:** `fd`'s `-x` and `-X` features are designed to execute commands on found files. This functionality becomes a critical attack surface when the command or its arguments are constructed using unsanitized user input or filenames, directly enabling command injection.
*   **Example:**
    *   Application code uses: `fd -x mv {} /destination/directory/ --type f --path user_uploads` (intending to move uploaded files).
    *   An attacker uploads a file named: `file.txt; rm -rf / ;`
    *   Resulting command executed by `fd` (potentially): `mv 'file.txt; rm -rf / ;' /destination/directory/ file1 file2 ...` (The attacker's command `rm -rf /` gets executed after the intended `mv`).
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), full system compromise, data deletion, privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Absolute Avoidance (Recommended):**  Completely avoid using `-x` and `-X` with any user-controlled input (including filenames, paths, patterns derived from user input). Seek alternative, safer methods to achieve the desired functionality.
        *   **Strict Input Validation (If `-x`/`-X` is unavoidable):** If command execution is absolutely necessary with user-influenced data, implement extremely rigorous input validation and sanitization. Use allow-lists for characters and patterns. Blacklists are insufficient.
        *   **Parameterization/Escaping (If `-x`/`-X` is unavoidable):**  Utilize parameterization or robust escaping mechanisms provided by the programming language or shell to prevent shell interpretation of injected characters.  Avoid shell interpolation entirely if possible. Construct commands programmatically and safely.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run `fd` processes with the minimum necessary user privileges to limit the blast radius of a successful command injection.
    *   **Users (if directly using `fd` with `-x`/`-X`):**
        *   **Extreme Caution:** Exercise extreme caution when using `-x` or `-X`, especially with filenames or paths that might be influenced by untrusted sources.
        *   **Command Review:** Carefully and manually review the command being constructed by `fd` before execution, especially when using complex patterns or paths.
        *   **Safe Filenames:** Avoid using filenames or paths containing shell metacharacters when working with `-x` or `-X`.

## Attack Surface: [2. Path Injection via `-p`/`--path` or Positional Arguments](./attack_surfaces/2__path_injection_via__-p__--path__or_positional_arguments.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate path arguments provided to `fd` to force it to operate on directories outside the intended scope, potentially leading to unauthorized access or information disclosure.
*   **How `fd` contributes to the attack surface:** `fd` directly uses the provided path arguments to define its search scope. If these paths are derived from user input without proper validation, attackers can control where `fd` searches, potentially bypassing intended access restrictions.
*   **Example:**
    *   Application intends `fd` to search only within a user's designated upload directory, e.g., `/app/user_uploads/user123`.
    *   Application code: `fd "important_file" /app/user_uploads/user123` (where `/app/user_uploads/user123` is partially derived from user session data).
    *   Attacker manipulates session data or input to influence the path to: `../../../../sensitive_admin_area`
    *   Resulting command: `fd "important_file" ../../../../sensitive_admin_area` ( `fd` now searches within `/sensitive_admin_area` relative to the intended base directory or current working directory, potentially exposing sensitive files).
*   **Impact:** Information Disclosure (access to sensitive files outside the intended user scope), unauthorized file system access, potential for further exploitation if combined with other vulnerabilities.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Strict Path Validation and Sanitization:**  Rigidly validate and sanitize all user-provided path inputs. Implement checks to ensure paths are within the expected base directory and do not contain path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`). Use canonicalization to resolve paths to their absolute form and verify they remain within allowed boundaries.
        *   **Path Allow-listing:** Define an explicit allow-list of permitted base directories. Validate user-provided paths against this allow-list to ensure they fall within authorized locations.
        *   **Chroot Environment (Advanced):** In highly sensitive scenarios, consider running `fd` within a chroot environment to restrict its file system access to a specific directory tree, limiting the impact of path injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Users (if directly using `fd`):**
        *   **Path Awareness:** Be acutely aware of the paths provided to `fd`, especially when constructing them dynamically or using input from external sources.
        *   **Absolute Paths:** Prefer using absolute paths to clearly define the search scope and reduce ambiguity.
        *   **Double-Check Paths:** Carefully double-check the constructed search path before executing `fd` to ensure it aligns with the intended scope and does not inadvertently include sensitive areas.
