# Threat Model Analysis for sharkdp/fd

## Threat: [Threat 1: Command Injection via Unsanitized Input](./threats/threat_1_command_injection_via_unsanitized_input.md)

*   **Threat:** Command Injection via Unsanitized Input to `fd` Arguments
*   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious shell commands by providing unsanitized input that is directly used as arguments to the `fd` command. For example, if user input is used for the search pattern and not properly escaped, an attacker could input something like `; rm -rf /` to execute arbitrary commands after the `fd` command.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on the server, leading to:
    *   Data breach and exfiltration
    *   System compromise and takeover
    *   Denial of service
    *   Privilege escalation
*   **Affected `fd` Component:**  `fd` command execution via shell, specifically how arguments are constructed and passed to `fd`.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize all user inputs before using them in `fd` commands. Use allow-lists for characters and patterns.
    *   **Parameterization/Escaping:** Use secure command execution methods provided by your programming language to properly escape or parameterize arguments passed to the shell when executing `fd`. Avoid string concatenation for command construction.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the application and `fd` with minimal necessary privileges.

## Threat: [Threat 2: Path Traversal and Unauthorized File Access](./threats/threat_2_path_traversal_and_unauthorized_file_access.md)

*   **Threat:** Path Traversal via Manipulated Path Arguments
*   **Description:** An attacker could use path traversal techniques (e.g., `../`) in user-provided path arguments to escape the intended search directory and access files or directories outside the allowed scope. For example, if the application intends to search only within `/app/data`, an attacker could provide input like `../../../../etc/passwd` to access system files.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure: Access to sensitive files and directories that should not be accessible, potentially leading to further exploitation.
*   **Affected `fd` Component:** `fd`'s path handling, specifically how it interprets and traverses directory paths provided as arguments.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization (Path):**  Strictly validate and sanitize path inputs. Canonicalize paths to resolve symbolic links and remove relative path components. Restrict allowed paths to a predefined set of directories or enforce a strict base directory.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (File System Permissions):** Ensure the user account running `fd` has restricted file system access permissions, limiting access even if path traversal is attempted.
