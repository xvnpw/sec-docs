## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Sanitization for `fd` Arguments](./mitigation_strategies/input_sanitization_for__fd__arguments.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify all points in your application where user input is used to construct arguments for the `fd` command. This includes search patterns, file extensions, or arguments passed to `-x`, `-X`, or `-e`.
    2.  Implement input validation rules. Define allowed characters, formats, and lengths for each user-provided input field used in `fd` arguments. For example, if expecting filenames, allow alphanumeric characters, underscores, hyphens, and dots, and restrict special characters like `;`, `|`, `&`, `$`, `(`, `)`, `<`, `>`, `\` and spaces if not properly escaped.
    3.  Apply sanitization techniques. Use your programming language's built-in functions or libraries to escape special characters in user input before passing them to the `fd` command. For shell commands, use proper quoting or parameterization mechanisms. Prefer using functions that separate commands from arguments rather than directly constructing shell commands from strings.
    4.  Reject invalid input. If user input does not conform to the validation rules, reject it with an informative error message and do not proceed with executing `fd`.
    5.  Regularly review and update validation rules. As your application evolves or new attack vectors are discovered, revisit and strengthen your input validation rules.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Command Injection (High Severity):** Malicious users could inject shell commands by manipulating input fields that are directly passed to `fd` without proper sanitization. This could allow them to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Path Traversal (Medium Severity):** If user input controls the search path for `fd`, attackers might use path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to access files outside the intended directory, potentially leading to information disclosure or unauthorized access.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Command Injection:** Significantly reduces the risk. Proper input sanitization is a primary defense against command injection when using `fd` with user-provided arguments.
    *   **Path Traversal:** Partially reduces the risk. Input sanitization helps prevent direct path traversal attempts through input fields used in `fd` commands.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Input validation is partially implemented in the search functionality of the application. Filename inputs are checked for basic alphanumeric characters and some special symbols are rejected. However, escaping for shell commands used with `fd` is not consistently applied.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Escaping of user input for shell commands used with `-x`, `-X`, and `-e` options of `fd` is missing.
    *   More robust validation rules are needed to cover a wider range of potentially harmful characters and input patterns specifically for `fd` arguments.
    *   Input validation should be consistently applied across all features that use `fd` with user-provided arguments.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Allowed Paths for `fd` Operations](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_allowed_paths_for__fd__operations.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify all places in your application where `fd` is used to search or operate on files. Determine if user input influences the starting directory or search paths for `fd`.
    2.  Define a whitelist of allowed base directories where `fd` operations are permitted. This should be the most restrictive set of directories necessary for the application's functionality.
    3.  Before executing `fd`, validate user-provided paths (if any) against the whitelist. Ensure that the resolved path after processing user input remains within the allowed base directories.
    4.  Use absolute paths when constructing `fd` commands to avoid ambiguity and ensure operations are confined to the intended directories.
    5.  If possible, avoid allowing users to directly specify paths for `fd` operations. Instead, use predefined categories or identifiers that map to specific allowed directories on the server-side.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (High Severity):** Unrestricted path access for `fd` could allow attackers to search and access sensitive files outside of the intended application scope, leading to the disclosure of confidential data.
    *   **Unauthorized File Access (Medium Severity):** Attackers might gain access to files they are not authorized to view or modify if `fd` can operate outside of restricted directories.
    *   **Path Traversal (Medium Severity):** Even with input sanitization, restricting allowed paths provides an additional layer of defense against path traversal vulnerabilities when using `fd` by limiting its operational scope.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Significantly reduces the risk by preventing `fd` from accessing sensitive areas of the filesystem.
    *   **Unauthorized File Access:** Significantly reduces the risk by limiting the scope of file operations performed by `fd`.
    *   **Path Traversal:** Partially reduces the risk. While input sanitization targets malicious input, path restriction limits the damage even if sanitization is bypassed or if there are logical path traversal issues related to `fd`'s path handling.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   The application currently uses a predefined base directory for file searches using `fd`. However, there is no explicit validation to ensure user-provided search terms or filters do not inadvertently lead `fd` to operate outside this base directory.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Implement strict validation to ensure that all `fd` operations are confined within the predefined allowed base directory, even when user input is involved in search patterns or filters used by `fd`.
    *   Consider using server-side mappings for user-selectable categories instead of directly exposing file paths to users for `fd` operations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Timeouts for `fd` Execution](./mitigation_strategies/implement_timeouts_for__fd__execution.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Determine a reasonable maximum execution time for `fd` commands based on the expected search scope and application requirements.
    2.  Implement a timeout mechanism in your application code that monitors the execution time of `fd` commands.
    3.  If an `fd` command exceeds the defined timeout, forcefully terminate the `fd` process.
    4.  Log timeout events for monitoring and potential issue diagnosis related to `fd`'s performance.
    5.  Allow administrators to configure or adjust the timeout value for `fd` execution if needed.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (High Severity):** Malicious or poorly crafted requests could cause `fd` to run for an excessively long time, consuming server resources (CPU, memory, I/O) and potentially leading to a denial of service for legitimate users due to prolonged `fd` execution.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Runaway `fd` processes without timeouts can exhaust server resources, impacting the performance and stability of the application and potentially other services on the same server due to uncontrolled `fd` usage.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Significantly reduces the risk by preventing long-running `fd` processes from consuming resources indefinitely.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Significantly reduces the risk by limiting the resource consumption of individual `fd` operations.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   No timeouts are currently implemented for `fd` command execution.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Implement a timeout mechanism for all `fd` commands executed by the application.
    *   Configure a reasonable default timeout value for `fd` and allow for administrative adjustments.
    *   Add logging for timeout events related to `fd` to monitor for potential DoS attempts or performance issues caused by `fd`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Search Depth and Scope](./mitigation_strategies/limit_search_depth_and_scope.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Analyze the application's use cases for `fd` and determine the necessary search depth and scope for file operations performed by `fd`.
    2.  Use the `--max-depth` option of `fd` to limit the depth of directory traversal during searches. Set a reasonable maximum depth based on the application's requirements for `fd` usage.
    3.  Carefully define the starting directory for `fd` searches. Avoid using overly broad starting directories like the root directory (`/`) unless absolutely necessary. Use more specific subdirectories as starting points for `fd` whenever possible.
    4.  If user input influences the search scope for `fd`, validate and sanitize it to ensure it does not expand the search scope beyond acceptable limits for `fd` operations.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Unnecessarily deep or broad searches by `fd` can consume excessive server resources and contribute to denial of service.
    *   **Performance Degradation (Medium Severity):** Extensive searches by `fd` can significantly slow down the application and impact user experience.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Broad and deep searches by `fd` can lead to resource exhaustion, especially in environments with large file systems.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Partially reduces the risk by limiting the resource consumption of `fd` searches, but timeouts are a more direct mitigation for DoS.
    *   **Performance Degradation:** Significantly reduces the risk by optimizing `fd` search operations and preventing unnecessarily long searches.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Partially reduces the risk by limiting the scope of resource usage by `fd`, but resource limits at the process level are also important.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   The application does not currently use `--max-depth` to limit search depth for `fd`. The starting directory for `fd` is somewhat restricted, but could be more specific.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Implement `--max-depth` option in all `fd` commands to limit search depth to a reasonable value.
    *   Review and refine the starting directories for `fd` searches to be as specific as possible.
    *   Consider making the maximum search depth for `fd` configurable based on application needs and performance considerations.
