## Attack Tree Path: [1.0 Gain Unauthorized Access/Data Breach [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_0_gain_unauthorized_accessdata_breach__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **1.1 Path Traversal via fd [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Exploiting the application's use of `fd` to access files and directories outside the intended scope. This is achieved by manipulating user-controlled input that is used to construct file paths for `fd`.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, configuration files, application code, or user data. This can lead to data breaches, information disclosure, and further compromise of the application.

    *   **1.1.1 Exploit Insufficient Input Sanitization [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user input before using it to construct file paths for `fd`.
        *   **Attack Example:** Injecting path traversal sequences like `../` or URL encoded equivalents into input fields that are used in `fd` commands.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Allows attackers to bypass intended directory restrictions and instruct `fd` to search or operate on files outside the designated scope.

    *   **1.1.3 Leverage fd's `-x`/`--exec` or `-X`/`--exec-batch` with Path Traversal [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Combining path traversal vulnerabilities with the `-x` or `-X` options of `fd`. This allows attackers not only to access files outside the intended scope but also to execute commands on them.
        *   **Attack Example:** Using path traversal to target sensitive files (e.g., configuration files, system files) and then using `-x` to execute commands like `cat` or more malicious scripts on these files.
        *   **Potential Impact:**  Significant escalation of path traversal impact. Can lead to information disclosure, privilege escalation, and potentially remote code execution if commands can be crafted to exploit vulnerabilities in the executed commands or scripts.

*   **2.1 Command Injection via fd Arguments [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Injecting shell commands into the arguments passed to the `fd` command when the application constructs the command string using user-controlled input without proper sanitization or escaping.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Full system compromise through remote code execution. Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the application user.

    *   **2.1.1 Exploit Unsanitized User Input in fd Command [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** The application directly concatenates user input into the `fd` command string without proper escaping or parameterization.
        *   **Attack Example:** Injecting shell metacharacters like `;`, `|`, `&`, or backticks into input fields that are directly used in constructing the `fd` command. For example, if the application uses `fd "{user_input}" ...`, an attacker could input `; malicious_command ;`.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Direct command injection leading to RCE.

    *   **2.1.2 Leverage `-x`/`--exec` or `-X`/`--exec-batch` for Command Injection [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application uses `-x` or `-X` options, allowing injection of malicious commands through filename or path manipulation, or by manipulating the command executed by `-x`/`-X`.
        *   **Attack Example:** If the application uses `-x "process_file {}"` and the `process_file` script is vulnerable to argument injection, an attacker might craft filenames or paths that, when processed by `fd` and passed to `process_file` via `{}`, result in command injection within `process_file`.
        *   **Potential Impact:** RCE through injection points related to the command execution features of `fd`.

    *   **2.2 Exploiting fd's `-x`/`--exec` or `-X`/`--exec-batch` with Malicious Files [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**

        *   **Potential Impact:** RCE by executing attacker-controlled code placed on the server.

        *   **2.2.1 Upload/Place Malicious Files for Execution via fd [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers upload or place files containing malicious code (e.g., scripts, executables) in directories that `fd` is configured to search.
            *   **Attack Example:** Uploading a PHP script containing a web shell and then crafting an `fd` command (potentially combined with path traversal or other techniques) to locate and execute this script using `-x php {}`.
            *   **Potential Impact:** RCE by triggering the execution of malicious code uploaded or placed by the attacker.
