# BUSINESS POSTURE

The `fd` project is a command-line tool designed as a user-friendly and faster alternative to the traditional `find` utility. Its primary goal is to improve the efficiency and user experience of file searching in command-line environments.

- Business priorities:
  - Enhance command-line user experience by providing a more intuitive and faster file searching tool.
  - Increase developer productivity by reducing the time spent on file system navigation and search.
  - Offer a cross-platform solution that works consistently across different operating systems.

- Business risks:
  - Potential for misuse if used in scripts without proper input validation, although the risk is low for a file-finding utility.
  - Dependency risk if critical scripts or processes rely heavily on `fd` and it encounters issues or becomes unavailable.
  - Limited business impact in case of security vulnerabilities due to the nature of the tool (primarily file system navigation).

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security controls:
  - security control: Open source project with public code repository on GitHub. This allows for community review and scrutiny of the codebase. (Implemented: GitHub Repository)
  - security control: Written in Rust, a memory-safe language, which reduces the risk of certain types of vulnerabilities like buffer overflows. (Implemented: Project Technology Stack)
  - security control: Regular updates and maintenance by the maintainers and community. (Implemented: GitHub Repository - commit history, releases)

- Accepted risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on external dependencies (Rust libraries) which could introduce vulnerabilities.
  - accepted risk: Potential for undiscovered vulnerabilities in the codebase, as with any software project.
  - accepted risk: Users might run `fd` with elevated privileges, although it's generally not required for its core functionality.

- Recommended security controls:
  - security control: Implement automated security scanning as part of the CI/CD pipeline to detect potential vulnerabilities in dependencies and the codebase (e.g., using `cargo audit`, `cargo deny`, or similar tools).
  - security control: Follow secure coding practices and guidelines during development and maintenance.
  - security control: Provide clear documentation and examples on secure usage, especially regarding input handling in scripts that use `fd`.

- Security requirements:
  - Authentication: Not applicable as `fd` is a command-line utility and does not handle user authentication.
  - Authorization: `fd` operates within the user's permissions on the file system. It should respect file system permissions and not bypass them.
  - Input validation: `fd` should properly validate user inputs (command-line arguments, patterns) to prevent unexpected behavior or potential vulnerabilities.
  - Cryptography: Not applicable as `fd` does not handle sensitive data or require cryptographic operations for its core functionality. However, if extended with features that involve network communication or data storage, cryptography requirements should be considered.

- Build Process Description:
  The build process for `fd` starts with developers committing code to the GitHub repository. A CI/CD system, likely GitHub Actions, is triggered upon code changes. The CI/CD pipeline sets up a build environment with the Rust toolchain, compiles the code, runs automated tests, and performs static analysis and linting. If all checks pass, build artifacts (the `fd` binary for different platforms) are produced and released for users to download.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical business processes:
  - For most users, `fd` enhances productivity in command-line workflows. Critical business processes might include automated scripts or developer workflows that rely on efficient file searching. If `fd` malfunctions or is unavailable, these processes might be slowed down or disrupted. However, the impact is generally low as `find` or other alternatives can be used.

- Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
  - `fd` primarily interacts with file system metadata (file names, paths, timestamps, permissions). It does not directly handle sensitive data in the context of its core functionality. However, if users use `fd` in scripts that process sensitive files, the file paths themselves might be considered sensitive in certain contexts. The sensitivity of the data depends heavily on the user's specific use case and the context in which `fd` is used. In general, the sensitivity is low to medium, primarily concerning the confidentiality and integrity of file system information within the user's environment.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- BUSINESS POSTURE:
  - Assumption: `fd` is primarily used by individual users and developers to improve their command-line workflow efficiency.
  - Question: Are there any enterprise or organizational deployments of `fd` where it's used in critical infrastructure or automated systems with higher security requirements?

- SECURITY POSTURE:
  - Assumption: Current security posture relies mainly on open-source principles, Rust's memory safety, and community review.
  - Question: Are there any specific security compliance requirements or industry standards that `fd` should adhere to?
  - Question: Is there a formal security vulnerability reporting and response process in place for `fd`?

- DESIGN:
  - Assumption: `fd` is designed as a standalone, stateless command-line utility.
  - Question: Are there any plans to extend `fd` with features that might introduce new security considerations, such as network communication, data storage, or user management?
  - Question: Is there any consideration for sandboxing or privilege separation for `fd` to further limit its potential impact in case of vulnerabilities?
