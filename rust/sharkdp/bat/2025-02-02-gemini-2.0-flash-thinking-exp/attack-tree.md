## Attack Tree Path: [1.0 Exploit Input Manipulation to bat Command (Critical Node & High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1_0_exploit_input_manipulation_to_bat_command__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector Description:** This is the overarching category of attacks where an attacker manipulates the input provided to the `bat` command executed by the web application. This input is typically the filename to be processed by `bat`.
*   **Risk:** High. Improper handling of user-controlled input is a common and critical vulnerability in web applications.
*   **Impact:** Can lead to severe consequences like unauthorized file access, command execution, and full application compromise.
*   **Mitigation Focus:** Implement robust input validation, sanitization, and safe command execution practices.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Path Traversal Vulnerability (Critical Node & High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_path_traversal_vulnerability__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector Description:** Exploiting the application's handling of filenames to access files outside the intended directory. Attackers inject path traversal sequences like `../` or `..\\` into the filename.
*   **Risk:** High. Path traversal is a well-known and easily exploitable vulnerability if input is not properly validated.
*   **Impact:** Reading sensitive files on the server, including configuration files, source code, databases, and user data.
*   **Mitigation Focus:**
    *   Strictly validate filename input, rejecting path traversal sequences.
    *   Canonicalize paths to resolve symbolic links and relative paths.
    *   Consider using chroot/jail environments to restrict `bat`'s file system access.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Inject Path Traversal Sequences (e.g., ../../) (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_inject_path_traversal_sequences__e_g__________high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector Description:** The specific technique of inserting `../` or `..\\` sequences into the filename provided to the application, aiming to navigate up directory levels.
*   **Risk:** High. Direct and simple path traversal attack.
*   **Impact:** Enables access to files outside the intended directory.
*   **Mitigation Focus:**  Specifically block or remove `../` and `..\\` sequences from filename inputs.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.1 Read Sensitive Files (e.g., /etc/passwd, application config) (Critical Node & High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_1_read_sensitive_files__e_g___etcpasswd__application_config___critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector Description:** The successful outcome of a path traversal attack, where the attacker gains access to sensitive files on the server. Examples include system configuration files (`/etc/passwd`), application configuration files, and other confidential data.
*   **Risk:** High. Direct exposure of sensitive information.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potentially leading to further attacks, privilege escalation, or data breaches.
*   **Mitigation Focus:**  Prevent path traversal vulnerabilities entirely to avoid reaching this stage. Implement strong access controls on sensitive files.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Command Injection via Filename (Critical Node & High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_command_injection_via_filename__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector Description:** Injecting shell metacharacters (e.g., `;`, `|`, `$()`) into the filename. If the application executes `bat` using a shell and doesn't properly sanitize the filename, these metacharacters can be interpreted as shell commands.
*   **Risk:** High. Command injection is a critical vulnerability that allows arbitrary code execution.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the server, including data theft, malware installation, and denial of service.
*   **Mitigation Focus:**
    *   Sanitize filename input to remove or escape shell metacharacters.
    *   Use safe command execution methods that avoid shell interpretation (e.g., parameterized commands, `subprocess.run` with `shell=False` in Python).

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1 Inject Shell Metacharacters in Filename (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_inject_shell_metacharacters_in_filename__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector Description:** The specific technique of inserting characters like `;`, `|`, `$`, `(`, `)` , `` ` `` into the filename input to be processed by `bat`.
*   **Risk:** High. Direct command injection attempt.
*   **Impact:** Potential for arbitrary command execution.
*   **Mitigation Focus:**  Specifically sanitize or escape shell metacharacters in filename inputs.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1.1 Execute Arbitrary Commands (e.g., `; whoami`, `$(command)`) (Critical Node & High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_1_execute_arbitrary_commands__e_g____;_whoami____$_command_____critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector Description:** The successful outcome of command injection, where the attacker is able to execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the web application user.
*   **Risk:** Critical. Full system compromise.
*   **Impact:** Complete control over the server, data breaches, system downtime, and reputational damage.
*   **Mitigation Focus:**  Prevent command injection vulnerabilities entirely. Implement the principle of least privilege for the web application user.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.0 Exploit bat Output Handling by Application (Critical Node & Elevated Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/2_0_exploit_bat_output_handling_by_application__critical_node_&_elevated_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector Description:** Exploiting how the web application processes and displays the output generated by `bat`. If the application directly renders `bat`'s output without sanitization, it can be vulnerable to output injection attacks, primarily XSS.
*   **Risk:** Elevated. While less likely to directly compromise the server, XSS is a significant client-side vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, leading to user session hijacking, data theft from users, and website defacement.
*   **Mitigation Focus:** Always sanitize or encode `bat`'s output before displaying it in web pages. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) as a defense-in-depth measure.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1 Output Injection leading to XSS (Critical Node & Elevated Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_output_injection_leading_to_xss__critical_node_&_elevated_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector Description:**  The general category of attacks where malicious content is injected into the output of `bat` and then rendered by the application in a web page without proper sanitization, leading to XSS.
*   **Risk:** Elevated. XSS vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Client-side attacks, user data compromise.
*   **Mitigation Focus:** Sanitize `bat` output.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.2 Application Renders bat Output Directly in Web Page (Elevated Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_2_application_renders_bat_output_directly_in_web_page__elevated_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector Description:** The application directly embeds the raw output from `bat` into the HTML of a web page without any sanitization or encoding.
*   **Risk:** Elevated. Direct rendering of unsanitized output is a common cause of XSS.
*   **Impact:** XSS vulnerability.
*   **Mitigation Focus:** Avoid directly rendering unsanitized output. Implement output sanitization/encoding.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.2.1 No Output Sanitization/Encoding by Application (Elevated Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_2_1_no_output_sanitizationencoding_by_application__elevated_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector Description:** The specific vulnerability where the application fails to sanitize or encode the output from `bat` before displaying it in a web page.
*   **Risk:** Elevated. Direct and easily exploitable XSS vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** XSS vulnerability.
*   **Mitigation Focus:**  Mandatory output sanitization/encoding before rendering `bat` output. Use appropriate encoding functions like HTML entity encoding.
