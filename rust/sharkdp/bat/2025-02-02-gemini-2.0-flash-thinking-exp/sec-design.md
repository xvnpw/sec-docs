# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
 - Enhance command-line user experience by providing a visually appealing and feature-rich alternative to standard file viewing utilities like `cat`.
 - Improve developer productivity by offering syntax highlighting for various programming languages and integration with Git for version control context.
 - Maintain a lightweight, fast, and cross-platform command-line tool that is easy to install and use.
 - Foster an open-source community around the project, encouraging contributions and ensuring long-term sustainability.

- Business Risks:
 - Security vulnerabilities in the tool could be exploited by malicious actors if `bat` is used to view untrusted files.
 - Dependency vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by `bat` could introduce security risks.
 - Lack of adoption by users if the tool is perceived as unreliable, slow, or incompatible with common workflows.
 - Community stagnation if contributions decline, leading to slow bug fixes and feature development.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
 - security control: Open Source Code - The source code is publicly available on GitHub, allowing for community review and identification of potential vulnerabilities. Implemented in: GitHub repository.
 - security control: Written in Rust - Rust is a memory-safe language, reducing the risk of common vulnerabilities like buffer overflows and dangling pointers. Implemented in: Project codebase.
 - security control: Use of established crates - The project likely uses well-vetted and widely used Rust crates, reducing the risk of introducing vulnerabilities from custom or less-maintained libraries. Implemented in: `Cargo.toml` dependencies.
 - accepted risk: Reliance on third-party crates - The project depends on external crates, which could contain vulnerabilities that are not immediately known or patched. Accepted risk: Dependency management.
 - accepted risk: Potential for undiscovered vulnerabilities - As with any software, there is always a possibility of undiscovered vulnerabilities in the `bat` codebase itself. Accepted risk: Software development inherent risk.

- Recommended Security Controls:
 - security control: Dependency Scanning - Implement automated dependency scanning to identify and alert on known vulnerabilities in third-party crates used by `bat`. Recommended implementation: Integrate dependency scanning tools into CI/CD pipeline.
 - security control: Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST) - Integrate SAST tools into the development process to automatically analyze the codebase for potential security flaws. Recommended implementation: Integrate SAST tools into CI/CD pipeline.
 - security control: Fuzzing - Perform fuzz testing to discover unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities by providing invalid or malformed inputs to `bat`. Recommended implementation: Integrate fuzzing into testing process.
 - security control: Release Signing - Sign release binaries to ensure authenticity and integrity, protecting users from downloading tampered versions. Recommended implementation: Implement binary signing during release process.

- Security Requirements:
 - Authentication: Not applicable. `bat` is a command-line tool executed locally and does not involve user authentication.
 - Authorization: Not applicable. `bat` operates within the permissions of the user executing it and does not require explicit authorization mechanisms.
 - Input Validation:
  - Requirement: `bat` must properly handle and validate file paths provided as input to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.
  - Requirement: `bat` must handle potentially malicious or malformed files gracefully without crashing or exhibiting unexpected behavior.
  - Requirement: Syntax highlighting logic should be robust and not vulnerable to injection attacks or denial-of-service through specially crafted input files.
 - Cryptography: Not applicable for core functionality. If future features require cryptography, standard best practices for cryptographic implementation should be followed.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
 - Ensuring developers and command-line users have a reliable and secure tool for viewing file contents.
 - Maintaining the reputation and trustworthiness of the `bat` project as a secure and well-maintained open-source tool.
 - Supporting the open-source community around `bat` and encouraging contributions.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
 - Source Code: Publicly available, but integrity and availability are important to ensure the project can be maintained and built. Sensitivity: Low confidentiality, Medium integrity, Medium availability.
 - Build Artifacts (Binaries): Publicly available, but integrity and authenticity are crucial to prevent users from downloading compromised versions. Sensitivity: Low confidentiality, High integrity, High availability.
 - Signing Key: Private key used for signing releases. Confidentiality and integrity are paramount to prevent unauthorized signing of releases. Sensitivity: High confidentiality, High integrity, Low availability (access needed only during release process).
 - User Data: `bat` itself does not collect or store user data. However, files viewed by users might contain sensitive information, but `bat` is only a viewer and does not store or transmit this data. Sensitivity: Depends on the files users view, but not directly related to `bat` itself.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
 - What is the expected threat model for `bat`? Is it primarily concerned with preventing vulnerabilities that could be exploited by viewing malicious files, or are there other threat vectors to consider?
 - Are there any specific compliance requirements or security standards that `bat` needs to adhere to?
 - What is the process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities in `bat`?
 - Are there any plans to implement additional security features in the future, such as sandboxing or more advanced input validation?

- Assumptions:
 - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to provide a useful and secure command-line tool for the open-source community. Business risks are primarily related to security vulnerabilities and lack of user adoption.
 - SECURITY POSTURE: Current security controls are based on open-source principles and Rust's memory safety. Recommended controls focus on automated security testing and release process security. Security requirements are centered around input validation and secure file handling.
 - DESIGN: `bat` is designed as a standalone command-line executable. Deployment is primarily user-managed installation on local machines. The build process involves standard Rust tooling and can be enhanced with security scanning and release signing.
