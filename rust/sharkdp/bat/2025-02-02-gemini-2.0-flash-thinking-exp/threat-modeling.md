# Threat Model Analysis for sharkdp/bat

## Threat: [Command Injection via Filenames/Paths](./threats/command_injection_via_filenamespaths.md)

* **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious filename or path containing shell commands. When the application uses this unsanitized input to construct a `bat` command, the injected commands are executed by the shell. For example, an attacker might provide a filename like `; rm -rf / #` to delete files on the server. This threat directly arises from how the application interacts with `bat` by passing potentially attacker-controlled paths.
* **Impact:** **Critical**. Full compromise of the server, including data loss, system downtime, and potential further attacks on internal networks due to arbitrary command execution.
* **Affected Bat Component:** Invocation of `bat` via shell, specifically how the application constructs and executes the `bat` command. While not a vulnerability *in* `bat`'s code, it's a direct consequence of using `bat` in a shell environment with unsanitized input.
* **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Input Sanitization:**  Strictly validate and sanitize all user-provided input used in `bat` commands. Use allowlists for allowed characters and patterns.
    * **Parameterization:** Avoid constructing shell commands by string concatenation. Use secure methods for invoking subprocesses that prevent shell injection, such as passing arguments as separate parameters to the subprocess execution function.
    * **Path Restriction:** If possible, limit the paths `bat` can access to a safe, controlled directory.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Large Input Files](./threats/denial_of_service_via_large_input_files.md)

* **Description:** An attacker provides or uploads an extremely large file (e.g., gigabytes in size) for `bat` to process and highlight. `bat` consumes excessive server resources (CPU, memory, I/O) attempting to handle the file, leading to application slowdown or crash, and potentially impacting other services on the same server. This threat is directly related to `bat`'s resource consumption when processing large files.
* **Impact:** **High**. Application unavailability, degraded performance, potential server instability, and disruption of service for legitimate users due to resource exhaustion caused by `bat`.
* **Affected Bat Component:** `bat`'s file processing and syntax highlighting engine. `bat`'s inherent behavior of processing and highlighting files is the direct component affected.
* **Risk Severity:** **High**
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **File Size Limits:** Implement strict file size limits for files processed by `bat`. Reject files exceeding a reasonable threshold.
    * **Timeouts:** Set timeouts for `bat` execution. If `bat` takes longer than the timeout, terminate the process to prevent resource exhaustion.
    * **Resource Limiting:** Use operating system mechanisms like cgroups or namespaces to limit the resources (CPU, memory) available to the `bat` process.

## Threat: [Exploitation of `bat`'s Syntax Highlighting/Parsing Logic](./threats/exploitation_of__bat_'s_syntax_highlightingparsing_logic.md)

* **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious file designed to exploit a vulnerability (e.g., buffer overflow, integer overflow) in `bat`'s syntax highlighting engine or file parsing libraries. Successful exploitation could lead to crashes, denial of service, or potentially remote code execution *within the `bat` process*. This threat is directly within `bat`'s code and how it handles file parsing and syntax highlighting.
* **Impact:** **High**. Denial of service, potential application instability. In a worst-case scenario, if vulnerabilities are severe enough, it could lead to code execution within the context of the `bat` process, which might be leveraged for further exploitation.
* **Affected Bat Component:** `bat`'s syntax highlighting engine (likely `syntect` crate) and file parsing libraries used by `bat`. Vulnerabilities within these components of `bat` are the direct cause.
* **Risk Severity:** **High**
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Keep `bat` Updated:** Regularly update `bat` to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
    * **Dependency Monitoring:** Monitor security advisories for `bat` and its dependencies (especially `syntect` and other Rust crates).
    * **Sandboxing:** If processing untrusted files is a critical function, consider sandboxing `bat` execution using technologies like containers or virtual machines to limit the impact of potential exploits.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via `bat` Output](./threats/information_disclosure_via__bat__output.md)

* **Description:** `bat` is used to display files that contain sensitive information (e.g., configuration files with credentials, API keys, secrets). This sensitive information is inadvertently exposed in `bat`'s output, potentially to unauthorized users or logged in application logs. This threat is directly related to what `bat` outputs and how the application handles and presents this output.
* **Impact:** **High**. Exposure of sensitive data, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, or further attacks due to the information revealed by `bat`'s output.
* **Affected Bat Component:** `bat`'s output generation. `bat`'s core function of displaying file content is the direct component involved in this threat.
* **Risk Severity:** **High**
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Careful File Selection:**  Carefully consider which files are displayed using `bat`. Avoid displaying sensitive configuration files or files that might contain secrets directly to users.
    * **Output Sanitization/Redaction:** Sanitize or redact sensitive information from `bat`'s output before displaying it to users. Implement mechanisms to identify and remove or mask sensitive data.
    * **Access Control:** Implement robust access control mechanisms to ensure only authorized users can view file contents via `bat`.
