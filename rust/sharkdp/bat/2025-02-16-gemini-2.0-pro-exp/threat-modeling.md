# Threat Model Analysis for sharkdp/bat

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion

    *   **Description:** An attacker submits a very large file, a file with extremely long lines, or a large number of requests to display files.  The attacker's goal is to overwhelm the server's resources (CPU, memory) by forcing `bat` to perform excessive computations for syntax highlighting, Git diffing, or line numbering. The attacker might use automated tools to generate many requests in a short period. `bat`'s features, while useful, inherently increase resource consumption compared to a simple `cat` command.
    *   **Impact:** The application becomes unresponsive or crashes, denying service to legitimate users.  This can lead to data loss if the application is in the middle of processing other requests.
    *   **Affected `bat` Component:** Primarily the core processing engine of `bat`, including:
        *   Syntax highlighting engine (syntect library).
        *   Line wrapping and formatting logic.
        *   Git integration (if enabled).
        *   Paging logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation & Size Limits:** Implement strict server-side checks to limit the maximum file size `bat` processes.
        *   **Line Length Limits:** Enforce a maximum line length before passing data to `bat`.
        *   **Resource Limits (cgroups/ulimit):** Use operating system tools to limit CPU and memory for the `bat` process.
        *   **Timeouts:** Terminate `bat` processes that exceed a predefined execution time.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Limit the number of file display requests per user per time unit.
        *   **Disable Expensive Features:** Selectively disable `bat` features like `--diff` or `--paging=always` if not crucial.  Use `--paging=auto` or `--paging=never` strategically.
        *   **Queueing:** Use a queue to manage requests, preventing overload.
