## Attack Tree Path: [1.0 Exploit Input Manipulation to `bat` Command (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1_0_exploit_input_manipulation_to__bat__command__high-risk_path_.md)

**Description:** This is the overarching high-risk category. It involves manipulating the input (filename, arguments) provided to the `bat` command executed by the web application.  If the application doesn't properly control this input, it opens up several attack vectors.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Path Traversal Vulnerability (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_path_traversal_vulnerability__high-risk_path_.md)

**Description:** Attackers aim to access files outside the intended directory by injecting path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`, `..\`) into the filename provided to `bat`.
* **1.1.1 Inject Path Traversal Sequences (e.g., ../../) (High-Risk Path)**
    * **Description:**  The attacker crafts a filename input that includes sequences like `../../` or `..\`.
    * **1.1.1.1 Read Sensitive Files (e.g., /etc/passwd, application config) (High-Risk Path & Critical Node)**
        * **Attack Name:** Path Traversal leading to Sensitive File Read
        * **Description:** By successfully injecting path traversal sequences, the attacker can instruct `bat` to access and display sensitive files on the server's file system that the web application should not expose.
        * **Potential Impact:** Disclosure of sensitive information, including:
            * System configuration files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, application configuration files).
            * Application source code.
            * Database credentials.
            * User data.
        * **Mitigation Strategies (Actionable Insights):**
            * **Strict Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation to reject any filename input containing path traversal sequences. Use a whitelist approach for allowed characters and patterns.
            * **Path Canonicalization:** Canonicalize the input path to resolve symbolic links and relative paths before passing it to `bat`. This helps prevent bypasses using different path representations.
            * **Chroot/Jail Environment:** Consider running `bat` in a chrooted environment or a container with restricted file system access to limit its access to only necessary directories.
            * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the user account running the web application and `bat` has minimal necessary file system permissions.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Inject Path Traversal Sequences (e.g., ../../) (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_inject_path_traversal_sequences__e_g__________high-risk_path_.md)

**Description:**  The attacker crafts a filename input that includes sequences like `../../` or `..\`.

**Attack Name:** Path Traversal leading to Sensitive File Read
        * **Description:** By successfully injecting path traversal sequences, the attacker can instruct `bat` to access and display sensitive files on the server's file system that the web application should not expose.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Command Injection via Filename (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_command_injection_via_filename__high-risk_path_.md)

**Description:** Attackers attempt to execute arbitrary commands on the server by injecting shell metacharacters into the filename provided to `bat`. If the application naively executes `bat` with this unsanitized filename, the shell might interpret these metacharacters as commands.
* **1.2.1 Inject Shell Metacharacters in Filename (High-Risk Path)**
    * **Description:** The attacker crafts a filename input that includes shell metacharacters like `;`, `|`, `$()`, `` ` ``.
    * **1.2.1.1 Execute Arbitrary Commands (e.g., `; whoami`, `$(command)`) (High-Risk Path & Critical Node)**
        * **Attack Name:** Command Injection via Filename
        * **Description:** By injecting shell metacharacters, the attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the web application user. This is possible if the application uses a shell to execute `bat` and doesn't properly sanitize the filename.
        * **Potential Impact:** Complete compromise of the application server, including:
            * Data breach and theft.
            * Modification or deletion of data.
            * Installation of malware.
            * Denial of service.
            * Privilege escalation.
        * **Mitigation Strategies (Actionable Insights):**
            * **Robust Input Sanitization:** Sanitize the filename input to remove or escape all shell metacharacters. Use a whitelist of allowed characters.
            * **Parameterized Commands/Safe Execution:** Use parameterized command execution or libraries that handle command execution safely, preventing shell injection. Avoid using `shell=True` in Python's `subprocess` module or similar unsafe practices in other languages.
            * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Limit the privileges of the user account running the web application and `bat` to minimize the impact of command injection.
            * **Input Validation:** Validate the filename input to ensure it conforms to expected formats and does not contain unexpected characters.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.0 Exploit bat Output Handling by Application (Elevated Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/2_0_exploit_bat_output_handling_by_application__elevated_risk_path_.md)

**Description:** This category focuses on vulnerabilities arising from how the web application processes and displays the output generated by `bat`. While less likely to directly compromise the server, it can lead to client-side vulnerabilities like XSS.
* **2.1 Output Injection leading to XSS (Elevated Risk Path)**
    * **Description:** If the application directly renders `bat`'s output in a web page without proper sanitization, and if the filename or file content processed by `bat` is user-controlled, an attacker can inject malicious content that `bat` will highlight and the application will render, leading to XSS.
    * **2.1.2 Application Renders bat Output Directly in Web Page (Elevated Risk Path)**
        * **Description:** The application takes the raw output from `bat` and directly embeds it into the HTML of a web page without any sanitization or encoding.
        * **2.1.2.1 No Output Sanitization/Encoding by Application (Elevated Risk Path & Critical Node)**
            * **Attack Name:** Output Injection leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
            * **Description:** If the application fails to sanitize or encode the output from `bat` before displaying it in a web page, and if the input to `bat` (filename or file content) can be controlled by an attacker, they can inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code. This code will be highlighted by `bat` and then executed in the user's browser when the application renders the output.
            * **Potential Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, leading to:
                * Session hijacking.
                * Cookie theft.
                * Defacement of the web page.
                * Redirection to malicious websites.
                * Information disclosure from the user's browser.
            * **Mitigation Strategies (Actionable Insights):**
                * **Output Sanitization/Encoding:**  Always sanitize or encode the output from `bat` before displaying it in a web page. Use appropriate encoding functions like HTML entity encoding to prevent the browser from interpreting HTML or JavaScript code within the output.
                * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of XSS vulnerabilities, even if output sanitization is missed. CSP can restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, reducing the effectiveness of injected scripts.
