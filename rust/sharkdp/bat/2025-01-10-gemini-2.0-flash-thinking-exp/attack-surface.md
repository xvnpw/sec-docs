# Attack Surface Analysis for sharkdp/bat

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal via User-Controlled File Paths](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_via_user-controlled_file_paths.md)

**Description:** An attacker can manipulate user-provided input intended to specify a file path, allowing them to access files outside the intended directory.

**How `bat` Contributes:** If the application uses user input to construct the file path passed to `bat`, and this input isn't properly sanitized, `bat` will faithfully attempt to read and display the file at the attacker-controlled path.

**Example:** An application allows a user to view a file by entering its name. If the application directly uses this input with `bat`, an attacker could input `../../../../etc/passwd` to attempt to display the contents of the system's password file.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, potentially leading to information disclosure, privilege escalation, or other security breaches.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Strict Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization on any user-provided file paths before passing them to `bat`. Use allow-lists or canonicalization techniques to prevent path traversal attempts.
* **Confine File Access:** Ensure the application only allows `bat` to access files within a specific, controlled directory. Do not allow users to directly specify arbitrary paths.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the `bat` process with the minimum necessary permissions to access only the required files.

## Attack Surface: [Abuse of `bat`'s Pager Functionality](./attack_surfaces/abuse_of__bat_'s_pager_functionality.md)

**Description:** An attacker can influence the pager program used by `bat` (e.g., via environment variables), potentially leading to the execution of arbitrary commands if a malicious pager is specified.

**How `bat` Contributes:** `bat` respects the `PAGER` environment variable to determine which pager to use for displaying output. If this variable is controlled by an attacker, they can point it to a malicious executable.

**Example:** An attacker sets the `PAGER` environment variable to a malicious script before the application executes `bat`. When `bat` tries to use the pager, the malicious script is executed.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the system where `bat` is running.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Control the Environment:** Ensure the environment in which `bat` is executed is tightly controlled and prevent users or external sources from manipulating environment variables like `PAGER`.
* **Specify a Safe Pager:** Explicitly configure `bat` to use a known safe pager (e.g., by using command-line arguments or configuration files) and ignore the `PAGER` environment variable.
* **Disable Pager if Unnecessary:** If the pager functionality is not required, disable it entirely when invoking `bat`.
