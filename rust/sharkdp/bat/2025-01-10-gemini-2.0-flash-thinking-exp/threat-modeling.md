# Threat Model Analysis for sharkdp/bat

## Threat: [Command Injection via Filename Manipulation](./threats/command_injection_via_filename_manipulation.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate user-provided input (e.g., a filename to be highlighted) to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the server when the application calls `bat`. This is achieved by crafting filenames containing shell metacharacters that are not properly sanitized before being passed as arguments to the `bat` command. `bat` directly receives and processes these potentially malicious filenames.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the server, including data breaches, malware installation, and denial of service.

**Affected Component:** `bat`'s command-line argument parsing.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Strict Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user-provided input before using it in command-line arguments for `bat`. Whitelist allowed characters and reject or escape others.
* **Avoid User Input in Filenames:** If possible, avoid directly using user-provided input as filenames for `bat`. Use internal identifiers or map user input to predefined safe paths.
* **Parameterization/Escaping:**  Properly escape shell metacharacters when constructing the command to execute `bat`. Use libraries or functions specifically designed for this purpose in your programming language.

## Threat: [Path Traversal leading to Unauthorized File Access](./threats/path_traversal_leading_to_unauthorized_file_access.md)

**Description:** An attacker could provide manipulated file paths (e.g., using `../`) to the application, causing `bat` to access and display files outside the intended directory or scope. `bat` directly interprets and acts upon the provided file path.

**Impact:** Disclosure of sensitive information, including configuration files, source code, or user data.

**Affected Component:** `bat`'s file access mechanism.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Strict Path Validation:** Implement robust path validation to ensure that the file paths provided to `bat` are within the expected and allowed directories *before* passing them to `bat`.
* **Canonicalization:**  Canonicalize file paths to resolve symbolic links and relative paths before passing them to `bat`.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the application and the `bat` process only have the necessary file system permissions.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in `bat` or its Dependencies](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_in__bat__or_its_dependencies.md)

**Description:**  `bat` or its underlying syntax highlighting libraries might contain security vulnerabilities. An attacker could provide specially crafted input files that trigger these vulnerabilities, potentially leading to remote code execution or other malicious outcomes *within the `bat` process*.

**Impact:** Potential for code execution within the `bat` process, leading to local privilege escalation, information disclosure, or denial of service.

**Affected Component:**  Various modules within `bat` and its dependencies (e.g., syntax highlighting libraries).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Regular Updates:** Keep `bat` updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
* **Dependency Management:** Use dependency management tools to track and update `bat`'s dependencies.
* **Vulnerability Scanning:** Periodically scan your dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
* **Sandboxing:** Running `bat` in a sandboxed environment can limit the impact of potential exploits.
