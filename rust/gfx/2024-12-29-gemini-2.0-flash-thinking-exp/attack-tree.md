## Threat Model: Compromising Application Using gfx-rs - High-Risk Sub-Tree

**Objective:** Compromise application using gfx-rs by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the project itself.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

    *   **AND: Trigger Memory Corruption in gfx-rs (CRITICAL NODE)**
        *   OR: Supply Malicious Input Data
            *   **HIGH-RISK PATH:** Crafted Vertex Data leading to Buffer Overflow
            *   **HIGH-RISK PATH:** Malicious Texture Data causing Out-of-Bounds Read/Write
            *   **HIGH-RISK PATH:** Exploiting Shader Compilation Vulnerabilities
        *   **HIGH-RISK PATH:** Exploit Use-After-Free Vulnerabilities

        *   **HIGH-RISK PATH:** Vulnerabilities in the underlying graphics API
        *   **HIGH-RISK PATH:** Vulnerabilities in shader compiler libraries
*   **OR: Exploit Application's Incorrect Usage of gfx-rs (CRITICAL NODE)**
    *   **HIGH-RISK PATH:** Improper Input Validation Before Passing to gfx-rs
        *   Application fails to sanitize user-provided data

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

*   **OR: Exploit Vulnerabilities in gfx-rs Library (CRITICAL NODE)**
    *   This node represents the attacker's goal of directly exploiting flaws within the gfx-rs library code. Success here can lead to significant control over the application.

*   **AND: Trigger Memory Corruption in gfx-rs (CRITICAL NODE)**
    *   This node focuses on attacks that aim to corrupt the memory used by gfx-rs, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

    *   OR: Supply Malicious Input Data
        *   **HIGH-RISK PATH:** Crafted Vertex Data leading to Buffer Overflow
            *   Providing vertex data with sizes exceeding allocated buffers can lead to buffer overflows, allowing attackers to overwrite adjacent memory regions and potentially gain control of program execution.
        *   **HIGH-RISK PATH:** Malicious Texture Data causing Out-of-Bounds Read/Write
            *   Corrupted image formats or manipulated pixel data can cause out-of-bounds reads or writes during texture loading or processing, potentially leading to information disclosure or crashes.
        *   **HIGH-RISK PATH:** Exploiting Shader Compilation Vulnerabilities
            *   If gfx-rs handles shader compilation directly or relies on a vulnerable shader compiler library, attackers might inject malicious code into shaders that gets executed by the GPU.

    *   **HIGH-RISK PATH:** Exploit Use-After-Free Vulnerabilities
        *   If gfx-rs incorrectly manages the lifecycle of resources, an attacker might be able to access memory that has already been freed, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

    *   **HIGH-RISK PATH:** Exploit Double-Free Vulnerabilities
        *   Freeing the same memory twice can lead to memory corruption and potentially arbitrary code execution.

    *   **HIGH-RISK PATH:** Exploit Dependencies of gfx-rs
        *   This path involves exploiting vulnerabilities in libraries that gfx-rs relies on.
        *   **HIGH-RISK PATH:** Vulnerabilities in the underlying graphics API
            *   Attackers might craft gfx-rs calls that trigger known vulnerabilities in Vulkan, Metal, DirectX, or other backend APIs, potentially leading to driver crashes or system compromise.
        *   **HIGH-RISK PATH:** Vulnerabilities in shader compiler libraries
            *   If gfx-rs uses external shader compilers, vulnerabilities in those compilers could be exploited through malicious shader code, leading to arbitrary code execution.

*   **OR: Exploit Application's Incorrect Usage of gfx-rs (CRITICAL NODE)**
    *   This node highlights vulnerabilities that arise from how the application developers use the gfx-rs library, rather than flaws within the library itself.

    *   **HIGH-RISK PATH:** Improper Input Validation Before Passing to gfx-rs
        *   Application fails to sanitize user-provided data
            *   If the application doesn't properly sanitize user-provided data used for vertex attributes, textures, or shader inputs, attackers can inject malicious data that triggers vulnerabilities in gfx-rs or the underlying drivers.

*   **OR: Exploit Interaction with Underlying Graphics Drivers (CRITICAL NODE)**
    *   This node focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior in the graphics drivers that gfx-rs interacts with.

    *   **HIGH-RISK PATH:** Trigger Driver Bugs via Malformed gfx-rs API Calls
        *   Attackers might try to find specific sequences of gfx-rs API calls that trigger known or unknown vulnerabilities in the underlying graphics drivers, potentially leading to driver crashes or system instability.
