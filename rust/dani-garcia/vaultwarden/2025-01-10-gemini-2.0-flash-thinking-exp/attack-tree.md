## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Vaultwarden Itself](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_vaultwarden_itself.md)

* This represents a fundamental weakness in the Vaultwarden software itself. If vulnerabilities exist, attackers can directly exploit them.

    **1.1. Exploit Known Vulnerabilities** (High-Risk Path):
        * Attackers leverage publicly disclosed vulnerabilities with available exploits.

        **1.1.1. Exploit Unpatched Vulnerabilities** (High-Risk Path):
            * The system is running a version of Vaultwarden with known vulnerabilities that have not been patched.

            **1.1.1.1. Gain Remote Code Execution (RCE)** (Critical Node):
                * An attacker successfully exploits a vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the Vaultwarden server.
                * Attack Vector: Sending a crafted request or input that triggers a buffer overflow, injection flaw, or other vulnerability leading to code execution.

            **1.1.1.2. Achieve Authentication Bypass** (Critical Node):
                * An attacker bypasses the normal authentication mechanisms to gain unauthorized access.
                * Attack Vector: Exploiting flaws in the authentication logic, using default credentials (if not changed), or leveraging vulnerabilities that allow bypassing login procedures.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Vaultwarden's Integration with the Application](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_vaultwarden's_integration_with_the_application.md)

* This focuses on weaknesses in how the application interacts with Vaultwarden, particularly concerning the API key.

    **2.1. Exploit Insecure API Key Management by the Application** (High-Risk Path and Critical Node):
        * The application does not securely manage the Vaultwarden API key, making it accessible to attackers.

        **2.1.1. Retrieve Stored API Key** (High-Risk Path):
            * Attackers attempt to retrieve the API key stored by the application.

            **2.1.1.1. Exploit Application Vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL Injection, Path Traversal)**:
                * Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the application's codebase to access the stored API key.
                * Attack Vector: Using SQL injection to query the database for the key, exploiting path traversal to access configuration files containing the key.

            **2.1.1.2. Access Application Configuration Files**:
                * Attackers directly access configuration files where the API key might be stored insecurely.
                * Attack Vector: Exploiting misconfigured file permissions, using default credentials for the server, or leveraging other access control weaknesses.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise the Vaultwarden Environment](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_the_vaultwarden_environment.md)

* This involves attacking the infrastructure where Vaultwarden is hosted.

    **3.1. Exploit Vulnerabilities in the Hosting Infrastructure** (High-Risk Path):
        * Attackers target vulnerabilities in the operating system or container environment.

        **3.1.1. Exploit OS Vulnerabilities** (Critical Node):
            * Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the server's operating system.
            * Attack Vector: Using publicly available exploits for known OS vulnerabilities to gain shell access.

    **3.2. Gain Unauthorized Access to the Vaultwarden Data Store** (High-Risk Path and Critical Node):
        * Attackers directly access the database where Vaultwarden stores its encrypted data.

        **3.2.1. Exploit Database Vulnerabilities**:
            * Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the database system itself.
            * Attack Vector: Using SQL injection against the database, exploiting known database vulnerabilities, or using default database credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Social Engineering or Phishing Attacks](./attack_tree_paths/social_engineering_or_phishing_attacks.md)

* This relies on manipulating individuals to gain access.

    **4.1. Target Vaultwarden Administrators** (High-Risk Path):
        * Attackers specifically target administrators who have access to the Vaultwarden instance.

        **4.1.1. Obtain Master Password** (Critical Node):
            * Attackers trick administrators into revealing their master password.
            * Attack Vector: Sending phishing emails disguised as legitimate requests, creating fake login pages, or using social engineering tactics to manipulate administrators.
