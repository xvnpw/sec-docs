# Threat Model Analysis for dani-garcia/vaultwarden

## Threat: [Unpatched Vaultwarden Vulnerability Leading to Remote Code Execution](./threats/unpatched_vaultwarden_vulnerability_leading_to_remote_code_execution.md)

**Description:** An attacker identifies a known security vulnerability in the Vaultwarden codebase (e.g., through public disclosures or vulnerability scanning). They craft a malicious request or exploit that targets this vulnerability, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the Vaultwarden instance. This could involve sending specially crafted data through the web interface or API directly to the Vaultwarden service.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the Vaultwarden server, potentially leading to data breaches (access to all stored secrets), denial of service, and the ability to pivot to other systems on the network.

**Affected Component:** Potentially any part of the Vaultwarden codebase, depending on the specific vulnerability. This could include the web server component, API endpoints, or internal processing logic within Vaultwarden.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement a process for regularly updating Vaultwarden to the latest stable version.
* Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases related to Vaultwarden and its dependencies.
* Consider using automated vulnerability scanning tools specifically targeting Vaultwarden.

## Threat: [Misconfigured Vaultwarden Admin Panel Exposing Secrets](./threats/misconfigured_vaultwarden_admin_panel_exposing_secrets.md)

**Description:** The administrator of the Vaultwarden instance fails to properly secure the administrative interface. This could involve using default credentials, exposing the admin panel to the public internet without proper authentication, or failing to implement multi-factor authentication directly on the Vaultwarden instance. An attacker gains access to the admin panel through brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploiting default credentials targeting the Vaultwarden admin interface. Once logged in, they can view and export all stored secrets managed by Vaultwarden.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of all stored secrets within the Vaultwarden instance.

**Affected Component:** The administrative web interface of Vaultwarden.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Change default administrative credentials immediately after installation of Vaultwarden.
* Restrict access to the Vaultwarden administrative interface to specific IP addresses or networks directly within the Vaultwarden configuration or using network firewalls.
* Enforce strong passwords for administrative accounts directly within Vaultwarden.
* Implement multi-factor authentication for administrative accounts within Vaultwarden.
* Regularly review access logs of the Vaultwarden admin interface for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Weak Encryption Configuration or Implementation Flaws within Vaultwarden](./threats/weak_encryption_configuration_or_implementation_flaws_within_vaultwarden.md)

**Description:** While Vaultwarden uses strong encryption by default, misconfiguration within Vaultwarden's settings or undiscovered vulnerabilities in its encryption implementation could weaken the protection of stored secrets. This could involve configuring Vaultwarden to use outdated encryption algorithms, improper key management *within Vaultwarden itself*, or flaws in Vaultwarden's encryption/decryption logic. An attacker exploiting such weaknesses could potentially decrypt the stored data directly from the Vaultwarden database.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive secrets stored within the Vaultwarden database.

**Affected Component:** The encryption module within Vaultwarden responsible for encrypting and decrypting data at rest.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure Vaultwarden is configured to use strong and up-to-date encryption algorithms as recommended by the Vaultwarden documentation.
* Monitor for any reported vulnerabilities specifically related to Vaultwarden's encryption implementation.
* Regularly review Vaultwarden's security documentation and best practices regarding encryption.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Vaultwarden's Components Leading to Compromise](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_vaultwarden's_components_leading_to_compromise.md)

**Description:** Vaultwarden relies on various third-party libraries and dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies *within the Vaultwarden application itself* could be exploited to compromise the Vaultwarden instance. An attacker could leverage known vulnerabilities in these components to gain unauthorized access or execute malicious code directly on the Vaultwarden server.

**Impact:** Potential for remote code execution on the Vaultwarden server, data breaches, or denial of service, depending on the specific vulnerability in the dependency.

**Affected Component:** The specific vulnerable dependency used by Vaultwarden.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update Vaultwarden, which typically includes updates to its dependencies.
* Monitor security advisories for the specific libraries used by Vaultwarden.
* Consider using tools that can scan the Vaultwarden installation for known dependency vulnerabilities.
