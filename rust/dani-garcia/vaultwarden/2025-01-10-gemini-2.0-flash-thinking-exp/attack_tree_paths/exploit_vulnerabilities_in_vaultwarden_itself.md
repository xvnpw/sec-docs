    * **Vulnerability Management Program:** Implement a robust process for tracking, assessing, and remediating vulnerabilities.
    * **Security Monitoring:**  Monitor logs and network traffic for signs of exploitation attempts targeting known vulnerabilities.

**Node 1.1.1: Exploit Unpatched Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path)**

* **Description:** This highlights the critical window of opportunity for attackers between the disclosure of a vulnerability and the application of the corresponding patch. Systems running outdated versions are highly susceptible.
* **Attacker Skill Level:**  Moderate to High. While exploits might be available, understanding the vulnerability and adapting the exploit to the specific environment might require more skill.
* **Likelihood:**  High if patching is delayed or neglected. The longer a vulnerability remains unpatched, the higher the chance of exploitation.
* **Impact:**  Critical, as attackers can leverage well-understood weaknesses in the software.
* **Attack Vectors:**  Same as Node 1.1, but specifically targeting vulnerabilities that the current instance has not addressed.
* **Mitigation Strategies (in addition to previous nodes):**
    * **Automated Patching:** Implement automated patching mechanisms where possible to reduce the time window for exploitation.
    * **Change Management:**  Establish a well-defined change management process for applying security updates.
    * **Emergency Patching Procedures:** Have procedures in place for rapidly deploying critical security patches.

**Node 1.1.1.1: Gain Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Critical Node)**

* **Description:** This is a highly critical outcome where an attacker successfully exploits a vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the Vaultwarden server. This grants them complete control over the server and the application.
* **Attacker Skill Level:**  High. Developing reliable RCE exploits often requires deep technical understanding and skillful manipulation of system resources.
