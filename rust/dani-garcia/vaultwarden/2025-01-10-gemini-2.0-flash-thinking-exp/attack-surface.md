# Attack Surface Analysis for dani-garcia/vaultwarden

## Attack Surface: [Weak Password Policies and Brute-Force Attacks](./attack_surfaces/weak_password_policies_and_brute-force_attacks.md)

**Description:** Insufficient enforcement of strong password requirements allows users to set easily guessable passwords, making accounts vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
*   **How Vaultwarden Contributes:** Vaultwarden's web interface handles user registration and password changes. If it doesn't enforce strong password complexity (length, character types, etc.), it directly contributes to this vulnerability.
*   **Example:** An attacker uses a password cracking tool to try common passwords against a Vaultwarden user's login. If the password is weak (e.g., "password123"), the attacker gains access to the user's vault.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of user's stored credentials, potentially leading to access to sensitive accounts and data across various services.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement and enforce strong password complexity requirements during registration and password changes. Consider using password strength estimators.

## Attack Surface: [Lack of Rate Limiting on Login Attempts](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_rate_limiting_on_login_attempts.md)

**Description:** The absence of rate limiting on login attempts allows attackers to repeatedly try different passwords without significant delays, facilitating brute-force attacks.
*   **How Vaultwarden Contributes:** Vaultwarden's authentication mechanism processes login requests. If it doesn't implement rate limiting, it allows for unlimited login attempts.
*   **Example:** An attacker uses a script to automatically try thousands of passwords against a user's account. Without rate limiting, the attacker can quickly iterate through many possibilities.
*   **Impact:** Increased likelihood of successful brute-force attacks, potentially leading to account compromise. Can also cause denial-of-service by overloading the server with login requests.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement rate limiting on login attempts based on IP address or username. Consider using techniques like temporary account lockout after a certain number of failed attempts.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure API Key Management](./attack_surfaces/insecure_api_key_management.md)

**Description:**  Vulnerabilities in how API keys are generated, stored, or managed can lead to their compromise, allowing unauthorized access to Vaultwarden's API.
*   **How Vaultwarden Contributes:** Vaultwarden's API allows interaction with the server for various functionalities. If API keys are generated predictably, stored insecurely (e.g., in plain text), or lack proper rotation mechanisms, it increases the risk.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains access to a server configuration file where API keys are stored in plain text. They can then use these keys to access and manipulate data within Vaultwarden.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user vaults, potential data exfiltration, and the ability to perform actions on behalf of users.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Generate API keys using cryptographically secure random number generators. Store API keys securely using encryption or hashing. Implement API key rotation mechanisms. Provide granular control over API key permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Configuration Management](./attack_surfaces/insecure_configuration_management.md)

**Description:**  Storing sensitive configuration data in plain text or with weak protection can expose critical information.
*   **How Vaultwarden Contributes:** Vaultwarden's configuration files contain sensitive information like database credentials, encryption keys, and potentially API keys. If these files are not properly secured *by Vaultwarden's design or default configuration*, they become an attack vector.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the Vaultwarden configuration file and retrieves the database credentials. They can then directly access the database, bypassing Vaultwarden's security measures.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Vaultwarden instance and potentially the underlying data.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Avoid storing sensitive information directly in configuration files. Use environment variables or dedicated secrets management solutions. Ensure configuration files have appropriate file permissions *by default or through clear documentation*.
