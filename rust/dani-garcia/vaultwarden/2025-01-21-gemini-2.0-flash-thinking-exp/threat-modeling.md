# Threat Model Analysis for dani-garcia/vaultwarden

## Threat: [Master Password Brute-Force](./threats/master_password_brute-force.md)

**Description:** An attacker attempts to guess a user's master password by repeatedly submitting login requests directly to the Vaultwarden server. They might use automated tools and lists of common passwords or previously leaked credentials.

**Impact:** Successful brute-force allows the attacker to gain full access to the user's vault, including all stored credentials and sensitive information.

**Affected Component:** Authentication Module

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Developers should implement robust rate limiting on login attempts.
*   Developers should consider implementing account lockout mechanisms after a certain number of failed attempts.

## Threat: [Weak Master Password Hashing](./threats/weak_master_password_hashing.md)

**Description:** If the algorithm used by Vaultwarden to hash the master password is weak or improperly implemented, an attacker who gains access to the Vaultwarden database might be able to crack master passwords offline.

**Impact:** Compromised master passwords allow attackers to decrypt user vaults and access sensitive information.

**Affected Component:** Authentication Module, Database Interaction

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Developers should ensure the use of a strong and well-vetted password hashing algorithm like Argon2id with appropriate parameters (iterations, memory).
*   Developers should regularly review and update the hashing implementation to follow security best practices.

## Threat: [Session Hijacking via XSS](./threats/session_hijacking_via_xss.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious scripts (Cross-Site Scripting) into the Vaultwarden web interface. These scripts can steal session cookies, allowing the attacker to impersonate a legitimate user on the Vaultwarden server.

**Impact:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to a user's vault and perform actions as that user.

**Affected Component:** Web Interface, Session Management

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Developers must implement robust input sanitization and output encoding to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
*   Developers should use Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.

## Threat: [Database Compromise Leading to Data Exposure](./threats/database_compromise_leading_to_data_exposure.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the underlying database where Vaultwarden stores encrypted vault data. If Vaultwarden's encryption is weak or keys are compromised, the attacker can decrypt the data.

**Impact:** Full exposure of all user credentials and sensitive information stored in the Vaultwarden instance.

**Affected Component:** Database, Encryption Module

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Developers should ensure strong encryption at rest for the database itself (this is often an operational concern but influenced by Vaultwarden's design).

## Threat: [Encryption Key Compromise](./threats/encryption_key_compromise.md)

**Description:** If the encryption key used by Vaultwarden to protect the vault data is compromised (e.g., due to a vulnerability in key generation or storage within Vaultwarden), attackers can decrypt the stored credentials.

**Impact:** Full exposure of all user credentials and sensitive information stored in the Vaultwarden instance.

**Affected Component:** Encryption Module, Key Management

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Developers should ensure the encryption key derivation process is secure and relies on strong user secrets (master password).
*   Developers should avoid storing the encryption key separately from the encrypted data in a way that could lead to its compromise within the Vaultwarden application.

## Threat: [Malicious Update Injection](./threats/malicious_update_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker compromises the Vaultwarden update mechanism and injects a malicious update containing malware or backdoors directly into the Vaultwarden instance.

**Impact:** The attacker gains control over the Vaultwarden server, potentially leading to data theft, further attacks, or denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Update Mechanism

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Developers should implement secure update channels using HTTPS.
*   Developers should digitally sign updates to ensure their authenticity and integrity.
