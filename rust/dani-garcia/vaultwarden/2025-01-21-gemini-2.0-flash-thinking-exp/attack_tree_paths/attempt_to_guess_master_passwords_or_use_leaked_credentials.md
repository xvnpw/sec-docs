### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Attempt to guess master passwords or use leaked credentials

This attack path represents a common and significant threat to any password management system, including Vaultwarden. It leverages the inherent human element of password creation and the unfortunate reality of data breaches.

**4.1. Understanding the Attack**

This attack path encompasses two primary methods:

* **Guessing Master Passwords:**
    * **Brute-Force Attacks:** Attackers use automated tools to systematically try every possible combination of characters for the master password. The success of this attack depends on the complexity and length of the master password. Simpler and shorter passwords are significantly more vulnerable.
    * **Dictionary Attacks:** Attackers use lists of commonly used passwords, words from dictionaries, and variations thereof. This method is effective against users who choose easily guessable passwords.
    * **Hybrid Attacks:** A combination of brute-force and dictionary attacks, often incorporating common substitutions and patterns.

* **Using Leaked Credentials:**
    * **Credential Stuffing:** Attackers obtain lists of username/password pairs from previous data breaches of other online services. They then attempt to use these credentials to log into the Vaultwarden instance, hoping that users have reused the same password across multiple platforms. This is a highly effective attack method due to widespread password reuse.

**Technical Details:**

Attackers typically target the login endpoint of the Vaultwarden web interface or the mobile application API. They will send numerous login requests with different password attempts.

* **Web Interface:**  Attackers will interact with the `/api/mobile/login` endpoint (or similar) by sending HTTP POST requests with username and password combinations.
* **Mobile Application API:** Similar to the web interface, attackers will target the API endpoints used for authentication.

**Vaultwarden Specifics:**

Vaultwarden implements some built-in defenses against these attacks:

* **Rate Limiting:** Vaultwarden can be configured to limit the number of failed login attempts from a single IP address within a specific timeframe. This can slow down brute-force attacks.
* **Account Lockout:** After a certain number of consecutive failed login attempts, Vaultwarden can temporarily lock the account, preventing further attempts for a period.

**4.2. Identifying Vulnerabilities**

The vulnerabilities exploited in this attack path are primarily related to:

* **Weak Master Passwords:**  Users choosing easily guessable or short master passwords significantly increase the likelihood of a successful brute-force or dictionary attack.
* **Password Reuse:**  Users reusing the same master password across multiple online services make them vulnerable to credential stuffing attacks if their credentials are leaked from another service.
* **Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  If MFA is not enabled, the master password is the sole barrier to accessing the vault. Compromising the master password grants immediate access to all stored credentials.

**4.3. Analyzing Impact**

A successful attack via this path has severe consequences:

* **Complete Compromise of Stored Credentials:** Attackers gain access to all usernames, passwords, notes, and other sensitive information stored within the Vaultwarden vault.
* **Potential for Further Attacks:** The compromised credentials can be used to access other online accounts and services, leading to further data breaches, financial loss, and identity theft.
* **Reputational Damage:** If the Vaultwarden instance is used by an organization, a successful attack can severely damage its reputation and erode trust.
* **Financial Loss:**  Depending on the information stored in the vault, the compromise can lead to direct financial losses.

**4.4. Evaluating Existing Controls**

Vaultwarden's built-in rate limiting and account lockout features are crucial first lines of defense against brute-force attacks. However, their effectiveness depends on proper configuration and the attacker's sophistication.

* **Rate Limiting:**  If the rate limit is too high, attackers can still make a significant number of attempts.
* **Account Lockout:**  The lockout duration needs to be sufficient to deter attackers. Attackers might also attempt to bypass lockout mechanisms by using distributed botnets or rotating IP addresses.

**4.5. Recommending Enhancements**

To further strengthen defenses against this attack path, the following enhancements are recommended:

* **Enforce Strong Master Passwords:**
    * **Password Complexity Requirements:** Implement and enforce strict password complexity requirements (minimum length, use of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols).
    * **Password Strength Meter:** Integrate a password strength meter during master password creation and modification to guide users towards stronger passwords.
    * **Regular Password Changes:** Encourage users to periodically change their master password.

* **Mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
    * **Strongly Recommend or Enforce MFA:**  MFA adds an extra layer of security, making it significantly harder for attackers to gain access even if the master password is compromised. Encourage the use of authenticator apps (TOTP) or hardware security keys (U2F/WebAuthn).

* **Account Monitoring and Alerting:**
    * **Implement Logging and Monitoring:**  Log failed login attempts, successful logins, and other relevant security events.
    * **Alerting System:**  Implement an alerting system to notify administrators of suspicious activity, such as a high number of failed login attempts from a single IP or for a specific user.

* **Consider CAPTCHA or Similar Mechanisms:**
    * **Implement CAPTCHA:**  For public-facing Vaultwarden instances, consider implementing CAPTCHA or similar mechanisms after a certain number of failed login attempts to deter automated attacks.

* **Educate Users:**
    * **Security Awareness Training:**  Educate users about the importance of strong, unique master passwords and the risks of password reuse.
    * **Promote MFA Adoption:**  Clearly communicate the benefits of MFA and provide guidance on how to enable it.

* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    * **Conduct Regular Audits:**  Periodically review security configurations and logs.
    * **Penetration Testing:**  Engage security professionals to conduct penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the system.

**4.6. Providing Development Insights**

The development team should consider the following:

* **Default Security Settings:**  Ensure that default security settings for rate limiting and account lockout are reasonably aggressive.
* **MFA Implementation:**  Make MFA implementation robust and user-friendly. Provide clear instructions and support for different MFA methods.
* **Logging and Monitoring Infrastructure:**  Ensure comprehensive logging of authentication events and provide tools for administrators to monitor and analyze these logs.
* **API Security:**  Review the security of the authentication API endpoints to prevent abuse and ensure proper rate limiting and protection against automated attacks.
* **User Interface Improvements:**  Enhance the user interface to guide users towards stronger passwords and encourage the adoption of MFA.

**Conclusion:**

The attack path of attempting to guess master passwords or use leaked credentials poses a significant threat to Vaultwarden instances. While Vaultwarden provides some built-in defenses, a layered security approach is crucial. By enforcing strong master passwords, mandating MFA, implementing robust monitoring and alerting, and educating users, the risk of successful attacks via this path can be significantly reduced. The development team plays a vital role in providing the necessary features and configurations to support these security measures. Continuous vigilance and proactive security practices are essential to protect sensitive information stored within Vaultwarden.
