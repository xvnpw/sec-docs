      * **Web Crawling and Directory Traversal:**  Exploring the server's file system through web vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
      * **Analyzing Application Code:**  Examining the application's source code (if accessible) to identify where configuration files are loaded or environment variables are used.
      * **Utilizing Command Injection Vulnerabilities:**  Executing commands on the server to list directories and files.

3. **Accessing Configuration Files:**

   * **Potential Vulnerabilities:**
      * **Insecure File Permissions:** Configuration files readable by the web server user or other unauthorized accounts.
      * **Exposed Backup Files:** Backup files containing configuration data stored in accessible locations.
      * **Web Server Misconfiguration:**  Web server configured to serve configuration files directly.
      * **Path Traversal Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the application or web server to access files outside the intended directory.
   * **Attacker Techniques:**
      * **Direct File Access:**  Accessing files directly if permissions allow.
      * **Downloading Backup Files:**  Retrieving exposed backup files.
      * **Exploiting Path Traversal:**  Using "../" sequences or other techniques to navigate the file system.

4. **Accessing Environment Variables:**

   * **Potential Vulnerabilities:**
      * **Insecure Process Management:**  Environment variables accessible to other processes or users.
      * **Exposed Process Information:**  Tools or interfaces that reveal running processes and their environment variables.
      * **Server-Side Vulnerabilities:**  Vulnerabilities allowing execution of arbitrary commands, which can then be used to read environment variables.
      * **Container Escape (if applicable):**  Exploiting vulnerabilities to escape the container and access the host's environment variables.
   * **Attacker Techniques:**
      * **Using `printenv`, `env`, or similar commands:** Executing commands to display environment variables.
      * **Inspecting Process Information:**  Using tools like `ps` or accessing process information through system interfaces.
      * **Exploiting Server-Side Vulnerabilities:**  Leveraging vulnerabilities like command injection to execute commands that reveal environment variables.

5. **Extraction of API Keys:**

   * **Potential Vulnerabilities:**
      * **Plain Text Storage:** API keys stored directly in configuration files or environment variables without encryption.
      * **Weak Encryption:**  API keys encrypted with easily breakable algorithms or weak keys.
      * **Poor Key Management Practices:**  Storing API keys alongside other sensitive information without proper segregation.
   * **Attacker Techniques:**
      * **Direct Reading:**  Simply reading the API keys if stored in plain text.
