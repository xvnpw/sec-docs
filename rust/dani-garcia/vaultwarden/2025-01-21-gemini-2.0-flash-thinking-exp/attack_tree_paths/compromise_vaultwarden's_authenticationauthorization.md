* **4.4.1. Missing or Weak API Authentication:**
    * **Description:**  The API lacks proper authentication mechanisms or uses weak authentication methods, allowing unauthorized access.
    * **Potential Weaknesses:**  Reliance on easily guessable API keys, lack of authentication requirements for certain API endpoints.
    * **Impact:** Attackers can access and manipulate data through the API without proper authorization.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strong API authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0, API keys with proper management).
        * Ensure all API endpoints require authentication.

* **4.4.2. Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA/IDOR):**
    * **Description:**  The API fails to properly verify that a user has the authorization to access a specific resource based on its identifier. Attackers can manipulate resource IDs to access resources belonging to other users.
    * **Potential Weaknesses:**  Using predictable or sequential resource IDs, lack of proper authorization checks based on user context.
    * **Impact:** Attackers can access and modify data belonging to other users.
