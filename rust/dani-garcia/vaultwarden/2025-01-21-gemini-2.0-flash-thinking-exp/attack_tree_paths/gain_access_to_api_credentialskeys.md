### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Gain Access to API Credentials/Keys

This attack path focuses on compromising the security of the API credentials used by the Vaultwarden application. These credentials are crucial for authentication and authorization of API requests, potentially granting access to sensitive data and administrative functions.

Here's a breakdown of potential attack vectors within this path:

**4.1. Direct Access to Storage of Credentials:**

* **Attack Vector:** **Compromised Configuration Files:**
    * **Description:** API keys might be stored directly within configuration files (e.g., `.env` files, configuration YAML/JSON files) without proper encryption or access controls. If an attacker gains access to the server's filesystem, they could read these files and extract the credentials.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium to High (depending on configuration practices). Developers might inadvertently commit sensitive information to version control or leave default configurations in place.
    * **Impact:** High. Direct access to API keys grants full control over the API.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Never store API keys directly in configuration files.**
        * **Utilize secure secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault).**
        * **Encrypt configuration files at rest.**
        * **Implement strict access controls on configuration files, limiting access to only necessary users and processes.**
        * **Regularly scan repositories and server files for accidentally committed secrets.**

* **Attack Vector:** **Exposed Environment Variables:**
    * **Description:** API keys might be stored as environment variables on the server. If the server is compromised or if there are vulnerabilities allowing access to environment variables (e.g., through server-side request forgery - SSRF), the attacker can retrieve the credentials.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium. While common, best practices discourage storing highly sensitive secrets directly in environment variables without additional protection.
    * **Impact:** High. Access to API keys grants full control over the API.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Avoid storing highly sensitive secrets directly in environment variables.**
        * **If using environment variables, ensure the server environment is securely configured and protected.**
        * **Implement robust access controls to prevent unauthorized access to server environments.**
        * **Regularly audit server configurations and environment variables.**

* **Attack Vector:** **Compromised Secrets Management System:**
    * **Description:** If a secrets management system is used to store API keys, a compromise of this system would grant the attacker access to the credentials. This could involve vulnerabilities in the secrets management software itself, misconfigurations, or compromised access credentials to the system.
    * **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (depending on the security posture of the secrets management system).
    * **Impact:** High. Compromise of a secrets management system can expose multiple secrets, including API keys.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Choose a reputable and well-maintained secrets management solution.**
        * **Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing the secrets management system.**
        * **Regularly update and patch the secrets management software.**
        * **Enforce the principle of least privilege for access to secrets.**
        * **Monitor access logs and audit trails of the secrets management system.**

* **Attack Vector:** **Database Compromise:**
    * **Description:** In some cases, API keys might be stored within the application's database. If the database is compromised due to SQL injection vulnerabilities, weak credentials, or other database security flaws, the attacker could retrieve the keys.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium (depending on database security practices).
    * **Impact:** High. Database compromise can expose a wide range of sensitive data, including API keys.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Implement robust database security measures, including strong authentication, authorization, and encryption at rest and in transit.**
        * **Regularly patch and update the database software.**
        * **Sanitize user inputs to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.**
        * **Enforce the principle of least privilege for database access.**
        * **Regularly back up the database and store backups securely.**

**4.2. Exploiting Application Vulnerabilities:**

* **Attack Vector:** **Code Injection Vulnerabilities (e.g., SSRF, Command Injection):**
    * **Description:** Vulnerabilities like Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) or Command Injection could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. This code could then be used to access configuration files, environment variables, or the secrets management system where API keys are stored.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium (depending on the application's code quality and security testing).
    * **Impact:** High. Successful exploitation can lead to full server compromise and access to sensitive data.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Implement secure coding practices to prevent injection vulnerabilities.**
        * **Regularly perform static and dynamic application security testing (SAST/DAST).**
        * **Sanitize and validate all user inputs.**
        * **Implement proper input and output encoding.**
        * **Enforce the principle of least privilege for application processes.**

* **Attack Vector:** **Information Disclosure Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Description:** Vulnerabilities that unintentionally expose sensitive information, such as API keys, through error messages, debug logs, or publicly accessible files.
    * **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (depending on development practices and security awareness).
    * **Impact:** High. Direct exposure of API keys grants immediate access.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Disable detailed error messages in production environments.**

        * **Securely configure web servers to prevent access to sensitive files (e.g., using `.htaccess` or `nginx.conf`).**
        * **Regularly review application logs and server configurations.**

**4.3. Interception During Transmission:**

* **Attack Vector:** **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:**
    * **Description:** If API keys are transmitted over an insecure channel (e.g., HTTP instead of HTTPS), an attacker could intercept the communication and steal the credentials.
    * **Likelihood:** Low (if HTTPS is enforced).
    * **Impact:** High. Intercepted API keys can be used immediately.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Enforce HTTPS for all communication involving API keys.**
        * **Utilize TLS (Transport Layer Security) with strong ciphers.**
        * **Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to prevent downgrade attacks.**
