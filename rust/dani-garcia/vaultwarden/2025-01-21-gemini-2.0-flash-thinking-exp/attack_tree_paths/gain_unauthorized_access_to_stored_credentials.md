### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Gain Unauthorized Access to Stored Credentials

This attack path represents the ultimate goal for an attacker targeting a password manager like Vaultwarden. Success here grants the attacker access to a potentially vast collection of sensitive credentials, leading to significant damage. We can break down this high-level objective into several potential sub-paths and attack vectors:

**4.1 Exploiting Web Application Vulnerabilities in Vaultwarden:**

* **4.1.1 SQL Injection:**
    * **Description:** An attacker injects malicious SQL code into input fields, potentially allowing them to bypass authentication, extract data directly from the database (including encrypted credentials), or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server.
    * **Prerequisites:**  Vulnerable input fields that are not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries.
    * **Impact:**  Complete database compromise, including access to all stored credentials.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):**  The most effective defense against SQL injection.
        * **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Strictly validate and sanitize all user inputs.
        * **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant the database user minimal necessary permissions.
        * **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

* **4.1.2 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    * **Description:** An attacker injects malicious scripts into the Vaultwarden web interface, which are then executed in the browsers of other users. This can be used to steal session cookies, capture keystrokes, or redirect users to phishing sites to obtain their master password.
    * **Prerequisites:**  Vulnerable areas in the application where user-supplied data is displayed without proper encoding.
    * **Impact:**  Stealing user session cookies, potentially leading to account takeover and access to stored credentials. Phishing for master passwords.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Output Encoding:**  Properly encode all user-supplied data before displaying it in the browser.
        * **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Define a policy to control the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources.
        * **HTTPOnly and Secure Flags for Cookies:**  Prevent client-side scripts from accessing session cookies and ensure they are only transmitted over HTTPS.

* **4.1.3 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):**
    * **Description:** An attacker tricks a logged-in user into performing unintended actions on the Vaultwarden application, such as changing their master password or granting access to their vault.
    * **Prerequisites:**  The user must be logged into Vaultwarden and visit a malicious website or click a malicious link.
    * **Impact:**  Account takeover, potentially leading to access to stored credentials.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Anti-CSRF Tokens:**  Include a unique, unpredictable token in each sensitive request.
        * **SameSite Cookie Attribute:**  Restrict when cookies are sent with cross-site requests.

* **4.1.4 Authentication and Authorization Bypass:**
    * **Description:** Exploiting flaws in the authentication or authorization mechanisms to gain access without proper credentials or to elevate privileges. This could involve vulnerabilities in password reset flows, session management, or role-based access control.
    * **Prerequisites:**  Weaknesses in the implementation of authentication and authorization logic.
    * **Impact:**  Direct access to user accounts and their stored credentials.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Strong Password Policies:**  Enforce complex and unique passwords.
        * **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Require an additional verification step beyond the master password.
        * **Secure Session Management:**  Implement secure session handling, including timeouts and invalidation.
