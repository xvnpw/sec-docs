# Attack Surface Analysis for dani-garcia/vaultwarden

## Attack Surface: [Weak Master Password Hashing](./attack_surfaces/weak_master_password_hashing.md)

*   **Description:** The algorithm used to hash user master passwords is weak or improperly implemented.
    *   **How Vaultwarden Contributes:** Vaultwarden's choice and implementation of the hashing algorithm directly determines the resistance against brute-force and dictionary attacks on master passwords.
    *   **Example:** If Vaultwarden uses an outdated or poorly salted hashing algorithm, an attacker who gains access to the database might be able to crack master passwords relatively easily.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of user vaults, exposing all stored credentials and sensitive information.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strong, industry-standard password hashing algorithms like Argon2id with appropriate memory and iteration costs. Regularly review and update the hashing implementation.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Encryption of Vault Data](./attack_surfaces/insecure_encryption_of_vault_data.md)

*   **Description:** The encryption used to protect stored vault data is weak, improperly implemented, or uses insecure key management.
    *   **How Vaultwarden Contributes:** Vaultwarden is responsible for encrypting and decrypting vault data. Vulnerabilities in the encryption scheme or key handling directly expose user data.
    *   **Example:** If Vaultwarden uses a deprecated encryption algorithm or stores encryption keys insecurely, an attacker gaining database access could decrypt the vault data.
    *   **Impact:** Mass exposure of all stored credentials and sensitive information for all users.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Utilize strong, well-vetted encryption libraries (e.g., libsodium). Implement proper key derivation and management practices. Ensure encryption is applied to all sensitive data at rest and in transit. Regularly audit the encryption implementation.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Implementation](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_two-factor_authentication__2fa__implementation.md)

*   **Description:** Flaws in the implementation of supported 2FA methods (TOTP, U2F/WebAuthn) can allow attackers to bypass 2FA.
    *   **How Vaultwarden Contributes:** Vaultwarden's code handles the 2FA enrollment and verification process. Bugs or oversights in this code can create bypass opportunities.
    *   **Example:** An attacker might be able to bypass TOTP verification if Vaultwarden doesn't properly handle time synchronization or if there's a flaw in the token validation logic.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts, even with a strong master password.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement 2FA according to security best practices and relevant standards. Thoroughly test the 2FA implementation for bypass vulnerabilities. Support multiple strong 2FA methods.

## Attack Surface: [API Key Compromise](./attack_surfaces/api_key_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** API keys, used for programmatic access, are compromised due to insecure generation, storage, or transmission.
    *   **How Vaultwarden Contributes:** Vaultwarden generates and manages API keys. Weaknesses in this process can lead to key exposure.
    *   **Example:** If API keys are stored in plain text in configuration files or transmitted over unencrypted channels by Vaultwarden, an attacker gaining access to these resources can steal the keys.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user vaults and data via the API, potentially allowing for automated data exfiltration or manipulation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Generate API keys using cryptographically secure random number generators. Store API keys securely (e.g., hashed and salted). Implement proper access controls and rate limiting for API usage. Provide mechanisms for users to easily revoke and regenerate API keys.
