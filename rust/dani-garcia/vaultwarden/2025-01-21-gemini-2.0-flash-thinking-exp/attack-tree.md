## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access to Stored Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_to_stored_credentials.md)

This node represents the attacker's primary objective when targeting a password manager. Success here means the attacker has obtained the credentials managed by Vaultwarden.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vaultwarden Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vaultwarden_vulnerabilities.md)

This path involves leveraging security flaws within the Vaultwarden application itself to gain unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Vaultwarden](./attack_tree_paths/remote_code_execution__rce__in_vaultwarden.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit known vulnerabilities in Vaultwarden's core logic](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_vaultwarden's_core_logic.md)

This involves exploiting publicly known security flaws in Vaultwarden's code that allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit vulnerabilities in dependencies used by Vaultwarden](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_dependencies_used_by_vaultwarden.md)

This involves exploiting security flaws in third-party libraries or components that Vaultwarden relies on.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Vaultwarden's Authentication/Authorization](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_vaultwarden's_authenticationauthorization.md)

This node focuses on bypassing Vaultwarden's security mechanisms that are designed to verify user identity and grant access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Brute-Force/Credential Stuffing against Vaultwarden](./attack_tree_paths/brute-forcecredential_stuffing_against_vaultwarden.md)

This path involves attackers attempting to guess the master password or using lists of compromised credentials from other breaches to gain access to a Vaultwarden account. The risk is significantly higher if two-factor authentication is not enabled or has weaknesses.

## Attack Tree Path: [Attempt to guess master passwords or use leaked credentials](./attack_tree_paths/attempt_to_guess_master_passwords_or_use_leaked_credentials.md)

Attackers use automated tools to try numerous password combinations or use lists of known username/password pairs obtained from previous data breaches.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Vaultwarden's Data Storage Directly](./attack_tree_paths/access_vaultwarden's_data_storage_directly.md)

This node represents attacks that bypass the Vaultwarden application layer and target the underlying storage mechanisms where the encrypted data is held.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise the Underlying Database Server](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_the_underlying_database_server.md)

This path involves attacking the database server that stores Vaultwarden's data. If successful, the attacker can directly access the encrypted credential data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit vulnerabilities in the database server hosting Vaultwarden data](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_the_database_server_hosting_vaultwarden_data.md)

This involves exploiting known security flaws in the database software (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) or misconfigurations in its setup.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Backups of Vaultwarden Data](./attack_tree_paths/access_backups_of_vaultwarden_data.md)

This path targets backups of Vaultwarden data, which may be less protected than the live system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain access to unencrypted or weakly encrypted backups of Vaultwarden data](./attack_tree_paths/gain_access_to_unencrypted_or_weakly_encrypted_backups_of_vaultwarden_data.md)

Attackers may target network shares, cloud storage, or other locations where backups are stored, especially if these backups are not properly encrypted or have weak encryption.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Vaultwarden API](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_vaultwarden_api.md)

This node focuses on exploiting the Application Programming Interface (API) that Vaultwarden provides for interacting with its services.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Access to API Credentials/Keys](./attack_tree_paths/gain_access_to_api_credentialskeys.md)

This path involves obtaining the credentials (API keys) required to authenticate and authorize requests to the Vaultwarden API.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise the Application Server](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_the_application_server.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Access configuration files or environment variables containing API keys](./attack_tree_paths/access_configuration_files_or_environment_variables_containing_api_keys.md)

Attackers target the application server hosting the application that uses Vaultwarden, seeking configuration files or environment variables where API keys might be stored.
