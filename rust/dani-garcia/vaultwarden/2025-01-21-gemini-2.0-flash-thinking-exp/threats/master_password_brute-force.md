## Deep Analysis of Master Password Brute-Force Threat

**Threat Actor Profile:**

The attacker in this scenario is likely to be:

*   **Automated:** Utilizing scripts or specialized tools designed for password cracking.
*   **Resourceful:** Potentially leveraging botnets or distributed attack infrastructure to bypass simple IP-based rate limiting.
*   **Opportunistic:** Targeting accounts with weak or commonly used master passwords.
*   **Potentially Targeted:** In some cases, the attacker might be specifically targeting a particular user or organization.

**Attack Vector:**

The attack vector is straightforward:

1. The attacker identifies a target Vaultwarden instance.
2. They attempt to log in using a known username (typically an email address).
3. They repeatedly submit login requests with different password attempts for that username.
4. This process is automated and can involve trying thousands or millions of password combinations.

**Vulnerability Analysis (Vaultwarden Specific):**

While Vaultwarden is generally considered secure, potential vulnerabilities or areas of concern related to brute-force attacks include:

*   **Effectiveness of Rate Limiting:**
    *   **Granularity:** Is rate limiting applied per IP address, per user account, or both? IP-based rate limiting can be circumvented using proxies or botnets. User-based rate limiting is more effective but requires accurate identification of the user.
    *   **Thresholds:** What are the thresholds for triggering rate limiting? Are they appropriately configured to block malicious attempts without significantly impacting legitimate users?
    *   **Duration:** How long does the rate limiting last? A short duration might allow attackers to resume their attempts quickly.
    *   **Bypass Potential:** Are there any known methods to bypass the rate limiting mechanism in Vaultwarden?
*   **Implementation of Account Lockout:**
    *   **Lockout Threshold:** How many failed login attempts trigger an account lockout?
    *   **Lockout Duration:** How long does the lockout last? A short duration might be insufficient.
    *   **Lockout Scope:** Is the lockout applied to the user account or the originating IP address? User-based lockout is more effective.
    *   **Reset Mechanism:** How can a locked-out user regain access? Is the reset process secure and not easily exploitable?
    *   **False Positives:** Could legitimate users be locked out due to typos or forgotten passwords?
*   **Password Complexity Enforcement (Indirect Impact):** While not directly preventing brute-force, weak password policies increase the likelihood of a successful attack. Vaultwarden relies on users to choose strong master passwords.
*   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Enforcement:** If 2FA is enabled and enforced, brute-forcing the master password alone is insufficient to gain access. However, the analysis focuses on the scenario *without* successful 2FA bypass.
*   **Timing Attacks:** Could an attacker potentially infer information about the correctness of a password attempt based on the response time from the server? This is less likely with modern frameworks but worth considering.
*   **Server Resource Consumption:**  A sustained brute-force attack can consume significant server resources, potentially leading to denial-of-service for legitimate users.

**Impact Assessment (Detailed):**

A successful master password brute-force attack has critical consequences:

*   **Complete Vault Access:** The attacker gains full access to the user's encrypted vault, including all stored usernames, passwords, notes, and other sensitive information.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** The attacker can export the entire vault data.
*   **Identity Theft:** Stolen credentials can be used for identity theft, financial fraud, and other malicious activities.
*   **Compromise of Linked Accounts:** Access to the vault compromises all the accounts whose credentials are stored within.
*   **Reputational Damage:** If the attack is widespread or publicized, it can damage the reputation of the Vaultwarden instance and the organization hosting it.
*   **Loss of Trust:** Users may lose trust in the security of the platform.

**Evaluation of Existing Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Rate Limiting:**  A crucial first line of defense. Its effectiveness depends heavily on its implementation details (granularity, thresholds, duration). Simple IP-based rate limiting can be easily bypassed. Rate limiting based on user accounts is more effective but requires accurate user identification early in the authentication process.
*   **Account Lockout:**  A strong deterrent against brute-force attacks. However, poorly configured lockout mechanisms (e.g., short lockout durations, easy reset processes) can be less effective. It's important to balance security with usability to avoid locking out legitimate users.

**Recommendations for Enhanced Security:**

Beyond the proposed mitigation strategies, consider implementing the following:

*   **Intelligent Rate Limiting:** Implement adaptive rate limiting that adjusts based on the number of failed attempts and other factors. Consider using techniques like exponential backoff for subsequent failed attempts.
*   **Granular Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting at multiple levels (IP address, user account) for enhanced protection.
*   **CAPTCHA or Proof-of-Work:** Implement CAPTCHA or proof-of-work challenges after a certain number of failed login attempts to deter automated attacks.
*   **Temporary Account Lockout with Increasing Backoff:** Implement account lockout with increasing lockout durations for repeated offenses.
*   **Strong Password Policy Enforcement:** Encourage or enforce strong master password policies (length, complexity, no reuse). While not a direct mitigation, it increases the difficulty of brute-forcing.
*   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Enforcement:** Strongly encourage or enforce 2FA for all users. This significantly reduces the risk of successful brute-force attacks, even if the master password is compromised.
*   **Login Attempt Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement robust logging and alerting for failed login attempts. This allows administrators to detect and respond to potential brute-force attacks in real-time.
*   **Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Regularly conduct security audits and penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the authentication process.
*   **Consider IP Blocking/Blacklisting:** For persistent attackers, consider temporarily or permanently blocking the originating IP addresses.
*   **User Education:** Educate users about the importance of strong master passwords and the risks of brute-force attacks. Encourage them to enable 2FA.
*   **Consider Using a Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can help detect and block malicious login attempts based on patterns and anomalies.

**Conclusion:**

The Master Password Brute-Force threat poses a significant risk to Vaultwarden users. While the proposed mitigation strategies of rate limiting and account lockout are essential, their effectiveness depends heavily on their implementation details. Implementing a layered security approach, incorporating the recommendations outlined above, will significantly enhance Vaultwarden's resilience against this type of attack and provide a more secure experience for users. Continuous monitoring, regular security assessments, and user education are also crucial components of a robust defense strategy.
