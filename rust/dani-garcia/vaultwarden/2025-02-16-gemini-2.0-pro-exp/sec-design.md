# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a lightweight, easy-to-deploy, and self-hostable alternative to the official Bitwarden password manager server.
*   Minimize resource consumption (CPU, RAM) compared to the official implementation.
*   Maintain compatibility with official Bitwarden clients across all platforms (web, desktop, mobile, browser extensions).
*   Offer a simplified setup and maintenance experience for self-hosters.
*   Enable users to securely store and manage their passwords and other sensitive data.
*   Provide a secure and private password management solution, giving users full control over their data.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Data Breach: Unauthorized access to the user's password database, potentially exposing all stored credentials. This is the most critical risk.
*   Data Loss: Loss of the user's password database due to server failure, data corruption, or other unforeseen events.
*   Service Unavailability: Inability for users to access their passwords when needed, potentially disrupting their workflow or locking them out of critical accounts.
*   Compromised Client Compatibility: Breaking changes that render official Bitwarden clients incompatible, forcing users to migrate or lose access.
*   Reputational Damage: Security vulnerabilities or data breaches could severely damage the project's reputation and erode user trust.
*   Legal and Compliance Issues: Failure to comply with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR) could lead to legal penalties.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Uses Rust's memory safety features to prevent common vulnerabilities like buffer overflows and dangling pointers. (Implemented in the source code.)
*   security control: Supports HTTPS to encrypt communication between clients and the server. (Described in the documentation and configuration options.)
*   security control: Offers optional two-factor authentication (2FA) support, compatible with Bitwarden clients. (Described in the documentation and configuration options.)
*   security control: Implements rate limiting to mitigate brute-force attacks. (Implemented in the source code and configurable.)
*   security control: Provides options for data backup and restore. (Described in the documentation.)
*   security control: Uses Argon2id for password hashing, a memory-hard and computationally expensive algorithm. (Implemented in the source code.)
*   security control: Supports database encryption at rest, depending on the database backend used (e.g., SQLite with WAL mode or a separate database server like PostgreSQL). (Described in documentation and depends on configuration.)
*   security control: Web Vault can be disabled. (Described in the documentation and configuration options.)
*   security control: Admin interface can be protected with a strong password. (Described in the documentation and configuration options.)

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Relies on the security of third-party dependencies (Rust libraries, database drivers, etc.). While the project aims to use well-vetted dependencies, vulnerabilities in these components could still pose a risk.
*   accepted risk: The default configuration may not be fully secure for all deployment scenarios. Users are responsible for reviewing and adjusting the configuration to meet their specific security needs.
*   accepted risk: Self-hosting inherently carries risks. Users are responsible for securing their server infrastructure and keeping the software up-to-date.
*   accepted risk: While the project strives for compatibility with Bitwarden clients, subtle differences or bugs could exist that impact security or functionality.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
*   security control: Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to enforce HTTPS connections.
*   security control: Regularly conduct security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Implement a robust logging and monitoring system to detect and respond to suspicious activity.
*   security control: Provide clear and concise security documentation to guide users in securely deploying and configuring Vaultwarden.
*   security control: Implement a vulnerability disclosure program to encourage responsible reporting of security issues.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Support strong password policies (length, complexity).
    *   Enforce 2FA when enabled by the user.
    *   Protect against brute-force attacks with rate limiting and account lockout.
    *   Securely store and manage user authentication tokens.
    *   Provide a secure password reset mechanism.

*   Authorization:
    *   Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for administrative functions.
    *   Ensure users can only access their own data.
    *   Prevent unauthorized access to sensitive configuration settings.

*   Input Validation:
    *   Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (SQL injection, XSS, etc.).
    *   Sanitize data before displaying it in the web interface.
    *   Reject invalid or malicious requests.

*   Cryptography:
    *   Use strong, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms for password hashing (Argon2id), encryption (AES), and key derivation.
    *   Securely manage cryptographic keys.
    *   Protect against known cryptographic attacks (e.g., timing attacks).
    *   Use HTTPS for all communication.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes to Protect:

*   User authentication and authorization.
*   Secure storage and retrieval of user password data.
*   Availability of the service for users to access their passwords.
*   Maintaining compatibility with official Bitwarden clients.

Data to Protect and Sensitivity:

*   User password vaults (encrypted): Highest sensitivity. This is the core data that Vaultwarden is designed to protect. A breach would expose users' credentials for all their accounts.
*   User account information (email address, 2FA settings, etc.): High sensitivity. This data could be used for phishing attacks or to compromise user accounts.
*   API keys and other secrets used for integrations: High sensitivity. These secrets could be used to access external services.
*   Server configuration files: Medium sensitivity. These files could contain sensitive information about the server setup.
*   Logs: Low to medium sensitivity, depending on the content. Logs could contain sensitive information about user activity or system errors.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS
