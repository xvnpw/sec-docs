## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Vaultwarden Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_vaultwarden_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **1. RCE via Attachment Handling** [CRITICAL]
    *   **Description:** An attacker uploads a malicious file that exploits a vulnerability in the server-side processing of attachments (e.g., image resizing, file type validation) to execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low
    *   **Impact:** Very High (Complete server takeover)
    *   **Effort:** High
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Strict file type validation *before* any processing (using magic numbers, not just extensions).
        *   Sandboxed library for file manipulation.
        *   Consider a separate, isolated service for attachment handling.
        *   Regularly audit and update dependencies related to file handling.
        *   Disable attachments if not strictly required.

*   **5. SQLi via Admin Panel (if vulnerable)** [CRITICAL]
    *   **Description:**  If the admin panel has any SQL injection vulnerabilities, an attacker could gain full control of the database.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low
    *   **Impact:** Very High (Full database compromise)
    *   **Effort:** High
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Use parameterized queries or an ORM.
        *   Avoid string concatenation for SQL queries.
        *   Regularly audit database interactions.

*   **7. Bypass 2FA (if vulnerable)** [CRITICAL]
    *   **Description:** Flaws in the 2FA implementation allow an attacker to bypass this security measure.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low
    *   **Impact:** High (Bypassing 2FA significantly reduces security)
    *   **Effort:** High
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Thoroughly test the 2FA implementation, including edge cases.
        *   Ensure 2FA cannot be bypassed by manipulating requests or exploiting race conditions.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Compromise Admin Interface](./attack_tree_paths/2__compromise_admin_interface.md)

*   **A. Brute-Force Admin Password** [HIGH RISK]
    *   **Description:**  A weak or easily guessable admin password is compromised through brute-force or dictionary attacks.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Very High (Full administrative access)
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Enforce strong password policies (length, complexity, disallow common passwords).
        *   Account lockout after failed login attempts.
        *   *Require* Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).

*   **C. Credential Stuffing** [HIGH RISK]
    *   **Description:**  An admin reuses their password, and a breach on another service allows attackers to use those credentials on Vaultwarden.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High (Full administrative access)
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Educate admins about password reuse risks.
        *   Encourage password managers.
        *   Monitor for logins from unusual locations/IPs.
        *   *Require* Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).

*   **D. Phishing Admin** [HIGH RISK]
    *   **Description:**  An attacker sends a phishing email, tricking the admin into entering credentials on a fake login page.
    *   **Likelihood:** High
    *   **Impact:** Very High (Full administrative access)
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Train admins to recognize phishing attacks.
        *   Implement email security measures (SPF, DKIM, DMARC).
        *   *Require* Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Configuration Errors](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_configuration_errors.md)

*   **ii. Exposed Admin Token** [CRITICAL]
    *   **Description:**  The admin token is accidentally exposed (e.g., in logs, a public Git repo, environment variables).
    *   **Likelihood:** Low
    *   **Impact:** Very High (Immediate, full administrative access)
    *   **Effort:** Very Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Protect the admin token as a *highly sensitive secret*.
        *   Store it securely (e.g., in a secrets management system).
        *   Rotate the token regularly.
        *   *Never* commit the token to version control.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Abuse Vaultwarden Features](./attack_tree_paths/4__abuse_vaultwarden_features.md)

*    **3. DoS via Resource Exhaustion** [HIGH RISK]
    *   **Description:** An attacker sends many requests, large attachments, or crafted requests to consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory, disk, database connections), causing a denial-of-service.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium (Disrupts service availability)
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Implement rate limiting on API endpoints and user actions.
        *   Set reasonable limits on attachment sizes.
        *   Monitor server resource usage and set up alerts.
        *   Use a robust database connection pool.
        *   Consider a Web Application Firewall (WAF) for DDoS mitigation.
