# Deep Analysis: Compromised Master Password in Vaultwarden

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the "Compromised Master Password" attack surface in a Vaultwarden deployment, identify specific vulnerabilities and weaknesses, and propose concrete, actionable recommendations to minimize the risk and impact of this critical threat.  We aim to go beyond the initial attack surface analysis and provide detailed technical guidance.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the scenario where an attacker successfully obtains a user's Vaultwarden master password.  It encompasses:

*   **Attack Vectors:**  How an attacker might realistically obtain the master password.
*   **Vaultwarden-Specific Considerations:**  How Vaultwarden's design and configuration influence this attack surface.
*   **Technical Mitigations:**  Detailed configuration recommendations and best practices for Vaultwarden and related systems.
*   **User-Centric Mitigations:**  Strategies to reduce the likelihood of users falling victim to attacks that target the master password.
*   **Detection and Response:** How to detect potential master password compromise attempts and respond effectively.

This analysis *does not* cover other attack surfaces, such as vulnerabilities in the Vaultwarden software itself (e.g., code injection, server-side vulnerabilities).  It assumes the Vaultwarden software is up-to-date and properly configured from a basic security perspective (e.g., HTTPS is enforced, database is secured).

## 3. Methodology

This analysis employs a multi-faceted approach:

*   **Threat Modeling:**  We will systematically identify potential attack vectors, considering both common and Vaultwarden-specific scenarios.
*   **Configuration Review:**  We will analyze recommended Vaultwarden configuration settings related to password security and brute-force protection.
*   **Best Practices Research:**  We will leverage industry best practices for password management, 2FA, and user security awareness.
*   **Technical Analysis:** We will delve into the technical details of KDF (Key Derivation Function) settings and their impact on brute-force resistance.
*   **Vulnerability Assessment (Conceptual):** While not a live penetration test, we will conceptually assess the vulnerability of a default and a well-configured Vaultwarden instance to various attack vectors.

## 4. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

### 4.1. Attack Vectors

An attacker can obtain a user's master password through various means:

*   **Phishing:**
    *   **Classic Phishing:**  Emails or messages directing users to a fake Vaultwarden login page.
    *   **Spear Phishing:**  Highly targeted phishing attacks, potentially leveraging information about the user or their organization.
    *   **Evilginx2/Modlishka:**  Sophisticated phishing attacks that can bypass even 2FA by acting as a reverse proxy and capturing session cookies.
*   **Credential Stuffing:**  Using credentials leaked from other breaches to attempt login to Vaultwarden.  This is highly effective if users reuse passwords.
*   **Keylogging:**  Malware installed on the user's device that records keystrokes, including the master password.
*   **Shoulder Surfing:**  Physically observing a user typing their master password.
*   **Social Engineering:**  Tricking the user into revealing their master password through manipulation or deception.
*   **Brute-Force/Dictionary Attacks:**  Automated attempts to guess the master password.  This is less likely to succeed against strong passwords but remains a threat.
*   **Database Compromise (Indirect):** If the Vaultwarden database is compromised (through a separate vulnerability), the attacker *might* be able to recover master passwords if the KDF is weak.  This is a separate attack surface, but it highlights the importance of a strong KDF.
* **Client-side attacks:** Browser extensions, compromised browsers, or other client-side software could potentially intercept the master password.

### 4.2. Vaultwarden-Specific Considerations

*   **Centralized Risk:** Vaultwarden, by design, concentrates all credentials behind a single point of failure â€“ the master password.  This makes it an extremely attractive target.
*   **KDF (Argon2id):** Vaultwarden uses Argon2id for password hashing, which is a strong choice.  However, the *configuration* of Argon2id is crucial.  Weak parameters significantly reduce its effectiveness.
*   **2FA Support:** Vaultwarden supports various 2FA methods, but their effectiveness depends on user adoption and the specific method used.
*   **Lack of Hardware Security Module (HSM) Support (by default):**  While possible to integrate with external tools, Vaultwarden doesn't natively support HSMs for storing the master key, which would provide an additional layer of protection.
*   **Open Source:** While beneficial for transparency and community auditing, it also means attackers have access to the source code to analyze potential weaknesses.

### 4.3. Technical Mitigations (Detailed)

*   **KDF Configuration (Crucial):**
    *   **`PASSWORD_ITERATIONS`:**  Set this to the *highest* value your server can handle without causing unacceptable login delays.  Aim for at least 100,000, and ideally much higher (e.g., 310,000 or more).  Monitor server performance after changes.
    *   **`PASSWORD_MEMORY`:**  Increase memory usage to make brute-forcing more resource-intensive.  A good starting point is 65536 (64MB), but consider increasing it to 128MB or 256MB if your server resources allow.
    *   **`PASSWORD_PARALLELISM`:**  Set this to the number of CPU cores available on your server.  This allows Argon2id to utilize multiple cores for faster hashing (but also increases resource consumption).
    *   **Regularly Re-evaluate KDF Settings:**  As hardware improves, attackers' capabilities increase.  Periodically review and increase your KDF parameters to maintain strong protection.
    *   **Example (docker-compose.yml):**
        ```yaml
        environment:
          - PASSWORD_ITERATIONS=310000
          - PASSWORD_MEMORY=131072 # 128MB
          - PASSWORD_PARALLELISM=4 # Adjust to your server's core count
        ```

*   **Two-Factor Authentication (Mandatory):**
    *   **Enforce 2FA:**  Use Vaultwarden's administrative settings to *require* 2FA for all users.  Do not allow users to disable it.
    *   **Prioritize Strong 2FA Methods:**
        *   **Hardware Security Keys (FIDO2/WebAuthn):**  The most secure option, resistant to phishing.  Strongly encourage or even mandate their use.
        *   **TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Password):**  A good alternative (e.g., Google Authenticator, Authy).
        *   **Avoid SMS-Based 2FA:**  SMS is vulnerable to interception and SIM swapping attacks.  If used, treat it as a last resort.
    *   **Educate Users on 2FA Setup and Security:**  Provide clear instructions and emphasize the importance of protecting their 2FA recovery codes.

*   **Brute-Force Protection:**
    *   **`SIGNUPS_ALLOWED=false`:** Disable new user signups unless absolutely necessary.  This prevents attackers from creating accounts to test passwords.
    *   **`LOGIN_RATELIMIT`:**  Implement strict rate limiting to slow down brute-force attempts.  Example: `LOGIN_RATELIMIT=10/minute`.
    *   **Account Lockout:**  Configure account lockout after a small number of failed login attempts (e.g., 5 attempts).  Implement a reasonable lockout duration (e.g., 30 minutes, increasing with subsequent failed attempts).
    *   **CAPTCHA:** Consider enabling a CAPTCHA after a few failed login attempts to further deter automated attacks.
    *   **IP Address Blocking:**  Monitor logs for suspicious activity (repeated failed logins from the same IP) and implement temporary or permanent IP address blocks.  Use a tool like Fail2Ban to automate this.

*   **Network Security:**
    *   **Firewall:**  Restrict access to the Vaultwarden server to only necessary ports (e.g., 443 for HTTPS).
    *   **Reverse Proxy:**  Use a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, Apache) in front of Vaultwarden to handle TLS termination, rate limiting, and other security tasks.
    *   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (IDS/IPS):**  Deploy an IDS/IPS to monitor network traffic for malicious activity.

*   **Monitoring and Alerting:**
    *   **Log Analysis:**  Regularly review Vaultwarden logs (and reverse proxy logs) for failed login attempts, suspicious IP addresses, and other anomalies.
    *   **Alerting:**  Configure alerts for critical events, such as multiple failed login attempts from the same IP or user, or successful logins from unusual locations.
    *   **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**  Consider using a SIEM system to centralize and analyze logs from multiple sources.

### 4.4. User-Centric Mitigations

*   **Security Awareness Training:**
    *   **Phishing Recognition:**  Train users to identify phishing emails and websites, specifically those targeting Vaultwarden.  Conduct simulated phishing campaigns to test their awareness.
    *   **Strong Password Practices:**  Educate users on creating strong, unique passwords.  Explain the risks of password reuse.
    *   **Master Password Importance:**  Emphasize the critical importance of the master password and the consequences of its compromise.
    *   **2FA Importance and Usage:**  Explain how 2FA works and why it's essential.  Provide clear instructions on setting up and using 2FA.
    *   **Safe Browsing Habits:**  Advise users to avoid accessing Vaultwarden from public computers or untrusted networks.
    *   **Reporting Suspicious Activity:**  Encourage users to report any suspicious emails, login attempts, or other security concerns.

*   **Password Manager Best Practices:**
    *   **Regular Password Audits:**  Encourage users to regularly review their stored passwords and update any weak or reused credentials.
    *   **Use of Password Generator:**  Promote the use of Vaultwarden's built-in password generator to create strong, random passwords.
    *   **Secure Storage of Recovery Codes:**  Instruct users to store their 2FA recovery codes securely (offline, encrypted).

### 4.5. Detection and Response

*   **Failed Login Attempt Monitoring:**  As mentioned above, actively monitor logs for failed login attempts.
*   **Unusual Login Activity:**  Monitor for logins from unexpected locations or devices.  Vaultwarden may provide some built-in features for this, or you can use external monitoring tools.
*   **User Reporting:**  Establish a clear process for users to report suspected security incidents.
*   **Incident Response Plan:**  Develop a formal incident response plan that outlines the steps to take in case of a suspected master password compromise.  This should include:
    *   **Account Lockout/Password Reset:**  Immediately lock the affected account and force a password reset.
    *   **2FA Reset:**  Reset the user's 2FA method.
    *   **Investigation:**  Investigate the incident to determine the cause and extent of the compromise.
    *   **Notification:**  Notify affected users and relevant authorities, if necessary.
    *   **Remediation:**  Take steps to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.
