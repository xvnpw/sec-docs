    *   **Web Server (Rocket):** A fast and reliable asynchronous web framework in Rust that handles incoming HTTP requests and routes them appropriately.
        *   **Request Routing:** Directs incoming requests based on their path and method to the corresponding API endpoint handlers.
        *   **Middleware:** Intercepts requests to handle cross-cutting concerns:
            *   **Authentication:** Verifies user credentials and manages session tokens.
            *   **Rate Limiting:** Protects against brute-force attacks by limiting the number of requests from a single IP address.
            *   **Logging:** Records important events for auditing and debugging purposes.
            *   **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):**  Manages which domains are allowed to make requests to the API.
    *   **API Endpoints:** Define the interface through which client applications interact with the server, providing specific functionalities via HTTP requests.
        *   **Authentication API (Login, Register, Token Management):** Handles user registration, login procedures, password reset requests, and the generation and management of authentication tokens (e.g., JWTs).
        *   **Vault API (CRUD Operations on Vault Items):** Provides endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting password entries, notes, and other secure items within a user's vault.
        *   **Sync API (Data Synchronization with Clients):** Manages the synchronization of vault data between the server and client applications, ensuring data consistency across devices. This includes handling conflicts and updates.
        *   **Organization API (Management of Organizations and Users):**  Allows for the creation and management of organizations, inviting and managing users within organizations, and sharing vault items securely among organization members.
        *   **Admin API (Server Configuration, User Management):** Provides administrative functionalities for managing the server itself, including configuring settings, managing users (creating, deleting, modifying), and potentially viewing server statistics. Access to this API is typically restricted to administrative users.
    *   **Database Interface:** Provides an abstraction layer for interacting with the underlying database system, isolating the application logic from specific database implementations.
        *   **Database Query Builder (ORM-like abstraction):** Simplifies database interactions by providing a higher-level interface for constructing and executing queries, reducing the need to write raw SQL.
        *   **Database Connection Pool (Efficient Connection Management):** Manages a pool of database connections, improving performance by reusing connections and reducing the overhead of establishing new connections for each request.
    *   **Background Workers:**  Handles asynchronous and deferred tasks that do not need to be executed immediately within the request-response cycle.
        *   **Email Service (Sending Notifications, Invitations):** Responsible for sending emails for various purposes, such as password reset requests, new user invitations to organizations, and other notifications.
        *   **Job Queue System (Processing Delayed Tasks):** Manages a queue of tasks that need to be executed asynchronously, such as sending bulk emails or performing periodic maintenance tasks.

*   **Data Storage:** The persistent storage mechanism for all application data.
    *   **Database (SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL):** Supports various relational database systems for storing:
        *   **Encrypted Vault Data:**  User's password entries, notes, and other secure information, encrypted using the user's master password.
        *   **User Credentials:** Hashed and salted master passwords, along with other user-related information.
        *   **Settings:** Server-wide and user-specific configuration settings.

*   **External Services (Optional):** Services that Vaultwarden may optionally interact with to extend its functionality.
    *   **SMTP Server (For Sending Emails):** An external Simple Mail Transfer Protocol server used by the Email Service to relay outgoing emails.

## 5. Data Flow

This section provides more detailed examples of data flow for critical operations within the Vaultwarden system.

### 5.1. User Registration

1. The user initiates the registration process through a client application.
2. The client application sends a registration request containing the user's email and chosen master password to the **Authentication API** endpoint.
3. The **Web Server** routes the request, and **Middleware** may perform checks like rate limiting.
4. The **Authentication API** receives the request.
5. A strong salt is generated.
6. The user's master password is cryptographically hashed using a robust key derivation function (e.g., PBKDF2) along with the generated salt.
7. The hashed master password and salt are stored securely in the database via the **Database Interface**.
8. An authentication token might be generated and returned to the client, or the user might be prompted to log in.

### 5.2. Synchronizing Vault Data

1. A client application initiates a synchronization request with the **Sync API** endpoint, including the user's authentication token.
2. The **Web Server** routes the request, and **Middleware** verifies the token.
3. The **Sync API** retrieves the latest encrypted vault data for the user from the database via the **Database Interface**.
4. The server may also retrieve metadata about changes to determine what needs to be synchronized.
5. The encrypted data is sent back to the client application.
6. The client application decrypts the data locally.
7. If the client has local changes, it encrypts them and sends them back to the **Sync API**.
8. The **Sync API** processes these changes, potentially resolving conflicts, and updates the database.

### 5.3. Sharing a Vault Item within an Organization

1. A user within an organization initiates the sharing process in a client application.
2. The client application sends a request to the **Organization API** endpoint, including details of the item to be shared and the target user(s) or group(s).
3. The **Web Server** routes the request, and **Middleware** verifies the user's authentication and authorization to perform this action.
4. The **Organization API** creates a shared item record in the database, linking the original item with the target user(s) or group(s), potentially with specific permissions.
5. Notifications might be sent to the recipients via the **Email Service** (if configured).
6. When the recipient synchronizes their data, the shared item will be included in the data retrieved from the **Sync API**.

## 6. Security Considerations
