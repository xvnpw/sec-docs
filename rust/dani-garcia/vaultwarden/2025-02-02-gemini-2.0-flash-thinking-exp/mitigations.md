## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep Vaultwarden Updated](./mitigation_strategies/keep_vaultwarden_updated.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Keep Vaultwarden Updated
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor for Vaultwarden Updates:** Regularly check the official Vaultwarden GitHub repository ([https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden)) and release notes for new version announcements. Subscribe to GitHub release notifications or monitor community forums.
    2.  **Review Vaultwarden Release Notes:** Carefully read the release notes for each new Vaultwarden version to understand the changes, especially security fixes, bug patches, and new features.
    3.  **Test in Staging Environment:** Before updating the production Vaultwarden instance, deploy the new version to a staging or testing environment that mirrors the production setup. Test core functionalities, user access, and integrations to ensure compatibility and stability with the new version.
    4.  **Apply Update to Production Vaultwarden:** Once testing is successful in staging, apply the update to the production Vaultwarden instance. Follow the official Vaultwarden update documentation for the recommended update method (e.g., Docker image update, binary replacement).
    5.  **Verify Production Update:** After updating the production instance, verify the Vaultwarden version through the admin panel or command-line interface to confirm the update was successful. Monitor Vaultwarden logs for any errors or unexpected behavior immediately after the update.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vaultwarden Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Outdated Vaultwarden versions are susceptible to publicly known vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit to gain unauthorized access to the password vault, leading to data breaches or service disruption.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vaultwarden Vulnerabilities:** High risk reduction. Regularly updating Vaultwarden directly patches known vulnerabilities, significantly reducing the risk of exploitation.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, a process is in place to check for updates monthly and apply them to the staging environment first before production.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Automated update notifications from the Vaultwarden repository and a more formalized staging environment testing procedure could be implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure the Admin Panel](./mitigation_strategies/secure_the_admin_panel.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure the Admin Panel
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Change Default Admin Token in Vaultwarden:** Immediately after initial Vaultwarden setup, change the default admin token. Generate a strong, unique, and long token using a cryptographically secure random number generator. Configure this new token in Vaultwarden's `ADMIN_TOKEN` setting (via `config.toml` or environment variable).
    2.  **Securely Store Vaultwarden Admin Token:** Store the generated admin token securely, preferably in a dedicated password manager or secrets management system, separate from the Vaultwarden instance itself. Limit access to the admin token to only authorized Vaultwarden administrators.
    3.  **Restrict Network Access to Vaultwarden Admin Panel (using Web Server or Vaultwarden Config):** Configure network access restrictions to the `/admin` panel endpoint. This can be achieved through:
        *   **Web Server Configuration (Recommended):** Use web server directives (e.g., Nginx `allow`/`deny` directives, Apache `.htaccess`) to restrict access to the `/admin` path to specific trusted IP addresses or networks. This is generally more robust than relying solely on Vaultwarden's internal mechanisms.
        *   **Vaultwarden Configuration (Less Secure):** While less robust, Vaultwarden's `ADMIN_PANEL_ALLOWED_IPS` setting can be used to restrict access based on IP addresses. However, web server level restrictions are generally preferred for stronger security.
    4.  **Disable Vaultwarden Admin Panel in Production (If Possible):** If the admin panel is infrequently used in production and administrative tasks can be performed via command-line tools, configuration files, or API, consider disabling the admin panel entirely by setting `ADMIN_PANEL=false` in Vaultwarden's configuration.
    5.  **Regularly Audit Admin Access:** Periodically review who has access to the Vaultwarden admin token and the IP whitelist (if implemented). Revoke access for personnel who no longer require administrative privileges.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Vaultwarden Admin Panel (High Severity):** If the admin panel is easily accessible and the admin token is weak or compromised, attackers can gain full administrative control over the Vaultwarden instance. This allows them to access all stored passwords, modify settings, create backdoors, and potentially compromise the entire password vault.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks on Vaultwarden Admin Panel (Medium Severity):** Without proper access controls, attackers can attempt brute-force attacks to guess the admin token, especially if it's not sufficiently strong.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Vaultwarden Admin Panel:** High risk reduction. Restricting access to the admin panel and securing the admin token significantly reduces the attack surface and prevents unauthorized administrative actions.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks on Vaultwarden Admin Panel:** Medium risk reduction. IP whitelisting and strong admin tokens make brute-force attacks substantially more difficult and less likely to succeed.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, the default admin token has been changed, and access is restricted to the internal network via firewall.
*   **Missing Implementation:** IP whitelisting at the web server level for the `/admin` path is not yet implemented. Disabling the admin panel in production is being evaluated.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Unnecessary Vaultwarden Features](./mitigation_strategies/disable_unnecessary_vaultwarden_features.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Disable Unnecessary Vaultwarden Features
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Vaultwarden Configuration Options:** Thoroughly review all available configuration options in Vaultwarden's `config.toml` file or environment variables, paying attention to features that can be enabled or disabled. Consult the official Vaultwarden documentation for a comprehensive list of options.
    2.  **Identify Unused Vaultwarden Features:** Identify Vaultwarden features that are not essential or required for the intended use case and organizational needs. Examples include:
        *   User registration (`SIGNUPS_ALLOWED`): If user accounts are managed through an external system or pre-provisioned, disabling user registration reduces the risk of unauthorized account creation.
        *   Server Admin functionalities accessible via the web interface (certain admin panel features): If server administration is primarily done via command-line or API, disabling web-based admin functionalities can reduce the attack surface.
        *   Specific authentication methods (if not utilized): If certain authentication methods are not used, disabling them can simplify the configuration and potentially reduce attack vectors.
    3.  **Disable Identified Vaultwarden Features:** Disable the identified unnecessary features by setting the corresponding configuration options to `false`, `null`, or their disabled state in Vaultwarden's `config.toml` or environment variables.
    4.  **Test Core Vaultwarden Functionality:** After disabling features, thoroughly test the remaining core functionalities of Vaultwarden to ensure that essential operations (password storage, retrieval, sharing, etc.) are still working as expected and that disabling features has not introduced any unintended side effects or broken critical workflows.
    5.  **Document Disabled Vaultwarden Features:** Document which Vaultwarden features have been disabled and the rationale behind disabling them. This documentation is crucial for future maintenance, troubleshooting, and security audits.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Increased Vaultwarden Attack Surface (Medium Severity):** Unnecessary features, even if not actively used, can introduce additional attack vectors and potential vulnerabilities within the Vaultwarden application. Disabling them reduces the overall attack surface and potential points of compromise.
    *   **Complexity and Vaultwarden Maintenance Overhead (Low Severity):** Unnecessary features can add complexity to the Vaultwarden system and potentially increase maintenance overhead. Disabling them simplifies the system and can improve manageability.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Increased Vaultwarden Attack Surface:** Medium risk reduction. Reducing the attack surface by disabling unused features limits potential entry points for attackers targeting Vaultwarden.
    *   **Complexity and Vaultwarden Maintenance Overhead:** Low risk reduction in terms of direct security threats, but improves overall system manageability and potentially reduces the likelihood of misconfigurations.
*   **Currently Implemented:** User registration (`SIGNUPS_ALLOWED`) is disabled.
*   **Missing Implementation:** A comprehensive review of all Vaultwarden configuration options to identify and disable other potentially unnecessary features (like server admin functionalities via web interface if not actively used) is pending.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Vaultwarden Rate Limiting](./mitigation_strategies/implement_vaultwarden_rate_limiting.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Vaultwarden Rate Limiting
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Vaultwarden Endpoints:** Determine the sensitive endpoints within Vaultwarden that are susceptible to brute-force attacks or abuse. These typically include:
        *   Login endpoints (`/identity/connect/token`, `/api/accounts/login`) for user authentication.
        *   Admin panel login endpoint (`/admin`).
        *   Password reset endpoints (if enabled).
        *   Potentially other API endpoints that could be abused for resource exhaustion or denial-of-service.
    2.  **Configure Vaultwarden Rate Limiting Rules:** Configure rate limiting rules specifically for these identified sensitive endpoints within Vaultwarden's configuration. Vaultwarden's `config.toml` file or environment variables provide settings for rate limiting. Define parameters such as:
        *   `LOGIN_RATELIMIT_ATTEMPTS`: Maximum number of login attempts allowed within a specified time window.
        *   `LOGIN_RATELIMIT_TIME`: Time window in seconds for login attempts rate limiting.
        *   Similar settings for other sensitive endpoints if configurable within Vaultwarden.
    3.  **Test Vaultwarden Rate Limiting:** Thoroughly test the configured rate limiting by simulating multiple failed login attempts from the same IP address or user account to ensure the rate limiting mechanism is working as expected. Verify that it blocks further attempts after the defined limit is reached and that legitimate users are not inadvertently blocked.
    4.  **Adjust Vaultwarden Rate Limits (If Necessary):** Monitor the effectiveness of the rate limiting in preventing brute-force attacks and analyze logs for rate limiting events. Adjust the rate limits if needed to strike a balance between security and usability. Avoid overly aggressive rate limiting that might negatively impact legitimate users or automated processes.
    5.  **Log Vaultwarden Rate Limiting Events:** Ensure that rate limiting events (e.g., blocked requests, IP addresses being rate-limited) are logged by Vaultwarden. These logs are essential for security monitoring, incident response, and analyzing attack patterns.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vaultwarden Brute-Force Attacks (High Severity):** Rate limiting effectively mitigates brute-force attacks against user accounts and the admin panel by limiting the number of login attempts an attacker can make within a given timeframe. This makes brute-force attacks significantly more difficult and time-consuming.
    *   **Vaultwarden Credential Stuffing Attacks (Medium Severity):** Rate limiting can also help mitigate credential stuffing attacks, where attackers use lists of compromised credentials from other breaches to attempt logins to Vaultwarden accounts. By limiting login attempts, rate limiting slows down credential stuffing efforts.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vaultwarden Brute-Force Attacks:** High risk reduction. Rate limiting makes brute-force attacks significantly more difficult and often impractical, protecting user accounts and the admin panel.
    *   **Vaultwarden Credential Stuffing Attacks:** Medium risk reduction. Rate limiting slows down credential stuffing attempts, providing more time for detection and response, and reducing the likelihood of successful account compromise.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic rate limiting is enabled using default Vaultwarden configuration for login attempts.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Review and potentially strengthen the existing rate limiting configuration. Consider implementing rate limiting for other sensitive Vaultwarden endpoints beyond just login attempts, such as password reset or API access points if applicable and vulnerable to abuse.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Strong Vaultwarden Master Passwords (User Guidance)](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_strong_vaultwarden_master_passwords__user_guidance_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce Strong Vaultwarden Master Passwords (User Guidance)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Vaultwarden Master Password Complexity Requirements:** Establish clear and specific guidelines for strong master password complexity for Vaultwarden users. These guidelines should be communicated to all users and should include recommendations for:
        *   Minimum master password length (e.g., 16 characters or more, ideally 20+).
        *   Use of a mix of character types: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols.
        *   Avoidance of easily guessable information: dictionary words, common phrases, personal information (names, birthdays, etc.), sequential characters, repeated characters.
        *   Uniqueness: Master passwords should be unique and not reused across other online accounts.
    2.  **User Education on Vaultwarden Master Passwords:** Provide comprehensive user education and training on the importance of strong master passwords for Vaultwarden. Emphasize that the master password is the single key to their entire password vault and that its strength is paramount to the security of their stored credentials. Use various communication channels (e.g., onboarding materials, security awareness training, internal knowledge base) to reinforce this message.
    3.  **Password Strength Feedback (Encourage Use of External Tools):** While Vaultwarden itself does not enforce master password complexity, encourage users to utilize password strength meters (available in browsers, online tools, or password manager extensions) when creating their master passwords. These tools provide visual feedback on password strength and help users create more robust passwords.
    4.  **Regular Vaultwarden Master Password Audits (User Responsibility):** Encourage users to periodically review and update their master passwords, especially if they suspect any compromise, if their password has been reused elsewhere, or if it has been a long time since the last password change. Promote the practice of regularly updating master passwords as a proactive security measure.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vaultwarden Password Guessing/Brute-Force Attacks (High Severity):** Weak master passwords are highly vulnerable to password guessing and brute-force attacks. Attackers can try common passwords, dictionary words, or use password cracking tools to compromise weak master passwords and gain access to the Vaultwarden vault.
    *   **Vaultwarden Dictionary Attacks (High Severity):** Weak master passwords that are dictionary words or common phrases are easily cracked using dictionary attacks, where attackers use lists of dictionary words and common phrases to attempt to guess passwords.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vaultwarden Password Guessing/Brute-Force Attacks:** High risk reduction. Strong master passwords, adhering to complexity guidelines, significantly increase the time and computational resources required for successful brute-force attacks, making them practically infeasible for most attackers.
    *   **Vaultwarden Dictionary Attacks:** High risk reduction. Strong, complex master passwords that are not dictionary words or common phrases are not susceptible to dictionary attacks.
*   **Currently Implemented:** User education is provided during onboarding, emphasizing the importance of strong master passwords and providing guidelines.
*   **Missing Implementation:** There is no technical enforcement of password complexity within Vaultwarden itself. Relying solely on user education is less effective than technical controls. Exploring browser extensions or external tools that could provide password strength checks during master password creation (though outside direct Vaultwarden implementation) could be considered to enhance user guidance.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable Vaultwarden Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)](./mitigation_strategies/enable_vaultwarden_two-factor_authentication__2fa_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enable Vaultwarden Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Vaultwarden 2FA Options in Configuration:** Ensure that 2FA options are enabled in the Vaultwarden server configuration (`config.toml` or environment variables). Vaultwarden supports various 2FA methods, including TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password), WebAuthn, and Duo. Verify that the desired 2FA methods are enabled in the Vaultwarden configuration.
    2.  **Mandate or Strongly Encourage Vaultwarden 2FA:** Decide whether to mandate 2FA for all Vaultwarden users or strongly encourage its adoption. Mandating 2FA provides a significantly higher level of security for all user accounts. Communicate the 2FA policy clearly to all users.
    3.  **User Onboarding and Guidance for Vaultwarden 2FA:** Provide clear, step-by-step instructions and user-friendly guides for users on how to enable and set up 2FA for their Vaultwarden accounts. This includes detailed steps for generating TOTP secrets using authenticator apps (e.g., Google Authenticator, Authy), registering WebAuthn devices (e.g., security keys, biometric authentication), or configuring Duo if used. Offer support and assistance to users during the 2FA setup process.
    4.  **Support Multiple Vaultwarden 2FA Methods:** Offer multiple 2FA methods (e.g., TOTP and WebAuthn) to provide flexibility and cater to different user preferences, device availability, and security requirements. Providing choices increases user adoption and accommodates diverse user environments.
    5.  **Vaultwarden Account Recovery Options (Careful Consideration):** Plan for secure account recovery procedures in case users lose access to their 2FA devices or recovery codes. Recovery methods should be secure and well-documented, but also carefully designed to avoid introducing new vulnerabilities or weakening the security of 2FA. Review Vaultwarden's built-in recovery mechanisms (if any) and implement secure and documented recovery processes. Consider backup codes or administrator-assisted recovery options with strong identity verification.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vaultwarden Account Takeover due to Master Password Compromise (High Severity):** If a user's master password is compromised (e.g., through phishing, data breach on another service, malware), 2FA prevents attackers from gaining unauthorized access to the Vaultwarden account without also possessing the second factor of authentication.
    *   **Vaultwarden Phishing Attacks (Medium Severity):** 2FA adds an extra layer of protection against phishing attacks targeting Vaultwarden accounts. Even if a user is tricked into entering their master password on a fake login page, the attacker still needs the second factor (TOTP code, WebAuthn device) to successfully access the account.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vaultwarden Account Takeover due to Master Password Compromise:** High risk reduction. 2FA significantly reduces the risk of account takeover even if the master password is compromised, providing a critical second layer of security.
    *   **Vaultwarden Phishing Attacks:** Medium risk reduction. 2FA makes phishing attacks less effective, as attackers need to bypass both the master password and the second factor. However, users still need to be vigilant against sophisticated phishing attempts that might try to circumvent 2FA.
*   **Currently Implemented:** 2FA (TOTP) is enabled and strongly encouraged for all users.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Mandating 2FA for all users is under consideration. WebAuthn support is enabled but not actively promoted to users. Documented and tested account recovery processes for 2FA are needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Vaultwarden Database Backups](./mitigation_strategies/regular_vaultwarden_database_backups.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regular Vaultwarden Database Backups
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Determine Vaultwarden Backup Frequency:** Determine an appropriate backup frequency for the Vaultwarden database based on the rate of data changes within the password vault and the organization's Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO). Daily backups are generally recommended as a minimum, but more frequent backups (e.g., hourly or even more frequent for very active vaults) might be necessary for critical data and stringent RPO requirements.
    2.  **Automate Vaultwarden Database Backups:** Automate the Vaultwarden database backup process to ensure backups are performed consistently and reliably without manual intervention. Use scripting (e.g., shell scripts, cron jobs) or built-in backup tools provided by the underlying database system (e.g., `mysqldump` for MySQL, `pg_dump` for PostgreSQL, file system copy for SQLite). Schedule backups to run automatically at the chosen frequency.
    3.  **Secure Vaultwarden Backup Location:** Store Vaultwarden database backups in a secure location that is physically separate from the Vaultwarden server itself. This separation is crucial to prevent data loss in case of server hardware failure, compromise of the Vaultwarden server, or localized disasters. Consider using:
        *   Network Attached Storage (NAS) in a different physical location or data center.
        *   Cloud storage services (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage) with robust access controls, encryption at rest, and geographic redundancy.
        *   Dedicated backup servers in a separate infrastructure.
    4.  **Implement Vaultwarden Backup Rotation and Retention Policy:** Implement a well-defined backup rotation and retention policy to manage backup storage space efficiently and comply with data retention requirements. Define how long backups should be kept (e.g., daily backups for a week, weekly backups for a month, monthly backups for a year) and how older backups are rotated out or archived.
    5.  **Test Vaultwarden Database Restores Regularly:** Regularly test the Vaultwarden database backup and restore process to ensure that backups are valid, consistent, and that data can be restored successfully within the required RTO in a disaster recovery scenario. Document the complete restore procedure, including steps for database recovery, Vaultwarden configuration restoration (if needed), and verification of data integrity after restoration. Schedule periodic restore drills to validate the backup strategy and restore procedures.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vaultwarden Data Loss due to Hardware Failure (High Severity):** Hardware failures affecting the Vaultwarden server or database storage (e.g., disk crashes, server malfunctions) can lead to permanent data loss if backups are not in place.
    *   **Vaultwarden Data Loss due to Software Corruption (Medium Severity):** Software bugs, database corruption, or accidental data corruption can damage the Vaultwarden database, resulting in data loss or data integrity issues.
    *   **Vaultwarden Data Loss due to Accidental Deletion or Errors (Medium Severity):** Accidental deletion of Vaultwarden data by administrators or users, or errors in database operations, can lead to data loss.
    *   **Vaultwarden Data Loss due to Ransomware or Cyberattacks (High Severity):** In the event of a ransomware attack or other cyberattack that compromises the Vaultwarden server and data, backups are essential for recovering the password vault to a clean state and restoring service after a security incident.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vaultwarden Data Loss due to Hardware Failure:** High risk reduction. Regular backups are the primary defense against data loss resulting from hardware failures, ensuring business continuity and data recoverability.
    *   **Vaultwarden Data Loss due to Software Corruption:** Medium risk reduction. Backups allow restoring the Vaultwarden database to a previous consistent state before software corruption occurred, minimizing data loss and service disruption.
    *   **Vaultwarden Data Loss due to Accidental Deletion or Errors:** Medium risk reduction. Backups provide a mechanism to revert to a state before accidental data deletion or errors, enabling data recovery and preventing permanent data loss.
    *   **Vaultwarden Data Loss due to Ransomware or Cyberattacks:** High risk reduction. Backups are crucial for recovering from ransomware attacks and restoring Vaultwarden service after a compromise, minimizing downtime and data loss.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Daily database backups are automated and stored on a separate NAS device.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Backup encryption for Vaultwarden database backups is not yet implemented. A formal backup rotation and retention policy needs to be defined and implemented. Regular restore testing needs to be scheduled, documented, and performed to validate the backup strategy and restore procedures.
