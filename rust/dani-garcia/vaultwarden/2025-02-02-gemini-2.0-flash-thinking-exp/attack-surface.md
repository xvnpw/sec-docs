# Attack Surface Analysis for dani-garcia/vaultwarden

## Attack Surface: [Brute-force attacks on login](./attack_surfaces/brute-force_attacks_on_login.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers attempt to guess user credentials by repeatedly trying different usernames and passwords against the Vaultwarden login form.
    *   **Vaultwarden Contribution:** Vaultwarden's authentication mechanism is the direct target. The sensitivity of stored password data amplifies the risk.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uses automated tools to repeatedly submit login requests with different password combinations to a Vaultwarden instance.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts and their password vaults, leading to data breaches and potential compromise of other online accounts.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong password policies and enforce complexity requirements.
        *   Enable and properly configure Vaultwarden's built-in rate limiting and account lockout features.
        *   Consider deploying a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to further enhance brute-force protection.
        *   Mandatory enforcement of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for all users.

## Attack Surface: [Password Reset Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/password_reset_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Flaws in Vaultwarden's password reset process can be exploited to gain unauthorized account access without knowing the original password.
    *   **Vaultwarden Contribution:** Vaultwarden's password reset functionality itself is the attack vector if not implemented securely.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in Vaultwarden's password reset token generation, making tokens predictable and reusable. Or, an attacker finds a flaw allowing password reset without proper email verification.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover and unauthorized access to password vaults.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure Vaultwarden uses strong, unpredictable, and time-limited password reset tokens.
        *   Implement robust email verification within the password reset workflow in Vaultwarden.
        *   Consider CAPTCHA integration in Vaultwarden's password reset form to deter automated attacks.
        *   Regularly audit and test the password reset process for potential vulnerabilities specific to Vaultwarden's implementation.

## Attack Surface: [Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Bypass](./attack_surfaces/two-factor_authentication__2fa__bypass.md)

*   **Description:**  Circumventing Vaultwarden's 2FA mechanisms allows attackers to gain access even when users have enabled this security layer.
    *   **Vaultwarden Contribution:** Vulnerabilities in Vaultwarden's 2FA implementation or weaknesses in how it integrates with supported 2FA methods are direct points of failure.
    *   **Example:** An attacker discovers a session fixation vulnerability within Vaultwarden that allows bypassing the 2FA check after obtaining a valid session ID. Or, a flaw in Vaultwarden's TOTP handling is exploited.
    *   **Impact:** Bypassing a critical security control, leading to unauthorized access to user accounts and password vaults.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly test and audit Vaultwarden's 2FA implementation for any bypass vulnerabilities.
        *   Encourage users to utilize stronger 2FA methods supported by Vaultwarden like WebAuthn or U2F, if available, over less secure options.
        *   Ensure secure session management within Vaultwarden to prevent session fixation and related attacks.
        *   Keep Vaultwarden updated to benefit from any 2FA security patches.

## Attack Surface: [Database Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/database_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Weaknesses in the database system used by Vaultwarden can be exploited to directly access or manipulate the stored encrypted password vaults.
    *   **Vaultwarden Contribution:** Vaultwarden's architecture relies on a database to persist sensitive data. Vulnerabilities in how Vaultwarden interacts with or configures the database are relevant.
    *   **Example:** Although less likely in Vaultwarden's core code, potential SQL injection vulnerabilities in custom extensions or integrations interacting with Vaultwarden's database. Or, misconfiguration of database access permissions within Vaultwarden's deployment.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of encrypted password vaults, potential data manipulation or deletion, and complete compromise of the Vaultwarden instance.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Adhere to database security best practices when deploying Vaultwarden, including strong access controls and minimal privileges.
        *   Ensure the database software (SQLite, MySQL/MariaDB) is kept up-to-date with security patches in the Vaultwarden deployment environment.
        *   Minimize external network access to the database server hosting Vaultwarden's data.

## Attack Surface: [Encryption Key Management Weaknesses](./attack_surfaces/encryption_key_management_weaknesses.md)

*   **Description:**  Insecure generation, storage, or management of encryption keys within Vaultwarden can compromise the confidentiality of the encrypted password vaults.
    *   **Vaultwarden Contribution:** Vaultwarden's core security relies on strong encryption. Flaws in its key management are direct vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** Vaultwarden using a weak or outdated key derivation function, making brute-forcing encryption keys feasible if the database is compromised. Or, insecure storage of encryption keys within the Vaultwarden server environment.
    *   **Impact:**  Compromise of encryption keys renders the encryption ineffective, allowing attackers to decrypt and access all stored passwords.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure Vaultwarden utilizes strong and well-vetted encryption algorithms and key derivation functions as designed.
        *   Verify secure storage of encryption keys within the Vaultwarden deployment, limiting access to only necessary processes and users.
        *   Regularly review and audit Vaultwarden's key management practices and configurations.

## Attack Surface: [API Endpoint Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/api_endpoint_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Flaws in the API endpoints exposed by Vaultwarden can be exploited to bypass security controls and gain unauthorized access to functionality and sensitive password data.
    *   **Vaultwarden Contribution:** Vaultwarden's API is the interface for client applications. Vulnerabilities in these API endpoints are direct attack vectors against Vaultwarden.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability in Vaultwarden's API to access password vaults of other users. Or, an API endpoint lacks proper authentication, allowing unauthorized data extraction.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to password vaults, data manipulation, potential privilege escalation, and compromise of user accounts.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and output encoding for all Vaultwarden API endpoints.
        *   Enforce strict authentication and authorization controls for all API requests within Vaultwarden.
        *   Conduct regular security testing and penetration testing specifically targeting Vaultwarden's API endpoints.
        *   Implement rate limiting on sensitive API endpoints within Vaultwarden to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attempts.
        *   Adhere to API security best practices (e.g., OWASP API Security Top 10) during Vaultwarden deployment and configuration.
