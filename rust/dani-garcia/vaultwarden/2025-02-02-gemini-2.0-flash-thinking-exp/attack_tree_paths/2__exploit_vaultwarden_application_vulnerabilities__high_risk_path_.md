### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Brute-force/Credential Stuffing Attacks (Weak Password Policy)

#### 4.1. Attack Description

This attack path focuses on gaining unauthorized access to Vaultwarden by attempting to guess user credentials through brute-force or by leveraging compromised credentials from other sources (credential stuffing).  The effectiveness of these attacks is significantly amplified by weak password policies.

*   **Brute-force Attacks:**  Involve systematically trying numerous username/password combinations until the correct credentials are found. Attackers can use automated tools to rapidly attempt logins.
*   **Credential Stuffing Attacks:**  Exploit the common practice of users reusing passwords across multiple online services. Attackers use lists of username/password pairs leaked from data breaches of other websites and attempt to log in to Vaultwarden with these credentials.
*   **Weak Password Policy:**  A weak password policy allows users to create easily guessable passwords (e.g., "password123", "123456", dictionary words, personal information). This significantly reduces the time and resources required for successful brute-force and credential stuffing attacks.

#### 4.2. Impact

A successful brute-force or credential stuffing attack against Vaultwarden can have severe consequences:

*   **Complete Data Breach:** Attackers gain full access to the user's Vaultwarden vault, compromising all stored passwords, notes, credit card details, and other sensitive information. This is the primary and most critical impact.
*   **Lateral Movement:**  Compromised Vaultwarden credentials can be used to access other systems and applications if users have reused passwords, leading to broader network compromise.
*   **Data Manipulation/Deletion:**  Attackers could modify or delete vault data, causing significant disruption and data loss.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  If a Vaultwarden instance is breached due to weak password policies and brute-force/credential stuffing, it can severely damage the reputation of the organization or individual using it.
*   **Compliance Violations:**  Depending on the data stored in Vaultwarden, a breach could lead to violations of data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

#### 4.3. Likelihood

The likelihood of successful brute-force or credential stuffing attacks against Vaultwarden depends on several factors:

*   **Password Policy Enforcement:**  If Vaultwarden is configured with a strong password policy and actively enforces it, the likelihood of successful brute-force attacks is significantly reduced. However, if weak or no password policies are in place, the likelihood increases dramatically.
*   **Account Lockout Mechanisms:**  Vaultwarden's implementation of account lockout after multiple failed login attempts is crucial. Effective lockout mechanisms can significantly hinder brute-force attacks.
*   **Rate Limiting:**  Implementing rate limiting on login attempts can slow down brute-force attacks and make them less feasible.
*   **Use of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Enabling MFA adds a significant layer of security, making brute-force and credential stuffing attacks much more difficult, even with weak passwords.
*   **User Password Hygiene:**  Ultimately, user behavior plays a role. Even with strong policies, users might still choose weak passwords or reuse passwords across services. However, strong policies encourage better password practices.
*   **Exposure of Vaultwarden Instance:**  Publicly accessible Vaultwarden instances are more vulnerable to these attacks compared to instances behind firewalls or VPNs.

**Likelihood Assessment for this Path (Without Strong Mitigations): HIGH**

Without proper mitigations like strong password policies, account lockout, rate limiting, and MFA, the likelihood of successful brute-force or credential stuffing attacks against a publicly accessible Vaultwarden instance is **HIGH**.  The prevalence of credential stuffing lists and readily available brute-force tools makes this a common and easily executable attack vector.

#### 4.4. Mitigation and Prevention Strategies for Vaultwarden

To mitigate the risk of brute-force and credential stuffing attacks against Vaultwarden, the following security controls and best practices should be implemented:

*   **Strong Password Policy Enforcement (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Mandatory Password Complexity:** Enforce strong password complexity requirements (minimum length, character types - uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols). Vaultwarden's configuration should be reviewed to ensure these policies are configurable and enforced.
    *   **Password Strength Meter:** Implement a password strength meter during password creation and change processes to guide users towards stronger passwords.
    *   **Regular Password Updates (Optional but Recommended):** While not always user-friendly, periodic password changes can reduce the window of opportunity for compromised credentials.
    *   **Prohibit Common Passwords:**  Consider using a dictionary of common passwords to prevent users from choosing easily guessable passwords.

*   **Account Lockout Mechanisms (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Implement Account Lockout:** Configure Vaultwarden to automatically lock user accounts after a certain number of failed login attempts within a specific timeframe.
    *   **Progressive Backoff:**  Implement progressive lockout, increasing the lockout duration after each subsequent lockout.
    *   **Admin Unlock:** Provide administrators with a mechanism to unlock accounts.
    *   **Consider CAPTCHA:**  Implement CAPTCHA or similar challenges after a few failed login attempts to differentiate between human users and automated bots.

*   **Rate Limiting (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Implement Rate Limiting on Login Endpoints:**  Limit the number of login requests from a single IP address or user account within a given timeframe. This can effectively slow down brute-force attacks. Web server or reverse proxy configurations (like Nginx or Apache) can be used for rate limiting.

*   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Enable and Enforce MFA:**  Strongly recommend and ideally enforce MFA for all Vaultwarden users. Vaultwarden supports various MFA methods (TOTP, WebAuthn, Duo, YubiKey). MFA significantly reduces the risk of account compromise even if passwords are weak or compromised.
    *   **Promote MFA Adoption:**  Educate users about the importance of MFA and provide clear instructions on how to enable and use it.

*   **Security Monitoring and Logging (IMPORTANT):**
    *   **Log Failed Login Attempts:**  Enable detailed logging of failed login attempts, including timestamps, usernames, and source IP addresses.
    *   **Alerting on Suspicious Activity:**  Set up alerts for unusual login patterns, such as a high number of failed login attempts from a single IP or for a specific user account. Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems can be used for advanced monitoring and alerting.
    *   **Regular Log Review:**  Periodically review logs to identify and investigate suspicious activity.

*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF) (RECOMMENDED):**
    *   **Deploy a WAF:**  A WAF can provide an additional layer of defense by detecting and blocking malicious requests, including brute-force and credential stuffing attempts. WAFs can often identify and block patterns associated with these attacks.

*   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing (RECOMMENDED):**
    *   **Conduct Regular Audits:**  Periodically review Vaultwarden's security configuration and policies.
    *   **Penetration Testing:**  Engage security professionals to conduct penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities, including weaknesses in authentication and authorization mechanisms.

*   **User Education and Awareness (ONGOING):**
    *   **Password Security Training:**  Educate users about the importance of strong, unique passwords and the risks of password reuse.
    *   **MFA Promotion:**  Continuously promote the use of MFA and explain its benefits.
    *   **Phishing Awareness:**  Train users to recognize and avoid phishing attacks, which can be used to steal credentials.

#### 4.5. Vaultwarden Specific Considerations

*   **Vaultwarden Configuration:** Vaultwarden's configuration file (`config.rs` or environment variables) should be thoroughly reviewed to ensure that password policies, account lockout, and other security settings are properly configured and enforced.
*   **Reverse Proxy Configuration:** If Vaultwarden is deployed behind a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, Apache), the reverse proxy should be configured to implement rate limiting and potentially WAF functionalities.
*   **Updates and Patching:**  Keep Vaultwarden and its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches to address known vulnerabilities that could be exploited in authentication mechanisms.
*   **Community Resources:** Leverage the Vaultwarden community and documentation for best practices and security recommendations.
