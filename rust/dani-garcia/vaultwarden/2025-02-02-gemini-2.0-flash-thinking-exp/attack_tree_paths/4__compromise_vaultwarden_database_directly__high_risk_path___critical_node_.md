#### 4.2. 4.1. Database Credential Compromise [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]

**Description:** This node focuses on compromising the credentials used to access the Vaultwarden database. If an attacker obtains valid database credentials, they can bypass authentication and directly interact with the database, effectively achieving the objective of direct database compromise.

**Risk Level:** **HIGH RISK** -  Credential compromise is a common and effective attack vector.

**Impact:** **CRITICAL** -  Same as the parent node (Compromise Vaultwarden Database Directly).

**Attack Vectors (Sub-nodes):**

##### 4.2.1. 4.1.1. Weak Database Password [HIGH RISK PATH]

**Description:** This attack vector involves exploiting a weak or easily guessable password used to protect the database user account that Vaultwarden uses to connect. Attackers can employ password guessing techniques (manual or automated) or password cracking tools (dictionary attacks, brute-force attacks) to attempt to discover the password.

**Likelihood:** **MEDIUM to HIGH** -  Depending on the password complexity and security practices. Default or easily guessable passwords are highly vulnerable.

**Impact:** **CRITICAL** -  Successful password cracking grants direct database access.

**Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Default Passwords:** Using default passwords provided by database software or installation guides.
    *   **Simple Passwords:** Choosing passwords that are short, contain common words, or are easily related to the application or organization.
    *   **Password Reuse:** Reusing passwords across different systems, including the database.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Strong Password Policy:** Enforce a strong password policy for the database user account. This should include:
    *   **Minimum Length:**  At least 16 characters, ideally longer.
    *   **Complexity Requirements:**  Combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
    *   **Regular Password Rotation:**  While less critical for machine accounts, periodic rotation can be considered as part of a broader security strategy.
*   **Password Complexity Checks:** Implement automated checks during database setup to ensure the chosen password meets complexity requirements.
*   **Password Managers (for administrators):** Encourage administrators to use password managers to generate and store strong, unique database passwords.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Periodically audit password strength and database access controls.

##### 4.2.2. 4.1.2. Exposed Database Credentials (in configuration files, environment variables, code) [HIGH RISK PATH]

**Description:** This attack vector involves finding database credentials that are unintentionally exposed in various locations. This can occur due to insecure development practices, misconfigurations, or inadequate security awareness.

**Likelihood:** **MEDIUM to HIGH** -  Common misconfiguration and development oversight.

**Impact:** **CRITICAL** -  Direct access to database upon finding exposed credentials.

**Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Configuration Files:** Storing database credentials directly in configuration files (e.g., `config.yml`, `.env` files) that are accessible to unauthorized users or accidentally committed to version control systems.
    *   **Environment Variables (Misconfigured):**  While environment variables are generally a better practice than configuration files, misconfigurations can lead to exposure if not properly secured (e.g., exposed through web server configuration, process listing, or insecure container orchestration).
    *   **Hardcoded Credentials in Code:** Embedding database credentials directly within the application code, which can be discovered through reverse engineering or code leaks.
    *   **Log Files:**  Accidentally logging database connection strings or credentials in application or system logs.
    *   **Version Control Systems (VCS):**  Committing configuration files or code containing credentials to public or insecurely managed VCS repositories (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
    *   **Backup Files:**  Including configuration files with credentials in unencrypted or insecurely stored backup files.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Secure Credential Management:** Implement a secure credential management strategy:
    *   **Environment Variables (Best Practice):**  Store database credentials as environment variables, ensuring proper access control and secure configuration of the environment.
    *   **Secrets Management Systems:**  Consider using dedicated secrets management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) for more robust credential storage and access control, especially in larger or more complex deployments.
*   **Configuration File Security:** If configuration files are used, ensure they are:
    *   **Properly Permissions:**  Restrict file permissions to only the necessary user accounts (e.g., the Vaultwarden application user).
    *   **Excluded from VCS:**  Never commit configuration files containing credentials to version control. Use `.gitignore` or similar mechanisms.
*   **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews to identify and eliminate any hardcoded credentials.
*   **Static Code Analysis:** Utilize static code analysis tools to automatically detect potential credential exposure in code and configuration files.
*   **Log Sanitization:**  Implement logging practices that avoid logging sensitive information like database credentials.
*   **Secure Backup Practices:** Encrypt backup files and store them in secure locations with appropriate access controls.
*   **Regular Security Scanning:**  Perform regular security scans of the application and infrastructure to identify potential credential exposure vulnerabilities.
