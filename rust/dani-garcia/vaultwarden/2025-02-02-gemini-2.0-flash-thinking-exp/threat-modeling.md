Regularly review and update cryptographic libraries to address known vulnerabilities. Follow secure coding practices for cryptographic operations. Participate in or commission cryptographic audits.
    *   **Users/Administrators:** Ensure Vaultwarden is regularly updated to benefit from the latest security patches and cryptographic improvements.

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass or Weak Authentication Mechanisms](./threats/authentication_bypass_or_weak_authentication_mechanisms.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in Vaultwarden's authentication process allow an attacker to bypass login procedures and gain unauthorized access. This could involve flaws in password hashing algorithms *within Vaultwarden*, session management, two-factor authentication implementation, or logic errors in the authentication flow. An attacker could potentially impersonate legitimate users or gain administrative access.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user vaults and potential control over the Vaultwarden instance.
*   **Affected Vaultwarden Component:** Authentication module, password hashing functions, session management, two-factor authentication implementation.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement robust authentication mechanisms using strong password hashing algorithms (e.g., Argon2id). Securely manage user sessions and prevent session hijacking. Thoroughly test and validate two-factor authentication implementation. Regularly audit authentication code for vulnerabilities.
    *   **Users/Administrators:** Enforce strong password policies for users. Enable and enforce two-factor authentication for all users, especially administrators. Regularly update Vaultwarden to benefit from authentication security patches.

## Threat: [Authorization Flaws Leading to Privilege Escalation or Data Access](./threats/authorization_flaws_leading_to_privilege_escalation_or_data_access.md)

*   **Description:** Authorization flaws *within Vaultwarden* allow a user to perform actions or access data beyond their intended permissions. This could include accessing other users' vaults, modifying administrative settings without proper authorization, or bypassing access controls designed to restrict certain functionalities. An attacker could exploit these flaws to gain elevated privileges or access sensitive data they should not be able to see.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data and potential for malicious actions within the Vaultwarden instance, including data modification or deletion.
*   **Affected Vaultwarden Component:** Authorization module, access control logic, user and role management.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement strict and well-defined authorization controls based on the principle of least privilege. Thoroughly test authorization logic for all functionalities and user roles. Regularly audit authorization code for vulnerabilities.
    *   **Users/Administrators:** Carefully configure user roles and permissions, granting only necessary privileges. Regularly review user permissions and remove unnecessary access.

## Threat: [Exposure of Configuration Files](./threats/exposure_of_configuration_files.md)

*   **Description:** Vaultwarden's configuration files (e.g., `.env` file) are inadvertently exposed due to misconfigurations *in how Vaultwarden is deployed*, directory listing vulnerabilities, insecure file permissions, or improper deployment practices. These files may contain sensitive information such as database credentials, encryption keys, API keys, or other secrets. An attacker gaining access to these files could completely compromise the Vaultwarden instance.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Vaultwarden instance and potential exposure of all stored secrets.
*   **Affected Vaultwarden Component:** Configuration file handling, deployment scripts, documentation.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Provide clear documentation on secure storage and handling of configuration files. Emphasize the importance of restricting access to configuration files.
    *   **Users/Administrators:** Store configuration files outside the web server's document root. Restrict file permissions on configuration files to only allow access by the Vaultwarden application user. Ensure web server configurations prevent directory listing and access to sensitive files.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Vaultwarden relies on third-party libraries and crates. These dependencies may contain security vulnerabilities. If vulnerable dependencies are used, attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise Vaultwarden. This could range from denial of service to remote code execution and data breaches, depending on the nature of the vulnerability *within Vaultwarden's dependencies*.
*   **Impact:** Potential for various attacks depending on the dependency vulnerability, ranging from denial of service to remote code execution and data breaches.
*   **Affected Vaultwarden Component:** All components relying on third-party libraries, dependency management system.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Regularly update dependencies to the latest versions. Monitor security advisories related to dependencies. Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities. Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) in the development pipeline.
    *   **Users/Administrators:** Regularly update Vaultwarden to benefit from dependency updates included in new releases.

## Threat: [Insecure Update Process](./threats/insecure_update_process.md)

*   **Description:** The Vaultwarden update process is vulnerable to attacks. An attacker could potentially inject malicious code into updates if the update channel is not secure (e.g., using HTTP instead of HTTPS), if updates are not cryptographically signed and verified *by Vaultwarden*, or if there are vulnerabilities in the update mechanism itself. This could lead to the installation of a compromised Vaultwarden version.
*   **Impact:** Installation of compromised Vaultwarden versions, potentially leading to complete compromise of the instance and data.
*   **Affected Vaultwarden Component:** Update mechanism, update server infrastructure, software distribution process.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Use secure update channels (HTTPS). Cryptographically sign updates to ensure integrity and authenticity. Implement robust verification of update integrity during the update process.
    *   **Users/Administrators:** Ensure Vaultwarden is configured to use secure update channels. Verify the integrity of downloaded updates if possible (though usually handled automatically by the application). Apply updates promptly when they are released.
