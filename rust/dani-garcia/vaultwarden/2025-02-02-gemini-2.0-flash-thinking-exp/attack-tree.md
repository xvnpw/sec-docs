## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Vaultwarden Server Directly [HIGH RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_vaultwarden_server_directly__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Vaultwarden application itself.
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in the underlying server infrastructure (Operating System, Network, etc.).
    *   Misconfigurations of the Vaultwarden server or its environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Vaultwarden Application Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_vaultwarden_application_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Authentication & Authorization Bypass [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Brute-force/Credential Stuffing Attacks (Weak Password Policy) [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            *   Attacker attempts to guess user passwords through repeated login attempts.
            *   Attacker uses lists of compromised credentials from other breaches to try and login (credential stuffing).
            *   Weak password policies make password guessing easier.
        *   **Vulnerabilities in Login/Authentication Logic:**
            *   Flaws in the code that handles user login and authentication, potentially allowing bypass without valid credentials.
            *   Vulnerabilities in Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) implementation, allowing bypass of MFA.
        *   **Session Hijacking/Fixation:**
            *   Stealing a valid user session ID to impersonate the user.
            *   Forcing a user to use a known session ID controlled by the attacker.
        *   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in API endpoints:**
            *   Exploiting API endpoints that do not properly validate user authorization, allowing access to resources they shouldn't have access to.
        *   **Vulnerabilities in Password Reset Mechanism:**
            *   Flaws in the password reset process that allow an attacker to reset another user's password without proper authorization.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Resource Exhaustion (CPU, Memory, Disk) [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            *   Overwhelming the server with requests to consume CPU, memory, or disk resources, making the application unavailable.
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Dependencies (Libraries, Frameworks) [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   Exploiting known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries or frameworks used by Vaultwarden.
    *   **Misconfiguration Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Insecure Default Settings (e.g., weak encryption, debug mode enabled) [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            *   Exploiting default configurations that are not secure, such as weak encryption algorithms or enabled debug modes in production.
        *   **Lack of HTTPS/TLS or Improper TLS Configuration [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            *   Intercepting communication if HTTPS/TLS is not enabled or improperly configured, leading to data interception (Man-in-the-Middle attacks).
    *   **Logic Flaws in Vaultwarden Functionality:**
        *   **Vulnerabilities in Password Generation/Storage [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   Flaws in how Vaultwarden generates or stores passwords, potentially leading to weak encryption or exposure of passwords.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Server Infrastructure Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_server_infrastructure_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Operating System Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]:**

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Compromise Vaultwarden Database Directly [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/4__compromise_vaultwarden_database_directly__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Database Credential Compromise [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Weak Database Password [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            *   Guessing or cracking a weak password used to protect the database.
        *   **Exposed Database Credentials (in configuration files, environment variables, code) [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            *   Finding database credentials that are inadvertently exposed in configuration files, environment variables, or hardcoded in the application.
    *   **Database Server Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   Exploiting known vulnerabilities in the database server software to gain unauthorized access or execute arbitrary code.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Supply Chain Attacks Targeting Vaultwarden [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/5__supply_chain_attacks_targeting_vaultwarden__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Compromised Dependencies (malicious or vulnerable dependencies introduced into Vaultwarden's build process) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   Malicious code injected into a dependency used by Vaultwarden, either intentionally or through compromise of the dependency's maintainers.
        *   Vulnerable dependencies that are not patched, allowing attackers to exploit known flaws.
    *   **Compromised Build/Release Pipeline (attacker gains access to Vaultwarden's build or release process to inject malicious code) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   Gaining unauthorized access to Vaultwarden's build or release infrastructure to inject malicious code into the official distribution.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Social Engineering Targeting Vaultwarden Users [HIGH RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/6__social_engineering_targeting_vaultwarden_users__high_risk_path_.md)

        *   Tricking users into revealing their Vaultwarden credentials or other sensitive information through deceptive emails, websites, or messages.
        *   Distributing malware disguised as legitimate Vaultwarden software or updates.
    *   **Insider Threats [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   Malicious actions by individuals with legitimate access to Vaultwarden systems or data, such as employees or contractors.
        *   Negligent actions by insiders that unintentionally compromise security, such as misconfiguring systems or mishandling credentials.
