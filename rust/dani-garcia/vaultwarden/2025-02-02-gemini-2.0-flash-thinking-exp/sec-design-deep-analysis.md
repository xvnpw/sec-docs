### 2. Security Implications of Key Components and Mitigation Strategies

#### 2.1. C4 Context Diagram Components

**2.1.1. Users:**

*   **Security Implications:**
    *   **Weak Master Passwords:** Users choosing weak master passwords are a significant vulnerability. If a master password is compromised, the entire vault is at risk.
    *   **Compromised User Devices:** If a user's device is compromised (malware, physical access), the Bitwarden client and potentially the unlocked vault could be exposed.
    *   **Phishing Attacks:** Users could be tricked into entering their master password on a fake Bitwarden login page, leading to credential theft.
    *   **Lack of 2FA:** Users not enabling 2FA are more vulnerable to account takeover if their master password is leaked or cracked.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Password Strength Meter:** Implement a strong password strength meter in Bitwarden clients to encourage users to choose strong master passwords.
    *   **Password Complexity Requirements (Optional Server-Side Setting):** Consider adding an optional server-side setting for administrators to enforce password complexity requirements for master passwords.
    *   **2FA Enforcement (Optional Server-Side Setting):** Provide an option for administrators to enforce 2FA for all users on their Vaultwarden instance.
    *   **User Education:** Provide clear and accessible documentation and in-app guidance on the importance of strong master passwords, 2FA, and device security.
    *   **Phishing Awareness Training (for organizations):** Encourage organizations using Vaultwarden to conduct phishing awareness training for their users.
