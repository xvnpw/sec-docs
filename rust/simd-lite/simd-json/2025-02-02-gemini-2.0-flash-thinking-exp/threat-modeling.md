# Threat Model Analysis for simd-lite/simd-json

## Threat: [Malformed JSON Denial of Service](./threats/malformed_json_denial_of_service.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends specially crafted, malformed JSON data to the application. `simd-json`'s parsing process might get stuck in an infinite loop, consume excessive resources, or crash, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Impact:** Application becomes unavailable, service disruption, potential server instability.
*   **Affected Component:** `simd-json` parsing core, specifically the input validation and error handling logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement input validation *before* passing data to `simd-json` to filter out obviously invalid JSON structures.
    *   Set timeouts for JSON parsing operations to prevent indefinite processing.
    *   Implement resource limits (CPU, memory) for processes handling JSON parsing.
    *   Thoroughly test with various malformed JSON inputs and edge cases.

## Threat: [Buffer Overflow/Underflow during Parsing](./threats/buffer_overflowunderflow_during_parsing.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends complex or deeply nested JSON structures, or JSON with very long strings, aiming to trigger a buffer overflow or underflow vulnerability within `simd-json`'s parsing logic. This could allow the attacker to overwrite memory, potentially leading to code execution or denial of service.
*   **Impact:** Code execution, Denial of Service, Information Disclosure (memory corruption), application crash.
*   **Affected Component:** `simd-json` parsing core, memory management within parsing functions.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Crucially:** Keep `simd-json` updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches.
    *   Perform fuzzing and security testing of your application's JSON parsing logic, especially with large, complex, and maliciously crafted JSON inputs.
    *   Implement limits on the maximum size and complexity of JSON inputs accepted by the application.

## Threat: [Memory Exhaustion from Large JSON](./threats/memory_exhaustion_from_large_json.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends very large JSON documents to consume excessive memory during parsing. This can lead to memory exhaustion, application crashes, or denial of service.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service, Application crash, service disruption.
*   **Affected Component:** `simd-json` memory allocation during parsing.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement limits on the maximum size of JSON payloads accepted by the application.
    *   Consider streaming JSON parsing if `simd-json` supports it and if your use case allows to reduce memory footprint.
    *   Monitor memory usage and implement resource limits to prevent excessive memory consumption.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in `simd-json` Library](./threats/vulnerabilities_in__simd-json__library.md)

*   **Description:** Undiscovered vulnerabilities might exist within the `simd-json` library code itself. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities if they are discovered and become publicly known.
*   **Impact:**  Varies depending on the vulnerability - could range from Denial of Service to Remote Code Execution or Information Disclosure.
*   **Affected Component:** Entire `simd-json` library codebase.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical to Low depending on the specific vulnerability, considering potential for critical vulnerabilities, we keep it as high priority).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Crucially:** Stay informed about security advisories and updates for `simd-json`.
    *   **Crucially:** Regularly update to the latest stable version of `simd-json` to benefit from security patches.
    *   Subscribe to security mailing lists or monitoring services related to `simd-json` and its ecosystem.
    *   Consider using dependency scanning tools to detect known vulnerabilities in `simd-json` and its dependencies.
