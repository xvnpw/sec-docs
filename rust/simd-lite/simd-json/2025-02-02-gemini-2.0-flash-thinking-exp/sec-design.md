# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, `simdjson`, provides a high-performance JSON parsing library. The primary business priority it addresses is improving the performance and efficiency of applications that process JSON data. This is crucial for applications where speed and low latency are critical, such as web servers, data analytics pipelines, and real-time systems.

Most important business risks that need to be addressed:

- Performance bottlenecks due to slow JSON parsing can impact application responsiveness and user experience.
- Inefficient resource utilization due to slow parsing can increase operational costs, especially in cloud environments.
- Potential vulnerabilities in the parsing library could lead to application security breaches if not properly addressed.
- Compatibility issues with different JSON formats or edge cases could lead to application errors or data corruption.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:

- security control: Code review process is likely in place as part of the open-source contribution model. (Location: GitHub repository - pull request reviews)
- security control: Static analysis tools might be used during development, although not explicitly mentioned in the repository. (Location: Assumption based on common software development practices)
- security control: Unit and integration tests are present to ensure code correctness and prevent regressions. (Location: GitHub repository - test directory and CI workflows)

Accepted risks:

- accepted risk: As an open-source project, the project relies on community contributions for security vulnerability identification and patching. Response time to vulnerabilities might vary.
- accepted risk:  The library's focus on performance might lead to overlooking certain less common but potentially exploitable edge cases in JSON parsing.

Recommended security controls:

- security control: Implement automated static analysis security testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to detect potential vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle.
- security control: Integrate dependency scanning to identify and manage vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by `simdjson`.
- security control: Establish a clear process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities, including a security policy and contact information.
- security control: Perform regular security audits and penetration testing to proactively identify and address potential security weaknesses.

Security requirements:

- Authentication: Not applicable. `simdjson` is a library and does not handle authentication.
- Authorization: Not applicable. `simdjson` is a library and does not handle authorization.
- Input validation:
    - security requirement: The library must robustly handle malformed or invalid JSON input without crashing or exhibiting unexpected behavior.
    - security requirement: The library should protect against common JSON parsing vulnerabilities, such as denial-of-service attacks via excessively large JSON documents or deeply nested structures.
    - security requirement: The library should handle various JSON encoding formats correctly and securely.
- Cryptography: Not applicable directly. `simdjson` is a JSON parsing library and does not handle cryptography directly. However, it should not interfere with or weaken any cryptographic operations performed on data before or after parsing.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

What are critical business process we are trying to protect?

- The critical business process is the application's ability to efficiently and reliably process JSON data. This is essential for the application's core functionality and performance.  If JSON parsing is slow or fails, the application's business processes will be negatively impacted.

What data we are trying to protect and what is their sensitivity?

- The data being protected is the JSON data itself, and the application's code and infrastructure.
- Sensitivity of JSON data depends on the application. It could range from publicly available data to highly sensitive personal or financial information. The sensitivity level directly impacts the required security controls.
- The application code and infrastructure are also sensitive assets, as their compromise could lead to data breaches, service disruption, or reputational damage.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- What type of application is using `simdjson`? (Web server, data pipeline, etc.) - This would help to refine the deployment and risk assessment sections.
- What is the sensitivity of the JSON data being processed? - This is crucial for determining appropriate security controls.
- What is the organization's risk appetite? - A startup might accept more risks than a Fortune 500 company.
- Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS)? - Compliance requirements will dictate specific security controls.

Assumptions:

- Assumption: The application using `simdjson` is performance-sensitive and benefits significantly from fast JSON parsing.
- Assumption: The application is deployed in a cloud environment for scalability and availability.
- Assumption: Standard software development practices are followed, including code review and testing.
