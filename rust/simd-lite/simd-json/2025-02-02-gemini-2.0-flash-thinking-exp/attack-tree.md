## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Malformed JSON](./attack_tree_paths/supply_malformed_json.md)

#### 1. Supply Malformed JSON (Part of "Exploit Parsing Logic Flaws -> Trigger Incorrect Data Extraction")

*   **Attack Vector Name:** Supply Malformed JSON
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Low to Medium (Application logic errors, data corruption, unexpected behavior)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Input Validation: Implement robust schema validation *after* simd-json parsing to verify data integrity and structure against expected format.
    *   Error Handling: Ensure application gracefully handles parsing errors and doesn't proceed with processing invalid data.
    *   Fuzzing: Regularly fuzz test the application with various malformed JSON inputs to identify parsing logic weaknesses.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Type Confusion](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_type_confusion.md)

#### 2. Exploit Type Confusion (Part of "Exploit Parsing Logic Flaws -> Trigger Incorrect Data Extraction")

*   **Attack Vector Name:** Exploit Type Confusion
*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium to High (Logic errors, security bypasses, data corruption)
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Strict Type Checking:  In application code, enforce strict type checking on data extracted from simd-json. Do not rely solely on simd-json's type interpretation.
    *   Schema Definition: Define and enforce a clear JSON schema for expected inputs to minimize ambiguity and potential type confusion.
    *   Unit Tests: Develop unit tests specifically targeting type handling edge cases and potential type confusion scenarios in simd-json parsing.

## Attack Tree Path: [Resource Exhaustion via Large JSON](./attack_tree_paths/resource_exhaustion_via_large_json.md)

#### 3. Resource Exhaustion via Large JSON (Part of "Cause Denial of Service (DoS)") **[CRITICAL NODE: DoS via Large JSON - High Likelihood, High Impact]**

*   **Attack Vector Name:** Resource Exhaustion via Large JSON
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
*   **Impact:** High (Application unavailability, service disruption)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Input Size Limits: Implement limits on the maximum size of JSON payloads accepted by the application.
    *   Resource Monitoring: Monitor application resource usage (CPU, memory) and implement alerts for unusual spikes during JSON parsing.
    *   Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting on API endpoints that process JSON to prevent abuse through repeated large payload submissions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Algorithmic Complexity Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/algorithmic_complexity_exploitation.md)

#### 4. Algorithmic Complexity Exploitation (Part of "Cause Denial of Service (DoS)")

*   **Attack Vector Name:** Algorithmic Complexity Exploitation
*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium to High (Application slowdown, DoS)
*   **Effort:** Medium to High
*   **Skill Level:** Medium to High
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Performance Testing: Conduct performance testing with various JSON structures, including deeply nested and complex ones, to identify potential algorithmic bottlenecks in simd-json.
    *   Timeout Mechanisms: Implement timeouts for JSON parsing operations to prevent indefinite blocking in case of algorithmic complexity issues.
    *   Code Review: Review simd-json's parsing algorithm (if feasible and source code is available) to understand potential worst-case complexity scenarios.

## Attack Tree Path: [Buffer Overflow/Underflow](./attack_tree_paths/buffer_overflowunderflow.md)

#### 5. Buffer Overflow/Underflow (Part of "Exploit Memory Safety Vulnerabilities") **[CRITICAL NODE: Buffer Overflow/Underflow - Critical Impact]**

*   **Attack Vector Name:** Buffer Overflow/Underflow
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** Critical (Memory corruption, application crash, potential for arbitrary code execution)
*   **Effort:** High
*   **Skill Level:** High to Expert
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium (if crashes occur), High (if subtle corruption). Memory sanitizers are best for detection.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Memory Sanitizers: Compile and test the application and simd-json with memory sanitizers (e.g., AddressSanitizer, MemorySanitizer) to detect memory safety issues during development and testing.
    *   Code Auditing: Conduct thorough code audits of simd-json's C++ source code, focusing on memory management and buffer handling, especially in SIMD sections.
    *   Dependency Updates: Regularly update to the latest version of simd-json, as security vulnerabilities are often patched in newer releases.

## Attack Tree Path: [Integer Overflow/Underflow](./attack_tree_paths/integer_overflowunderflow.md)

#### 6. Integer Overflow/Underflow (Part of "Exploit Memory Safety Vulnerabilities")

*   **Attack Vector Name:** Integer Overflow/Underflow
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** Medium to High (Memory corruption, unexpected behavior, potential for buffer overflows/underflows)
*   **Effort:** Medium to High
*   **Skill Level:** Medium to High
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Input Validation: Validate the size and structure of incoming JSON to prevent excessively large or deeply nested structures that might trigger integer overflows.
    *   Safe Integer Operations: If possible, review simd-json's code for integer operations and ensure safe integer handling practices are used (e.g., checks for overflow before operations).
    *   Compiler Flags: Compile simd-json and the application with compiler flags that detect integer overflows (if available and practical).
