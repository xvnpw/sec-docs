# Threat Model Analysis for simd-lite/simd-json

## Threat: [Integer Overflow/Underflow in Size Calculations](./threats/integer_overflowunderflow_in_size_calculations.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts JSON input that triggers integer overflows or underflows during `simdjson`'s size calculations for memory allocation and data processing. This can lead to incorrect buffer sizes and subsequent memory corruption.
*   **Impact:** Buffer Overflow, Memory Corruption, potentially leading to Arbitrary Code Execution or Denial of Service.
*   **Affected Component:** `simdjson` memory management routines, size calculation logic within parsing functions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Conduct thorough code review of `simdjson` usage, focusing on size calculations and memory management.
    *   Utilize compiler and static analysis tools to detect potential integer overflow/underflow issues.
    *   Use address sanitizers (like ASan) during development and testing to detect memory errors.

## Threat: [Buffer Overflows in Parsing Logic](./threats/buffer_overflows_in_parsing_logic.md)

*   **Description:** Due to bugs in `simdjson`'s parsing logic, an attacker can provide specific JSON input that causes the parser to write beyond allocated buffer boundaries. This can be triggered by exploiting flaws in bounds checking or buffer management within `simdjson`'s core parsing functions, especially when combined with SIMD optimizations.
*   **Impact:** Memory Corruption, Arbitrary Code Execution, Denial of Service.
*   **Affected Component:** `simdjson` core parsing logic, buffer management routines, SIMD optimized parsing functions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Rigorous code review and static analysis focusing on buffer handling and memory management in `simdjson`'s source code and usage.
    *   Extensive fuzz testing with a wide range of JSON inputs, including large and complex structures, to uncover buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
    *   Employ memory safety tools like AddressSanitizer (ASan) and MemorySanitizer (MSan) during development and testing.
    *   Keep `simdjson` updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.

## Threat: [Use-After-Free Vulnerabilities](./threats/use-after-free_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrect memory management within `simdjson` can lead to use-after-free vulnerabilities. An attacker might trigger a scenario where memory used by `simdjson` is freed prematurely and then accessed again during parsing or data processing, leading to memory corruption and potential exploitation.
*   **Impact:** Memory Corruption, Arbitrary Code Execution, Denial of Service.
*   **Affected Component:** `simdjson` memory management routines, object lifecycle management within the parser.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Careful code review of memory allocation and deallocation patterns in `simdjson`'s source code and usage.
    *   Static analysis tools to detect potential use-after-free scenarios.
    *   AddressSanitizer (ASan) and MemorySanitizer (MSan) are crucial for detecting use-after-free errors during testing.
    *   Ensure proper resource management and object lifetime management when using `simdjson`.

## Threat: [Double-Free Vulnerabilities](./threats/double-free_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might craft a JSON input or trigger a sequence of operations that causes `simdjson` to attempt to free the same memory block multiple times. This double-free condition corrupts memory management structures and can lead to crashes or exploitable conditions.
*   **Impact:** Memory Corruption, Denial of Service, potentially Arbitrary Code Execution.
*   **Affected Component:** `simdjson` memory management routines, object lifecycle management within the parser.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thorough code review of memory deallocation logic in `simdjson`'s source code and usage.
    *   Static analysis tools to identify potential double-free scenarios.
    *   AddressSanitizer (ASan) can often detect double-free errors during testing.
    *   Ensure correct and consistent memory management practices when integrating `simdjson`.
