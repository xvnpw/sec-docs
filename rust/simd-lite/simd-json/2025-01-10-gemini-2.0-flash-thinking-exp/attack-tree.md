## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Parsing Inefficiencies leading to DoS](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_parsing_inefficiencies_leading_to_dos.md)

**Objective:** Cause a Denial of Service by overwhelming the parser with resource-intensive JSON.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Send Extremely Large JSON Payload:**
        * **Trigger Excessive Memory Allocation:**
            * **Exploit Deeply Nested Objects/Arrays:** Sending JSON with numerous nested levels forces the parser to allocate significant memory for tracking the structure.
            * **Exploit Large String/Number Values:** Including extremely long strings or numbers in the JSON requires the parser to allocate large memory blocks to store these values.
* **Likelihood:** Medium - While applications often have size limits, attackers can still craft payloads large enough to cause disruption.
* **Impact:** Medium - Can lead to temporary unavailability of the application.
* **Effort:** Low - Relatively easy to generate large JSON payloads.
* **Skill Level:** Low.
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Large request sizes can be indicative, but might also be legitimate.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Trigger Parser Crash via Malformed JSON](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_trigger_parser_crash_via_malformed_json.md)

**Objective:** Cause the parser to crash by sending syntactically incorrect or invalid JSON.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Send Malformed JSON Payload:**
        * **Trigger Unhandled Exception:**
            * **Introduce Invalid Characters:** Including characters not allowed in JSON syntax.
            * **Introduce Syntax Errors (e.g., missing quotes, commas):** Violating the basic syntax rules of JSON.
* **Likelihood:** Medium - Common attack vector, but robust parsers often handle basic malformed input.
* **Impact:** Low (if handled), potentially Medium (if leads to application crash and DoS).
* **Effort:** Low - Easy to introduce syntax errors.
* **Skill Level:** Low.
* **Detection Difficulty:** Easy - Parsing errors are usually logged.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Buffer Overflow/Underflow](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_buffer_overflowunderflow.md)

**Objective:** Cause a crash or potentially execute arbitrary code by overflowing or underflowing internal buffers within the `simdjson` library.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Send Input Exceeding Internal Buffer Limits:**
        * **Exploit String Parsing Logic:** Crafting JSON with extremely long strings that exceed the expected buffer size during parsing.
        * **Exploit Number Parsing Logic:** Sending very large or very small numbers that exceed the buffer allocated for number conversion.
        * **Exploit SIMD Optimization Edge Cases:**  Finding specific input that causes the SIMD instructions to write beyond allocated memory regions due to implementation flaws.
* **Likelihood:** Low to Very Low - Modern parsers, especially those with SIMD optimizations, are generally designed to be memory-safe. Exploiting these vulnerabilities requires deep understanding of the library's internals.
* **Impact:** High - Can lead to application crashes and, in more severe cases, remote code execution.
* **Effort:** High to Very High - Requires significant reverse engineering and deep understanding of `simdjson`'s implementation.
* **Skill Level:** High to Very High.
* **Detection Difficulty:** Hard to Very Hard - May not be easily detectable without memory analysis tools.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Manipulate Application Logic/Data](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_manipulate_application_logicdata.md)

**Objective:**  Cause the application to behave incorrectly or process data in an unintended way by exploiting how `simdjson` parses specific JSON structures.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Exploit Parsing Logic Flaws:**
        * **Cause Incorrect Data Interpretation:**
            * **Send JSON with Ambiguous or Edge-Case Values:**
                * **Exploit Integer Overflow/Underflow in Number Parsing:** Sending very large or small integers that might wrap around or be misinterpreted by the application.
                * **Exploit Floating-Point Precision Issues:** Sending floating-point numbers that could lead to precision errors affecting application logic.
* **Likelihood:** Medium - Depends on the application's handling of specific data types and edge cases.
* **Impact:** Medium - Can lead to incorrect calculations, flawed decision-making within the application, or data corruption.
* **Effort:** Medium - Requires understanding of the application's data processing logic and potential parsing ambiguities.
* **Skill Level:** Medium.
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard - May manifest as subtle application errors.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Parsing Logic Flaws to Manipulate Data](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_parsing_logic_flaws_to_manipulate_data.md)

**Objective:**  Specifically target vulnerabilities in how `simdjson` interprets certain JSON structures to manipulate application behavior.
* **Attack Vectors:** (As listed under the "Manipulate Application Logic/Data" critical node)
* **Likelihood:** Medium - Relies on finding specific edge cases in parsing and how the application uses the parsed data.
* **Impact:** Medium - Can alter application behavior or data in unintended ways.
* **Effort:** Medium.
* **Skill Level:** Medium.
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Memory Corruption](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_memory_corruption.md)

**Objective:** Corrupt memory used by the `simdjson` library, potentially leading to crashes or code execution.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Trigger Out-of-Bounds Write:**
        * **Exploit SIMD Instruction Vulnerabilities:** Crafting input that causes the SIMD instructions to write data to incorrect memory locations.
        * **Exploit Memory Management Issues:**
            * **Trigger Double-Free or Use-After-Free Conditions:** Sending specific sequences of JSON data and triggering application logic that interacts with the parsed data in a way that exposes memory management flaws.
* **Likelihood:** Very Low - Requires finding subtle flaws in `simdjson`'s memory management or SIMD implementation.
* **Impact:** High - Can lead to application crashes and potentially remote code execution.
* **Effort:** Very High - Requires deep understanding of memory management and potentially assembly language/SIMD instruction sets.
* **Skill Level:** Very High.
* **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard - Often requires specialized memory debugging tools.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Memory Access Vulnerabilities for Information Disclosure](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_memory_access_vulnerabilities_for_information_disclosure.md)

**Objective:** Gain access to sensitive information residing in the memory used by the `simdjson` library.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Exploit Memory Access Vulnerabilities:**
        * **Read Sensitive Data from Parser's Memory:**
            * **Exploit Buffer Over-read:** Sending input that causes the parser to read beyond the allocated buffer, potentially exposing adjacent memory regions.
* **Likelihood:** Very Low - Relies on specific memory layout and the ability to trigger out-of-bounds reads.
* **Impact:** Medium to High - Can lead to the disclosure of sensitive data stored in memory.
* **Effort:** High - Requires a good understanding of memory management and potentially reverse engineering.

* **Effort:** High - Requires a deep understanding of `simdjson`'s internal memory management and buffer handling.
* **Skill Level:** High.
* **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard - Often requires memory analysis and is difficult to detect through standard logging.
