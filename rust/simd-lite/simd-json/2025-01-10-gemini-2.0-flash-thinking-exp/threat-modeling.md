# Threat Model Analysis for simd-lite/simd-json

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Large JSON Payload](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_large_json_payload.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends an extremely large JSON payload to the application. `simdjson` attempts to parse this large payload, consuming excessive CPU and memory resources, potentially leading to the application becoming unresponsive or crashing. The attacker might repeatedly send such payloads to keep the application in a DoS state.
    *   **Impact:** Application unavailability, service disruption for legitimate users, potential server overload, and increased infrastructure costs.
    *   **Affected Component:** Core parsing logic, memory allocation within `simdjson`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement a maximum size limit for incoming JSON payloads at the application level *before* passing it to `simdjson`.
        *   Implement request timeouts to prevent long-running parsing operations from tying up resources indefinitely.

## Threat: [Exploiting Bugs in SIMD Instruction Implementation](./threats/exploiting_bugs_in_simd_instruction_implementation.md)

*   **Description:** `simdjson` leverages SIMD instructions for performance. A subtle bug in the SIMD implementation for a specific CPU architecture or instruction set could be triggered by a carefully crafted JSON payload. This could lead to incorrect parsing, unexpected behavior, or potentially exploitable conditions within `simdjson` itself.
    *   **Impact:** Incorrect data processing by `simdjson`, potential for memory corruption within `simdjson` leading to application crashes or vulnerabilities.
    *   **Affected Component:** SIMD-specific code paths within `simdjson`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (can be critical depending on the nature of the bug, potentially leading to remote code execution if memory corruption is exploitable).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Stay updated with `simdjson` releases, as bug fixes in SIMD implementations are often addressed.
        *   Consider testing the application on various CPU architectures if possible.
        *   Report any suspected issues with specific JSON payloads and CPU architectures to the `simdjson` developers.
