## Attack Tree Path: [Attacker Goal: DoS or ACE via `simd-json` Exploit [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/attacker_goal_dos_or_ace_via__simd-json__exploit__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** The ultimate objective of the attacker is to either disrupt the service (DoS) or gain complete control (ACE) by targeting vulnerabilities within the `simd-json` library or its interaction with the application.
*   **Why Critical:** This is the top-level goal; preventing it is the core security objective.

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Denial of Service (DoS) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1__denial_of_service__dos___critical_.md)

*   **Description:** Attacks aimed at making the application unavailable to legitimate users. This is achieved by overwhelming the application or `simd-json` with malicious input, causing it to crash or become unresponsive.
*   **Why Critical:** DoS attacks directly impact the availability of the service, a fundamental security property.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2__arbitrary_code_execution__ace___critical_.md)

*   **Description:** The most severe outcome, where the attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary code on the system running the application. This grants the attacker full control.
*   **Why Critical:** ACE represents a complete compromise of the system's security.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Crafted Input Causing Excessive Memory Allocation [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_crafted_input_causing_excessive_memory_allocation__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** This category encompasses attacks that exploit the way `simd-json` (and the application) handles memory allocation when parsing JSON. The attacker crafts specific JSON input designed to consume excessive memory, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Why High Risk:** These attacks are relatively easy to execute and have a high probability of success if the application lacks proper input validation.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Extremely Deeply Nested JSON [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_extremely_deeply_nested_json__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker provides a JSON document with an extremely large number of nested arrays or objects (e.g., `[[[[...]]]]}`).  `simd-json` might use recursive functions or a stack to process these nested structures.  Excessive nesting can lead to a stack overflow or exhaust available memory.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High (DoS)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2 Extremely Large String/Number Values [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_extremely_large_stringnumber_values__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker includes very long strings or extremely large numerical values within the JSON (e.g., a string with millions of characters, or a number close to the maximum representable value).  Even with optimized parsing, these large values can consume significant memory during processing.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High (DoS)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.3 Large Number of Keys in an Object [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_3_large_number_of_keys_in_an_object__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker creates a JSON object with an exceptionally large number of keys (e.g., an object with tens of thousands of key-value pairs).  `simd-json` likely uses internal data structures (e.g., hash tables) to represent objects, and a huge number of keys can lead to excessive memory allocation for these structures.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High (DoS)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
