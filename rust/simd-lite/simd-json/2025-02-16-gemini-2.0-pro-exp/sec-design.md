Okay, let's create a design document for the `simd-json` project.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   High Performance: The primary goal is to provide extremely fast JSON parsing, significantly outperforming traditional parsers. This speed is crucial for applications processing large volumes of JSON data, such as data analytics, high-frequency trading, and real-time data streaming.
*   Efficiency: Minimize CPU cycles and memory usage during JSON parsing. This is important for resource-constrained environments and large-scale deployments where even small inefficiencies can accumulate.
*   Correctness: Ensure accurate and reliable parsing of JSON documents, adhering strictly to the JSON specification (RFC 8259).  Incorrect parsing can lead to data corruption, application errors, and security vulnerabilities.
*   Ease of Integration: Provide a simple and easy-to-use API for C++ developers, allowing seamless integration into existing projects.
*   Portability: Support a wide range of hardware architectures and operating systems, maximizing the reach and applicability of the library.
*   Open Source: Maintain an open-source codebase to foster community contributions, transparency, and trust.

Business Risks:

*   Performance Degradation: Any changes that negatively impact parsing speed could undermine the core value proposition of the library.
*   Compatibility Issues:  Changes that break compatibility with existing user code or supported platforms could lead to adoption barriers and user frustration.
*   Security Vulnerabilities:  Bugs in the parser could be exploited to cause denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, arbitrary code execution, or information disclosure.  This is a major concern given the library's focus on performance and low-level memory manipulation.
*   Maintainability:  The highly optimized nature of the code, using SIMD instructions and advanced C++, could make it difficult to maintain and extend.
*   Licensing Issues:  Incorrect handling of licensing or dependencies could lead to legal problems.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Fuzz Testing: The project uses extensive fuzz testing (OSS-Fuzz) to identify potential vulnerabilities and edge cases that could lead to crashes or security issues. (Found in the repository's fuzzing directory and continuous integration setup).
*   security control: Static Analysis: The project employs static analysis tools (like Coverity, clang-tidy) to detect potential bugs and security vulnerabilities during development. (Mentioned in documentation and CI configuration).
*   security control: Continuous Integration (CI):  Automated builds and tests are run on every commit to ensure code quality and prevent regressions. (GitHub Actions workflows).
*   security control: AddressSanitizer (ASan): Used during testing to detect memory errors like buffer overflows and use-after-free vulnerabilities. (Part of the CI configuration).
*   security control: MemorySanitizer (MSan): Used to detect use of uninitialized memory. (Part of CI).
*   security control: UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer (UBSan): Used to detect undefined behavior in C++. (Part of CI).
*   security control: Code Reviews: All changes are subject to code review by other developers. (Standard GitHub workflow).
*   security control: Adherence to JSON Specification: The parser is designed to strictly adhere to the RFC 8259 JSON specification, preventing common parsing errors.
*   security control: Input Validation: While the library's primary focus is parsing, it does perform validation to ensure the input conforms to the JSON grammar. This helps prevent many classes of injection attacks.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Complexity: The use of SIMD instructions and low-level optimizations inherently increases code complexity, making it potentially harder to audit and maintain. This risk is mitigated by extensive testing and code reviews.
*   accepted risk: Platform-Specific Code: The library uses platform-specific intrinsics (e.g., AVX2, NEON) for performance. This introduces a risk of potential issues on unsupported platforms or with specific compiler versions. This is mitigated by providing fallback mechanisms and thorough testing on various platforms.
*   accepted risk: Denial of Service (DoS): While fuzzing helps, there's always a residual risk that a specially crafted, extremely large or deeply nested JSON input could cause excessive resource consumption, leading to a denial-of-service. This is partially mitigated by design choices that aim to minimize memory allocation and processing overhead, but the risk is not entirely eliminated.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Regular Expression Hardening: If any regular expressions are used (even indirectly), ensure they are carefully reviewed and potentially hardened against ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) attacks.
*   security control: Memory Allocation Limits: Consider adding configurable limits on memory allocation to provide an additional layer of protection against DoS attacks that attempt to exhaust memory.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication: Not applicable (library, not a service).
*   Authorization: Not applicable (library, not a service).
*   Input Validation:
    *   The library *must* strictly adhere to the JSON specification (RFC 8259).
    *   The library *should* reject invalid JSON input with clear error messages.
    *   The library *should* handle potentially malicious input (e.g., deeply nested objects, extremely long strings) gracefully, without crashing or exhibiting undefined behavior.
*   Cryptography: Not directly applicable, but if the library ever handles encrypted JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) or similar formats, it should rely on established cryptographic libraries for the actual encryption/decryption and signature verification.
*   Memory Safety:
    *   The library *must* avoid buffer overflows, use-after-free errors, and other memory corruption vulnerabilities.
    *   The library *should* use memory sanitizers (ASan, MSan) during testing to detect memory errors.

## DEPLOYMENT

Deployment Solutions:

1.  **Static Linking:** The most common and recommended approach. The `simd-json` library is compiled directly into the user's application. This simplifies distribution and avoids dependency issues.
2.  **Dynamic Linking:** Less common, but possible. The `simd-json` library is compiled as a shared library (e.g., `.so` on Linux, `.dll` on Windows) and linked at runtime. This can reduce the size of the application executable but introduces dependency management complexities.
3.  **Header-Only Library:** `simd-json` is designed to be used as header only library.

Chosen Solution: Static Linking (most common and recommended)

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   **JSON Parsing:** The core functionality of the library. Any disruption or failure of this process would directly impact users.
*   **Data Integrity:** Ensuring that JSON data is parsed correctly and without modification.

Data Sensitivity:

*   The `simd-json` library itself does *not* handle specific data classifications. It parses *any* JSON data provided to it. The sensitivity of the data depends entirely on the *user application* and the *content* of the JSON being parsed.
*   The library *must* be designed to handle potentially sensitive data securely, without introducing vulnerabilities that could lead to data breaches. This means preventing buffer overflows, injection attacks, and other vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to access or modify the data being parsed.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS
