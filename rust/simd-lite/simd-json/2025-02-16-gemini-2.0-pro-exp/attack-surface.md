# Attack Surface Analysis for simd-lite/simd-json

## Attack Surface: [Parsing Logic Vulnerabilities (Buffer Overflows/Underflows, Logic Errors)](./attack_surfaces/parsing_logic_vulnerabilities__buffer_overflowsunderflows__logic_errors_.md)

*Description:* Undiscovered bugs in `simd-json`'s parsing logic, particularly in the SIMD-accelerated code, could lead to memory corruption (buffer overflows/underflows) or other logic errors. While unlikely due to extensive fuzzing, it's a non-zero risk. This is the most significant direct threat.
*simd-json Contribution:* The complexity of SIMD programming and the highly optimized nature of `simd-json` increase the (small) chance of subtle bugs that could be exploited. The core parsing routines are the primary area of concern.
*Example:* A highly specific, fuzzer-discovered input that triggers an out-of-bounds read or write due to an edge case in the SIMD parsing routines. This is difficult to predict without a specific vulnerability report. A hypothetical example might involve a malformed UTF-8 sequence combined with a specific number representation that triggers an incorrect offset calculation.
*Impact:* Potential for application crashes (segmentation faults), data corruption, and, in the worst (and highly unlikely) case, arbitrary code execution.
*Risk Severity:* Critical (if exploitable for code execution), High (for crashes/data corruption)
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Keep Updated:** Use the *latest* version of `simd-json`. Security vulnerabilities are often patched quickly. This is the *primary* mitigation.
    *   **Fuzz Testing (Integration):** While `simd-json` is heavily fuzzed by its developers, fuzz testing the *integration* of `simd-json` with *your* application can help uncover vulnerabilities specific to your usage patterns, or vulnerabilities that might be triggered by the interaction of `simd-json` with other parts of your system. This is a *supplementary* mitigation.
    *   **Memory Safety (If Possible):** If feasible (and this is a *general* security best practice, not specific to `simd-json`), consider using memory-safe languages (e.g., Rust) or memory safety tools (e.g., AddressSanitizer, Valgrind Memcheck) to help detect and prevent memory corruption issues during development and testing.
    *   **Code Audits:** If the application is *highly* security-sensitive (e.g., handling financial transactions, medical data), consider a professional code audit of the `simd-json` *integration* (and ideally, the relevant parts of `simd-json` itself, though this is less likely to be feasible).

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion (CPU/Memory) - Specifically Targeting `simd-json`'s Worst-Case Performance](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion__cpumemory__-_specifically_targeting__simd-json_'s_worst-case_performance.md)

*Description:* Attackers craft malicious, *but technically valid*, JSON inputs designed to trigger worst-case performance scenarios within `simd-json`'s optimized parsing routines, leading to excessive CPU or memory consumption and a Denial-of-Service (DoS). This differs from simple large inputs; it targets specific code paths.
*simd-json Contribution:* `simd-json`'s performance optimizations, while generally beneficial, can have specific input patterns that lead to significantly worse performance. The attacker aims to exploit these patterns.
*Example:*
    *   **Pathological Nesting:** A JSON document with an extremely large number of nested empty objects or arrays, specifically designed to stress `simd-json`'s handling of nested structures (e.g., `[[[[...{}...]]]]` with thousands of levels). This is *not* just deep nesting, but nesting crafted to hit specific code paths.
    *   **Pathological Number Representations:** Exploiting edge cases in the number parsing logic. For example, numbers with extremely long sequences of digits before or after the decimal point, numbers very close to the limits of representable floating-point values, or numbers with many leading zeros. The goal is to trigger slow code paths in the number parsing routines.
    *   **Pathological String/Key Lengths:** While `simd-json` has limits, an attacker might try to craft inputs with strings or keys that are *just below* the configured limits, but in a way that maximizes processing time (e.g., strings with many escaped characters or unusual Unicode sequences).
*Impact:* Application becomes unresponsive, potentially affecting other users or services. May lead to service outages. This is a DoS attack.
*Risk Severity:* High
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Configure Limits (Strictly):** Utilize `simd-json`'s built-in configuration options to set *strict* and *reasonable* limits on:
        *   Maximum document size.
        *   Maximum string length.
        *   Maximum nesting depth.
        *   Maximum number of keys/values.
        *   *These limits should be as low as possible while still allowing legitimate use cases.*
    *   **Input Size Validation (Pre-Parsing):** Implement application-level checks to reject excessively large JSON inputs *before* passing them to `simd-json`. This is a first line of defense.
    *   **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor CPU and memory usage of the application *specifically during JSON parsing*. Implement alerts and potentially automatic scaling (if applicable) to handle unexpected load.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Limit the rate at which clients can submit JSON data to prevent abuse. This is a general DoS mitigation, but it's particularly important here.
    * **Performance Profiling with Malicious Inputs:** Use performance profiling tools to analyze how `simd-json` behaves with various potentially malicious inputs. This can help identify specific code paths that are vulnerable to resource exhaustion and inform the setting of appropriate limits.
