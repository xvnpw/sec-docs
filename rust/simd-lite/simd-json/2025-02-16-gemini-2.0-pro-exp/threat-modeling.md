# Threat Model Analysis for simd-lite/simd-json

## Threat: [Threat: Crafted JSON for Integer Overflow in `parse_number`](./threats/threat_crafted_json_for_integer_overflow_in__parse_number_.md)

*   **Threat:** Crafted JSON for Integer Overflow in `parse_number`

    *   **Description:** An attacker provides a JSON document containing extremely large or small integer values (near the limits of `int64_t` or `uint64_t`) designed to trigger integer overflow/underflow within `simd-json`'s `parse_number` or related internal functions during the conversion from string to numeric types. The attacker exploits specific SIMD instructions or logic flaws in the integer parsing routines.
    *   **Impact:**  Incorrect parsing, unexpected behavior, and potentially (though less likely with careful usage) could contribute to memory corruption if the application doesn't handle the parsed values safely.
    *   **Affected Component:** `simd-json`'s number parsing logic, specifically functions related to integer parsing (e.g., `parse_number`, internal functions, SIMD-accelerated integer parsing routines).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (Potentially leading to incorrect parsing and, in rare cases and with improper handling in the application, could contribute to memory issues).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation (Pre-Parsing):** Validate numeric strings *before* `simd-json` to ensure they are within a safe range. Reject out-of-range numbers.
        *   **Range Checks (Post-Parsing):** After parsing, check if the resulting values are within expected bounds. Treat out-of-range values as errors.
        *   **Fuzz Testing:** Fuzz test `parse_number` with a wide range of integer values, including boundary conditions.
        *   **Safe Integer Libraries:** If the application requires very large numbers, use a "safe integer" library *after* parsing with `simd-json`.

## Threat: [Threat:  DoS via Excessive String Escapes in `parse_string`](./threats/threat__dos_via_excessive_string_escapes_in__parse_string_.md)

*   **Threat:**  DoS via Excessive String Escapes in `parse_string`

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts JSON with strings containing an excessive number of escape sequences (e.g., `\uXXXX`, `\\`, `\"`). This forces `simd-json`'s `parse_string` and its escape sequence handling (including SIMD-accelerated routines) to consume excessive CPU time and potentially memory. The attacker exploits the performance characteristics of the SIMD string processing.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to high CPU usage and potentially memory exhaustion.
    *   **Affected Component:** `simd-json`'s string parsing logic, specifically `parse_string` and its escape sequence handling, including SIMD-accelerated string processing.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (DoS is a likely outcome).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation (Pre-Parsing):** Limit the number of escape sequences allowed within a string *before* `simd-json`.
        *   **String Length Limits:** Enforce strict limits on string length *before* parsing.
        *   **Resource Limits:** Enforce CPU time and memory limits on the parsing process.
        *   **Fuzz Testing:** Fuzz test `parse_string` with various combinations and quantities of escape sequences.

## Threat: [Threat:  Buffer Overflow in UTF-8 Validation (`validate_utf8`)](./threats/threat__buffer_overflow_in_utf-8_validation___validate_utf8__.md)

*   **Threat:**  Buffer Overflow in UTF-8 Validation (`validate_utf8`)

    *   **Description:** An attacker provides JSON with invalid UTF-8 sequences. A bug in `simd-json`'s `validate_utf8` (or related internal functions, including SIMD-accelerated UTF-8 processing) could lead to a buffer overflow/underflow. The attacker crafts specific byte sequences to exploit a hypothetical vulnerability in the SIMD-accelerated UTF-8 validation.
    *   **Impact:**  Potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE) if a buffer overflow can be exploited.
    *   **Affected Component:** `simd-json`'s UTF-8 validation logic, specifically `validate_utf8` and related SIMD-accelerated UTF-8 processing routines.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (RCE is a potential, though unlikely, outcome).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep `simd-json` updated to the latest version.
        *   **Fuzz Testing:** Extensively fuzz test `validate_utf8` with valid and *invalid* UTF-8 sequences, including edge cases.
        *   **Memory Safety Tools:** Use memory safety tools (e.g., AddressSanitizer, Valgrind) during development and testing.
        *   **Independent UTF-8 Validation (Pre-Parsing):** Use a separate, well-vetted UTF-8 validation library *before* `simd-json` for redundancy.
