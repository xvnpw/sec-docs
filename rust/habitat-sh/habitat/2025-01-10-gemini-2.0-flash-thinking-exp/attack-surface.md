# Attack Surface Analysis for habitat-sh/habitat

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Habitat Supervisor API](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_habitat_supervisor_api.md)

*   **Description:** The Habitat Supervisor exposes an HTTP API for management and control of services. If this API is not properly secured, it can be accessed by unauthorized parties.
    *   **How Habitat Contributes:** Habitat's design includes this API for runtime management, making its accessibility a potential attack vector. By default, it might not have strong authentication or authorization enabled.
    *   **Example:** An attacker on the network could send API requests to a Supervisor to stop a critical service, retrieve sensitive configuration data, or even execute commands within the Supervisor's context if authentication is weak or absent.
    *   **Impact:** Service disruption, data breach, potential for remote code execution on the host.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable authentication and authorization for the Supervisor API.
        *   Restrict network access to the Supervisor API to trusted sources (e.g., using firewalls or network segmentation).
        *   Regularly review and update API access credentials.
        *   Consider using TLS/SSL to encrypt communication with the API.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in the Habitat Gossip Protocol](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_the_habitat_gossip_protocol.md)

*   **Description:** Habitat Supervisors communicate using a gossip protocol for service discovery and coordination. Flaws in the implementation or configuration of this protocol can be exploited.
    *   **How Habitat Contributes:** Habitat relies on this gossip protocol for its core functionality of service orchestration and discovery.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could inject malicious gossip messages into the network, potentially poisoning service discovery information, leading to services connecting to malicious endpoints, or causing denial of service by overwhelming the gossip network.
    *   **Impact:** Service disruption, man-in-the-middle attacks, potential for redirection of traffic to malicious services.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable secure gossip if available in the Habitat version being used (e.g., using encryption and authentication for gossip messages).
        *   Isolate the Habitat network to minimize exposure to untrusted networks.
        *   Monitor gossip traffic for anomalies and suspicious activity.
        *   Keep Habitat Supervisor versions up to date to patch known vulnerabilities in the gossip protocol.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Habitat Builder and Package Supply Chain](./attack_surfaces/compromised_habitat_builder_and_package_supply_chain.md)

*   **Description:** The Habitat Builder is responsible for building and managing application packages. If the Builder or the package build process is compromised, malicious code can be introduced into the packages.
    *   **How Habitat Contributes:** Habitat's package management system relies on the Builder as a central point for creating and distributing application artifacts.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could gain access to the Builder and inject malicious code into a popular package, which would then be deployed to numerous environments, executing the malicious code.
    *   **Impact:** Widespread compromise of applications using the malicious package, data breaches, potential for persistent access to infrastructure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the Habitat Builder infrastructure with strong access controls and regular security audits.
        *   Implement package signing and verification to ensure the integrity and authenticity of packages.
        *   Use trusted and verified sources for Habitat packages.
        *   Regularly scan built packages for vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement controls to prevent unauthorized modifications to the build process.

## Attack Surface: [Exploitation of Habitat Hook Scripts](./attack_surfaces/exploitation_of_habitat_hook_scripts.md)

*   **Description:** Habitat allows defining hook scripts that execute at various stages of a service's lifecycle. If these scripts are not carefully written and validated, they can be exploited.
    *   **How Habitat Contributes:** Habitat's lifecycle management features rely on these hook scripts for customization and automation.
    *   **Example:** A poorly written hook script might execute external commands without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious commands and gain remote code execution on the Supervisor or the container.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, privilege escalation, resource exhaustion.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and validate all hook scripts for potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Avoid executing external commands within hook scripts if possible, or sanitize inputs rigorously.
        *   Run hook scripts with the least necessary privileges.
        *   Implement monitoring and logging for hook script execution.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Template Injection in Habitat Templates](./attack_surfaces/server-side_template_injection_in_habitat_templates.md)

*   **Description:** Habitat uses templates for dynamic configuration. If template rendering is not handled securely, attackers can inject malicious code into templates.
    *   **How Habitat Contributes:** Habitat's configuration management features utilize templates to customize application behavior at runtime.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could manipulate template data or configuration sources to inject malicious code that gets executed during template rendering, potentially leading to remote code execution on the Supervisor or within the application context.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize and validate all data used in templates.
        *   Use a templating engine that is known to be secure and keep it updated.
        *   Restrict access to template files and configuration sources.
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) where applicable to limit the impact of successful injections.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Handling of Secrets in Habitat](./attack_surfaces/insecure_handling_of_secrets_in_habitat.md)

*   **Description:** Habitat provides mechanisms for managing secrets. If these mechanisms are not used correctly or have vulnerabilities, secrets can be exposed.
    *   **How Habitat Contributes:** Habitat offers features for managing sensitive data, making its secure implementation crucial.
    *   **Example:** Secrets might be stored in plain text in configuration files or environment variables managed by Habitat, or access controls to the secrets store might be insufficient, allowing unauthorized access.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, API keys, or other confidential information, leading to further compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize Habitat's built-in secrets management features securely.
        *   Encrypt secrets at rest and in transit.
        *   Implement strict access controls to the secrets store.
        *   Avoid storing secrets directly in configuration files or environment variables.
        *   Regularly rotate secrets.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Habitat CLI Credentials or Access](./attack_surfaces/compromised_habitat_cli_credentials_or_access.md)

*   **Description:** The Habitat CLI is used to interact with the Habitat ecosystem. If the credentials used by the CLI are compromised or access is not properly controlled, attackers can perform unauthorized actions.
    *   **How Habitat Contributes:** Habitat provides the CLI as the primary interface for developers and operators to manage the platform.
    *   **Example:** An attacker with compromised CLI credentials could deploy malicious packages, manipulate running services, or access sensitive information from the Builder or Supervisors.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized deployment of malicious code, service disruption, data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the machines where the Habitat CLI is used.
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing Habitat components via the CLI.
        *   Use short-lived credentials or tokens for CLI access.
        *   Regularly review and revoke unnecessary CLI access.
