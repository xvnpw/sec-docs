# Threat Model Analysis for habitat-sh/habitat

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attacks via Compromised Dependencies](./threats/supply_chain_attacks_via_compromised_dependencies.md)

**Description:** An attacker compromises an upstream dependency used in the Habitat package build process. When the Habitat package is built, this malicious dependency is included.

**Impact:** Introduction of vulnerabilities or malicious code directly into the application, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, or system compromise at runtime.

**Affected Component:** Habitat Builder (during `pkg build`), Package Management.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Utilize Habitat's origin keying and signing to verify the integrity and authenticity of packages from Builder.
* Implement dependency scanning and vulnerability analysis tools within the build pipeline.
* Carefully vet and control access to the Builder environment and the sources of dependencies.

## Threat: [Malicious Code Injection During Package Build](./threats/malicious_code_injection_during_package_build.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the build environment or the Habitat plan files and injects malicious code directly into the application artifacts or build scripts.

**Impact:** Compromised application functionality, data breaches, or the introduction of backdoors into the deployed application.

**Affected Component:** Habitat Builder, Habitat Plan files, Build scripts.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Secure the build environment with strong access controls and regular security audits.
* Implement code review processes for Habitat plan files and build scripts.
* Utilize immutable build infrastructure.

## Threat: [Tampered Habitat Packages](./threats/tampered_habitat_packages.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts and modifies a Habitat package (`.hart` file) after it has been built but before it is deployed.

**Impact:** Deployment of a compromised application, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, or system compromise.

**Affected Component:** Habitat Package Management, Package Storage/Distribution.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Utilize Habitat's package signing and verification features.
* Ensure secure channels for package transfer.
* Implement secure storage for Habitat packages.

## Threat: [Supervisor Vulnerabilities Leading to Host Compromise](./threats/supervisor_vulnerabilities_leading_to_host_compromise.md)

**Description:** A security vulnerability exists in the Habitat Supervisor itself. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access or execute code on the host system running the Supervisor.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the host system where the Supervisor is running.

**Affected Component:** Habitat Supervisor.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep the Habitat Supervisor updated to the latest stable version.
* Monitor for security advisories related to Habitat.
* Implement security hardening measures on the host operating system.

## Threat: [Service Group Membership Manipulation](./threats/service_group_membership_manipulation.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized control over the Habitat ring and manipulates service group membership.

**Impact:** Denial of service, unauthorized access to inter-service communication, or disruption of application logic.

**Affected Component:** Habitat Supervisor, Habitat Ring (gossip protocol).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Secure the Habitat ring with authentication and encryption.
* Implement strong access controls for managing service group membership.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation within the Supervisor](./threats/privilege_escalation_within_the_supervisor.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability within the Habitat Supervisor or a misconfiguration to gain elevated privileges within the Supervisor's context.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive information, control over other services within the Supervisor, or potential for further system compromise.

**Affected Component:** Habitat Supervisor (authorization and privilege management).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Follow Habitat's best practices for running services with minimal privileges.
* Regularly review and audit Supervisor configurations and service definitions.

## Threat: [Insecure Secrets Management within Habitat](./threats/insecure_secrets_management_within_habitat.md)

**Description:** Sensitive information is stored insecurely within Habitat configurations, plan files, or environment variables managed by Habitat.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, leading to unauthorized access to external systems or further compromise.

**Affected Component:** Habitat Supervisor (secrets management), Habitat Configuration.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Utilize Habitat's secrets management features securely.
* Avoid storing secrets directly in plan files or configuration.
* Integrate with external secrets management providers.

## Threat: [Compromised Operator Credentials](./threats/compromised_operator_credentials.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to the credentials of a Habitat operator account.

**Impact:** Unauthorized control over the Habitat environment, potentially leading to the deployment of malicious packages, modification of configurations, or disruption of services.

**Affected Component:** Habitat CLI, Habitat API (authentication).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enforce strong password policies for operator accounts.
* Implement multi-factor authentication for operator logins.
* Regularly review and audit operator access and permissions.

## Threat: [Insecure Access to Habitat API or CLI](./threats/insecure_access_to_habitat_api_or_cli.md)

**Description:** Access to the Habitat API or command-line interface is not properly secured, allowing unauthorized individuals or systems to interact with and manage the Habitat environment.

**Impact:** Manipulation or disruption of the application and its environment.

**Affected Component:** Habitat CLI, Habitat API (authentication and authorization).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Secure access to the Habitat API and CLI using strong authentication mechanisms.
* Implement authorization controls to restrict actions based on user roles or permissions.
