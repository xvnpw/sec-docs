# Attack Tree Analysis for habitat-sh/habitat

Objective: Gain unauthorized control or access to the application or its underlying resources by leveraging vulnerabilities or misconfigurations within the Habitat environment.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
*   Compromise Habitat Application (CRITICAL NODE)
    *   Exploit Habitat Package Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)
        *   Inject Malicious Code into Package (HIGH-RISK PATH STARTS HERE)
            *   Exploit Build Process Weakness
                *   Compromise Builder Service (CRITICAL NODE)
        *   Supply Chain Attack (HIGH-RISK PATH STARTS HERE)
            *   Compromise Package Registry (CRITICAL NODE)
        *   Exploit Known Package Vulnerability (HIGH-RISK PATH)
    *   Exploit Habitat Supervisor Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)
        *   Exploit Supervisor API Vulnerability (HIGH-RISK PATH STARTS HERE)
        *   Exploit Supervisor Configuration (HIGH-RISK PATH STARTS HERE)
```


## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code into Package](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_into_package.md)

*   **Exploit Build Process Weakness -> Compromise Builder Service:** Attackers target vulnerabilities in the build process or the Builder service itself to inject malicious code into packages during the build phase. This allows them to deploy compromised applications from the outset.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Chain Attack](./attack_tree_paths/supply_chain_attack.md)

*   **Compromise Upstream Dependency:** Attackers compromise a dependency used by the Habitat package. This malicious dependency is then included in the built package, injecting the vulnerability indirectly.
    *   **Compromise Package Registry:** Attackers directly compromise the package registry, allowing them to replace legitimate packages with malicious ones. This is a highly impactful attack as it can affect many users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Package Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_package_vulnerability.md)

Attackers leverage publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in the software packaged by Habitat. This is a high-likelihood path if patching is not diligently performed. Readily available exploits can make this a low-effort attack.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Supervisor API Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_supervisor_api_vulnerability.md)

Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the Supervisor's API to gain unauthorized access or inject malicious data. This can allow them to control running services, access sensitive information, or disrupt operations. This is particularly high-risk if default credentials are used or authentication is weak.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Supervisor Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_supervisor_configuration.md)

Attackers manipulate the Supervisor's configuration to gain unauthorized access or control. This often involves exploiting default or weak credentials or gaining access to configuration files. This path is high-risk due to the potential for easily exploitable misconfigurations.
