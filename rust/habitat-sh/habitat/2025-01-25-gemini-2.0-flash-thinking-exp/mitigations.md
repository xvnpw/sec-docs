# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for habitat-sh/habitat

## Mitigation Strategy: [Run Supervisors with Least Privilege](./mitigation_strategies/run_supervisors_with_least_privilege.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Create a dedicated user account (e.g., `hab`) on the system where the Habitat Supervisor will run. This user should *not* be root or an administrator.
    2.  Configure the Habitat Supervisor to run under this dedicated user account. This is typically achieved during Supervisor installation or through systemd service configuration if using systemd.
    3.  Ensure this dedicated user account only possesses the minimal permissions necessary for Supervisor operation. This includes:
        *   Read and execute permissions for Habitat binaries and libraries (usually within `/hab`).
        *   Read access to service packages and plan files (typically in `/hab/pkgs` and `/hab/plans`).
        *   Write access to designated data directories for service data and Supervisor state (configurable via Supervisor flags, default is often within `/hab/svc`).
        *   Network binding permissions for necessary ports (configurable in service topology and Supervisor flags).
    4.  Avoid granting the Supervisor user unnecessary Linux capabilities or elevated privileges.  Capabilities like `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` should be strictly avoided unless absolutely necessary and carefully justified.
    5.  When deploying Supervisors in containerized environments (like Docker or Kubernetes), configure the container runtime to execute the Supervisor process as a non-root user *inside* the container. Utilize security context settings in Kubernetes or Docker's `--user` flag to achieve this.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Privilege Escalation via Supervisor Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** If a security vulnerability is discovered within the Habitat Supervisor itself, running it as root would allow an attacker to gain full control of the host system. Least privilege confines the impact of such exploits.
        *   **Service Compromise Leading to Host Compromise (High Severity):** If a service managed by the Supervisor is compromised and the Supervisor runs as root, the attacker could potentially leverage the Supervisor's privileges to escalate to the host system. Least privilege limits this potential escalation path.
        *   **Lateral Movement after Supervisor Compromise (Medium Severity):**  In the event of a Supervisor compromise, reduced privileges restrict the attacker's ability to move laterally to other parts of the system or network.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Privilege Escalation via Supervisor Vulnerabilities:** High Impact Reduction. Significantly reduces the potential damage from vulnerabilities in the Supervisor itself.
        *   **Service Compromise Leading to Host Compromise:** High Impact Reduction. Prevents a compromised service from easily escalating to host-level compromise through the Supervisor.
        *   **Lateral Movement after Supervisor Compromise:** Medium Impact Reduction. Limits the attacker's initial foothold and potential for further malicious activity.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Partially implemented. Production Supervisors are generally configured to run as a non-root `hab` user. This is part of our standard deployment procedures and Habitat best practices.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Enforcement is not always consistent across all environments (development, staging). Developers may sometimes run Supervisors as root locally for convenience, bypassing security best practices.
        *   Further restriction of Linux capabilities for the Supervisor user could be explored for enhanced security hardening.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Always Verify Package Origins](./mitigation_strategies/always_verify_package_origins.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Enable Habitat origin verification within the Supervisor configuration. This is typically done by ensuring the `HAB_ORIGIN_KEYS` environment variable or the `--origin-key` Supervisor flag is set and configured correctly.
    2.  Strictly manage Habitat origin keys. Generate strong, unique origin keys for each trusted origin within your organization.
    3.  Securely store the private origin keys. Employ hardware security modules (HSMs), dedicated secrets vaults, or tightly controlled access to key storage locations to protect private keys.
    4.  Distribute the *public* origin keys to all Supervisors that will be running services from that origin. Public keys are used by Supervisors to verify package signatures.
    5.  During the Habitat package build process, *always* sign packages using the corresponding private origin key before uploading them to a Habitat Builder or any package repository.
    6.  Configure Supervisors to *strictly* enforce origin verification.  Supervisors should be configured to *reject* and refuse to load any package that is not signed by a trusted origin or whose signature cannot be verified.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Supply Chain Attacks via Package Tampering (High Severity):** Prevents the deployment of compromised or malicious Habitat packages that may have been tampered with during transit or storage. Attackers could inject backdoors or malware into packages if origin verification is not enforced.
        *   **Package Spoofing and Impersonation (Medium Severity):** Prevents attackers from distributing fake or malicious packages under the guise of a trusted origin. Origin verification ensures package authenticity and provenance.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Supply Chain Attacks via Package Tampering:** High Impact Reduction. Provides a robust defense against supply chain attacks targeting Habitat packages by ensuring package integrity and authenticity.
        *   **Package Spoofing and Impersonation:** Medium Impact Reduction. Effectively prevents the deployment of spoofed packages, maintaining trust in the package source.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Implemented in production and staging environments. Origin verification is enabled, and Supervisors are configured to validate package signatures. Origin keys are managed using a secure key management system.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Enforcement in development environments can be inconsistent. Developers may sometimes disable origin verification locally for faster iteration, which can create security practice gaps.
        *   Automated key rotation for origin keys is not fully implemented. While we have procedures for key rotation, automating this process would improve security and reduce manual effort.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Secrets Management using Habitat Secrets Subsystem](./mitigation_strategies/secure_secrets_management_using_habitat_secrets_subsystem.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  *Never* hardcode sensitive secrets (passwords, API keys, database credentials, certificates, etc.) directly into Habitat package plan files, configuration templates, or service code. This is a critical security vulnerability.
    2.  Utilize Habitat's built-in secrets subsystem to manage sensitive information securely. This subsystem is designed to handle secrets separately from configuration and code.
    3.  Choose a secure secrets backend for Habitat. Habitat supports various backends, including file-based vaults (for development/testing) and more robust solutions like HashiCorp Vault or cloud provider secret management services (for production). Configure the Supervisor to connect to your chosen secrets backend.
    4.  Define secrets within Habitat plans using the `secrets` block in the `plan.sh` file. This declares the secrets that a service requires.
    5.  Access secrets within service configuration templates (e.g., `.toml` files) using the `{{secret "secret_name"}}` Handlebars helper function. At runtime, the Supervisor will retrieve the secret from the configured backend and inject it into the rendered configuration.
    6.  Implement strict access control to the secrets backend itself. Only authorized Supervisors and administrators should have permissions to manage and retrieve secrets from the vault.
    7.  Ensure secrets are encrypted both at rest within the secrets vault and in transit between the vault and the Supervisors. The specific encryption mechanisms depend on the chosen secrets backend.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Exposure of Secrets in Configuration Files (High Severity):** Prevents the accidental or intentional exposure of secrets by embedding them in configuration files that might be stored in version control, package repositories, or logs. Hardcoded secrets are easily discovered by attackers.
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Secrets (Medium Severity):** Habitat's secrets subsystem, when properly configured with a secure backend and access controls, significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive secrets compared to insecure storage methods.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Exposure of Secrets in Configuration Files:** High Impact Reduction. Eliminates the primary risk of exposing secrets through insecure configuration practices.
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Secrets:** Medium Impact Reduction. Substantially reduces the risk of unauthorized secret access by centralizing and securing secret management.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Implemented in production and staging environments. We utilize HashiCorp Vault as our secrets backend for Habitat. Services are configured to retrieve secrets from Vault through the Habitat Supervisor's secrets subsystem.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Not consistently adopted across all services. Some legacy services might still rely on less secure methods like environment variables or configuration files for secret management. Migration of all services to the Habitat secrets subsystem is needed.
        *   Automated secret rotation policies are not fully implemented. While we have manual procedures for rotating secrets, automating this process would enhance security and reduce operational burden.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Mutual TLS (mTLS) for Habitat Service-to-Service Communication](./mitigation_strategies/implement_mutual_tls__mtls__for_habitat_service-to-service_communication.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Leverage Habitat's service topology and configuration management capabilities to facilitate the implementation of mutual TLS (mTLS) for secure inter-service communication.
    2.  Configure services to use TLS for communication. This encrypts network traffic, protecting against eavesdropping. Habitat's configuration templating can be used to manage TLS settings consistently across services.
    3.  Enable mutual TLS (mTLS). In mTLS, both the client and the server authenticate each other using X.509 certificates. This provides strong mutual authentication.
    4.  Utilize Habitat to distribute TLS certificates to each service instance. Habitat packages can include certificate generation scripts or integrate with certificate management systems to provision certificates.
    5.  Configure services (using Habitat configuration templates) to present their certificates during TLS handshakes and to verify the certificates presented by connecting services.
    6.  Enforce mTLS at the application level within services or, for more complex deployments, consider integrating Habitat with a service mesh that can handle mTLS enforcement transparently.
    7.  Establish a process for regular rotation of TLS certificates. Habitat's update strategies and configuration management can be used to automate certificate rotation and distribution.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Eavesdropping on Inter-Service Communication (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from intercepting and reading sensitive data exchanged between Habitat services. TLS encryption protects data in transit.
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Service Communication (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from intercepting and manipulating communication between services. mTLS ensures both communicating parties are strongly authenticated, mitigating MITM risks.
        *   **Service Impersonation and Unauthorized Service Access (Medium Severity):** mTLS helps prevent service impersonation by verifying the identity of services through certificate validation. It also restricts service access to only mutually authenticated and authorized services.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Eavesdropping on Inter-Service Communication:** High Impact Reduction. Encrypts communication, rendering eavesdropping ineffective.
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Service Communication:** High Impact Reduction. Provides strong mutual authentication and encryption, effectively mitigating MITM attacks.
        *   **Service Impersonation and Unauthorized Service Access:** Medium Impact Reduction. Makes service impersonation significantly more difficult and enforces authorized service communication.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Partially implemented. mTLS is implemented for critical inter-service communication paths in production environments, particularly where sensitive data is exchanged. Habitat's configuration management is used to manage TLS settings for these services.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   mTLS is not consistently implemented across *all* inter-service communication within our Habitat deployments. Expanding mTLS coverage to all internal service interactions would significantly enhance overall security.
        *   Automated certificate management and rotation specifically for mTLS within Habitat services is not fully automated. We rely on manual scripting and procedures, which are less efficient and more prone to errors than a fully automated system.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Supervisor Hardening](./mitigation_strategies/supervisor_hardening.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Run Supervisors with Least Privilege:** (Covered in detail in a separate mitigation strategy above). This is a fundamental hardening step.
    2.  **Disable Unnecessary Supervisor Features:** Review the Supervisor configuration and disable any features that are not required for your specific deployment. For example, if you are not using the Supervisor HTTP API for management, disable it in the `supervisor.toml` configuration file.
    3.  **Secure Supervisor Configuration:** Carefully review and harden the Supervisor configuration file (`supervisor.toml`). Pay close attention to settings related to:
        *   `listen_addr` and `http_listen_addr`: Restrict listening interfaces to specific networks or localhost if external access is not needed.
        *   `auto_update_strategy`: Carefully consider the auto-update strategy and ensure it aligns with your security and stability requirements. For critical production systems, manual or staged updates might be preferred over automatic updates.
        *   `gossip`: If using gossip, ensure it is configured securely and consider encryption if sensitive information is exchanged via gossip.
    4.  **Regularly Update Supervisors:** Keep Supervisors updated to the latest stable versions released by the Habitat project. These updates often include security patches and bug fixes. Implement a process for timely patching and testing of Supervisor updates.
    5.  **Implement Network Segmentation:** Isolate Supervisors within dedicated network segments. Limit network access to Supervisors to only necessary services and authorized administrators. Use firewalls and network policies to enforce network segmentation.
    6.  **Monitor Supervisor Logs and Metrics:** Implement robust logging and monitoring for Supervisors. Analyze Supervisor logs for suspicious activity, errors, and security-related events. Monitor key Supervisor metrics (CPU usage, memory consumption, network traffic) to detect anomalies that might indicate compromise or misconfiguration.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Supervisor Vulnerabilities Exploitation (High Severity):** Hardening reduces the attack surface of the Supervisor and mitigates the risk of exploiting vulnerabilities in the Supervisor software itself.
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Supervisor Control (Medium Severity):** Hardening access controls and disabling unnecessary features limits the avenues for unauthorized access to Supervisor management and control functions.
        *   **Denial of Service against Supervisors (Medium Severity):** Resource limits and configuration hardening can help protect Supervisors from denial-of-service attacks.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Supervisor Vulnerabilities Exploitation:** High Impact Reduction. Reduces the likelihood and impact of successful exploitation of Supervisor vulnerabilities.
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Supervisor Control:** Medium Impact Reduction. Makes it more difficult for unauthorized parties to gain control of Supervisors.
        *   **Denial of Service against Supervisors:** Medium Impact Reduction. Improves Supervisor resilience against DoS attacks.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Partially implemented. We have standard procedures for deploying Supervisors with non-default configurations that disable the HTTP API and restrict listening interfaces in production. Regular Supervisor updates are part of our maintenance schedule.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Configuration hardening is not fully automated and consistently applied across all environments. We could benefit from more automated configuration management for Supervisors.
        *   Monitoring of Supervisor-specific metrics and logs for security events could be improved and integrated into our central security monitoring system.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Supervisor Access Control](./mitigation_strategies/supervisor_access_control.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Restrict Access to Supervisor Control Ports:** Limit network access to Supervisor control ports (e.g., gossip port, HTTP API port if enabled). Use firewalls, network access control lists (ACLs), or security groups to restrict access to only authorized systems and administrators.
    2.  **Disable the HTTP API if Unnecessary:** If the Supervisor HTTP API is not required for management or monitoring in your deployment, disable it entirely in the `supervisor.toml` configuration. This significantly reduces the attack surface.
    3.  **Implement Authentication and Authorization for Supervisor APIs (if enabled):** If the HTTP API is enabled, enforce strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.
        *   Use API keys or tokens for authentication.
        *   Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to specific API endpoints based on user roles.
        *   Consider using TLS client certificates for mutual authentication.
    4.  **Secure Gossip Protocol (if used):** If the gossip protocol is used for Supervisor communication, ensure it is configured securely.
        *   Restrict gossip network access to only trusted Supervisors within the Habitat ring.
        *   Consider using encryption for gossip traffic if sensitive information is exchanged via gossip.
    5.  **Audit Supervisor API Access:** Log and audit all access attempts to Supervisor APIs, including successful and failed authentication attempts, and API endpoint access.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Supervisor Management (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized users or systems from gaining control of Supervisors and potentially manipulating services or the Habitat environment.
        *   **Data Exfiltration via Supervisor APIs (Medium Severity):** If Supervisor APIs are not properly secured, attackers could potentially use them to exfiltrate sensitive information about services or the system.
        *   **Denial of Service via API Abuse (Medium Severity):** Unprotected Supervisor APIs could be abused to launch denial-of-service attacks against Supervisors.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Supervisor Management:** High Impact Reduction. Significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized control over Supervisors.
        *   **Data Exfiltration via Supervisor APIs:** Medium Impact Reduction. Limits the potential for data leakage through Supervisor APIs.
        *   **Denial of Service via API Abuse:** Medium Impact Reduction. Improves Supervisor resilience against API-based DoS attacks.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Partially implemented. Access to Supervisor control ports is restricted via firewalls in production environments. The HTTP API is disabled in many production deployments.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Authentication and authorization for the HTTP API (when enabled) are not consistently enforced. We should implement API key-based authentication or RBAC for the HTTP API.
        *   Auditing of Supervisor API access is not fully implemented. We need to enhance logging and monitoring to include detailed audit trails of API access attempts.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Builder Security](./mitigation_strategies/builder_security.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use a Private Builder:**  For sensitive applications and environments, utilize a private Habitat Builder instance under your direct control instead of relying solely on the public Habitat Builder. This provides greater control over the build environment and reduces reliance on external infrastructure.
    2.  **Secure Builder Infrastructure:** Harden the infrastructure hosting your private Builder instance. Apply security best practices to the operating system, network, and applications running on the Builder server. This includes:
        *   Regularly patching the Builder server operating system and software.
        *   Implementing strong firewall rules to restrict network access to the Builder.
        *   Using intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS).
        *   Regularly scanning the Builder server for vulnerabilities.
    3.  **Regularly Update Builder:** Keep your private Builder instance updated to the latest stable version released by the Habitat project. Builder updates often include security patches and feature improvements.
    4.  **Implement Access Control for Builder:** Restrict access to your Builder instance to authorized users and systems.
        *   Enforce strong authentication (e.g., multi-factor authentication) for Builder user accounts.
        *   Implement role-based access control (RBAC) within the Builder to control user permissions for package management, origin management, and other Builder functionalities.
    5.  **Secure Builder Storage:** Secure the storage backend used by the Builder to store packages and metadata. Ensure proper access controls and encryption for stored data.
    6.  **Audit Builder Activity:** Implement comprehensive logging and auditing of Builder activity. Track user actions, package builds, origin management operations, and any security-related events.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Compromise of Builder Infrastructure (High Severity):** If the Builder infrastructure is compromised, attackers could potentially inject malicious code into packages, tamper with origin keys, or gain access to sensitive information.
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Builder (Medium Severity):** Unauthorized access to the Builder could allow attackers to manipulate packages, origins, or Builder settings, leading to supply chain attacks or service disruptions.
        *   **Data Breach via Builder (Medium Severity):** If Builder storage is not properly secured, attackers could potentially gain access to sensitive data stored within the Builder, such as package metadata or origin keys (if improperly stored).

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Compromise of Builder Infrastructure:** High Impact Reduction. Securing the Builder infrastructure significantly reduces the risk of a Builder compromise leading to widespread supply chain attacks.
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Builder:** Medium Impact Reduction. Access control prevents unauthorized manipulation of the Builder and its resources.
        *   **Data Breach via Builder:** Medium Impact Reduction. Secure storage and access controls minimize the risk of data breaches through the Builder.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Partially implemented. We utilize a private Habitat Builder instance for production package builds. Basic security hardening is applied to the Builder server infrastructure. Access control is in place, but primarily based on user accounts.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   RBAC within the Builder is not fully implemented. We should enhance Builder access control with more granular role-based permissions.
        *   Comprehensive auditing of Builder activity is not fully implemented. We need to improve logging and auditing to track all relevant Builder operations for security monitoring and incident response.
        *   Builder storage security could be further enhanced with encryption at rest and more robust access control mechanisms.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Harden Control Plane Components (Builder, etc.)](./mitigation_strategies/harden_control_plane_components__builder__etc__.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Apply Security Best Practices to Control Plane Infrastructure:** Harden the operating systems, networks, and underlying infrastructure hosting Habitat control plane components like the Builder, Habitat Operator (if used), and any supporting services (databases, message queues, etc.). This includes:
        *   Regular patching and updates.
        *   Strong firewall configurations.
        *   Intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS).
        *   Vulnerability scanning.
        *   Secure configuration of operating systems and applications.
    2.  **Regularly Update Control Plane Components:** Keep all Habitat control plane components updated to the latest stable versions released by the Habitat project. These updates often contain security patches and bug fixes.
    3.  **Implement Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS):** Deploy IDPS solutions to monitor control plane infrastructure for malicious activity, suspicious network traffic, and potential security breaches.
    4.  **Secure Communication Channels:** Ensure that communication channels between control plane components and between control plane components and Supervisors are secured using TLS encryption and mutual authentication where appropriate.
    5.  **Resource Limits and Quotas:** Implement resource limits and quotas for control plane components to prevent resource exhaustion and denial-of-service attacks.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Compromise of Control Plane Infrastructure (High Severity):** If control plane components are compromised, attackers could gain broad control over the Habitat environment, potentially leading to supply chain attacks, service disruptions, and data breaches.
        *   **Denial of Service against Control Plane (Medium Severity):** DoS attacks against control plane components could disrupt Habitat operations, package builds, and service deployments.
        *   **Data Breach via Control Plane (Medium Severity):** If control plane components store or process sensitive data (e.g., origin keys, package metadata), vulnerabilities in these components could lead to data breaches.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Compromise of Control Plane Infrastructure:** High Impact Reduction. Hardening control plane components significantly reduces the risk of a widespread compromise of the Habitat environment.
        *   **Denial of Service against Control Plane:** Medium Impact Reduction. Improves the resilience of the control plane against DoS attacks.
        *   **Data Breach via Control Plane:** Medium Impact Reduction. Minimizes the risk of data breaches through vulnerabilities in control plane components.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Partially implemented. Basic security hardening is applied to our private Builder infrastructure. Regular updates are performed for control plane components.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Comprehensive security hardening across all control plane components (including supporting services) is not fully implemented. We need to conduct a more thorough security assessment and implement more robust hardening measures.
        *   Intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) are not fully deployed for all control plane infrastructure.
        *   Resource limits and quotas for control plane components are not consistently enforced.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Access Control for Control Plane](./mitigation_strategies/access_control_for_control_plane.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Restrict Access to Control Plane Interfaces:** Limit access to control plane interfaces (e.g., Builder UI, Builder APIs, Habitat Operator interfaces) to only authorized administrators and systems.
    2.  **Implement Strong Authentication for Control Plane:** Enforce strong authentication mechanisms for access to control plane components.
        *   Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrator accounts.
        *   Enforce strong password policies.
        *   Consider using certificate-based authentication for API access.
    3.  **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Control Plane Management:** Implement RBAC to control access to different functionalities within the Habitat control plane based on user roles and responsibilities. Define roles with granular permissions for package management, origin management, user management, and other control plane operations.
    4.  **Principle of Least Privilege for Control Plane Access:** Grant users and systems only the minimum necessary permissions required to perform their assigned tasks within the control plane.
    5.  **Regularly Review Access Control Policies:** Periodically review and update access control policies for the control plane to ensure they remain aligned with organizational security requirements and user roles.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Control Plane Management (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized users from gaining administrative access to the Habitat control plane and potentially manipulating packages, origins, or the Habitat environment.
        *   **Privilege Escalation within Control Plane (Medium Severity):** RBAC and least privilege principles help prevent privilege escalation attacks within the control plane by limiting user permissions.
        *   **Insider Threats (Medium Severity):** Access control measures mitigate the risk of malicious actions by insider threats by limiting access and permissions based on roles and responsibilities.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Control Plane Management:** High Impact Reduction. Significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized administrative access to the control plane.
        *   **Privilege Escalation within Control Plane:** Medium Impact Reduction. Makes privilege escalation attacks more difficult.
        *   **Insider Threats:** Medium Impact Reduction. Limits the potential damage from insider threats by enforcing access control and least privilege.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Partially implemented. Basic access control is in place for our private Builder, primarily based on user accounts and basic permissions.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   RBAC within the Builder and other control plane components is not fully implemented. We need to implement more granular role-based access control.
        *   Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is not consistently enforced for administrator accounts accessing the control plane.
        *   Regular reviews of access control policies are not fully formalized and automated.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Signed Updates](./mitigation_strategies/signed_updates.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enforce Signed Package Updates in Supervisors:** Configure Supervisors to *only* accept and install package updates that are digitally signed by trusted Habitat origins. This is achieved through origin verification (described in a separate mitigation strategy).
    2.  **Secure Update Channels:** Ensure that the channels used by Supervisors to retrieve package updates (e.g., connections to Habitat Builder or package repositories) are secure and protected from tampering. Use HTTPS for all communication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
    3.  **Regularly Rotate Origin Keys:** Implement a policy for regular rotation of Habitat origin keys. This limits the window of opportunity if a private origin key is compromised.
    4.  **Secure Key Management for Origin Keys:** (Covered in detail in the "Always Verify Package Origins" mitigation strategy). Securely manage and protect private origin keys used for signing packages.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Malicious Updates (High Severity):** Prevents the installation of tampered or malicious package updates that could be injected by attackers into the update stream. Signed updates ensure package integrity and authenticity during updates.
        *   **Downgrade Attacks (Medium Severity):** Signed updates can help prevent downgrade attacks where attackers attempt to force the installation of older, potentially vulnerable package versions.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Malicious Updates:** High Impact Reduction. Provides a strong defense against malicious updates, ensuring that only trusted and verified packages are installed during updates.
        *   **Downgrade Attacks:** Medium Impact Reduction. Makes downgrade attacks more difficult to execute successfully.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Implemented in production and staging environments. Supervisors are configured to enforce signed package updates through origin verification. We use HTTPS for communication with our private Builder.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Automated key rotation for origin keys is not fully implemented. We have manual procedures for key rotation, but automation would improve security and reduce operational overhead.
        *   Formalized procedures for handling compromised origin keys and revocation are not fully documented and tested.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Staged Rollouts and Rollbacks (Habitat Update Strategies)](./mitigation_strategies/staged_rollouts_and_rollbacks__habitat_update_strategies_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize Habitat's Update Strategies:** Leverage Habitat's built-in update strategies (e.g., `rolling`, `at-once`, `canary`) to perform staged rollouts of service updates instead of applying updates to all instances simultaneously.
    2.  **Implement Canary Deployments:** Use canary deployments as an update strategy to initially roll out new service versions to a small subset of instances (canaries). Monitor canaries closely for errors or security issues before proceeding with a wider rollout.
    3.  **Phased Rollouts:** Employ phased rollouts to gradually deploy updates to increasing numbers of service instances over time. This allows for monitoring and validation at each phase.
    4.  **Automated Rollback Mechanisms:** Establish clear rollback procedures and mechanisms to quickly revert to previous versions of services in case of update failures, security issues, or unexpected behavior after an update. Habitat's Supervisor and package management system facilitate rollbacks.
    5.  **Monitoring and Alerting during Rollouts:** Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting during update rollouts. Monitor service health, performance, and error rates to detect any issues introduced by updates.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Deployment of Vulnerable Updates (High Severity):** Staged rollouts and rollbacks reduce the impact of deploying updates that inadvertently introduce new vulnerabilities or security regressions. By limiting the initial blast radius, issues can be detected and rolled back before widespread impact.
        *   **Service Disruptions due to Faulty Updates (High Severity):** Staged rollouts minimize service disruptions caused by faulty updates. If an update introduces errors or instability, the impact is contained to a smaller subset of instances, and a rollback can be performed quickly.
        *   **Zero-Day Vulnerability Exploitation during Update Window (Medium Severity):** While not directly preventing zero-day exploits, staged rollouts and rapid rollback capabilities can limit the window of exposure if a zero-day vulnerability is discovered in a newly deployed update.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Deployment of Vulnerable Updates:** High Impact Reduction. Significantly reduces the risk of widespread deployment of vulnerable updates and allows for faster detection and rollback.
        *   **Service Disruptions due to Faulty Updates:** High Impact Reduction. Minimizes service disruptions caused by problematic updates and enables rapid recovery.
        *   **Zero-Day Vulnerability Exploitation during Update Window:** Medium Impact Reduction. Limits the exposure window and potential impact of zero-day exploits in new updates.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Partially implemented. We utilize Habitat's `rolling` update strategy for many services in production. Canary deployments are used for some critical services. Rollback procedures are documented but could be further automated.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Staged rollouts and canary deployments are not consistently applied to all services. We should expand the use of these update strategies across more services.
        *   Automated rollback mechanisms could be further improved and integrated into our deployment pipelines for faster and more reliable rollbacks.
        *   Monitoring and alerting during update rollouts could be enhanced to provide more granular visibility and faster detection of issues.
