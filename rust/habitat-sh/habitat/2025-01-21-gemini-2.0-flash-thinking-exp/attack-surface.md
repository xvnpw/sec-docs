# Attack Surface Analysis for habitat-sh/habitat

## Attack Surface: [Supervisor API Exposure](./attack_surfaces/supervisor_api_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** The Habitat Supervisor exposes an API (often gRPC) for control and monitoring of services.
    *   **How Habitat Contributes:** Habitat's architecture inherently relies on this API for managing service lifecycle, configuration updates, and health checks, creating a direct attack vector if not secured.
    *   **Example:** An unauthenticated or improperly authorized API endpoint allows an attacker to trigger a service restart, retrieve sensitive configuration data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the Supervisor host.
    *   **Impact:** Service disruption, data exfiltration, potential host compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for the Supervisor API (e.g., mutual TLS).
        *   Restrict network access to the Supervisor API to authorized hosts/networks.
        *   Regularly audit and patch the Supervisor for known API vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider using a secure transport layer (TLS) for all API communication.

## Attack Surface: [Habitat Builder Supply Chain Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/habitat_builder_supply_chain_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** The Habitat Builder is responsible for building application packages. Compromises in the build process can introduce malicious code.
    *   **How Habitat Contributes:** Habitat's package building process relies on build plans and dependencies. If these are tampered with within the Habitat Builder environment, malicious code can be injected into the final package.
    *   **Example:** A compromised build dependency or a malicious build hook within a Habitat plan injects a backdoor into the application package within the Builder. This backdoor is then deployed across all instances of the service.
    *   **Impact:** Widespread compromise of deployed applications, data breaches, supply chain attacks affecting downstream users.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict controls over who can contribute to and modify Habitat build plans within the Habitat Builder.
        *   Utilize package provenance features within the Habitat ecosystem to verify the origin and integrity of build dependencies.
        *   Regularly scan the Habitat Builder environment for malware and vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement code review processes for Habitat build plans.
        *   Consider using signed and verified build artifacts generated by the Habitat Builder.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Habitat Package Distribution](./attack_surfaces/insecure_habitat_package_distribution.md)

*   **Description:** The mechanism for distributing Habitat packages can be vulnerable if not secured.
    *   **How Habitat Contributes:** Habitat packages are often distributed through a Builder service or a custom repository tightly integrated with the Habitat ecosystem. If this distribution channel is insecure, attackers can inject malicious packages.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the Habitat Builder's package repository and replaces a legitimate package with a malicious one. When Habitat Supervisors download this package, they deploy the compromised application.
    *   **Impact:** Deployment of compromised applications, potential for widespread service disruption or data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the Habitat Builder and any package repositories used within the Habitat ecosystem with strong authentication and authorization.
        *   Implement package signing and verification within Habitat to ensure the integrity and authenticity of packages.
        *   Use HTTPS for all package downloads initiated by Habitat Supervisors.
        *   Regularly audit access logs for the Habitat package distribution system.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Habitat Supervisor Process](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_habitat_supervisor_process.md)

*   **Description:** The Habitat Supervisor itself is a piece of software that can contain vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Habitat Contributes:** The Supervisor is a core component of the Habitat runtime environment. Any vulnerability in the Supervisor directly impacts the security of the services it manages within the Habitat ecosystem.
    *   **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Habitat Supervisor allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the host running the Supervisor, potentially gaining control of the entire system.
    *   **Impact:** Host compromise, service disruption, potential for lateral movement within the infrastructure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the Habitat Supervisor updated to the latest stable version with security patches.
        *   Follow security best practices for the host operating system running the Habitat Supervisor.
        *   Minimize the privileges granted to the Habitat Supervisor process.
        *   Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems to monitor Habitat Supervisor activity.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Habitat Configuration](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_habitat_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords) might be stored insecurely within Habitat configurations.
    *   **How Habitat Contributes:** Habitat uses configuration files and environment variables to manage service settings. If these are not handled carefully within the Habitat ecosystem, secrets can be exposed.
    *   **Example:** Database credentials are stored in plain text within a Habitat configuration file that is accessible to unauthorized users or processes managed by Habitat.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive resources, data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize Habitat's secrets management features to securely store and manage sensitive data.
        *   Avoid storing secrets directly in Habitat configuration files or environment variables.
        *   Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit within the Habitat environment.
        *   Implement access controls to restrict who can view or modify Habitat configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Habitat Hooks](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_habitat_hooks.md)

*   **Description:** Developers can create custom hooks that execute during the service lifecycle. These hooks can introduce vulnerabilities if not written securely.
    *   **How Habitat Contributes:** Habitat's flexibility allows for custom hooks, but this also introduces the risk of developer-introduced vulnerabilities within the Habitat managed service lifecycle.
    *   **Example:** A custom `init` hook executes a shell command based on user-provided input without proper sanitization, leading to a command injection vulnerability within a Habitat managed service.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the Supervisor host, potential for service compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow secure coding practices when developing Habitat hooks.
        *   Thoroughly test and review all custom hooks for potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Minimize the use of shell commands within hooks and prefer using Habitat's built-in functionalities.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization in hook scripts.
