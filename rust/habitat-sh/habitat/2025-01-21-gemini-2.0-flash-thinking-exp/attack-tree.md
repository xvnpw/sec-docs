## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Build Process (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK):](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_build_process__critical_node__high-risk_.md)

An attacker targets the infrastructure and processes used to build Habitat packages. This could involve gaining unauthorized access to build servers, manipulating build scripts, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the build tools themselves. Successful compromise allows the attacker to inject malicious code into the application package.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Build Dependencies (HIGH-RISK):](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_build_dependencies__high-risk_.md)

Attackers identify and exploit known vulnerabilities in the software libraries and tools used as dependencies during the build process. By leveraging these vulnerabilities, they can inject malicious code or alter the build output.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Builder Environment Credentials (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK):](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_builder_environment_credentials__critical_node__high-risk_.md)

Attackers obtain the credentials (usernames, passwords, API keys) used to access the build environment. This could be through phishing, credential stuffing, or exploiting vulnerabilities in systems where these credentials are stored. With valid credentials, attackers can directly manipulate the build process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Tamper with Habitat Plan Files (HIGH-RISK):](./attack_tree_paths/tamper_with_habitat_plan_files__high-risk_.md)

Attackers gain access to the Habitat plan files, which define how the application is built and packaged. They can then directly modify these files to include malicious code, alter dependencies, or change the application's behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Chain Attack on Package Dependencies (HIGH-RISK):](./attack_tree_paths/supply_chain_attack_on_package_dependencies__high-risk_.md)

Attackers target the external dependencies used by the application. This can involve compromising the repositories where these dependencies are hosted or injecting malicious code into legitimate, but vulnerable, upstream dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce Vulnerable or Malicious Upstream Dependency (HIGH-RISK):](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_vulnerable_or_malicious_upstream_dependency__high-risk_.md)

Attackers intentionally introduce a dependency into the application's build process that contains known vulnerabilities or malicious code. This can be done by submitting compromised packages to public repositories or by convincing developers to use a malicious dependency.

## Attack Tree Path: [Backdoor the Application Code During Packaging (HIGH-RISK):](./attack_tree_paths/backdoor_the_application_code_during_packaging__high-risk_.md)

Attackers with access to the packaging process directly modify the application's source code within the Habitat plan before the package is built. This allows them to insert backdoors or malicious functionality that will be included in the final application package.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Application Source Code within Habitat Plan (HIGH-RISK):](./attack_tree_paths/modify_application_source_code_within_habitat_plan__high-risk_.md)

Attackers directly edit the application's source code files as part of the Habitat packaging process. This requires access to the plan and the source code within it.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access to Habitat Supervisor (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK):](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_to_habitat_supervisor__critical_node__high-risk_.md)

Attackers successfully authenticate or bypass authentication mechanisms to gain access to the Habitat Supervisor. This provides them with control over the services managed by the Supervisor.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Supervisor API Vulnerabilities - Authorization Flaws (HIGH-RISK):](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_supervisor_api_vulnerabilities_-_authorization_flaws__high-risk_.md)

Attackers exploit flaws in the authorization logic of the Habitat Supervisor's API. This allows them to perform actions that they should not be permitted to do, potentially leading to service disruption or compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Supervisor API Vulnerabilities - Remote Code Execution (HIGH-RISK):](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_supervisor_api_vulnerabilities_-_remote_code_execution__high-risk_.md)

Attackers discover and exploit vulnerabilities in the Habitat Supervisor's API that allow them to execute arbitrary code on the Supervisor's host system. This provides a high level of control over the environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Network Communication Vulnerabilities - Man-in-the-Middle Attack on Supervisor Communication (HIGH-RISK):](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_network_communication_vulnerabilities_-_man-in-the-middle_attack_on_supervisor_communication_357b585e.md)

Attackers intercept communication between Habitat Supervisors and other components (e.g., clients, other Supervisors). By placing themselves in the communication path, they can eavesdrop on sensitive information or manipulate the messages being exchanged.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Network Communication Vulnerabilities - Exploit Unencrypted Communication Channels (HIGH-RISK):](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_network_communication_vulnerabilities_-_exploit_unencrypted_communication_channels__high-ris_f40e5c41.md)

Attackers exploit the lack of encryption in communication channels used by the Habitat Supervisor. This allows them to easily intercept and read sensitive data being transmitted.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Default or Weak Supervisor Credentials (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK):](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_default_or_weak_supervisor_credentials__critical_node__high-risk_.md)

Attackers leverage default or easily guessable credentials used to access the Habitat Supervisor. This is a common security oversight that provides a simple entry point for attackers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Unencrypted Service Communication (HIGH-RISK):](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_unencrypted_service_communication__high-risk_.md)

Attackers exploit the lack of encryption in communication between services managed by Habitat. This allows them to intercept and potentially manipulate data being exchanged between services.

## Attack Tree Path: [Expose Sensitive Configuration Data (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK):](./attack_tree_paths/expose_sensitive_configuration_data__critical_node__high-risk_.md)

Attackers gain access to sensitive configuration data, such as API keys, database credentials, or other secrets, which are used by the application. This exposure can lead to further compromise of the application and related systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Retrieve Configuration from Insecure Storage (HIGH-RISK):](./attack_tree_paths/retrieve_configuration_from_insecure_storage__high-risk_.md)

Attackers access configuration data that is stored in an insecure manner, such as in plain text files, easily accessible directories, or unprotected configuration management systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Tamper with Configuration Files on Disk (HIGH-RISK):](./attack_tree_paths/tamper_with_configuration_files_on_disk__high-risk_.md)

Attackers gain access to the file system where the application's configuration files are stored and directly modify them. This allows them to alter the application's behavior or inject malicious settings.
