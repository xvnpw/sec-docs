            * **Path Traversal:**  Manipulating file paths in API requests to access sensitive files.
            * **Deserialization Vulnerabilities:**  If the API uses deserialization of user-provided data, vulnerabilities in the deserialization process could lead to code execution.
        * **API Design Flaws:**
            * **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):**  Attackers can access resources by manipulating object identifiers in API requests.
            * **Mass Assignment:**  Attackers can modify object properties they shouldn't have access to.

* **4.1.3. Exploitation:**
    * **Goal:** Leverage the identified vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the Supervisor's host.
    * **Methods:**
        * **Crafting Malicious API Requests:**  Sending specially crafted requests that exploit the identified vulnerability.
        * **Leveraging Command Injection:**  Injecting malicious commands into API parameters that are executed by the Supervisor.
        * **Exploiting Deserialization Vulnerabilities:**  Sending malicious serialized objects that, when deserialized, execute arbitrary code.
    * **Example Scenarios:**
        * An API endpoint responsible for managing services might allow command injection through a service name parameter.
        * A vulnerability in the Supervisor's handling of configuration updates could allow an attacker to inject malicious code into a configuration file that is subsequently executed.
        * A deserialization vulnerability in an API endpoint that handles communication with other Habitat components could be exploited to gain control.

* **4.1.4. Post-Exploitation:**
    * **Goal:** Maintain access, escalate privileges (if necessary), and achieve the attacker's objectives.
    * **Methods:**
        * **Establishing Persistence:**  Creating backdoors or modifying system configurations to maintain access.
        * **Lateral Movement:**  Using the compromised Supervisor to access other systems within the network.
