### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Modify Application Source Code within Habitat Plan

**Attack Path Breakdown:**

The attack path "Modify Application Source Code within Habitat Plan" can be broken down into the following stages:

1. **Gain Access to the Habitat Plan:** The attacker needs to access the directory containing the Habitat plan files (e.g., `plan.sh`, `config/`, `hooks/`, and potentially the application source code itself).
2. **Locate and Identify Target Source Code:** Once inside the plan directory, the attacker needs to locate the specific source code files they intend to modify. This might involve understanding the plan's structure and the application's build process.
3. **Modify Source Code:** The attacker uses their access to directly edit the source code files. This could involve injecting malicious code, altering existing logic, or introducing vulnerabilities.
4. **Trigger Habitat Build Process:** The attacker needs to trigger the Habitat build process to incorporate the modified source code into the resulting artifact (e.g., a Docker image or a Habitat package). This could involve manually running `hab pkg build` or manipulating CI/CD pipelines.
5. **Deploy and Execute Modified Artifact:** The compromised artifact containing the modified source code is deployed and executed, potentially leading to the attacker's desired outcome.

**Prerequisites for Successful Attack:**

For this attack to be successful, several prerequisites must be met:

* **Access to the Habitat Plan Directory:** This is the most critical prerequisite. The attacker needs read and write access to the directory containing the plan files. This could be achieved through:
    * **Compromised Development Environment:**  If the attacker gains access to a developer's machine where the plan is stored.
    * **Compromised Source Code Repository:** If the plan is stored within the same repository as the application source code and the attacker gains access to the repository.
    * **Misconfigured Access Controls:**  If the plan directory is stored on a shared file system with overly permissive access controls.
    * **Supply Chain Attack:**  If a dependency or tool used in the build process is compromised, allowing the attacker to inject malicious code into the plan.
* **Understanding of the Habitat Plan Structure:** The attacker needs to understand how the plan is structured to locate the relevant source code files.
* **Ability to Trigger the Build Process:** The attacker needs a way to initiate the Habitat build process after modifying the source code.
* **Lack of Integrity Checks:**  The build process or deployment pipeline lacks mechanisms to verify the integrity of the source code or the resulting artifact.

**Attack Vectors:**

Attackers can leverage various vectors to achieve the prerequisites:

* **Compromised Developer Accounts:** Phishing, credential stuffing, or malware on developer machines can grant access to development environments and source code repositories.
* **Vulnerable CI/CD Pipelines:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the CI/CD pipeline used to build and deploy the application can allow attackers to inject malicious code or modify build scripts.
* **Insider Threats:** Malicious or negligent insiders with access to the plan directory can directly modify the source code.
* **Supply Chain Compromises:**  Compromising dependencies or build tools used by the Habitat plan can allow attackers to inject malicious code during the build process.
* **Weak Access Controls on Shared Resources:**  If the plan directory is stored on a shared network drive or repository with weak access controls, unauthorized individuals could gain access.

**Potential Impact:**

The impact of successfully modifying the application source code within the Habitat plan can be severe:

* **Introduction of Backdoors:** Attackers can inject code that allows them persistent access to the application or the underlying infrastructure.
* **Data Breaches:** Modified code can be used to exfiltrate sensitive data processed by the application.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Attackers can introduce code that crashes the application or makes it unavailable.
* **Privilege Escalation:** Modified code can be used to gain elevated privileges within the application or the system it runs on.
* **Supply Chain Contamination:** If the compromised artifact is distributed to other users or systems, the attack can spread further.
* **Reputational Damage:** A successful attack can severely damage the reputation of the organization and the application.

**Detection Strategies:**

Detecting this type of attack can be challenging but is crucial:

* **Source Code Integrity Monitoring:** Implement systems to monitor changes to the source code within the Habitat plan. This could involve version control systems with strong access controls and change tracking.
* **Build Process Auditing:** Log and monitor all activities within the Habitat build process, including who initiated the build, what changes were made, and the inputs used.
* **Artifact Integrity Verification:** Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity of the built artifacts (e.g., using cryptographic signatures). Compare the signature of the built artifact against a known good signature.
* **Anomaly Detection in Build Times and Resource Usage:**  Significant deviations in build times or resource consumption during the build process could indicate malicious activity.
* **Security Scanning of Built Artifacts:** Regularly scan the built artifacts for known vulnerabilities and malware.
* **Access Control Monitoring:** Monitor access attempts and changes to the Habitat plan directory and related repositories.
* **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct periodic security audits of the development environment, CI/CD pipelines, and access controls.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

Implementing robust mitigation strategies is essential to prevent this attack:

* **Strong Access Controls:** Implement strict access controls on the Habitat plan directory and related repositories, limiting access to only authorized personnel. Utilize role-based access control (RBAC).
* **Secure Development Practices:** Enforce secure coding practices and conduct regular code reviews to minimize the risk of introducing vulnerabilities.
* **Secure Storage of Habitat Plans:** Store Habitat plans in secure repositories with version control and access controls. Avoid storing them on individual developer machines without proper security measures.
* **Code Signing and Verification:** Implement code signing for the application source code and verify the signatures during the build process.
* **Immutable Infrastructure:**  Utilize immutable infrastructure principles where possible, making it harder for attackers to modify components.
* **Secure Build Pipelines:** Secure the CI/CD pipelines used to build and deploy the application. Implement security checks and validations at each stage.
* **Dependency Management:**  Use a robust dependency management system and regularly scan dependencies for vulnerabilities. Consider using dependency pinning and software bill of materials (SBOM).
* **Regular Security Training:**  Educate developers and operations teams about the risks associated with this attack and best practices for prevention.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the necessary permissions to users and processes involved in the development and deployment process.
* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enforce MFA for access to development environments, source code repositories, and build systems.
* **Supply Chain Security Measures:** Implement measures to verify the integrity of third-party components and tools used in the build process.

**Conclusion:**

The attack path "Modify Application Source Code within Habitat Plan" represents a significant risk due to the potential for deep and impactful compromise. Preventing this attack requires a layered security approach encompassing strong access controls, secure development practices, robust build pipeline security, and continuous monitoring. By understanding the attacker's perspective, implementing appropriate detection mechanisms, and proactively applying mitigation strategies, organizations can significantly reduce the likelihood and impact of this type of attack on their Habitat-based applications.
