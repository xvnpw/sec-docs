# Project Design Document: Habitat

**Version:** 1.1
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Author:** AI Software Architect

## 1. Introduction

This document provides an enhanced and detailed design overview of the Habitat project, an open-source automation technology designed to streamline the building, deployment, and management of applications across diverse environments. These environments range from traditional data centers to containerized platforms and cloud infrastructures. This document serves as a foundational resource for subsequent threat modeling activities, providing a comprehensive understanding of the system's architecture and components.

## 2. Goals

The core objectives of Habitat are:

* **Achieve Universal Application Portability:**  Enable applications to be built once and operate consistently across a wide array of operating systems and infrastructure platforms without modification.
* **Implement Comprehensive Runtime Automation:** Automate the complete application lifecycle, encompassing deployment, configuration, updates, service discovery, and health monitoring.
* **Establish Operational Consistency:** Deliver a unified and predictable operational model for applications, abstracting away the complexities of the underlying infrastructure.
* **Facilitate Secure Application Delivery Pipelines:**  Promote and enforce secure practices for application packaging, distribution, and deployment.
* **Enable Self-Managing and Resilient Applications:** Empower applications to monitor their own health, detect failures, and automatically initiate recovery procedures.

## 3. High-Level Architecture

Habitat's architecture is centered around the "Habitat package" and the "Supervisor" process. The following diagram illustrates the primary components and their interactions in greater detail:

```

Key components with expanded descriptions:

* **Developer:**  Writes application code and defines the build, runtime, and operational characteristics of the application through Habitat plan files (`PLAN.sh`).
* **Builder Service:** A centralized service responsible for compiling application code, resolving dependencies, and packaging applications into immutable Habitat packages based on the provided plan files. It also handles package signing for integrity.
* **Habitat Package Registry:** A repository for storing and distributing signed Habitat packages. It provides mechanisms for versioning, access control, and metadata management for packages.
* **Infrastructure:** The underlying computing environment where Habitat applications are deployed and run. This can include virtual machines, container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes, or cloud provider infrastructure.
* **Supervisor:** The core runtime agent that manages the lifecycle of Habitat applications on a given host. It downloads packages, configures applications, manages processes, provides service discovery, and performs health checks.
* **Application:** The actual software being managed by the Habitat Supervisor. It runs within the context provided by the Supervisor.
* **Service Group:** A logical grouping of Supervisors running the same application. This enables coordination, service discovery, leader election, and rolling updates across multiple instances of the application.
* **Other Supervisors:** Other instances of the Supervisor process, potentially managing different applications or participating in different service groups. They communicate via a gossip protocol.
* **Operator/Administrator:**  Individuals or automated systems responsible for managing the Habitat infrastructure, including the Builder Service, Package Registry, and Supervisor deployments.

    * **Threat:** Malicious actors could tamper with Habitat packages, injecting malicious code.
    * **Mitigation:** Cryptographic signing of packages by the Builder Service and signature verification by the Supervisor before execution.
* **Supply Chain Security:**
    * **Threat:** Compromised build dependencies or build environments could lead to compromised packages.
    * **Mitigation:** Secure build pipelines, dependency scanning, and potentially using reproducible builds.
* **Authentication and Authorization:**
    * **Threat:** Unauthorized access to the Habitat Package Registry could lead to the distribution of malicious packages. Unauthorized access to the Supervisor API could lead to service disruption.
    * **Mitigation:** Implementing robust authentication mechanisms (e.g., API keys, OAuth) and role-based access control for the registry and Supervisor API.
* **Secrets Management:**
    * **Threat:** Sensitive information like API keys or database credentials could be exposed within packages or configuration.
    * **Mitigation:** Utilizing Habitat's configuration features to securely manage secrets, potentially integrating with dedicated secrets management solutions.
* **Network Security:**
    * **Threat:** Unsecured communication channels could be intercepted, leading to data breaches or man-in-the-middle attacks.
    * **Mitigation:** Enforcing TLS encryption for communication between Supervisors, the Builder Service, and the Package Registry. Securing network access to Supervisor control plane ports.
* **Supervisor Security:**
    * **Threat:** A compromised Supervisor could be used to gain control over the managed application or the host system.
    * **Mitigation:** Running the Supervisor with minimal privileges, regularly patching vulnerabilities, and potentially using security hardening techniques.
* **Data at Rest and in Transit:**
    * **Threat:** Sensitive data within packages or during communication could be exposed.
    * **Mitigation:** Encrypting sensitive data within packages where necessary and ensuring secure communication channels.
* **Gossip Protocol Security:**
    * **Threat:** Malicious actors could inject false information into the gossip network, disrupting service discovery or coordination.
