- Increase application portability and reduce environment-specific configurations.
- Enable consistent and repeatable application deployments.
- Improve application runtime reliability and observability.
- Empower development and operations teams to collaborate more effectively on application lifecycle management.

Business Risks:
- Complexity of adopting a new application management paradigm.
- Potential for misconfiguration leading to application failures or security vulnerabilities.
- Reliance on a specific technology stack (Habitat ecosystem).
- Integration challenges with existing infrastructure and tooling.
- Security risks associated with automated deployment and management processes, especially around secrets management and access control.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- Application deployment and updates: Habitat automates the process of deploying and updating applications, which is critical for maintaining service availability and delivering new features.
- Application runtime management: Habitat manages the runtime of applications, ensuring they are running correctly and are monitored. This is crucial for application stability and reliability.

Data Sensitivity:
- Application configuration data: Habitat manages application configuration, which may include sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, and other secrets. This data is highly sensitive and requires strong protection.
- Application code: The application code itself is valuable intellectual property and may contain sensitive logic or data handling routines. Protecting the integrity and confidentiality of the application code is important.
- Operational logs and metrics: Habitat collects logs and metrics about application runtime and system performance. While generally less sensitive, these logs might contain some operational details that should be protected from unauthorized access.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What specific authentication and authorization mechanisms are currently implemented in Habitat components (CLI, Supervisor, Builder, API Gateway)?
- How are secrets managed within Habitat currently? Is there a built-in secrets management solution or recommendation?
- What security scanning tools are currently used in the Habitat build process, if any?
- What are the recommended best practices for securing Habitat deployments?
- Is there a formal security audit or penetration testing report available for Habitat?

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to improve application deployment efficiency and portability, with a secondary goal of enhancing application security through consistent management.
- SECURITY POSTURE:  Habitat is intended to be used in environments with moderate security requirements, where confidentiality, integrity, and availability are all important.  Security is considered but might not be the absolute top priority compared to ease of use and automation.
- DESIGN: The design assumes a typical deployment scenario involving virtual machines or cloud environments. The build process is assumed to be automated using CI/CD pipelines.
