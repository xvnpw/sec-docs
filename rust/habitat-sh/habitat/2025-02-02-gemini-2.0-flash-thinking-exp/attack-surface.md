# Attack Surface Analysis for habitat-sh/habitat

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Supervisor Gossip Protocol](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_supervisor_gossip_protocol.md)

Description: The Habitat Supervisor uses a gossip protocol for inter-supervisor communication. If this protocol is not secured, it can be intercepted or manipulated, allowing unauthorized access and control.
Habitat Contribution: Habitat's core functionality relies on the gossip protocol for cluster coordination, service discovery, and configuration propagation, making its security paramount.
Example: An attacker on the same network eavesdrops on unencrypted gossip traffic, intercepts service configuration details, and injects malicious commands to disrupt services.
Impact: Information disclosure, unauthorized access to services, service disruption, potential for complete cluster compromise.
Risk Severity: **High**
Mitigation Strategies:
*   Enable Gossip Encryption: Configure Habitat Supervisors to use encrypted gossip communication to protect data in transit.
*   Network Segmentation: Isolate the Habitat Supervisor network to restrict attacker access to the gossip communication channel.
*   Regular Security Audits: Periodically audit network configurations and gossip protocol settings to ensure proper security measures are in place.

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected Supervisor API](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_supervisor_api.md)

Description: The Habitat Supervisor exposes an API for control and monitoring. If this API lacks proper authentication and authorization, it becomes a direct attack vector for unauthorized management of Habitat services.
Habitat Contribution: Habitat's Supervisor API is the primary interface for managing and observing services within a Habitat environment. Its security directly dictates the control plane security of deployed applications.
Example: An attacker discovers an exposed Supervisor API endpoint without authentication and uses it to stop critical services, leading to a denial of service.
Impact: Denial of service, unauthorized service control, information disclosure, potential for data manipulation and escalation of privileges.
Risk Severity: **High**
Mitigation Strategies:
*   Implement API Authentication and Authorization:  Enable and enforce strong authentication (e.g., API keys, TLS client certificates) and role-based authorization for the Supervisor API.
*   Restrict API Access: Limit API access to authorized networks or IP addresses using firewalls and network access control lists.
*   Disable API if Unnecessary: If the Supervisor API is not required for external management, disable it or bind it only to localhost to minimize exposure.
*   Regular Security Audits: Regularly audit API access controls and configurations to identify and rectify any weaknesses.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Service Bindings](./attack_surfaces/insecure_service_bindings.md)

Description: Services within Habitat can bind to each other for communication. If these bindings lack proper security measures, they can be exploited for service impersonation and lateral movement within the Habitat environment.
Habitat Contribution: Habitat's service binding mechanism facilitates essential inter-service communication. Insecure bindings create direct pathways for attackers to compromise multiple services after initial access.
Example: Service A binds to Service B without authentication. A compromised Service C, running on the same Supervisor, impersonates Service A and connects to Service B, gaining unauthorized access to Service B's sensitive data.
Impact: Lateral movement within the Habitat environment, service impersonation, data breaches, unauthorized access to sensitive resources across multiple services.
Risk Severity: **High**
Mitigation Strategies:
*   Implement Service-to-Service Authentication:  Enforce robust authentication and authorization between services using mechanisms like mutual TLS, API keys, or service mesh technologies (if integrated with Habitat).
*   Network Segmentation within Supervisor:  Utilize network namespaces or other isolation techniques to limit the blast radius of compromised services within a Supervisor instance and restrict lateral movement.
*   Principle of Least Privilege for Bindings: Only establish bindings between services that absolutely require direct communication, minimizing potential attack vectors.
*   Regular Security Audits: Regularly review service binding configurations and inter-service communication patterns to identify and address potential security gaps.

## Attack Surface: [Untrusted Habitat Packages](./attack_surfaces/untrusted_habitat_packages.md)

Description: Habitat packages are the fundamental deployment unit. Using untrusted or unsigned packages directly introduces the risk of deploying malicious code into the system, bypassing standard security controls.
Habitat Contribution: Habitat's package management system, while offering origin verification, can be bypassed if users install packages from untrusted sources, directly leading to supply chain vulnerabilities.
Example: A developer installs a Habitat package from an unofficial, untrusted origin. This package contains a backdoor that grants an attacker persistent remote access to the deployed service and potentially the underlying infrastructure.
Impact: Code execution, data breaches, complete system compromise, severe supply chain attack impacting the integrity of deployed applications.
Risk Severity: **Critical**
Mitigation Strategies:
*   Strictly Verify Package Origins and Signatures:  Mandatory verification of the origin and cryptographic signature of all Habitat packages before installation to ensure package integrity and authenticity.
*   Utilize Trusted Package Repositories:  Restrict package installations to only trusted Habitat package repositories and origins, ideally internally managed and secured repositories.
*   Automated Package Scanning and Analysis:  Implement automated security scanning and analysis of Habitat packages to proactively detect potential malware or vulnerabilities before deployment.
*   Secure Package Build Pipeline: Secure the entire Habitat package build pipeline to prevent injection of malicious code during the build and release process, ensuring supply chain security.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Secrets Management](./attack_surfaces/insecure_secrets_management.md)

Description: Improper handling of secrets within Habitat deployments can lead to direct exposure of sensitive credentials, granting attackers unauthorized access to critical systems and data.
Habitat Contribution: While Habitat provides a secrets system, misconfiguration or insecure practices in its usage directly result in secret exposure, negating the intended security benefits.
Example: Secrets are mistakenly stored in plaintext within Habitat configuration files or environment variables, making them easily accessible to attackers who gain access to the Supervisor, container, or configuration repository.
Impact: Data breaches, unauthorized access to sensitive systems, compromise of cryptographic keys, widespread security compromise due to exposed credentials.
Risk Severity: **Critical**
Mitigation Strategies:
*   Mandatory Use of Habitat Secrets System: Enforce the use of Habitat's built-in secrets system for managing all sensitive data, avoiding plaintext storage in configuration files or environment variables.
*   Integration with External Secrets Management: Integrate Habitat with robust external secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) for enhanced secret storage, rotation, auditing, and access control.
*   Principle of Least Privilege for Secrets Access:  Strictly restrict access to secrets to only authorized services and users, minimizing the potential impact of compromised components.
*   Regular Security Audits and Secret Rotation: Regularly audit secrets management configurations, access controls, and implement automated secret rotation policies to reduce the window of opportunity for compromised secrets.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Habitat Components](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_habitat_components.md)

Description: Like any software, Habitat components (Supervisor, Builder, CLI) are susceptible to vulnerabilities. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities can directly compromise the Habitat environment and the applications it manages.
Habitat Contribution:  Adopting Habitat introduces a direct dependency on its codebase. Security vulnerabilities within Habitat components directly translate to vulnerabilities in applications deployed using Habitat.
Example: A critical vulnerability is discovered in the Habitat Supervisor that allows for remote code execution. Attackers exploit this vulnerability to gain complete control of systems running vulnerable Supervisors and the services they manage.
Impact: Code execution, privilege escalation, denial of service, complete system compromise, widespread impact across all applications managed by vulnerable Habitat components.
Risk Severity: **Critical**
Mitigation Strategies:
*   Maintain Up-to-Date Habitat Components:  Establish a rigorous process for regularly updating Habitat Supervisors, Builders, and CLI tools to the latest versions to promptly patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Proactive Security Monitoring and Vulnerability Scanning:  Implement continuous security monitoring for advisories related to Habitat and perform regular vulnerability scanning of Habitat deployments to identify and remediate potential weaknesses.
*   Active Participation in Habitat Security Community:  Engage with the Habitat security community to stay informed about emerging security issues, best practices, and contribute to the collective security of the Habitat ecosystem.
