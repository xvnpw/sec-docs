## Deep Dive Analysis: Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) via Rocket's Templating

This document provides a deep dive analysis of the Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) threat within a Rocket application, specifically focusing on the risks associated with Rocket's built-in templating features.

**1. Threat Overview:**

Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) is a critical vulnerability that arises when an application embeds user-controlled data directly into template expressions without proper sanitization or escaping. Template engines, like the one used by Rocket, interpret these expressions on the server-side to generate dynamic web pages. When malicious code is injected, the template engine executes it, granting the attacker significant control over the server.

**In the context of Rocket:**

*   Rocket's built-in templating relies on external crates like `handlebars` or similar. The specific implementation details of the underlying engine are crucial to understanding the attack surface.
*   The `rocket::serde::Template` struct facilitates rendering templates by merging data with template files. If the data passed to this struct originates from untrusted user input and is not properly handled, it becomes a potential injection vector.

**2. Attack Vector and Exploitation:**

The attack unfolds as follows:

1. **Attacker Input:** An attacker crafts malicious input designed to be interpreted as template code by the templating engine. This input is typically embedded within a parameter, form field, or any other user-controllable data source.
2. **Vulnerable Code:** The Rocket application's code directly incorporates this untrusted input into the data context passed to the `rocket::serde::Template` struct for rendering.
3. **Template Processing:** When the template is rendered, the templating engine processes the malicious input as code.
4. **Code Execution:** The injected code is executed on the server within the context of the application.

**Example Scenario (Conceptual):**

Imagine a Rocket route that displays a personalized greeting:

```rust
#[get("/greet/<name>")]
async fn greet(name: String) -> Template {
    Template::render("greet", &context! {
        name: name // Potentially vulnerable if 'name' is not sanitized
    })
}
```

And the `greet.hbs` template:

```html
<h1>Hello, {{ name }}!</h1>
```

An attacker could send a request like `/greet/{{evil_code_here}}`. If the templating engine allows it, `evil_code_here` could be interpreted and executed.

**Common Injection Payloads (Conceptual, Engine-Specific):**

The specific syntax for injection depends on the underlying templating engine used by Rocket. Common techniques include:

*   **Accessing Object Properties/Methods:**  Attempting to access built-in objects or methods of the templating engine's context.
*   **Executing Arbitrary Code:**  Leveraging language-specific constructs within the template engine to execute system commands or other arbitrary code.
*   **Reading Files:**  Using template functions to access and display the contents of server-side files.

**3. Impact Analysis:**

As stated in the threat description, the impact of successful SSTI can be severe:

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** This is the most critical impact. An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, effectively gaining complete control. This allows them to:
    *   Install malware.
    *   Modify system configurations.
    *   Pivot to other internal systems.
    *   Disrupt services.
*   **Full Server Compromise:** With RCE, the attacker can gain root access or equivalent privileges, leading to complete control over the server and its resources.
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can access sensitive data stored on the server, including database credentials, user information, and application secrets.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Malicious template code could be designed to consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service for legitimate users.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** If the application runs with elevated privileges, the attacker can leverage SSTI to gain those privileges.

**4. Technical Deep Dive: Rocket's Templating and Potential Injection Points:**

*   **`rocket::serde::Template`:** This struct is the primary interface for rendering templates in Rocket. It takes the template name and a data context (often a `HashMap` or a struct annotated with `#[derive(Serialize)]`) as input.
*   **Data Context:** The data context is where the vulnerability lies. If data within this context originates from untrusted sources and is not properly escaped or sanitized *before* being added to the context, it becomes an injection point.
*   **Underlying Templating Engine:**  Understanding the specific templating engine used by Rocket (e.g., Handlebars) is crucial. Each engine has its own syntax, features, and potential vulnerabilities. Attackers will target engine-specific constructs.
*   **Dynamic Template Names (High Risk):**  If the application dynamically determines the template name based on user input, this introduces an even higher risk. An attacker could potentially specify a malicious template file.
*   **Custom Helpers/Functions:** If the templating engine allows for custom helpers or functions, and these helpers interact with the operating system or sensitive data, they can become targets for exploitation via SSTI.

**5. Proof of Concept (Conceptual):**

Let's assume Rocket is using Handlebars as the templating engine.

**Vulnerable Rocket Code:**

```rust
#[get("/display/<message>")]
async fn display(message: String) -> Template {
    Template::render("display_message", &context! {
        message: message // Untrusted input directly used
    })
}
```

**`display_message.hbs` Template:**

```html
<p>Message: {{ message }}</p>
```

**Potential Attack Payload:**

```
/display/{{process.env.SECRET_KEY}}
```

If Handlebars allows accessing environment variables through the `process.env` object, this payload could leak the `SECRET_KEY`.

**More Dangerous Payload (Conceptual):**

```
/display/{{require('child_process').execSync('ls -la')}}
```

If the templating engine allows executing arbitrary JavaScript code, this payload could execute the `ls -la` command on the server.

**Important Note:** The exact syntax and available functionalities depend on the specific templating engine in use.

**6. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed):**

*   **Prioritize Secure Templating Engines:** If possible, consider using logic-less templating languages like Mustache or pure HTML templating where minimal server-side logic is required. These languages offer less opportunity for code injection.
*   **Context-Aware Output Encoding/Escaping:** This is the most crucial mitigation. **Always escape user-provided data before rendering it in templates.** The escaping mechanism should be context-aware, meaning it should escape characters based on the output format (HTML, JavaScript, URL, etc.).
    *   **Rocket's Mechanisms:** Investigate if Rocket provides built-in escaping functions or mechanisms within its templating integration. Utilize these if available.
    *   **External Libraries:**  If Rocket's built-in features are insufficient, consider using external libraries specifically designed for output encoding and escaping.
*   **Avoid Dynamic Template Generation:**  Refrain from constructing template strings dynamically based on user input. This significantly increases the risk of introducing malicious code.
*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  While not a direct solution to SSTI, robust input validation and sanitization can help reduce the attack surface. Validate the format and content of user input to ensure it conforms to expected patterns. Sanitize potentially harmful characters before they reach the templating engine.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the Rocket application with the minimum necessary privileges. This limits the potential damage an attacker can cause even if they achieve RCE.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to mitigate the impact of successful SSTI by restricting the sources from which the browser can load resources.
*   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing, specifically targeting SSTI vulnerabilities in the templating implementation.
*   **Keep Dependencies Updated:** Ensure that Rocket and the underlying templating engine dependencies are kept up-to-date with the latest security patches.
*   **Security Training for Developers:** Educate developers about the risks of SSTI and secure coding practices for template handling.

**7. Detection Strategies:**

*   **Code Reviews:** Carefully review the codebase, paying close attention to how user input is handled and incorporated into templates. Look for instances where untrusted data is directly passed to the template context without proper escaping.
*   **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Utilize SAST tools that can analyze the source code for potential SSTI vulnerabilities. These tools can identify patterns and code constructs that are known to be risky.
*   **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Employ DAST tools or manual penetration testing techniques to send crafted payloads to the application and observe its behavior. Look for error messages or unexpected output that indicates successful injection.
*   **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs):** Implement a WAF with rules to detect and block common SSTI attack patterns. However, WAFs are not a foolproof solution and should be used in conjunction with other mitigation strategies.

**8. Conclusion:**

Server-Side Template Injection is a critical threat that can have devastating consequences for Rocket applications utilizing its built-in templating features. By directly incorporating untrusted user input into templates without proper sanitization or escaping, developers inadvertently create opportunities for attackers to execute arbitrary code and compromise the server.

**Key Takeaways for the Development Team:**

*   **Treat all user input as potentially malicious.**
*   **Prioritize output encoding/escaping as the primary defense against SSTI.**  Understand and utilize Rocket's built-in mechanisms or appropriate external libraries.
