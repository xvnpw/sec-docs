## Attack Tree Path: [Path Traversal via Router Misconfiguration](./attack_tree_paths/path_traversal_via_router_misconfiguration.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attacker identifies a route definition in the Rocket application that is vulnerable to path traversal. This might occur if the route directly uses user-supplied input to construct file paths without proper sanitization. The attacker crafts a request containing ".." sequences to navigate outside the intended directories and access sensitive files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Route Hijacking/Spoofing](./attack_tree_paths/route_hijackingspoofing.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attacker analyzes how Rocket registers and handles routes. If there's a vulnerability allowing unauthorized route registration or manipulation, the attacker registers a malicious route that overlaps with a legitimate one. When a user sends a request intended for the legitimate route, the attacker's malicious route handles it, allowing them to intercept and potentially manipulate the request and response.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Malformed Requests](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos__via_malformed_requests.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attacker identifies specific request handlers in the Rocket application that consume significant resources (CPU, memory, network) when processing certain types of malformed or excessively large requests. The attacker sends a flood of these crafted requests to overwhelm the server, making it unresponsive to legitimate users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Input Validation Issues in Request Handlers](./attack_tree_paths/input_validation_issues_in_request_handlers.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attacker identifies request handlers that do not properly validate or sanitize user-supplied input. By sending malicious input (e.g., excessively long strings, SQL injection payloads, command injection payloads) within request parameters, headers, or body, the attacker can trigger unexpected behavior, errors, or even execute arbitrary code on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [HTTP Request Smuggling](./attack_tree_paths/http_request_smuggling.md)

**Attack Vector:** This attack is relevant if the Rocket application sits behind a proxy or load balancer. The attacker crafts HTTP requests that are interpreted differently by the Rocket server and the upstream proxy. This discrepancy allows the attacker to "smuggle" a second request within the first one, potentially bypassing security controls or directing requests to unintended backend resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [HTTP Response Splitting/Header Injection](./attack_tree_paths/http_response_splittingheader_injection.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the Rocket application allows direct manipulation of HTTP response headers through user input (e.g., setting a header value based on a request parameter), the attacker can inject malicious headers. This can be used to perform client-side attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) by injecting `<script>` tags or to set malicious cookies for session hijacking.

## Attack Tree Path: [Information Disclosure via Error Responses](./attack_tree_paths/information_disclosure_via_error_responses.md)

**Attack Vector:** When the Rocket application encounters errors, it might return detailed error messages to the client. If these error messages contain sensitive information like file paths, internal configurations, or database connection strings, an attacker can analyze them to gain valuable insights into the application's infrastructure and potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Resource Exhaustion via Repeated Error Conditions](./attack_tree_paths/resource_exhaustion_via_repeated_error_conditions.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attacker identifies operations within the Rocket application that are prone to errors and consume resources when an error occurs. By repeatedly triggering these error conditions (e.g., sending invalid input to a database query), the attacker can exhaust server resources, leading to a denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Security Bypass via Error Handling Logic](./attack_tree_paths/security_bypass_via_error_handling_logic.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attacker analyzes the error handling logic within the Rocket application. If there are flaws in how errors are handled, the attacker might be able to trigger specific error conditions that bypass authentication or authorization checks, granting them unauthorized access to protected resources or functionalities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Default Configurations](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_default_configurations.md)

**Attack Vector:** The Rocket framework or the application built upon it might have insecure default configurations. Examples include enabling debug mode in production, overly permissive Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies, or using default credentials. Attackers can exploit these defaults to gain unauthorized access or perform malicious actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exposure of Configuration Files](./attack_tree_paths/exposure_of_configuration_files.md)

**Attack Vector:** If configuration files containing sensitive information (e.g., API keys, database credentials) are accessible through the web server (due to misconfiguration or lack of access control), an attacker can retrieve these files, gaining access to critical secrets.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Third-Party Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_third-party_dependencies.md)

**Attack Vector:** The Rocket application relies on various third-party libraries. Attackers can identify the dependencies and their versions. If known vulnerabilities exist in these dependencies, attackers can exploit them to achieve various malicious outcomes, including Remote Code Execution, Denial of Service, or Information Disclosure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Asynchronous Request Handling Issues](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_asynchronous_request_handling_issues.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the Rocket application uses asynchronous request handling and it's not implemented securely, race conditions or inconsistent state management can occur. Attackers can send concurrent requests to trigger these vulnerabilities, leading to unintended states, data corruption, or bypasses of security checks.
