# Attack Surface Analysis for rwf2/rocket

## Attack Surface: [Improperly Defined or Overly Permissive Route Parameters and Guards](./attack_surfaces/improperly_defined_or_overly_permissive_route_parameters_and_guards.md)

*   **Description:**  Loosely defined route parameters or vulnerabilities in custom guard logic can allow attackers to access unintended resources or trigger unexpected behavior.
    *   **How Rocket Contributes:** Rocket's routing system relies on developers defining route parameters and optional guards for authorization and validation. Weakly defined parameters or flawed guard logic directly expose this attack surface.
    *   **Example:** A route defined as `/users/<id>` without proper validation on `id` could allow an attacker to try accessing arbitrary IDs, potentially including sensitive administrative accounts if guards are not in place or are flawed. A guard that checks for admin status might have a logic error allowing non-admins to pass.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data, modification of resources, privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize strong typing in route parameters (e.g., `i32`, `Uuid`) to enforce basic validation.
        *   Implement custom guards with thorough validation logic, ensuring all necessary checks are performed.
        *   Adhere to the principle of least privilege when defining route access and guard permissions.
        *   Regularly review and test guard logic for potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in `FromForm` and `FromQuery` Implementations](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in__fromform__and__fromquery__implementations.md)

*   **Description:**  Custom types implementing the `FromForm` or `FromQuery` traits might contain vulnerabilities in their deserialization logic, leading to unexpected data processing or even code execution.
    *   **How Rocket Contributes:** Rocket leverages these traits to automatically parse form and query data into Rust types. If the developer-provided implementation is flawed, it becomes an attack vector.
    *   **Example:** A custom `FromForm` implementation for a struct might not properly handle unexpected data types or sizes, leading to buffer overflows or logic errors when the data is used later. An attacker could craft malicious form data to exploit this.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, denial of service, potentially remote code execution if deserialized data is used unsafely.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly test `FromForm` and `FromQuery` implementations with various valid and invalid inputs.
        *   Use established and well-vetted deserialization libraries if possible.
        *   Implement robust validation after deserialization to ensure the data meets expected constraints.
        *   Be cautious when deserializing data into complex types and consider potential attack vectors.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious or Vulnerable Fairings](./attack_surfaces/malicious_or_vulnerable_fairings.md)

*   **Description:** Fairings are Rocket's mechanism for intercepting and processing requests and responses. Malicious or poorly written fairings can introduce vulnerabilities or compromise the application's security.
    *   **How Rocket Contributes:** Rocket's architecture allows developers to create and register fairings, which have significant control over the request/response lifecycle. This extensibility can be a vulnerability if fairings are not carefully vetted.
    *   **Example:** A malicious fairing could intercept all incoming requests and log sensitive data, modify request headers, or even inject malicious scripts into responses. A vulnerable fairing might have a bug that an attacker can exploit.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access, cross-site scripting (XSS), denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully vet all third-party fairings before using them in your application.
        *   Implement thorough testing for custom fairings to identify potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Follow secure coding practices when developing fairings.
        *   Consider the principle of least privilege when granting permissions to fairings.
