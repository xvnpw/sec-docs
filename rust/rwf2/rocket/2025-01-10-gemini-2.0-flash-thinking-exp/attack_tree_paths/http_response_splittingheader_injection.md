## Deep Analysis: HTTP Response Splitting/Header Injection in Rocket Application

This document provides a deep dive into the "HTTP Response Splitting/Header Injection" attack path within a Rocket web application, as requested. We will analyze the mechanics of the attack, its potential impact, specific considerations for the Rocket framework, and recommended mitigation strategies.

**Vulnerability Overview:**

HTTP Response Splitting/Header Injection exploits a weakness in how web servers and applications construct HTTP responses. If an application allows untrusted data to directly influence the HTTP response headers, an attacker can inject malicious characters, specifically Carriage Return (CR - `\r`, ASCII 13) and Line Feed (LF - `\n`, ASCII 10). These characters, when appearing in a specific sequence (`\r\n`), signify the end of an HTTP header. By injecting this sequence, an attacker can effectively:

1. **Terminate the current set of headers.**
2. **Inject new, arbitrary headers.**
3. **Potentially inject a malicious HTTP response body.**

**Technical Deep Dive:**

The core of the vulnerability lies in the interpretation of the `\r\n` sequence by HTTP clients (browsers). A properly formed HTTP response has headers separated by `\r\n`, and the headers are separated from the body by an empty line (`\r\n\r\n`).

**How the Attack Works:**

1. **Attacker Input:** The attacker identifies an input point in the Rocket application that is used to construct HTTP response headers. This could be a URL parameter, a form field, or any other source of user-controlled data.

2. **Malicious Payload:** The attacker crafts a malicious payload containing the `\r\n` sequence followed by the desired injected headers and potentially a malicious body.

3. **Application Processing:** The vulnerable Rocket application takes the attacker's input and incorporates it into an HTTP response header without proper sanitization or encoding.

4. **Response Construction:** The server constructs the HTTP response, embedding the attacker's injected payload.

5. **Client Interpretation:** The client (browser) receives the response and interprets the injected `\r\n` sequence as the end of the intended headers. It then processes the attacker's injected headers and potentially the malicious body.

**Example Payload:**

Let's assume the vulnerable application uses a URL parameter `redirect_url` to set a `Location` header for redirection:

```
// Vulnerable code (conceptual - might not be exact Rocket syntax)
#[get("/redirect?<redirect_url>")]
fn redirect(redirect_url: String) -> Redirect {
    Redirect::to(redirect_url)
}
```

An attacker could craft a URL like this:

```
/redirect?redirect_url=https://example.com/%0d%0aSet-Cookie: malicious_cookie=evil%0d%0a%0d%0a<script>alert('XSS')</script>
```

**Decoded Payload Breakdown:**

* `https://example.com/`: The intended redirect URL (potentially legitimate to avoid immediate suspicion).
* `%0d%0a`: URL-encoded representation of `\r\n`. This terminates the `Location` header.
* `Set-Cookie: malicious_cookie=evil`: An injected header setting a malicious cookie.
* `%0d%0a`: Another `\r\n` to separate the injected headers from the potential body.
* `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`: An injected malicious script tag, representing a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack.

**Attack Steps:**

1. **Identify Vulnerable Input:** The attacker identifies a part of the application where user input directly influences HTTP response headers. This could involve analyzing the application's routing logic, examining how headers are set, or through fuzzing techniques.

2. **Craft Malicious Payload:** The attacker crafts a payload containing the necessary `\r\n` sequences and the desired malicious headers and/or body.

3. **Inject Payload:** The attacker submits the crafted payload through the identified input vector (e.g., URL parameter, form field).

4. **Server Processes and Constructs Response:** The vulnerable Rocket application incorporates the malicious payload into the HTTP response headers.

5. **Client Receives and Interprets Malicious Response:** The user's browser receives the crafted response and executes the injected malicious code or sets the injected cookies.

**Impact and Consequences:**

Successful HTTP Response Splitting/Header Injection can lead to various severe consequences:

* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By injecting `<script>` tags, attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser within the context of the vulnerable domain. This can be used to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, deface the website, or perform other malicious actions.
* **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can inject `Set-Cookie` headers to set malicious cookies on the user's browser. If the application relies on these cookies for authentication or session management, the attacker can effectively hijack the user's session.
* **Cache Poisoning:** Attackers can inject headers that manipulate caching behavior, potentially serving malicious content to other users who access the same resource through a shared cache.
* **Open Redirect:** While the example uses a redirect, attackers could inject a `Location` header to redirect users to a phishing website or other malicious destination.
* **Defacement:** By injecting HTML content into the response body, attackers can alter the visual appearance of the web page.

**Rocket-Specific Considerations:**

While Rocket is a memory-safe language (Rust), which mitigates certain types of vulnerabilities, it doesn't inherently prevent logical flaws like HTTP Response Splitting.

* **Header Manipulation:**  Developers using Rocket need to be cautious when directly setting headers based on user input. The `rocket::http::Header` struct and the `Response` builder provide ways to set headers, but if the values are not properly sanitized, the vulnerability can still exist.
* **Redirection Handling:** If redirection logic in the Rocket application directly uses user-provided URLs without validation, it becomes a prime target for this attack.
* **Custom Header Setting:** Any part of the application that allows setting custom headers based on user input is a potential attack vector.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

Preventing HTTP Response Splitting requires careful handling of user input and strict control over HTTP header construction. Here are key mitigation strategies:

* **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    * **Disallow CRLF:** The most effective approach is to strictly reject any input containing `\r` or `\n` characters.
    * **Encoding:**  While URL encoding might seem like a solution, it's often bypassed by browsers. Directly blocking or stripping CRLF is preferred.
    * **Contextual Validation:**  Understand the expected format of the input and validate it against that format.

* **Secure Header Setting Mechanisms:**
    * **Framework-Provided Methods:** Utilize Rocket's built-in mechanisms for setting headers. These often provide some level of encoding or escaping, but developers still need to be mindful of the data being passed.
    * **Avoid Direct String Manipulation:**  Refrain from directly concatenating user input into header strings.

* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While not a direct mitigation for response splitting, a strong CSP can limit the damage caused by injected scripts.

* **HTTPOnly and Secure Flags for Cookies:** Setting these flags on cookies can help prevent session hijacking even if malicious cookies are injected.

* **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:**  Proactively identify potential vulnerabilities in the codebase.

* **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs):** WAFs can detect and block malicious requests containing CRLF sequences.

**Detection and Monitoring:**

* **Log Analysis:** Monitor application logs for suspicious patterns, such as URL-encoded CRLF characters in request parameters or unusual header values.
* **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):**  IDS can be configured to detect patterns indicative of HTTP Response Splitting attacks.
* **Security Scanning Tools:** Utilize vulnerability scanners that can identify this type of flaw.

**Conclusion:**

HTTP Response Splitting/Header Injection is a serious vulnerability that can have significant consequences for users and the application. In the context of a Rocket application, developers must be vigilant in how they handle user input that influences HTTP response headers. Implementing robust input validation, utilizing secure header setting mechanisms, and employing defense-in-depth strategies are crucial for preventing this type of attack. Regular security assessments and code reviews are essential to ensure the application remains resilient against this threat. By understanding the mechanics of the attack and implementing appropriate safeguards, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of this vulnerability being exploited.
