# Threat Model Analysis for rwf2/rocket

## Threat: [Malicious Route Injection](./threats/malicious_route_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts requests with URLs that, due to insecure dynamic route generation or insufficient input validation on route parameters *within Rocket's routing mechanisms*, are interpreted as valid routes leading to unintended handlers. The attacker might manipulate Rocket's routing logic to bypass authentication, access restricted resources, or trigger unintended functionality.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionalities, potential for privilege escalation, or triggering unintended application behavior.

**Affected Component:** `rocket::Route`, `rocket::Router`, application-defined route handling logic.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid dynamic route construction based on untrusted input.
*   Strictly validate and sanitize any data used to define or match routes *before using it with Rocket's routing API*.
*   Utilize Rocket's built-in route guards for authentication and authorization.
*   Employ strong typing and pattern matching for route parameters.

## Threat: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) via Rocket's Templating](./threats/server-side_template_injection__ssti__via_rocket's_templating.md)

**Description:** If the application utilizes *Rocket's built-in templating features* and incorporates untrusted user input directly into templates without proper sanitization or escaping, an attacker can inject malicious template code. This code is then executed on the server when the template is rendered *by Rocket's templating engine*, allowing the attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code, read sensitive files, or perform other malicious actions.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), full server compromise, data breach.

**Affected Component:** `rocket::serde::Template`, template rendering logic.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always sanitize and escape user-provided data before rendering it in templates *using Rocket's provided mechanisms or a secure templating engine*.
*   Avoid dynamic template generation based on untrusted input.
*   Consider using a logic-less templating language where possible.

## Threat: [Data Races and Concurrency Issues in Asynchronous Handlers](./threats/data_races_and_concurrency_issues_in_asynchronous_handlers.md)

**Description:** *Due to Rocket's asynchronous nature*, if multiple asynchronous handlers share mutable state without proper synchronization primitives, it can lead to data races. This can result in unpredictable behavior, data corruption, and potentially exploitable vulnerabilities within the application logic handled by Rocket.

**Impact:** Data corruption, application crashes, potential for exploitable vulnerabilities due to inconsistent state.

**Affected Component:** Asynchronous route handlers, shared mutable data.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Be mindful of shared mutable state in asynchronous handlers.
*   Utilize Rust's concurrency primitives (e.g., `Mutex`, `RwLock`, `mpsc::channel`) to ensure safe access and modification of shared data within Rocket handlers.
*   Consider using message passing for inter-task communication instead of directly sharing mutable state.
