## Mitigation Strategy: [Rocket TLS/HTTPS Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/rocket_tlshttps_configuration.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Rocket TLS/HTTPS Configuration

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Obtain TLS Certificates:** Acquire TLS certificates for your domain (e.g., using Let's Encrypt).
    *   **Step 2: Configure `Rocket.toml` or Programmatic Configuration:**  In your `Rocket.toml` configuration file, or programmatically within your Rust code using `rocket::config::Config`, specify the paths to your TLS certificate (`cert`) and private key (`key`) files.  Ensure you are configuring the `tls` section.
    *   **Step 3: Enforce HTTPS Redirection (using Fairings or Routes):** Implement a Rocket fairing or a dedicated route that intercepts HTTP requests (port 80) and redirects them to their HTTPS counterparts (port 443). This ensures all traffic is encrypted. A simple fairing can be created to add a redirect header.
    *   **Step 4: Programmatic TLS Configuration for Advanced Options:** For finer control over TLS settings (like minimum TLS version, cipher suites), use Rocket's programmatic configuration.  Access the `Config` builder and utilize methods to set TLS options.  While `Rocket.toml` handles basic cert/key paths, programmatic config is needed for advanced TLS hardening.
    *   **Step 5: Test with Rocket's Built-in TLS Support:**  Run your Rocket application and verify that it is serving content over HTTPS using the configured certificates. Use browser developer tools or online SSL checkers to confirm the TLS setup.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (High Severity):** Without Rocket's TLS configuration, communication is in plaintext, allowing interception and data theft.
    *   **Data Eavesdropping (High Severity):** Unencrypted traffic allows passive monitoring and capture of sensitive data.
    *   **Session Hijacking (High Severity):** Session tokens transmitted over HTTP are vulnerable to theft.
    *   **Data Tampering (Medium Severity):**  Attackers can modify unencrypted data in transit.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **MitM, Eavesdropping, Session Hijacking, Data Tampering:** High impact reduction. Rocket's TLS configuration, when properly implemented, directly encrypts communication, mitigating these threats.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Potentially Partially Implemented:** Basic HTTPS might be enabled using `Rocket.toml` for certificate paths, but advanced programmatic configuration and HTTP redirection using Rocket features might be missing.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Programmatic TLS Hardening:**  Explicitly setting strong TLS options programmatically within Rocket's configuration beyond basic certificate paths.
    *   **Rocket Fairing/Route for HTTP Redirection:**  Using Rocket's fairing or routing system to ensure consistent HTTP to HTTPS redirection.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation with Rocket Route Guards](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_with_rocket_route_guards.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Input Validation with Rocket Route Guards

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Identify Route Input Points:**  Locate all Rocket routes that accept user input (path parameters, query parameters, request bodies - using `Data`, `Form`, `Json`, etc.).
    *   **Step 2: Implement Route Guards:** For each route accepting input, create and apply Rocket route guards.  These guards can be custom structs implementing `FromRequest` or use built-in guards like `Form`, `Json`, `Query`.
    *   **Step 3: Validation Logic within Guards:** Inside your route guards' `FromRequest` implementation, add validation logic. This includes:
        *   **Data Type and Format Checks:** Ensure input conforms to expected types and formats (e.g., using Rust's type system, regular expressions, parsing libraries).
        *   **Business Rule Validation:** Enforce application-specific business rules on the input data.
        *   **Error Handling in Guards:** If validation fails within a guard, return `Outcome::Forward` or `Outcome::Failure` with an appropriate `Status` to prevent the route handler from executing with invalid data.
    *   **Step 4: Utilize Rocket's Data Guards:** Leverage Rocket's built-in data guards (`Form`, `Json`, `Data`, `Query`) to automatically deserialize and validate structured input into Rust types. This provides initial type-level validation.
    *   **Step 5: Sanitize within Route Handlers (Post-Guard):** After successful validation by guards, perform sanitization within route handlers *if necessary* before using input in sensitive operations (database queries, HTML rendering).  While guards validate, sanitization is output-context specific and might be needed in handlers.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Medium to High Severity):**  Insufficient input validation in Rocket routes can lead to XSS if unsanitized input is rendered in HTML.
    *   **SQL Injection (High Severity):**  Lack of validation in routes can allow malicious input to be used in database queries, leading to SQL injection.
    *   **Command Injection (High Severity):**  Unvalidated input in routes can be exploited for command injection if used in shell commands.
    *   **Path Traversal (Medium Severity):**  Routes accepting file paths without validation are vulnerable to path traversal.
    *   **Integer Overflow/Underflow (Medium Severity):**  Routes handling numerical input without validation can be susceptible to integer overflow/underflow.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS, SQL Injection, Command Injection, Path Traversal, Integer Overflow:** High impact reduction. Rocket route guards are a direct mechanism within the framework to enforce input validation, mitigating these injection vulnerabilities.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Potentially Partially Implemented:** Basic data type validation might be implicitly used with Rocket's data guards.  However, custom route guards and comprehensive validation logic within guards are likely missing.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Custom Route Guards for Validation:**  Extensive use of custom Rocket route guards to implement detailed validation logic for all input points.
    *   **Business Rule Validation in Guards:**  Enforcing application-specific business rules within Rocket route guards.
    *   **Consistent Guard Application:**  Ensuring all routes accepting user input are protected by appropriate Rocket route guards.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rocket Custom Error Handling](./mitigation_strategies/rocket_custom_error_handling.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Rocket Custom Error Handling

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Implement Rocket Error Catchers:** Utilize Rocket's "catchers" feature to define custom error handlers for different HTTP status codes (e.g., 404, 500).  Register these catchers using `rocket().register(catchers![...])`.
    *   **Step 2: Generic Production Error Responses in Catchers:** Within your custom error catchers, especially for 500 Internal Server Error, ensure you return generic, non-revealing error responses to clients in production environments. Avoid displaying stack traces or internal details.
    *   **Step 3: Differentiate Development vs. Production Error Output (using Rocket Config):** Use Rocket's configuration (e.g., `Environment::active()`) to conditionally provide more detailed error information in development environments (for debugging) while maintaining generic responses in production.
    *   **Step 4: Log Detailed Errors Server-Side (within Catchers):**  Inside your custom error catchers, implement server-side logging to capture detailed error information (stack traces, request details) for debugging and security monitoring. Ensure logs are stored securely and not publicly accessible.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Rocket's default error pages can leak sensitive information. Custom catchers prevent this.
    *   **Stack Trace Exposure (Medium Severity):** Default error handling might expose stack traces. Custom catchers allow suppression in production.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure, Stack Trace Exposure:** Medium impact reduction. Rocket's custom error catchers directly control error responses, preventing information leakage.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Potentially Partially Implemented:** Basic custom error pages (e.g., for 404) might be implemented using Rocket catchers. However, robust handling of 500 errors and environment-aware error output might be missing.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Custom 500 Error Catcher:**  Specific custom catcher for 500 Internal Server Error to provide generic responses in production.
    *   **Environment-Aware Error Handling in Rocket:**  Using Rocket's configuration to differentiate error output between development and production within catchers.
    *   **Server-Side Logging in Catchers:**  Implementing error logging within Rocket's custom error catchers.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting using Rocket Fairings](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_using_rocket_fairings.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Rate Limiting using Rocket Fairings

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Create a Rate Limiting Fairing:** Develop a Rocket fairing that implements rate limiting logic. This fairing will intercept incoming requests.
    *   **Step 2: Rate Limiting Logic in Fairing:** Within the fairing's `on_request` method, implement rate limiting logic. This typically involves:
        *   Identifying the client (e.g., by IP address, user authentication).
        *   Tracking request counts per client within a time window (e.g., using a data structure like a HashMap or an external store like Redis).
        *   Checking if the request count exceeds the defined limit.
        *   If limit exceeded, return `Outcome::Failure` with `Status::TooManyRequests` (429). Otherwise, proceed with the request (`Outcome::Forward`).
    *   **Step 3: Apply Fairing to Rocket Instance:** Register your rate limiting fairing with your Rocket instance using `rocket().attach(...)`. You can apply it globally or selectively to specific routes using route-specific fairings (if Rocket supports this level of granularity - check Rocket documentation for latest features).
    *   **Step 4: Configure Rate Limits:**  Make rate limits configurable (e.g., through environment variables or Rocket configuration files) to easily adjust them without code changes.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (Medium to High Severity):** Rocket fairing-based rate limiting on login routes mitigates brute-force attempts.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks (Medium to High Severity):** Fairing-based rate limiting can reduce the impact of request flooding DoS attacks.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Rate limiting prevents excessive requests from overwhelming server resources.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Brute-Force, DoS, Resource Exhaustion:** Medium to High impact reduction. Rocket fairings provide a framework-integrated way to implement rate limiting, directly mitigating these threats within the application.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Not Implemented:** Rate limiting fairings are custom implementations and are not part of Rocket's default setup.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Rate Limiting Fairing Development:**  Creating a custom Rocket fairing to handle rate limiting logic.
    *   **Fairing Registration:**  Attaching the rate limiting fairing to the Rocket application instance.
    *   **Rate Limit Configuration:**  Making rate limits configurable for easy adjustment.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Security Headers using Rocket Fairings](./mitigation_strategies/security_headers_using_rocket_fairings.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Security Headers using Rocket Fairings

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Create a Security Headers Fairing:** Develop a Rocket fairing dedicated to adding security-related HTTP headers to responses.
    *   **Step 2: Header Setting in Fairing:** Within the fairing's `on_response` method, add the desired security headers to the `Response` object.  Use `response.set_header(...)` to add headers like:
        *   `Content-Security-Policy`
        *   `X-Frame-Options`
        *   `X-Content-Type-Options`
        *   `Referrer-Policy`
        *   `Permissions-Policy`
        *   `Strict-Transport-Security` (if not already handled separately).
    *   **Step 3: Configure Header Values in Fairing:**  Set appropriate values for each security header within the fairing's code.  Make these values configurable if needed (e.g., through environment variables or Rocket configuration).
    *   **Step 4: Apply Security Headers Fairing:** Register your security headers fairing with your Rocket instance using `rocket().attach(...)`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Medium to High Severity):** `Content-Security-Policy` header (set via Rocket fairing) mitigates XSS.
    *   **Clickjacking (Medium Severity):** `X-Frame-Options` and `CSP frame-ancestors` (via fairing) prevent clickjacking.
    *   **MIME-Sniffing Attacks (Low to Medium Severity):** `X-Content-Type-Options` (via fairing) prevents MIME-sniffing.
    *   **Referrer Leakage (Low Severity):** `Referrer-Policy` (via fairing) controls referrer information.
    *   **Feature Policy Abuse (Low to Medium Severity):** `Permissions-Policy` (via fairing) controls browser features.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS, Clickjacking, MIME-Sniffing, Referrer Leakage, Feature Policy Abuse:** Medium to High impact reduction. Rocket fairings are the framework's mechanism to easily add security headers, directly mitigating these client-side vulnerabilities.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Not Implemented:** Security header fairings are custom and not part of default Rocket setup (except potentially HSTS if configured with TLS).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Security Headers Fairing Development:** Creating a Rocket fairing to manage security headers.
    *   **Fairing Registration:** Attaching the security headers fairing to the Rocket application.
    *   **Header Value Configuration:**  Setting appropriate values for security headers within the fairing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rocket Framework and Ecosystem Updates](./mitigation_strategies/rocket_framework_and_ecosystem_updates.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Rocket Framework and Ecosystem Updates

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Monitor Rocket Releases:** Regularly check for new releases of the Rocket framework on crates.io, GitHub, or Rocket's official communication channels.
    *   **Step 2: Review Release Notes:** When new Rocket versions are released, carefully review the release notes, paying close attention to security-related fixes, vulnerability patches, and recommended upgrade paths.
    *   **Step 3: Update Rocket Dependency in `Cargo.toml`:** Update the `rocket` dependency version in your project's `Cargo.toml` file to the latest stable and secure version.
    *   **Step 4: Run `cargo update`:** Execute `cargo update` to update your project's dependencies, including Rocket, to the specified versions.
    *   **Step 5: Test Application After Update:** After updating Rocket, thoroughly test your application to ensure compatibility and that no regressions have been introduced. Pay special attention to routes, guards, fairings, and any areas that might be affected by framework changes.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Known Rocket Framework Vulnerabilities (Variable Severity):**  Outdated Rocket versions might contain known security vulnerabilities that have been fixed in newer releases. Severity depends on the specific vulnerability.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Known Rocket Framework Vulnerabilities:** Medium to High impact reduction. Keeping Rocket updated ensures you benefit from security patches and vulnerability fixes released by the Rocket maintainers, directly addressing framework-specific security issues.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Potentially Inconsistently Implemented:** Developers might update Rocket occasionally for new features or bug fixes, but security-focused updates might be less systematic or prioritized.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Systematic Rocket Update Process:**  A formal process for regularly monitoring Rocket releases, reviewing security notes, and proactively updating the framework is likely missing.
    *   **Security-Focused Updates:**  Prioritizing Rocket updates specifically for security reasons might not be a consistent practice.
