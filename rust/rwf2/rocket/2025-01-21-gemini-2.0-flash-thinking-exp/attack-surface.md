# Attack Surface Analysis for rwf2/rocket

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal via Route Parameters](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_via_route_parameters.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers can manipulate route parameters, intended to represent file paths, to access files or directories outside the intended scope on the server's file system.
*   **Rocket Contribution:** Rocket's routing system allows capturing path segments as parameters. If developers directly use these parameters in file system operations within handler functions without proper validation, it creates a path traversal vulnerability.
*   **Example:**
    *   Route: `/files/<filepath>`
    *   Handler: `fn serve_file(filepath: String) -> ... { File::open(filepath) ... }`
    An attacker could request `/files/../../etc/passwd` to potentially access the `/etc/passwd` file if the `filepath` parameter is not validated to prevent ".." sequences.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure (reading arbitrary files), potential for data modification or deletion depending on application logic and file system permissions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement robust validation on route parameters used for file paths. Sanitize input to remove or reject path traversal sequences like `..`.
    *   **Path Sanitization:** Utilize secure path manipulation functions provided by the operating system or libraries to resolve paths safely and prevent traversal. Ensure paths are canonicalized and within expected boundaries.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the Rocket application with minimal file system permissions, limiting the impact of potential path traversal vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Flaws in deserialization processes can allow attackers to inject malicious data within serialized formats (like JSON, forms) that, when deserialized by the application, leads to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or other severe impacts.
*   **Rocket Contribution:** Rocket leverages `serde` for deserializing request bodies. Vulnerabilities in `serde` itself, or insecure deserialization practices within Rocket handlers, can introduce deserialization vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:**
    *   A Rocket handler uses `serde_json::from_str` to deserialize a JSON request body into a complex data structure. If a vulnerability exists in `serde_json` or if the application deserializes untrusted data without schema validation, a crafted JSON payload could trigger remote code execution.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution, Denial of Service, Information Disclosure, depending on the nature of the vulnerability and the application's context.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Updates:** Keep `serde` and all deserialization-related dependencies updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Schema Validation:** Implement strict schema validation for deserialized data to ensure it conforms to expected structures and types, preventing unexpected or malicious data from being processed.
    *   **Secure Deserialization Practices:** Avoid deserializing untrusted data directly into complex objects without thorough validation. Consider using safer deserialization methods or libraries if available, and be aware of known deserialization vulnerability patterns.

## Attack Surface: [Header Injection (in specific contexts leading to High Severity)](./attack_surfaces/header_injection__in_specific_contexts_leading_to_high_severity_.md)

*   **Description:**  While often Medium severity, header injection can become High severity when it leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or other significant impacts. Improper handling of HTTP headers can allow attackers to inject malicious content.
*   **Rocket Contribution:** Rocket provides access to request and response headers. If application code reflects header values in responses without proper encoding, or uses them in a way that influences application behavior insecurely, it can be exploited.
*   **Example (XSS via Header Reflection):**
    *   A Rocket handler reflects the `Referer` header in the response body without proper HTML encoding. An attacker can craft a link with a malicious JavaScript payload in the `Referer` header, leading to XSS when the victim clicks the link and the response is rendered.
*   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or malware distribution. In other contexts, it could lead to cache poisoning or session hijacking.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (when leading to XSS or other significant impacts)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Output Encoding:**  Always properly encode header values when reflecting them in response bodies (e.g., HTML encoding for HTML responses).
    *   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize header values if they are used in application logic where injection could be harmful.
    *   **Avoid Direct Reflection:** Minimize or eliminate the practice of directly reflecting user-controlled header values in responses, especially without encoding.

## Attack Surface: [Guard Logic Bypass](./attack_surfaces/guard_logic_bypass.md)

*   **Description:**  Logical flaws or implementation errors in Rocket guards can allow attackers to circumvent intended authorization checks and gain unauthorized access to protected routes and resources.
*   **Rocket Contribution:** Rocket's guard system is central to its security model. Weak or flawed guards directly undermine the application's access control.
*   **Example:**
    *   A guard intended to check for administrator privileges has a logical flaw in its condition evaluation. An attacker might find a way to manipulate request parameters or session state to satisfy the guard's condition even without administrator privileges.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized Access, Privilege Escalation, leading to full compromise of protected resources and functionalities.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the sensitivity of protected resources and the extent of bypass).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rigorous Testing:** Thoroughly test guard logic with diverse scenarios, including valid and invalid inputs, edge cases, and boundary conditions. Use unit tests and integration tests to verify guard behavior.
    *   **Code Reviews:** Conduct peer reviews of guard implementations to identify potential logical flaws, edge cases, and security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Guard Design):** Keep guard logic simple, focused, and easy to understand and verify. Avoid overly complex conditions that can introduce subtle vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Rocket's Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_rocket's_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:**  Rocket relies on a set of Rust crates. Security vulnerabilities discovered in these dependencies can indirectly affect Rocket applications, potentially leading to severe consequences.
*   **Rocket Contribution:** Rocket's security posture is inherently linked to the security of its dependency tree.
*   **Example:**
    *   A critical vulnerability is found in `tokio`, a core asynchronous runtime dependency of Rocket. This vulnerability could potentially be exploited in Rocket applications, allowing for remote code execution or denial of service.
*   **Impact:** Varies widely depending on the specific dependency vulnerability. Can range from Denial of Service to Remote Code Execution, Data Breach, and more.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (potential for Remote Code Execution and other severe impacts)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Automated Dependency Scanning:** Implement automated dependency scanning tools to regularly check Rocket's dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Proactive Dependency Updates:**  Establish a process for promptly updating Rocket's dependencies to patch identified vulnerabilities. Monitor security advisories for Rocket and its dependencies.
    *   **Dependency Management and Pinning (with review):** Use `Cargo.toml` to manage dependencies. While pinning dependencies can provide build stability, regularly review and update pinned versions to incorporate security patches.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Default Configurations (leading to High Severity Exposure)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_default_configurations__leading_to_high_severity_exposure_.md)

*   **Description:**  While Rocket aims for secure defaults, misconfigurations or running in development modes in production can expose sensitive information or functionalities, leading to high severity risks.
*   **Rocket Contribution:** Rocket's configuration options and deployment modes directly influence its security posture.
*   **Example (Running in Debug Mode in Production):**
    *   Deploying a Rocket application in production with debug mode enabled. This typically exposes verbose error pages with stack traces, internal paths, and potentially other sensitive debugging information to attackers, significantly aiding reconnaissance and further attacks.
*   **Impact:** Information Disclosure (sensitive server details, code paths), Unintended Functionality Exposure, potentially facilitating more targeted attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (when leading to significant information disclosure or exposure of sensitive functionalities).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Production-Specific Configuration:**  Ensure Rocket is configured specifically for production environments. **Crucially, disable debug mode in production.**
    *   **Review Configuration Settings:** Thoroughly review all Rocket configuration settings before deploying to production, focusing on security implications.
    *   **Security Hardening Guides:** Follow Rocket's official security best practices and hardening guides for deployment to ensure a secure configuration.
