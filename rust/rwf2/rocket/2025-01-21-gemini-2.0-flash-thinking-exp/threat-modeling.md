# Threat Model Analysis for rwf2/rocket

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization via Rocket Data Binding](./threats/insecure_deserialization_via_rocket_data_binding.md)

* **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input data in a request body. Rocket's data binding automatically deserializes this data. Without proper validation, attackers can exploit deserialization vulnerabilities leading to **arbitrary code execution** or cause **denial of service** by sending excessively large payloads.
    * **Impact:**
        * Arbitrary Code Execution (Critical)
        * Denial of Service (High)
    * **Rocket Component Affected:**
        * Data Binding (Rocket's `data` attribute)
        * Request Handling
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Robust Input Validation:** Implement strong validation *after* Rocket's data binding.
        * **Strict Schema Definition:** Define and enforce schemas for input data.
        * **Limit Request Size:** Configure Rocket to restrict request body size.

## Threat: [Route Overlap or Misconfiguration leading to unintended access](./threats/route_overlap_or_misconfiguration_leading_to_unintended_access.md)

* **Description:** Complex route definitions in Rocket can lead to overlaps, allowing attackers to craft URLs that bypass intended access controls and reach **privileged endpoints**. This can result in **unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality**.
    * **Impact:**
        * Unauthorized Access (High)
        * Privilege Escalation (High)
    * **Rocket Component Affected:**
        * Routing (Rocket's route matching)
        * Route Definitions
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Careful Route Design:** Design clear and non-overlapping route definitions.
        * **Route Ordering Review:** Understand and verify Rocket's route matching order.
        * **Route Guards Enforcement:** Utilize Rocket's route guards for access control.
        * **Thorough Route Testing:** Test route configurations for unintended access paths.

## Threat: [Race Conditions or Data Corruption in Managed State (High Severity aspect)](./threats/race_conditions_or_data_corruption_in_managed_state__high_severity_aspect_.md)

* **Description:** When using Rocket's managed state for shared mutable data across requests, concurrent access without proper synchronization can lead to **data corruption**. This can result in **loss of data integrity** and **application instability**.
    * **Impact:**
        * Data Corruption (High)
    * **Rocket Component Affected:**
        * Managed State (`.manage()`)
        * Concurrency
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Synchronization Primitives:** Employ mutexes, read-write locks, or atomic operations for shared mutable state.
        * **Minimize Shared Mutable State:** Design applications to reduce reliance on shared mutable state.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion due to Unbounded Concurrency or Asynchronous Operations](./threats/resource_exhaustion_due_to_unbounded_concurrency_or_asynchronous_operations.md)

* **Description:** Rocket's asynchronous nature, if not managed, can lead to **resource exhaustion**. Uncontrolled spawning of tasks or long-running operations can consume excessive server resources, causing a **denial of service** as the server becomes unresponsive.
    * **Impact:**
        * Denial of Service (High)
    * **Rocket Component Affected:**
        * Asynchronous Request Handling
        * Task Spawning (in application code)
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Resource Limits and Rate Limiting:** Implement limits on concurrent requests and tasks.
        * **Bounded Concurrency Mechanisms:** Use bounded channels or task pools.
        * **Timeouts for Operations:** Set timeouts for asynchronous operations.
        * **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor server resource usage and adjust limits.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Fairings (Critical Severity aspect)](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_custom_fairings__critical_severity_aspect_.md)

* **Description:** Custom Rocket fairings, if insecurely implemented, can introduce **critical vulnerabilities**. A flawed fairing handling authentication or authorization could lead to **complete authentication bypass** or other severe security breaches, potentially allowing **arbitrary code execution** if the fairing interacts with sensitive system components.
    * **Impact:**
        * Arbitrary Code Execution (Critical - if fairing flaw allows it)
        * Authentication Bypass (Critical)
    * **Rocket Component Affected:**
        * Fairings (Custom fairings)
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical (in worst-case scenarios)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Secure Fairing Development:** Adhere to secure coding practices when creating fairings.
        * **Rigorous Fairing Security Review:** Conduct thorough security reviews and testing of custom fairings.
        * **Principle of Least Privilege in Fairings:** Implement fairings with minimal necessary permissions.
