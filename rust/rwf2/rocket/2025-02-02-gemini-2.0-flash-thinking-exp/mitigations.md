# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for rwf2/rocket

## Mitigation Strategy: [Thoroughly Validate Data within Request Guards](./mitigation_strategies/thoroughly_validate_data_within_request_guards.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Thoroughly Validate Data within Request Guards
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Input Points in Guards:** For each Rocket request guard, pinpoint all input data sources it processes (path, query, headers, body).
    2.  **Define Guard Validation Rules:** For each input, define validation rules based on expected types, formats, ranges, and application logic *within the context of the request guard*.
    3.  **Implement Validation in Guards:** Write Rust code *inside each request guard* to enforce these rules, using libraries like `validator` or custom logic.
    4.  **Handle Guard Validation Failures:** Use `Result` in guards to signal failures. Return `Err` on validation failure.
    5.  **Customize Guard Error Responses:** Configure Rocket to return generic errors for guard failures in production, avoiding internal details. Log detailed errors securely.
    6.  **Test Guard Validation:** Thoroughly test each guard with valid and invalid inputs to ensure effective validation logic.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Input Validation Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Prevents injection attacks, buffer overflows, and issues from unexpected input *processed by Rocket request guards*.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues (Medium Severity):** Reduces data corruption and errors from invalid data entering the system *via Rocket request guards*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Input Validation Vulnerabilities:** High impact. Significantly reduces attack surface related to data handling within Rocket guards.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues:** Medium impact. Improves application stability and data reliability related to Rocket's input processing.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented in the "User Authentication" module for login and registration forms. Basic type checking and presence checks are in place within guards.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Missing in API endpoints related to "Product Management", "Order Processing", and "User Profile Updates". Request guards in these modules lack comprehensive validation, especially for complex data structures.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Securely Handle Request Guard Failures](./mitigation_strategies/securely_handle_request_guard_failures.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Securely Handle Request Guard Failures

    3.  **Generic Production Errors:** In production, configure custom handlers *in Rocket* to return generic errors (e.g., "Bad Request"). Avoid specific details.
    4.  **Secure Guard Failure Logging:** Log detailed error info (guard failure, input, context) securely server-side *within Rocket's logging framework or a custom logging solution*.
    5.  **Error Monitoring for Guards:** Monitor guard failures to detect security issues or attacks *within the Rocket application*.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Prevents leakage of internal paths, stack traces, etc., through *Rocket's error responses for guard failures*.
    *   **Attack Surface Reduction (Low Severity):** Reduces information for attackers *by controlling Rocket's error output for guard failures*.
