# Threat Model Analysis for rwf2/rocket

## Threat: [Unexpected Request Parsing Leading to DoS/RCE](./threats/unexpected_request_parsing_leading_to_dosrce.md)

*   **1. Threat:** Unexpected Request Parsing Leading to DoS/RCE

    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a specially crafted request (e.g., malformed form data, unusual query parameters, or a crafted request body) that exploits a vulnerability in Rocket's parsing logic. The attacker aims to either cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by crashing the server or consuming excessive resources, or, in a more severe scenario, achieve remote code execution (RCE).
    *   **Impact:**
        *   DoS: Application becomes unavailable to legitimate users.
        *   RCE: Attacker gains full control over the server, potentially accessing sensitive data, modifying the application, or using the server for further attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:** `rocket::Request`, `rocket::Data`, custom `FromData` implementations, custom `FromRequest` implementations, request guards, form handling (`rocket::form`), body data handling.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if RCE is possible), High (for DoS).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Fuzz Testing:** Extensively fuzz test all request handlers, particularly those with custom data guards or request guards.
        *   **Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation *before* Rocket's parsing, if possible (e.g., at a reverse proxy). Validate data *after* Rocket's parsing as well.
        *   **Resource Limits:** Enforce strict limits on request body size, number of form fields, and other request parameters using Rocket's configuration options.
        *   **Update Rocket:** Keep Rocket and its dependencies updated to the latest versions to benefit from security patches.
        *   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to prevent crashes and gracefully handle unexpected input.
        *   **Monitoring:** Monitor server logs for unusual request patterns and errors.

## Threat: [Route Collision/Overlap Leading to Incorrect Handler Execution](./threats/route_collisionoverlap_leading_to_incorrect_handler_execution.md)

*   **2. Threat:** Route Collision/Overlap Leading to Incorrect Handler Execution

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a request that matches multiple, ambiguously defined routes. Due to the overlap, Rocket might execute the wrong handler, potentially bypassing intended security checks or leading to unintended behavior.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Bypassed Authentication/Authorization: An attacker might access a resource they shouldn't.
        *   Information Disclosure: The wrong handler might expose sensitive data.
        *   Unexpected Application State: The application might enter an inconsistent or unexpected state.
    *   **Affected Component:** `rocket::Route`, route definition logic, route ranking system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Route Review:** Carefully review all route definitions to ensure there are no overlaps or ambiguities.
        *   **Explicit Ranking:** Use Rocket's route ranking system (`rank` attribute) explicitly to define the precedence of routes.
        *   **Testing:** Thoroughly test all possible request paths to ensure the correct handlers are executed.
        *   **Linting/Static Analysis:** Use a linter or static analysis tool that can detect potential route conflicts.

## Threat: [Unintended Exposure of Internal Routes](./threats/unintended_exposure_of_internal_routes.md)

*   **3. Threat:** Unintended Exposure of Internal Routes

    *   **Description:** An attacker discovers and accesses routes intended for internal use only (e.g., debugging endpoints, administrative interfaces) that were accidentally exposed to the public internet.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Information Disclosure: Exposure of sensitive internal data or configuration.
        *   Unauthorized Access: Attackers might gain administrative privileges or modify the application.
        *   System Compromise: Internal routes might provide entry points for further attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:** `rocket::Route`, route definition logic, deployment configuration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Conditional Compilation:** Use `#[cfg(debug_assertions)]` or similar mechanisms to conditionally compile internal routes only in development builds.
        *   **Authentication/Authorization:** Implement strong authentication and authorization checks on *all* routes, including those intended for internal use.
        *   **Network Segmentation:** Deploy internal services on a separate, firewalled network.
        *   **Reverse Proxy Configuration:** Configure the reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, Apache) to block access to internal routes from external networks.

## Threat: [Fairing-Induced Vulnerability (High-Risk Fairings)](./threats/fairing-induced_vulnerability__high-risk_fairings_.md)

*   **4. Threat:** Fairing-Induced Vulnerability (High-Risk Fairings)

    *   **Description:** A custom fairing that has significant control over request/response processing (e.g., modifies request bodies, headers, or interacts extensively with managed state) introduces a vulnerability, such as bypassing security checks, injecting malicious data, or causing a denial-of-service.  This is specifically focused on fairings with a high potential for impact.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability. Could range from information disclosure to RCE, depending on the fairing's actions.
    *   **Affected Component:** Custom fairing implementations (`rocket::fairing::Fairing`), request/response processing pipeline.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the fairing's functionality and the introduced vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Code Review:** Thoroughly review and audit all custom, high-risk fairings for potential security issues.  Prioritize security over performance.
        *   **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding practices, paying close attention to input validation, output encoding, and error handling.
        *   **Testing:** Extensively test high-risk fairings with a wide variety of inputs, including malicious and edge-case inputs.
        *   **Minimal Functionality:** Keep fairings as simple and focused as possible. Avoid unnecessary complexity.
        *   **Avoid State Manipulation:** If a fairing *must* manipulate state, do so carefully and with proper synchronization, using established concurrency patterns.

## Threat: [Custom Data/Request Guard Bypass](./threats/custom_datarequest_guard_bypass.md)

* **5. Threat:** Custom Data/Request Guard Bypass

    * **Description:** An attacker crafts a request that bypasses the intended logic of a custom `FromData` or `FromRequest` implementation (data guard or request guard). This could allow them to bypass authentication, authorization, or input validation.
    * **Impact:**
        *   Bypassed Authentication/Authorization: Access to protected resources.
        *   Invalid Data: Acceptance of malicious or invalid data.
        *   Unexpected Behavior: The application behaves in an unintended way.
    * **Affected Component:** Custom `FromData` implementations, custom `FromRequest` implementations, request guards.
    * **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Thorough Testing:** Extensively test custom guards with a wide variety of inputs, including malicious and edge-case inputs.
        *   **Code Review:** Carefully review the code of custom guards for potential bypass vulnerabilities.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure guards only grant the minimum necessary access.
        *   **Fail-Safe Design:** Design guards to fail securely (i.e., deny access) if any error or unexpected condition occurs.
        *   **Input Validation:** Perform thorough input validation within the guard.
