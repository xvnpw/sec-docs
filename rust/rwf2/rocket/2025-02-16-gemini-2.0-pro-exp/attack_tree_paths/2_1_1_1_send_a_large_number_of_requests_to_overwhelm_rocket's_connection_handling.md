# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 2.1.1.1 (DoS via Request Flooding)

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the vulnerability of a Rocket-based application to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack achieved by flooding the server with a large number of requests.  We aim to identify specific weaknesses in Rocket's default configuration and common usage patterns that could exacerbate this vulnerability.  Furthermore, we will evaluate the effectiveness of proposed mitigations and suggest best practices for developers.  The ultimate goal is to provide actionable recommendations to enhance the application's resilience against this type of attack.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on attack path 2.1.1.1: "Send a large number of requests to overwhelm Rocket's connection handling."  We will consider:

*   **Rocket Framework Specifics:**  How Rocket handles incoming connections, request queuing, worker threads, and resource allocation.  We'll examine relevant configuration parameters (e.g., `workers`, `max_connections`, `keep_alive`, `read_timeout`, `write_timeout`).
*   **Network Layer:**  While the attack originates at the network layer, we'll focus on how Rocket interacts with the underlying network stack (e.g., TCP/IP) and how this interaction can be exploited.
*   **Application Logic:**  We will briefly consider how application-specific logic *could* amplify the impact of a flood attack (e.g., computationally expensive routes), but the primary focus remains on Rocket's handling of the initial flood.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**  We will analyze the effectiveness of the proposed mitigations (rate limiting, reverse proxy, configuration tuning, WAF) in the context of a Rocket application.
* **Exclusions:** We will *not* delve deeply into operating system-level protections (e.g., SYN cookies, firewall rules at the OS level) or network infrastructure defenses (e.g., DDoS mitigation services provided by cloud providers).  These are important, but outside the scope of this Rocket-focused analysis.  We also won't cover other types of DoS attacks (e.g., slowloris, application-layer attacks).

### 1.3 Methodology

Our analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Rocket Code Review:**  Examine the relevant parts of the Rocket source code (primarily the `rocket` and `rocket_http` crates) to understand how connections and requests are managed.  This includes looking at the underlying Hyper library used by Rocket.
2.  **Configuration Analysis:**  Analyze the default Rocket configuration and how different configuration options affect the server's vulnerability to request flooding.
3.  **Mitigation Evaluation:**  Assess the effectiveness of each proposed mitigation strategy, considering potential limitations and bypass techniques.  This will involve a combination of theoretical analysis and, where possible, practical testing.
4.  **Best Practices Recommendation:**  Based on the analysis, formulate concrete recommendations for developers to minimize the risk of this type of DoS attack.
5.  **Threat Modeling Refinement:** Use the findings to refine the existing threat model and identify any related or cascading vulnerabilities.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 2.1.1.1

### 2.1 Rocket's Connection Handling

Rocket, by default, uses the Hyper library for handling HTTP requests. Hyper is a robust and performant HTTP implementation, but it's still susceptible to resource exhaustion if not configured correctly.  Key aspects of Rocket's connection handling include:

*   **Workers:** Rocket uses a multi-threaded model.  The `workers` configuration parameter determines the number of worker threads that handle incoming requests.  Each worker can handle multiple connections concurrently, up to the `max_connections` limit.
*   **`max_connections`:** This setting limits the total number of concurrent connections the server will accept.  Once this limit is reached, new connections are typically refused (or placed in a backlog queue, depending on the OS and socket configuration).  A low `max_connections` value makes the server more vulnerable to DoS.
*   **`keep_alive`:**  This setting controls whether connections are kept open after a request is completed (HTTP persistent connections).  While `keep_alive` improves performance for legitimate users, it can also allow an attacker to hold connections open, consuming resources.
*   **`read_timeout` and `write_timeout`:** These timeouts control how long Rocket will wait for data to be read from or written to a connection.  Appropriate timeouts are crucial to prevent slow clients (or attackers) from tying up resources.
*   **Request Queuing:**  When all worker threads are busy, incoming requests are typically queued.  The size of this queue is often limited by the operating system's socket backlog setting.  A large backlog can mask the effects of a DoS attack temporarily, but it can also lead to increased latency and eventual connection drops.

### 2.2 Attack Scenario Breakdown

1.  **Attacker Initiates Connections:** The attacker uses a tool (e.g., `ab`, `hping3`, a custom script, or a botnet) to initiate a large number of TCP connections to the Rocket server's listening port (typically 8000 by default).
2.  **Connection Establishment:**  The server's operating system accepts the incoming connections (up to the limits imposed by the OS and Rocket's `max_connections`).
3.  **Resource Consumption:**  Each established connection consumes resources:
    *   **File Descriptors:**  Each connection uses a file descriptor on the server.  Operating systems have limits on the number of open file descriptors.
    *   **Memory:**  Each connection requires some memory for buffers and connection state.
    *   **Worker Threads:**  If a connection sends a request, a worker thread is assigned to handle it.  If all worker threads are busy, the request is queued (or dropped if the queue is full).
4.  **Service Degradation/Denial:**  As the attacker continues to flood the server, one or more of the following occurs:
    *   **Connection Refusal:**  The server reaches its `max_connections` limit and starts refusing new connections.
    *   **Worker Thread Exhaustion:**  All worker threads are busy handling requests (or waiting on slow/malicious clients), preventing new requests from being processed.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:**  The server runs out of file descriptors, memory, or other system resources, leading to crashes or instability.
    *   **Queue Overflow:**  The request queue overflows, causing requests to be dropped.
    *   **Increased Latency:**  Even if the server doesn't completely fail, legitimate users experience significant delays due to the high load.

### 2.3 Mitigation Analysis

Let's analyze the effectiveness of the proposed mitigations:

*   **Rate Limiting:**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  Highly effective.  Rate limiting at the application level (using a Rocket fairing or a middleware crate like `rocket_governor`) can prevent a single IP address or user from sending an excessive number of requests within a given time window.
    *   **Limitations:**  Sophisticated attackers can use distributed attacks (botnets) to circumvent IP-based rate limiting.  Rate limiting needs to be carefully tuned to avoid blocking legitimate users.  It also adds some overhead to request processing.
    *   **Rocket Specifics:** `rocket_governor` is a good choice for implementing rate limiting in Rocket.  It provides flexible configuration options and integrates well with Rocket's fairing system.

*   **Reverse Proxy (Nginx, Apache):**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  Highly effective.  Reverse proxies are designed to handle high traffic loads and can act as a first line of defense against DoS attacks.  They can perform load balancing, connection pooling, request buffering, and caching, offloading work from the Rocket server.
    *   **Limitations:**  Adds complexity to the deployment.  The reverse proxy itself can become a target for DoS attacks.
    *   **Rocket Specifics:**  Rocket applications are often deployed behind a reverse proxy like Nginx.  Nginx can be configured to limit the number of connections, buffer requests, and handle TLS termination, freeing up Rocket to focus on application logic.

*   **Configuration Tuning (`workers`, `max_connections`):**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  Moderately effective.  Setting appropriate values for `workers` and `max_connections` is crucial for performance and resilience.  However, simply increasing these values won't prevent a determined attacker.  It's about finding the right balance for the expected load and available resources.
    *   **Limitations:**  There's a limit to how much you can increase these values.  Excessive values can lead to resource exhaustion.  This mitigation is more about optimizing performance under normal load than preventing a dedicated DoS attack.
    *   **Rocket Specifics:**  Experimentation is key.  Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, file descriptors) under load to determine optimal settings.  Consider the number of CPU cores available and the nature of the application's workload.

*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  Moderately to highly effective.  A WAF can filter out malicious traffic based on various rules and signatures.  It can detect and block common DoS attack patterns.
    *   **Limitations:**  WAFs can be complex to configure and maintain.  They can introduce false positives (blocking legitimate traffic).  They add some latency to request processing.  They are not a silver bullet and should be used in conjunction with other mitigations.
    *   **Rocket Specifics:**  A WAF would typically be deployed in front of the reverse proxy (or directly in front of Rocket if no reverse proxy is used).

### 2.4 Best Practices Recommendations

1.  **Always Use Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting using `rocket_governor` or a similar mechanism.  Configure it based on expected traffic patterns and be prepared to adjust it as needed.
2.  **Deploy Behind a Reverse Proxy:** Use Nginx or Apache as a reverse proxy.  Configure the reverse proxy to handle connection limits, request buffering, and TLS termination.
3.  **Tune Rocket Configuration:** Carefully configure `workers`, `max_connections`, `keep_alive`, `read_timeout`, and `write_timeout`.  Monitor resource usage and adjust these settings based on observed performance.  Err on the side of shorter timeouts to prevent slow clients from tying up resources.
4.  **Consider a WAF:**  If the application is handling sensitive data or is a high-value target, deploy a WAF to provide an additional layer of defense.
5.  **Monitor and Alert:**  Implement robust monitoring and alerting to detect and respond to DoS attacks quickly.  Monitor key metrics like request rate, error rate, latency, and resource usage.
6.  **Test Regularly:**  Perform regular load testing and penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities and validate the effectiveness of mitigations.  Use tools like `ab` or `wrk` to simulate DoS attacks in a controlled environment.
7.  **Prepare an Incident Response Plan:**  Have a plan in place to respond to DoS attacks.  This plan should include steps for identifying the attack, mitigating its impact, and restoring service.
8. **Use Asynchronous Tasks Where Possible:** If your application performs long-running or blocking operations, consider using asynchronous tasks (e.g., `rocket::tokio::task::spawn`) to avoid tying up worker threads.

### 2.5 Threat Model Refinement

This deep analysis highlights the importance of considering the interplay between Rocket's configuration, the underlying network stack, and application logic.  It also reinforces the need for a layered defense approach.  We should update the threat model to:

*   **Emphasize the importance of rate limiting and reverse proxies.** These are the most effective mitigations for this specific attack.
*   **Include specific configuration parameters** (e.g., `workers`, `max_connections`, timeouts) as potential attack vectors or mitigation points.
*   **Add a note about the potential for application logic to amplify the impact of a DoS attack.**  For example, a computationally expensive route could be targeted to exhaust CPU resources even with a relatively small number of requests.
* **Consider adding attack paths related to slowloris and other connection-based attacks.** While not the focus of this deep dive, they are related and should be considered in a comprehensive threat model.

This deep analysis provides a strong foundation for securing Rocket applications against DoS attacks via request flooding. By implementing the recommended best practices and regularly reviewing the threat model, developers can significantly improve the resilience of their applications.
