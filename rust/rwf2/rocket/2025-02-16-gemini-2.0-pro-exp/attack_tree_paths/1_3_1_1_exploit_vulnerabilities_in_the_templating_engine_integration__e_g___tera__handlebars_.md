# Deep Analysis: Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in Rocket Applications

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the risks associated with Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerabilities in Rocket web applications, specifically targeting the integration with templating engines (e.g., Tera, Handlebars, as mentioned in the attack tree).  We aim to:

*   Identify specific attack vectors related to SSTI in the context of Rocket.
*   Assess the feasibility and potential impact of these attacks.
*   Propose concrete, actionable mitigation strategies beyond the high-level mitigations already listed.
*   Provide developers with clear guidance on secure coding practices to prevent SSTI.
*   Develop testing strategies to detect and prevent SSTI vulnerabilities.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on attack path **1.3.1.1: Exploit vulnerabilities in the templating engine integration (e.g., Tera, Handlebars)**.  We will consider:

*   **Rocket Framework:**  How Rocket handles template rendering and data passing to templates.  We'll examine relevant Rocket documentation and source code (if necessary) to understand its built-in security features and potential weaknesses.
*   **Templating Engines:**  We'll focus on Tera and Handlebars, but the principles will generally apply to other templating engines used with Rocket.  We'll investigate known vulnerabilities and common misconfigurations in these engines.
*   **User Input:**  We'll analyze how user-supplied data can reach the templating engine and how this data can be manipulated to trigger SSTI.  This includes data from forms, URL parameters, headers, and cookies.
*   **Application Logic:**  We'll consider how the application's specific logic might inadvertently expose SSTI vulnerabilities, even if the templating engine itself is configured securely.
*   **Output Context:** We will analyze how output is rendered and what are potential risks.

We will *not* cover:

*   Other attack vectors outside of SSTI.
*   Vulnerabilities in the Rocket framework itself that are *not* related to template rendering.
*   Client-side template injection (which is a different vulnerability).

### 1.3 Methodology

Our analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Literature Review:**  We'll review existing research, articles, and documentation on SSTI, Rocket, Tera, and Handlebars.  This includes OWASP resources, security advisories, and blog posts.
2.  **Code Review (Conceptual):**  We'll conceptually review how a typical Rocket application might integrate with a templating engine, identifying potential areas of concern.  We'll create hypothetical code examples to illustrate vulnerabilities.
3.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  We'll analyze known SSTI payloads and techniques, adapting them to the Rocket/Tera/Handlebars context.
4.  **Mitigation Analysis:**  We'll evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed mitigations and propose additional, more specific recommendations.
5.  **Testing Strategy Development:**  We'll outline a testing strategy, including both static and dynamic analysis techniques, to detect SSTI vulnerabilities.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.3.1.1

### 2.1. Attack Vector Identification

The core attack vector is the unsanitized or improperly sanitized passing of user-controlled data to the templating engine.  Here's a breakdown:

*   **Unsafe Data Handling:** The Rocket application receives user input (e.g., from a form field, URL parameter, or request header) and directly incorporates this input into a template without proper validation or escaping.

*   **Templating Engine Exploitation:** The attacker crafts malicious input that leverages the syntax of the templating engine (Tera or Handlebars) to execute arbitrary code on the server.

*   **Example (Tera):**

    Let's assume a Rocket route that takes a `username` parameter and renders it in a Tera template:

    ```rust
    // Rocket Route (Vulnerable)
    #[get("/hello?<username>")]
    fn hello(username: Option<String>, templates: &State<Tera>) -> Template {
        let mut context = Context::new();
        context.insert("username", &username.unwrap_or_else(|| "Guest".to_string()));
        Template::render("hello", &context)
    }

    // hello.html (Tera Template)
    <h1>Hello, {{ username }}!</h1>
    ```

    An attacker could provide a payload like:
    `http://example.com/hello?username={{7*7}}`
    Result: `<h1>Hello, 49!</h1>`

    More dangerous payload:
    `http://example.com/hello?username={{__tera_one_off_call(name="system", args={"cmd":"ls"})}}`
    This attempts to execute the `ls` command on the server (this specific payload might need adjustments depending on the Tera configuration and available functions).

*   **Example (Handlebars):**

    Similar vulnerabilities can exist with Handlebars.  While Handlebars is generally considered safer due to its logic-less nature, helpers and custom functions can introduce vulnerabilities.

    ```rust
    // Rocket Route (Potentially Vulnerable - depends on helper)
    #[get("/greet?<name>")]
    fn greet(name: Option<String>, handlebars: &State<Handlebars>) -> Template {
        let mut data = HashMap::new();
        data.insert("name", name.unwrap_or_else(|| "User".to_string()));
        Template::render("greet", &data)
    }

    // greet.html (Handlebars Template)
    <h1>Greetings, {{name}}!</h1>
    ```
    If there is custom helper that is not properly sanitizing input, it can be exploited.

### 2.2. Feasibility and Impact Assessment

*   **Feasibility:**  Medium.  Exploiting SSTI requires knowledge of the templating engine's syntax and the application's context.  However, many resources and tools are available to assist attackers.  The prevalence of vulnerable code examples and tutorials online increases feasibility.

*   **Impact:** High (RCE).  Successful SSTI exploitation typically leads to Remote Code Execution (RCE).  The attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially gaining full control of the application and the underlying system.  This can lead to data breaches, system compromise, and denial of service.

### 2.3. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

The initial mitigations are a good starting point, but we need to be more specific:

1.  **Auto-Escaping (Prioritize):**
    *   **Tera:** Tera *does* have auto-escaping enabled by default for HTML.  Ensure this is *not* disabled.  Be extremely cautious when using `{% raw %}` blocks or the `safe` filter, as these bypass auto-escaping.
    *   **Handlebars:** Handlebars escapes HTML by default.  Avoid using triple-stash (`{{{ }}}`) unless you are *absolutely certain* the data is safe.

2.  **Input Sanitization (Defense in Depth):**
    *   **Context-Specific Sanitization:**  Don't just blindly apply a generic sanitization function.  Understand the *expected* data type and format for each template variable.  For example, if a variable is expected to be an integer, validate that it *is* an integer before passing it to the template.
    *   **Whitelist Approach:**  If possible, define a whitelist of allowed characters or patterns for each input.  Reject any input that doesn't match the whitelist.
    *   **Avoid Blacklisting:**  Blacklisting (trying to block specific characters or patterns) is generally less effective than whitelisting, as attackers can often find ways to bypass blacklists.
    *   **Rust Libraries:** Utilize Rust libraries like `validator` or `regex` for robust input validation.

3.  **Templating Engine Updates:**
    *   **Regular Updates:**  Keep Tera, Handlebars, and all related dependencies up-to-date.  Subscribe to security mailing lists or monitor vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE) for these libraries.
    *   **Dependency Management:** Use `cargo`'s dependency management features to ensure you're using the latest secure versions.

4.  **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
    *   **Limited Effectiveness for SSTI:**  CSP is primarily a client-side security mechanism.  It can help mitigate the *impact* of some SSTI attacks (e.g., by preventing the execution of injected JavaScript), but it won't prevent the SSTI itself.  It's a good defense-in-depth measure, but not a primary solution for SSTI.
    *   **Configuration:**  If using CSP, configure it carefully to restrict the sources from which scripts, styles, and other resources can be loaded.

5.  **Sandboxing (Advanced):**
    *   **Template Rendering Isolation:**  Consider running the template rendering process in a sandboxed environment (e.g., a separate process or container) with limited privileges.  This can limit the damage an attacker can do even if they achieve RCE within the templating engine.  This is a complex but highly effective mitigation.

6.  **Secure Coding Practices:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure that the application runs with the minimum necessary privileges.  Don't run the application as root.
    *   **Code Reviews:**  Conduct thorough code reviews, paying close attention to how user input is handled and passed to templates.
    *   **Security Training:**  Provide developers with training on secure coding practices, including SSTI prevention.

7.  **Avoid Dynamic Template Generation:** Do not generate templates dynamically based on user input.  This is extremely dangerous and almost always leads to vulnerabilities.

### 2.4. Testing Strategy

A comprehensive testing strategy should include both static and dynamic analysis:

*   **Static Analysis:**
    *   **Code Review (Manual):**  Manually inspect the code for potential SSTI vulnerabilities, focusing on how user input is used in templates.
    *   **Automated Static Analysis Tools:**  Use static analysis tools (e.g., Clippy, RustSec) to automatically detect potential vulnerabilities.  These tools may not specifically identify SSTI, but they can flag unsafe code patterns that could lead to SSTI.  Look for uses of `raw`, `safe` (Tera), and triple-stash (`{{{ }}}`) (Handlebars).
    *   **Grep/Regex Search:** Use `grep` or similar tools to search the codebase for potentially dangerous patterns, such as the use of user input directly within template tags.

*   **Dynamic Analysis:**
    *   **Fuzzing:**  Use a fuzzer to send a large number of malformed inputs to the application, specifically targeting parameters that are used in templates.  Monitor the application for crashes, errors, or unexpected behavior.
    *   **Penetration Testing:**  Conduct penetration testing, either manually or using automated tools, to specifically attempt to exploit SSTI vulnerabilities.  Use known SSTI payloads and techniques.
    *   **Web Application Scanners:**  Use web application security scanners (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite) to automatically scan the application for SSTI and other vulnerabilities.

*   **Specific Test Cases:**
    *   **Basic Injection:** Test with simple payloads like `{{7*7}}` (Tera) or `{{this}}` (Handlebars) to see if the templating engine is evaluating expressions.
    *   **Context-Specific Payloads:**  Craft payloads that are specific to the templating engine and the application's context.  Try to access server-side objects or execute system commands.
    *   **Bypass Attempts:**  If you have implemented input sanitization, try to bypass it with various encoding techniques or character substitutions.
    *   **Error Handling:**  Test how the application handles errors during template rendering.  Ensure that error messages don't leak sensitive information.

## 3. Conclusion

Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) is a serious vulnerability that can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Rocket web applications.  By understanding the attack vectors, implementing robust mitigation strategies, and employing a comprehensive testing strategy, developers can significantly reduce the risk of SSTI.  The key is to treat all user input as untrusted and to carefully control how this input is used within templates.  Auto-escaping, context-specific input sanitization, and regular security updates are crucial.  A combination of static and dynamic analysis techniques is essential for detecting and preventing SSTI vulnerabilities.
