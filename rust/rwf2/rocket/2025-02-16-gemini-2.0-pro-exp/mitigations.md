## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Configuration Storage (Rocket-Specific Aspects)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_configuration_storage__rocket-specific_aspects_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Leverage Rocket's configuration system correctly to securely manage sensitive data, avoiding hardcoding in `Rocket.toml` or source code.

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Sensitive Data:** List all configuration values needing protection (API keys, database credentials, etc.).
2.  **Choose Storage (Rocket-Aware):**
    *   **Environment Variables:** Use Rocket's built-in support for environment variables. Access them via `std::env::var` within your Rocket application, *not* directly in `Rocket.toml`.  Rocket automatically reads environment variables prefixed with `ROCKET_`.
    *   **Custom Config Providers (Advanced):** For complex scenarios or integration with secrets management services, implement a custom configuration provider for Rocket. This allows you to fetch configuration from external sources securely.
3.  **Remove Hardcoded Secrets:** Eliminate all hardcoded secrets from `Rocket.toml` and your Rust code.
4.  **Access via Rocket's System:** Use `Config::figment()` or the `Rocket::custom()` method to build your Rocket instance, ensuring that configuration is loaded from the chosen secure source (environment variables or your custom provider).
5.  **Typed Configuration:** Utilize Rocket's typed configuration features. Define structs that represent your configuration and use them to deserialize the configuration data. This provides compile-time safety and validation.
6. **Rotation:** Implement secret rotation policy.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Credential Exposure (Severity: Critical):** Prevents attackers from obtaining credentials if they access the source code or `Rocket.toml`.
*   **Configuration Tampering (Severity: High):** Makes it harder to modify configuration maliciously.
*   **Accidental Disclosure (Severity: Medium):** Reduces the risk of accidentally committing secrets.

**Impact:**
*   **Credential Exposure:** Risk significantly reduced (Critical to Low/Negligible).
*   **Configuration Tampering:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Medium/Low).
*   **Accidental Disclosure:** Risk significantly reduced (Medium to Low).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Partially. Environment variables are used for the database connection string, accessed via `std::env::var` in `src/db.rs`.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   API keys are hardcoded in `src/services/third_party.rs`.  These need to be managed via environment variables or a custom config provider.
*   No custom configuration provider is implemented.
*   No secret rotation policy implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Route Matching (Rocket-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_route_matching__rocket-specific_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Use precise route definitions, leveraging Rocket's type-safe routing capabilities to avoid unintended handler execution.

**Description:**
1.  **Review Routes:** Examine all `#[get]`, `#[post]`, etc., attributes in your Rocket application.
2.  **Identify Ambiguity:** Look for routes that could match unintended requests.
3.  **Refine with Rocket Types:** Use Rocket's specific parameter types:
    *   Instead of `"/users/<id>"` use `"/users/<id:usize>"`.
    *   Use `"/files/<filename:PathBuf>"` to ensure `filename` is a valid path segment.
    *   Use `Option<T>` for optional parameters *only* with default values or graceful `None` handling.  Leverage Rocket's support for `Option` in route parameters.
    *   Use custom types and implement the `FromParam` trait for complex parameter validation.
4.  **Test with Rocket's Testing Framework:** Use Rocket's built-in testing framework (`rocket::local::Client`) to write unit tests that specifically verify route matching, including *negative* tests (requests that *shouldn't* match).

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Request Hijacking (Severity: High):** Prevents crafting requests that unintentionally match sensitive routes.
*   **Unexpected Handler Execution (Severity: Medium):** Reduces the risk of handlers running with unexpected input.
*   **Information Disclosure (Severity: Medium):** Limits access, reducing potential leaks through unintended handler calls.

**Impact:**
*   **Request Hijacking:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Medium/Low).
*   **Unexpected Handler Execution:** Risk significantly reduced (Medium to Low).
*   **Information Disclosure:** Risk moderately reduced (Medium to Low/Negligible).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Mostly. Most routes use specific types (e.g., `usize`, `String`).

**Missing Implementation:**
*   `/admin/<action>` in `src/admin.rs` is too broad. Split into more specific routes.
*   More comprehensive unit tests using `rocket::local::Client` are needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Request Guard Validation (Rocket-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/request_guard_validation__rocket-specific_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Extensively use Rocket's request guards to enforce pre-conditions on requests *before* handler execution.

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Validation Needs:** For each route, determine what to validate: HTTP method, headers, body data, authentication, authorization.
2.  **Use Built-in Guards:** Use Rocket's built-in guards:
    *   `MethodGuard`: Check the HTTP method.
    *   `ContentType`: Validate the `Content-Type` header.
    *   `Accept`: Validate the `Accept` header.
3.  **Create Custom Guards:** Implement custom request guards (implementing the `FromRequest` trait) for:
    *   Authentication: Verify user identity (e.g., using JWTs, sessions).
    *   Authorization: Check user permissions.
    *   CSRF Protection: Validate CSRF tokens.
    *   Custom Header Validation: Check for specific headers or header values.
    *   Request Body Validation: Validate the structure and content of the request body (often used in conjunction with `FromData`).
4.  **Apply Guards:** Attach guards to routes using `#[guard]` or by adding them to the `Rocket` instance.
5.  **Fail Fast (Rocket-Specific):** Request guards should return a `rocket::outcome::Outcome` immediately.  Use `Outcome::Failure` with appropriate HTTP status codes (400, 401, 403) to reject invalid requests.
6.  **Test with Rocket:** Use `rocket::local::Client` to test that guards correctly enforce validation and return appropriate error responses.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Authentication Bypass (Severity: Critical):** Authentication guards prevent unauthorized access.
*   **Authorization Bypass (Severity: Critical):** Authorization guards ensure users only access permitted resources.
*   **Invalid Input (Severity: High):** Guards validate data, preventing many injection attacks.
*   **CSRF (Severity: High):** CSRF protection guards mitigate CSRF attacks.
*   **DoS (Severity: Medium):** Guards can limit request body sizes.

**Impact:**
*   **Authentication/Authorization Bypass:** Risk significantly reduced (Critical to Low/Negligible).
*   **Invalid Input:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Medium/Low).
*   **CSRF:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low, with CSRF protection).
*   **DoS:** Risk moderately reduced (Medium to Low).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Basic authentication guards on some routes in `src/api/private.rs`.
*   `ContentType` guard on routes accepting JSON.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   No authorization guards.
*   No CSRF protection.
*   No request body size limits.
*   More comprehensive guards for input validation are needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Fairing Auditing and Management (Rocket-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/fairing_auditing_and_management__rocket-specific_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Carefully review, manage, and order Rocket fairings to minimize vulnerabilities.

**Description:**
1.  **Inventory:** List all fairings (built-in and third-party).
2.  **Source Verification (Third-Party):** Verify the source and reputation of third-party fairing developers.
3.  **Code Review (Third-Party):** Review the source code of all third-party fairings for potential security issues.
4.  **Dependency Updates:** Keep all fairings updated.
5.  **Fairing Ordering (Rocket-Specific):** Understand the order of fairing execution (using `attach` on the `Rocket` instance). Place security-related fairings (authentication, authorization, rate limiting) *early* in the chain.  This ensures they are applied before any potentially vulnerable code.
6.  **Minimal Fairings:** Only use necessary fairings.
7.  **Testing (Rocket-Specific):** Use `rocket::local::Client` to test the application with all fairings enabled, including security testing.  Test how fairings interact with each other.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Code (Severity: High/Critical):** Reduces risk from third-party fairings.
*   **Unexpected Fairing Interactions (Severity: Medium):** Prevents issues from fairing interactions.
*   **Supply Chain Attacks (Severity: High):** Reduces risk by verifying sources and updating.

**Impact:**
*   **Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Code:** Risk significantly reduced (High/Critical to Medium/Low).
*   **Unexpected Fairing Interactions:** Risk moderately reduced (Medium to Low).
*   **Supply Chain Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Medium).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   A few built-in Rocket fairings are used.
*   One third-party fairing (`rocket_cors`).

**Missing Implementation:**
*   No code review of `rocket_cors`.
*   No regular fairing update schedule.
*   Fairing ordering hasn't been explicitly considered.

## Mitigation Strategy: [`FromData` and `FromForm` Implementation (Rocket-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/_fromdata__and__fromform__implementation__rocket-specific_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Carefully implement and validate data received through Rocket's `FromData` and `FromForm` traits to prevent vulnerabilities related to request body parsing.

**Description:**
1. **Understand `FromData` Variants:** Be aware of the differences between `FromDataSimple` (for streaming data) and `FromData` (for buffered data). Choose the appropriate trait based on your needs.
2. **Data Limits:** Set appropriate data limits using `Limits::new()` in your Rocket configuration. This prevents denial-of-service attacks through excessively large request bodies. Configure limits for both the overall request size and individual form fields.
3. **Strict Validation:** Implement thorough validation for any data received through `FromData` or `FromForm`. Use Rocket's built-in validation features (e.g., `validate` crate integration) or implement custom validation logic within your `FromData` or `FromForm` implementation.
4. **Type Safety:** Use strongly-typed structs to represent the data you expect to receive. This helps prevent type confusion vulnerabilities.
5. **Error Handling:** Handle errors gracefully within your `FromData` or `FromForm` implementation. Return appropriate error responses (e.g., 400 Bad Request) if the data is invalid.
6. **Testing:** Use `rocket::local::Client` to test your `FromData` and `FromForm` implementations with various inputs, including valid, invalid, and malicious data.

**Threats Mitigated:**
* **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: Medium):** Data limits prevent attackers from sending excessively large requests.
* **Invalid Input (Severity: High):** Strict validation prevents many types of injection attacks.
* **Type Confusion (Severity: Medium):** Type safety helps prevent vulnerabilities related to incorrect data types.

**Impact:**
* **DoS:** Risk reduced moderately (from Medium to Low).
* **Invalid Input:** Risk significantly reduced (from High to Medium/Low).
* **Type Confusion:** Risk reduced (from Medium to Low).

**Currently Implemented:**
* `FromForm` is used in several places to handle form data.

**Missing Implementation:**
* Data limits are not explicitly configured.
* Validation is basic and relies primarily on the `validate` crate. More comprehensive custom validation is needed in some cases.
* Error handling within `FromForm` implementations could be improved.
* More thorough testing with `rocket::local::Client` is required.
