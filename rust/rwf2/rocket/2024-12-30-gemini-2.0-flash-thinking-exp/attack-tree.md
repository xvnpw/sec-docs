**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

* **Execute Arbitrary Code on Server [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this node means the attacker has gained the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the application, leading to complete compromise.

* **Exploit Request Handling Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * This attack vector focuses on weaknesses in how the Rocket framework receives, parses, and processes incoming HTTP requests. A successful exploit here allows the attacker to manipulate the request in a way that leads to unintended actions or code execution.

* **Rocket Fails to Sanitize/Handle Properly [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * This node represents a fundamental flaw in Rocket's core functionality. If Rocket fails to properly sanitize or handle incoming data, it creates opportunities for various types of attacks by allowing malicious data to be interpreted as code or to cause unexpected behavior.

* **Exploit Input Validation Weaknesses in Rocket's Request Parsing [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * This focuses on the lack of proper validation of input data within the request (e.g., URL, query parameters, request body) by the Rocket framework itself.

* **Send Crafted Request with Malicious Payload (e.g., path traversal, injection) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    * **Attack Steps:** The attacker crafts a request containing a malicious payload designed to exploit input validation weaknesses in Rocket's request parsing. This could involve techniques like path traversal (accessing unauthorized files) or injection attacks (injecting malicious code into data processed by the application).
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** High
    * **Effort:** Medium
    * **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

* **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Rocket's Header Processing [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    * **Attack Steps:** The attacker sends a request with maliciously crafted HTTP headers. If Rocket doesn't properly handle these headers, it could lead to vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, where excessive data in a header overwrites adjacent memory, potentially allowing for code execution.
    * **Likelihood:** Low
    * **Impact:** Critical
    * **Effort:** High
    * **Skill Level:** Advanced
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

* **Parameter Manipulation Leading to Code Execution [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    * **Attack Steps:** The attacker identifies how route parameters are used by the application and crafts requests to manipulate these parameters in a way that leads to unintended functionality or triggers vulnerabilities that result in code execution. This often involves exploiting a lack of proper validation or sanitization of route parameters.
    * **Likelihood:** Low
    * **Impact:** High
    * **Effort:** Medium
    * **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

* **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Rocket's Error Handling:**
    * This attack vector targets weaknesses in how the Rocket framework handles errors and exceptions.

* **Error Handling Logic Contains Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    * **Attack Steps:** The attacker triggers an error condition within the Rocket application and then exploits vulnerabilities within the error handling code itself. A classic example is a format string bug, where user-controlled input is directly used in a formatting function within the error handling logic, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code.
    * **Likelihood:** Very Low
    * **Impact:** Critical
    * **Effort:** High
    * **Skill Level:** Advanced
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

* **Exploit Dependencies of Rocket (Less Focus, but worth mentioning) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * This attack vector focuses on vulnerabilities present in the external libraries or "crates" that the Rocket framework relies upon.

* **Trigger Vulnerability Through Rocket's Usage [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    * **Attack Steps:** The attacker identifies a known vulnerability in a dependency used by Rocket and then crafts requests or actions that cause Rocket to utilize the vulnerable dependency in a way that triggers the vulnerability. For example, if Rocket uses a vulnerable parsing library, sending malformed data that is processed by that library could trigger the vulnerability.
    * **Likelihood:** Low
    * **Impact:** High
    * **Effort:** Medium to High
    * **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
