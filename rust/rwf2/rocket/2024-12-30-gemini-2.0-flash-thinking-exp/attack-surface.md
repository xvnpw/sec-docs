*   **Attack Surface:** Unvalidated Route Parameters
    *   **Description:**  User-provided data in the URL path is not properly validated or sanitized before being used by the application.
    *   **How Rocket Contributes:** Rocket's routing system allows defining routes with dynamic parameters. If these parameters are directly used in file system operations, database queries (if applicable), or other sensitive logic without validation, it creates an attack vector.
    *   **Example:** A route like `/files/<filename>` where `<filename>` is directly used to open a file. An attacker could provide `../sensitive_data.txt` to attempt path traversal.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to files or resources, potential for command injection (if parameters are used in system calls), or data manipulation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:**  Use Rocket's form guards or manual validation to ensure route parameters conform to expected formats and values.
        *   **Sanitization:**  Remove or escape potentially harmful characters from route parameters before using them.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Avoid directly using route parameters for critical operations like file access. Instead, map them to internal identifiers.

*   **Attack Surface:** Unsafe Handling of Request Body Data (Form Data, JSON, etc.)
    *   **Description:** Data sent in the request body (e.g., through HTML forms or API requests) is not properly validated, sanitized, or deserialized, leading to vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Rocket Contributes:** Rocket provides mechanisms for handling different content types in the request body. If developers don't implement proper validation and sanitization when extracting this data, it becomes an attack vector.
    *   **Example:** A form field intended for a name is used to inject malicious JavaScript code, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) when the data is displayed. Or, improper deserialization of JSON could lead to unexpected object instantiation or denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), injection attacks (e.g., if data is used in database queries), data corruption, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Use Rocket's form guards, JSON deserialization with validation, or manual validation to ensure data conforms to expected types and constraints.
        *   **Output Encoding/Escaping:** When displaying user-provided data in HTML, use appropriate escaping techniques to prevent XSS.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to mitigate the impact of XSS attacks.

*   **Attack Surface:** Server-Side Template Injection (if using templating)
    *   **Description:** User-controlled data is directly embedded into server-side templates without proper sanitization, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **How Rocket Contributes:** If the Rocket application uses a templating engine (like Handlebars or Tera) and developers directly inject user input into templates without escaping, it creates a significant vulnerability.
    *   **Example:**  A comment feature where the comment content is directly rendered using a template. An attacker could inject template syntax to execute commands on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, full server compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use Auto-Escaping:** Ensure the templating engine is configured to automatically escape user-provided data by default.
        *   **Manual Escaping:**  Explicitly escape user input before embedding it in templates where auto-escaping is not sufficient.
        *   **Avoid Raw Template Rendering:**  Minimize the use of raw template rendering for user-provided content.

*   **Attack Surface:** Vulnerabilities in Custom Fairings
    *   **Description:**  Custom fairings, which are used to intercept and modify requests and responses, can introduce vulnerabilities if not implemented securely.
    *   **How Rocket Contributes:** Rocket's fairing system allows developers to extend the framework's functionality. However, poorly written or malicious fairings can introduce security flaws that affect the entire application.
    *   **Example:** A fairing that attempts to implement authentication but has a bypass vulnerability, or a fairing that logs sensitive information insecurely.
    *   **Impact:**  Depends on the vulnerability introduced by the fairing, ranging from authentication bypass to information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Thorough Review:**  Carefully review the code of custom fairings for potential security flaws.
        *   **Security Audits:**  Conduct security audits of custom fairings, especially those handling sensitive operations like authentication or authorization.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure fairings only have the necessary permissions and access to perform their intended functions.
