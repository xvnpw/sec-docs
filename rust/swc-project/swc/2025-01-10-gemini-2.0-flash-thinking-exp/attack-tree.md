## Attack Tree Path: [**[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Exploit Vulnerabilities within SWC Core [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_vulnerabilities_within_swc_core__critical_node_.md)

* **Attacker Goal:** Execute arbitrary code during the SWC compilation process.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Trigger Code Execution during Compilation:**
            * **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Provide Malicious Input Code [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                * **Craft input that exploits parser bugs:**  Attackers craft specific JavaScript/TypeScript code that exploits flaws in SWC's parser. Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution within the compilation process, potentially allowing modification of the compiled output or access to sensitive data available during the build.
                * **Craft input that exploits transformer bugs:** Attackers craft input that targets vulnerabilities in SWC's code transformation logic. This could involve providing code that, when transformed, results in exploitable output or triggers a vulnerability within the transformer itself, leading to code execution during compilation.
                * **Craft input that exploits code generation bugs:** Attackers focus on flaws in how SWC generates the final output code. By providing specific input, they can trigger bugs that lead to the generation of malicious code or the execution of attacker-controlled instructions during the code generation phase.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Exploit Vulnerabilities in SWC Plugins [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_swc_plugins__critical_node_.md)

* **Attacker Goal:** Execute arbitrary code by leveraging vulnerabilities in SWC plugins.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Use Maliciously Crafted Plugin:**
            * **Install a plugin with intentionally malicious code:** Attackers create a malicious SWC plugin and trick developers or the build process into installing it. This plugin can contain code designed to compromise the application during the build or runtime.
        * **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Vulnerabilities in Legitimate Plugins:**
            * **Trigger code execution within the plugin's scope:** Attackers identify and exploit vulnerabilities in legitimate SWC plugins. By providing specific input or manipulating the plugin's environment, they can achieve code execution within the context of the plugin, potentially allowing them to influence the compilation process or access sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Exploit Supply Chain Vulnerabilities Related to SWC [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_supply_chain_vulnerabilities_related_to_swc__critical_node_.md)

* **Attacker Goal:** Compromise the application by exploiting vulnerabilities in SWC's dependencies.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Compromise SWC Dependencies:**
            * **Exploit vulnerabilities in libraries SWC depends on:** Attackers identify and exploit known vulnerabilities in the libraries that SWC directly or indirectly depends on. If SWC uses a vulnerable version of a dependency, attackers can leverage those vulnerabilities to execute code during the build process or potentially at runtime if the vulnerable dependency is included in the final application.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Exploit Misconfigurations or Misuse of SWC](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_misconfigurations_or_misuse_of_swc.md)

* **Attacker Goal:** Execute arbitrary code on the server by exploiting how the application uses SWC.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Server-Side JavaScript Injection via SWC Output:**
            * **SWC incorrectly sanitizes or transforms user-provided code, leading to injectable output:** If the application uses SWC to process user-provided JavaScript or TypeScript code on the server-side and then executes the resulting output, vulnerabilities in SWC's sanitization or transformation logic can allow attackers to inject malicious code. This injected code will then be executed by the server, leading to a server-side JavaScript injection vulnerability.
