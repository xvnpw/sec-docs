# Threat Model Analysis for swc-project/swc

## Threat: [Malicious Input Exploitation](./threats/malicious_input_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious JavaScript or TypeScript code specifically designed to exploit a vulnerability within SWC's parsing logic. This could involve sending this code as input to a process using SWC (e.g., during a build process or through a code upload feature). The attacker aims to trigger a bug in the parser to cause a crash or potentially execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service (DoS) by crashing the SWC process, potentially halting development or deployment pipelines. In severe cases, remote code execution (RCE) on the machine running the SWC compilation if the parser vulnerability allows for memory corruption or control flow manipulation.
    *   **Affected Component:** SWC Parser module (specifically the parsing logic for JavaScript and TypeScript syntax).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep SWC updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        *   Consider using fuzzing techniques on SWC's parser with a wide range of potentially malicious inputs to identify vulnerabilities proactively.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Transformation Rules](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_transformation_rules.md)

*   **Description:** SWC's transformation rules (used for minification, code optimization, or language feature polyfilling) contain bugs or oversights. This could lead to the generation of compiled code with inherent security flaws. For example, an incorrect minification rule might introduce a scope issue, or a faulty polyfill could create an exploitable condition.
    *   **Impact:** Introduction of security vulnerabilities directly into the compiled application. This could range from cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities due to incorrect escaping to more severe issues like prototype pollution or incorrect access control.
    *   **Affected Component:** Specific Transformation modules within SWC (e.g., minifier, polyfill implementations, code optimizer).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Stay updated with SWC releases and monitor for reported issues related to transformation correctness.
        *   Carefully review the transformation options and configurations used in the build process.
        *   Utilize static analysis tools on the *compiled output* to identify potential vulnerabilities introduced by the transformations.

## Threat: [Malicious or Compromised Plugins](./threats/malicious_or_compromised_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** If the application utilizes SWC plugins (either custom or third-party), an attacker could introduce malicious code by compromising a plugin's source or by creating a seemingly benign but malicious plugin. During the SWC compilation process, this malicious plugin can inject arbitrary code into the compiled output or perform other harmful actions on the build system.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the build server or developer machines, allowing the attacker to gain control of the development environment. Injection of malicious code into the final application, leading to various security vulnerabilities affecting end-users (e.g., data theft, unauthorized actions).
    *   **Affected Component:** SWC Plugin System and individual plugin modules.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully vet and audit all third-party SWC plugins before using them.
        *   Implement a robust process for reviewing and auditing custom plugins.
        *   Consider using plugin sandboxing or isolation techniques if available within the SWC ecosystem.

## Threat: [Generation of Vulnerable Code Patterns](./threats/generation_of_vulnerable_code_patterns.md)

*   **Description:** Bugs in SWC's code generation logic could lead to the creation of compiled code that contains known security vulnerabilities. This might involve generating code with insecure defaults, improper escaping, or other common pitfalls that attackers can exploit.
    *   **Impact:** Introduction of exploitable vulnerabilities into the compiled application, such as cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection (if the generated code interacts with databases), or other common web application vulnerabilities.
    *   **Affected Component:** SWC Code Generation modules (specific to the target JavaScript version or output format).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Monitor SWC release notes and issue trackers for reports of code generation bugs.
        *   Utilize static analysis tools on the compiled output to identify potential vulnerabilities.
