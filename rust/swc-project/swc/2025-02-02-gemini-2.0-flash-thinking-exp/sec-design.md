# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, Speedy Web Compiler (SWC), aims to provide a high-performance compiler for web development, specifically targeting JavaScript and TypeScript. The primary business priority is to offer a significantly faster alternative to existing JavaScript tooling like Babel and Terser. The main business goal is to improve developer productivity and reduce build times in web development workflows.

The most important business risks associated with this project are:

- Adoption risk: The risk that developers may not adopt SWC as their primary compiler due to inertia, compatibility issues, or lack of awareness.
- Compatibility risk: The risk that SWC may not be fully compatible with all existing JavaScript and TypeScript ecosystems, frameworks, and libraries, leading to integration challenges for users.
- Performance regression risk: The risk that future updates or changes to SWC may inadvertently degrade its performance, undermining its core value proposition.
- Security vulnerability risk: The risk that security vulnerabilities in SWC itself could be exploited, potentially impacting the security of applications built using it. Given its role in the build process, vulnerabilities could have a wide-reaching impact.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls for the SWC project include:

- security control: Code review - As an open-source project hosted on GitHub, code contributions are likely subject to review by maintainers before being merged. This is implicitly implemented through the GitHub pull request process.
- security control: Static analysis - The Rust programming language, in which SWC is written, has a strong compiler with built-in static analysis capabilities. Rust's type system and borrow checker help prevent many common classes of vulnerabilities. This is implemented by the Rust compiler during development and build processes.
- security control: Dependency management - Rust projects use Cargo for dependency management, which includes mechanisms for tracking and managing dependencies. This is implemented through Cargo.toml and Cargo.lock files.

Accepted risks for the SWC project include:

- accepted risk: Open-source vulnerability disclosure - As an open-source project, vulnerabilities may be publicly disclosed before a patch is available. This is inherent to the open-source development model.

Recommended security controls to implement for high priority:

- security control: Regular security audits - Conduct periodic security audits by external security experts to identify potential vulnerabilities in the codebase and architecture.
- security control: Fuzzing and vulnerability scanning - Implement automated fuzzing and vulnerability scanning tools in the CI/CD pipeline to proactively detect potential security issues.
- security control: Supply chain security measures - Implement measures to ensure the security of dependencies, such as dependency scanning, vulnerability monitoring, and using signed dependencies where possible.

Security requirements for the SWC project are:

- Authentication: Not directly applicable to the core functionality of SWC as it is primarily a command-line tool used in development environments. Authentication might be relevant for access to project infrastructure (e.g., repository, build systems), which should follow standard secure practices.
- Authorization: Not directly applicable to the core functionality of SWC. Authorization is relevant for access control to project resources and infrastructure, which should be managed using role-based access control (RBAC) principles.
- Input Validation: Input validation is critical for SWC. As a compiler, it processes potentially untrusted source code and configuration files. Robust input validation is necessary to prevent vulnerabilities such as code injection, denial-of-service, or unexpected behavior due to maliciously crafted input. Input validation should be implemented at all stages of input processing, including file parsing, configuration loading, and code transformation.
- Cryptography: Cryptography is not a core requirement for the primary compilation functionality of SWC. However, cryptography might be relevant for features related to secure distribution (e.g., code signing of binaries) or for future features that might involve secure processing or handling of sensitive data (though this is not currently a primary use case). If cryptography is used, it should adhere to best practices, using well-vetted libraries and algorithms.

# DESIGN

The SWC project is designed as a command-line interface (CLI) tool and a set of libraries for compiling and transforming JavaScript and TypeScript code. It is built using Rust for performance and safety.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process being protected: The software development and build process for web applications, specifically the code compilation and transformation step. SWC aims to make this process faster and more efficient.

Data being protected: Source code and configuration files processed by SWC. Sensitivity: High. Source code is intellectual property and vulnerabilities in the compiler can lead to compromised applications. Configuration files can contain sensitive settings or influence the behavior of the compiled application.

Data sensitivity classification: Confidential and Integrity are the primary concerns. Confidentiality of source code and integrity of the compiled output are crucial. Availability is also important to ensure developers can rely on SWC for their build processes.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

- What specific SAST tools and linters are currently used in the SWC build process?
- Is dependency vulnerability scanning currently implemented in the CI pipeline? If so, which tools are used?
- Are there plans for regular security audits by external security experts?
- What is the process for handling and patching security vulnerabilities discovered in SWC?
- Are there any specific guidelines or documentation for developers contributing to SWC regarding secure coding practices?

Assumptions:

- BUSINESS POSTURE: It is assumed that the primary business goal of SWC is to provide a faster and more efficient compiler for web development, and that adoption and compatibility are key business risks.
- SECURITY POSTURE: It is assumed that while basic security controls are in place (code review, static analysis), there is room for improvement in proactive security measures like regular security audits, fuzzing, and more comprehensive supply chain security.
- DESIGN: It is assumed that the C4 model accurately represents the high-level architecture of SWC, and that the deployment model is primarily focused on distribution via package managers. It is also assumed that GitHub Actions is used for CI/CD.
