## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2.1 Supply Chain Attack via Malicious Dependencies (Critical Node & High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2_1_supply_chain_attack_via_malicious_dependencies__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:**
*   An attacker compromises a dependency used by either the application itself or by SWC during its operation. This dependency could be a direct dependency listed in `package.json` or a transitive dependency (a dependency of a dependency).
*   The attacker injects malicious code into the compromised dependency.
*   When the application's build process runs SWC, or when the application itself runs, the compromised dependency is downloaded and executed.
*   The malicious code within the dependency can then perform actions like:
    *   Exfiltrating sensitive data from the build environment or the application's runtime environment.
    *   Injecting further malicious code into the bundled application output.
    *   Compromising the build system itself.

*   **Likelihood:** Medium (especially for transitive dependencies, typosquatting, or vulnerabilities in less maintained packages).
*   **Impact:** High (Code Execution, Data Breach, Supply Chain Compromise).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Scanning:** Regularly use dependency scanning tools (like `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, or dedicated commercial solutions) to identify known vulnerabilities in both direct and transitive dependencies.
    *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Implement SCA practices to gain visibility into your software supply chain and identify potential risks.
    *   **Secure Dependency Management:**
        *   Use lock files (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`) to ensure consistent dependency versions across environments and prevent unexpected updates to vulnerable versions.
        *   Pin dependency versions explicitly in `package.json` to control updates.
        *   Consider using a private npm registry or repository manager to have more control over dependency sources.
    *   **Dependency Review:**  Periodically review your application's dependencies and SWC's dependencies. Assess the trustworthiness and maintenance status of each dependency.
    *   **Subresource Integrity (SRI) (Limited Applicability for Bundled Code):** While less directly applicable to bundled code, explore if SRI can be used for any external assets loaded during the build or runtime.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.3 Plugin contains malicious code that executes during SWC processing (Critical Node & High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_3_plugin_contains_malicious_code_that_executes_during_swc_processing__critical_node_&_high-risk__4fc8acdd.md)

**Attack Vector:**
*   If the application uses SWC plugins (either custom-developed or third-party), these plugins execute code within the SWC build process.
*   An attacker can compromise a plugin's repository or distribution channel (e.g., npm if it's a public plugin).
*   The attacker injects malicious code into the plugin.
*   When the application's build process runs SWC and uses the compromised plugin, the malicious code executes.
*   This malicious plugin code can:
    *   Inject malicious code into the bundled application output.
    *   Exfiltrate sensitive information from the build environment.
    *   Compromise the build system.

*   **Likelihood:** Medium (if plugins are used, depends on plugin source trustworthiness and security).
*   **Impact:** High (Code Execution during build, potentially in final app, Build System Compromise).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Plugin Security Review:** Thoroughly review the code of any custom or third-party SWC plugins before using them. Pay close attention to plugin permissions and actions.
    *   **Trusted Plugin Sources:**  Use plugins only from trusted and reputable sources. Prefer plugins with active maintenance and a strong security track record.
    *   **Plugin Source Validation:** Verify the source and integrity of third-party plugins. Use official plugin repositories and consider using plugin checksums or signatures if available.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Plugins:** If possible, configure plugins with the minimum necessary permissions and access. Limit what actions plugins are allowed to perform during the build process.
    *   **Regular Plugin Updates:** Keep plugins updated to the latest versions to patch any known vulnerabilities. Monitor plugin security advisories.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1.1 Running SWC with excessive privileges (e.g., as root) (Critical Node & High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_1_running_swc_with_excessive_privileges__e_g___as_root___critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:**
*   The application's build process is configured to run SWC with elevated privileges, such as root or administrator.
*   If a vulnerability exists in SWC (even a minor one that might otherwise be contained), running with excessive privileges amplifies the impact.
*   If an attacker can exploit a vulnerability in SWC (e.g., via crafted input code or a malicious plugin), the attacker's code will execute with the same elevated privileges as SWC.
*   This can lead to full system compromise, as the attacker gains root or administrator access.

*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Common misconfiguration, especially in development or poorly configured CI/CD pipelines).
*   **Impact:** High (Increased impact of any SWC vulnerability, potential Full System Compromise).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Run SWC and the entire build process with the minimum necessary privileges. Create dedicated build users with restricted permissions.
    *   **Containerization:** Use containerization technologies (like Docker) to isolate the build environment and limit the impact of potential compromises. Run build processes within containers with restricted capabilities.
    *   **Security Audits of Build Infrastructure:** Regularly audit the security configuration of your build infrastructure to identify and remediate any instances of excessive privileges.
    *   **Avoid Running as Root:** Never run build processes, including SWC, as the root user unless absolutely necessary and after careful security consideration.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2.1 Application uses an old version of SWC with publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (Critical Node & High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_1_application_uses_an_old_version_of_swc_with_publicly_disclosed_vulnerabilities__critical_node__436a72ec.md)

**Attack Vector:**
*   The application uses an outdated version of SWC that has known, publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities.
*   Attackers are aware of these vulnerabilities and may have readily available exploits.
*   If an attacker can control the input code processed by SWC (e.g., through a code injection vulnerability in the application or by compromising the source code repository), they can craft input that exploits the known SWC vulnerability.
*   Successful exploitation can lead to code execution within the build environment or potentially within the final application if the vulnerability affects the generated code.

*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (Common vulnerability management issue, especially if dependency updates are not prioritized).
*   **Impact:** High (Exploitation of known vulnerabilities, Code Execution).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular SWC Updates:** Implement a robust dependency update process and regularly update SWC to the latest stable version.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use vulnerability scanners (part of dependency audit tools or dedicated security scanners) to automatically detect outdated SWC versions and known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Dependency Monitoring:**  Set up alerts or notifications for new SWC releases and security advisories.
    *   **Patch Management Process:** Establish a clear process for promptly applying security patches and updating dependencies when vulnerabilities are disclosed.
    *   "Shift Left" Security: Integrate security checks and dependency scanning into the early stages of the development lifecycle to catch outdated dependencies and vulnerabilities early on.
