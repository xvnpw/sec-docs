# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for swc-project/swc

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update SWC](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_swc.md)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Monitor SWC project's GitHub releases, npm security advisories, and official communication channels specifically for security updates.
*   Step 2: Check for new SWC versions regularly (e.g., weekly or monthly), prioritizing security releases.
*   Step 3: Review release notes and changelogs of new SWC versions for security-related fixes.
*   Step 4: Update the `@swc/core` and related SWC packages in your `package.json` to the latest stable version when security updates are available.
*   Step 5: Thoroughly test your application after updating SWC to ensure compatibility and no regressions are introduced by the update.
*   Step 6: Deploy the updated application with the patched SWC version promptly.
**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Exploitation of Known SWC Vulnerabilities - Severity: High - Outdated SWC versions may contain publicly known security flaws that attackers can exploit.
**Impact:**
*   Exploitation of Known SWC Vulnerabilities: High reduction - Directly patches known vulnerabilities within SWC itself.
**Currently Implemented:** Partially - Dependency updates are performed, but security-focused SWC updates might not be prioritized or expedited.
    *   Implemented in: Project dependency update process.
**Missing Implementation:** Dedicated process for tracking SWC security advisories and a fast-track update procedure specifically for security patches in SWC.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dependency Scanning for SWC Dependencies](./mitigation_strategies/dependency_scanning_for_swc_dependencies.md)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Integrate a dependency scanning tool (like `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, or dedicated tools) into your workflow and CI/CD pipeline.
*   Step 2: Configure the tool to scan specifically for vulnerabilities in the *transitive dependencies* of `@swc/core` and other SWC packages you use.
*   Step 3: Run dependency scans regularly (e.g., on each build, commit, or merge request).
*   Step 4: Review scan results focusing on vulnerabilities originating from SWC's dependency tree.
*   Step 5: Investigate reported vulnerabilities and determine if they impact your application's usage of SWC.
*   Step 6: Update vulnerable dependencies of SWC indirectly by updating SWC itself if a newer version resolves the dependency issue, or by using dependency resolution overrides if necessary and safe.
*   Step 7: Re-run scans to confirm vulnerability resolution.
**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Vulnerabilities in SWC's Transitive Dependencies - Severity: High - SWC relies on other libraries, which may have their own vulnerabilities that could indirectly affect SWC and your application.
*   Supply Chain Attacks via Compromised SWC Dependencies - Severity: Medium - If a dependency of SWC is compromised, it could indirectly impact SWC's security.
**Impact:**
*   Vulnerabilities in SWC's Transitive Dependencies: High reduction - Identifies and helps remediate vulnerabilities within the libraries SWC depends on.
*   Supply Chain Attacks via Compromised SWC Dependencies: Medium reduction - Increases awareness of potential risks from SWC's supply chain.
**Currently Implemented:** Partially - `npm audit` is run occasionally, but not specifically focused on SWC's dependencies and not integrated into CI/CD for every build.
    *   Implemented in: Local development environment occasionally.
**Missing Implementation:** Automated dependency scanning integrated into CI/CD, specifically targeting SWC's dependency tree, with automated reporting and a defined remediation process.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Sanitization and Validation for SWC Code Transformation Plugins](./mitigation_strategies/input_sanitization_and_validation_for_swc_code_transformation_plugins.md)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Identify if you are using or developing custom SWC plugins that process external or user-provided input to influence code transformation.
*   Step 2: For each input point to SWC plugins, define strict validation rules based on expected data types, formats, and allowed values.
*   Step 3: Implement input sanitization and validation routines *before* passing data to SWC plugins for code transformation.
*   Step 4: Sanitize input to remove or escape potentially harmful characters or code constructs that could be interpreted as code by SWC or its plugins.
*   Step 5: Validate input against defined rules and reject invalid input, preventing it from being processed by SWC plugins.
*   Step 6: Log invalid input attempts for security monitoring and potential incident response related to SWC plugin usage.
**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Code Injection via Malicious Input to SWC Plugins - Severity: High - Malicious input could be crafted to manipulate SWC plugins into generating unintended or harmful code.
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if SWC-transformed code is rendered in a browser - Severity: High - If plugins process input that ends up in client-side code, vulnerabilities could lead to XSS.
*   Denial of Service (DoS) through crafted malicious input to plugins - Severity: Medium - Malformed input could cause SWC plugins to consume excessive resources or crash.
**Impact:**
*   Code Injection via Malicious Input to SWC Plugins: High reduction - Prevents injection attacks by ensuring input processed by SWC plugins is safe.
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): High reduction - Reduces XSS risks if SWC plugins handle data that could end up in browser-rendered code.
*   Denial of Service (DoS): Medium reduction - Can mitigate some DoS attacks by rejecting malformed input before it reaches SWC plugins.
**Currently Implemented:** No - No custom SWC plugins directly processing user input are currently in use.
    *   Implemented in: N/A
**Missing Implementation:**  Mandatory implementation if custom SWC plugins are developed that handle external or user-provided data. Security guidelines and code review processes should include input validation for SWC plugins.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limits for SWC Compilation Processes](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limits_for_swc_compilation_processes.md)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Identify environments where SWC compilation runs (local dev, CI/CD, build servers).
*   Step 2: Configure resource limits (CPU time, memory usage, process count) specifically for processes executing SWC.
*   Step 3: Utilize operating system tools (e.g., `ulimit`, cgroups), containerization features (Docker resource limits), or CI/CD platform settings to enforce these limits.
*   Step 4: Set limits that allow normal SWC compilation to complete successfully but prevent excessive resource consumption in case of vulnerabilities or malicious input.
*   Step 5: Monitor resource usage of SWC compilation processes to fine-tune limits and detect anomalies.
*   Step 6: Implement alerts to trigger if SWC processes exceed defined resource limits, indicating potential DoS attempts or unexpected behavior.

    *   Implemented in: Underlying server infrastructure (general limits).
**Missing Implementation:** Explicit configuration of resource limits tailored for SWC compilation processes in CI/CD and build server environments.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sandboxing or Isolation of SWC Compilation Environment](./mitigation_strategies/sandboxing_or_isolation_of_swc_compilation_environment.md)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Run SWC compilation processes within a sandboxed or isolated environment.
*   Step 2: Utilize containerization technologies like Docker or lightweight virtualization to create isolated environments for SWC compilation.
*   Step 3: Restrict the network access, file system access, and system call capabilities of the SWC compilation environment to the minimum necessary for its operation.
*   Step 4: Ensure that sensitive data and critical system resources are not directly accessible from the SWC compilation environment.
*   Step 5: Regularly review and harden the security configuration of the SWC compilation sandbox.
**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Exploitation of SWC Vulnerabilities leading to broader system compromise - Severity: High - If a vulnerability in SWC allows code execution, sandboxing limits the attacker's ability to pivot to other parts of the system.
