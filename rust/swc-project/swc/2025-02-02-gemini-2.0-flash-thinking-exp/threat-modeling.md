# Threat Model Analysis for swc-project/swc

## Threat: [SWC Parser Buffer Overflow](./threats/swc_parser_buffer_overflow.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts maliciously formed JavaScript/TypeScript code that, when parsed by SWC, triggers a buffer overflow in SWC's parser. This could be achieved by exploiting weaknesses in how SWC handles extremely long identifiers, deeply nested structures, or specific syntax combinations. The attacker might provide this malicious code as input to a build process that uses SWC.
**Impact:**
*   Denial of Service (DoS) of the build process, crashing the SWC compiler and halting development/deployment.
*   Potentially, arbitrary code execution on the build server if the buffer overflow vulnerability is exploitable beyond just crashing the process.
**SWC Component Affected:** Parser (parsing logic for JavaScript/TypeScript syntax).
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep SWC updated to the latest version to benefit from parser bug fixes.
*   Implement resource limits for build processes to mitigate DoS impact.
*   Ensure code processed by SWC originates from trusted sources.
*   Consider using fuzzing tools on SWC's parser for proactive vulnerability detection.

## Threat: [Plugin Vulnerability - Malicious Plugin Code Execution](./threats/plugin_vulnerability_-_malicious_plugin_code_execution.md)

**Description:** A developer uses a third-party SWC plugin from an untrusted source or a plugin that has been compromised. This malicious plugin, when loaded by SWC during the build process, could execute arbitrary code on the build server. The attacker distributes a seemingly benign plugin containing malicious code to compromise the build environment or inject malicious code into build artifacts.
**Impact:**
*   Compromise of the build server.
*   Supply chain attack: Malicious code injected into the application build artifacts through the plugin, potentially affecting end-users.
**SWC Component Affected:** Plugins (third-party plugin loading and execution mechanism).
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Only use SWC plugins from trusted and reputable sources.
*   Thoroughly vet and audit any third-party plugins before use, including code and dependencies review.
*   Implement a plugin vetting process and maintain a list of approved plugins.
*   Use security scanning tools on plugin code and dependencies.
*   Apply the principle of least privilege to plugin permissions and capabilities.
