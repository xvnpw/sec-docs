## Mitigation Strategy: [Monitor SWC Project Security Advisories](./mitigation_strategies/monitor_swc_project_security_advisories.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Regularly check the `swc` project's GitHub repository (https://github.com/swc-project/swc) for security advisories, announcements, and security-related issues.
    2.  Subscribe to GitHub notifications for the `swc` repository, specifically for security-related labels or discussions.
    3.  Monitor relevant security mailing lists, forums, or communities related to JavaScript/TypeScript build tools and the Rust ecosystem where `swc` vulnerabilities might be discussed.
    4.  Establish a process for reviewing these advisories and promptly assessing their impact on your project.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Zero-day Vulnerabilities in SWC - Severity: High
        *   Newly discovered vulnerabilities in `swc` that are not yet publicly known or patched could be exploited.
    *   Unpatched Vulnerabilities - Severity: High
        *   Failure to be aware of and react to published security advisories can leave your application vulnerable to known exploits in `swc`.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Zero-day Vulnerabilities in SWC: Low Reduction (Early Awareness)
        *   Monitoring provides early awareness of potential issues, allowing for faster reaction and mitigation once patches or workarounds become available. Does not prevent zero-day exploitation but reduces the window of vulnerability.
    *   Unpatched Vulnerabilities: High Reduction
        *   Significantly reduces the risk of remaining vulnerable to known and patched vulnerabilities by ensuring timely awareness and prompting updates.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No - Manual Checks
    *   Currently, security advisories are checked manually and sporadically.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Automated Monitoring and Alerting
    *   Implement automated monitoring and alerting for `swc` security advisories. This could involve using GitHub API to watch for security-related issues or using third-party security intelligence feeds.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Sanitization and Validation (for SWC Plugins/Customizations)](./mitigation_strategies/input_sanitization_and_validation__for_swc_pluginscustomizations_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  If using custom SWC plugins or configurations that accept external input (e.g., user-provided configuration files, command-line arguments), rigorously sanitize and validate all input data.
    2.  Implement input validation at multiple layers: client-side (if applicable), server-side (if applicable), and within the SWC plugin itself.
    3.  Use allowlists to define acceptable input values and formats rather than denylists.
    4.  Escape or encode input data appropriately before using it in code generation or transformation logic within the SWC plugin.
    5.  Conduct security code reviews of custom SWC plugins to identify potential input validation vulnerabilities.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Code Injection via SWC Plugins - Severity: High
        *   Vulnerabilities in custom SWC plugins that handle external input improperly could allow attackers to inject malicious code into the compilation process, leading to RCE in the build environment or the final application.
    *   Configuration Injection - Severity: Medium
        *   Improperly validated configuration inputs could be manipulated to alter the behavior of SWC in unintended and potentially harmful ways.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Code Injection via SWC Plugins: High Reduction
        *   Significantly reduces the risk of code injection by ensuring that external input is properly validated and sanitized before being used in SWC plugin logic.
    *   Configuration Injection: Medium Reduction
        *   Reduces the risk of configuration injection by validating configuration inputs and preventing manipulation of SWC behavior through malicious configuration.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not Applicable - No Custom SWC Plugins
    *   Currently, no custom SWC plugins or configurations that accept external user input are implemented in the project.
*   **Missing Implementation:** N/A - Not Currently Applicable
    *   This mitigation strategy will become relevant if custom SWC plugins or externalized configurations are introduced in the future.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update SWC Version](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_swc_version.md)

*   **Missing Implementation:** Scheduled Configuration Reviews and Documentation
    *   Implement scheduled reviews of `swc` configuration as part of security audits or regular maintenance. Document the rationale behind specific configuration choices, especially those that deviate from defaults or potentially impact security related to `swc`'s transformations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize Custom Transformations (If Possible)](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_custom_transformations__if_possible_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Evaluate the necessity of custom SWC plugins or transformations. If possible, achieve desired functionality using built-in SWC features or well-established, community-vetted SWC plugins.
    2.  If custom transformations are necessary for `swc`, keep them as simple and focused as possible to reduce complexity and the potential for introducing vulnerabilities through custom code.
    3.  Thoroughly test and security review any custom SWC plugins or transformations for `swc`.
    4.  Prefer using well-maintained and actively developed community SWC plugins over creating custom solutions from scratch when suitable options exist to leverage community security efforts.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Vulnerabilities in Custom SWC Plugins - Severity: High
        *   Custom SWC plugins, if not developed securely, can introduce vulnerabilities into the build process and the compiled application specifically through the code transformation pipeline.
    *   Increased Complexity and Attack Surface - Severity: Medium
        *   Excessive custom transformations in `swc` increase the complexity of the build process, making it harder to secure the code transformation and potentially increasing the attack surface.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Vulnerabilities in Custom SWC Plugins: High Reduction (Avoidance)
        *   Minimizing custom transformations reduces the risk of introducing vulnerabilities through custom plugin code within the `swc` compilation process.
    *   Increased Complexity and Attack Surface: Medium Reduction
