### High and Critical SWC Threats

Here's an updated list of high and critical threats that directly involve the SWC library:

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities in SWC
    *   **Description:** SWC itself might contain known vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, arbitrary code execution flaws) that an attacker can exploit. If the build environment or a developer's machine running the build process has an outdated or vulnerable version of SWC, an attacker could potentially trigger these vulnerabilities by providing specially crafted input or manipulating the build process.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Remote Code Execution on Build Machine:** An attacker could gain control of the machine running the SWC build process.
        *   **Build Process Manipulation:** The attacker could alter the build output, injecting malicious code or modifying application logic.
        *   **Denial of Service:** Exploiting a vulnerability could crash the SWC process, disrupting the build pipeline.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

*   **Threat:** Malicious SWC Configuration Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the SWC configuration files (e.g., `.swcrc`, `swc.config.js`) or the mechanism used to provide configuration (e.g., environment variables). They then inject malicious configuration options that cause SWC to behave in an unintended and harmful way. This could involve disabling security features, altering code transformation logic to introduce vulnerabilities, or directing SWC to include malicious code.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Introduction of Vulnerabilities:** The modified configuration could lead to the generation of insecure code, such as bypassing sanitization or introducing XSS vectors.
        *   **Backdoor Creation:** Malicious code snippets could be injected into the build output through configuration manipulation.
        *   **Information Disclosure:** Configuration changes could cause SWC to output sensitive information during the build process.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Threat:** Tampering with SWC Binaries in the Build Environment
    *   **Description:** An attacker with access to the build environment could directly modify the SWC binaries or related files. This could involve replacing legitimate binaries with malicious ones or patching them to introduce backdoors or vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Compromised Build Output:** Maliciously modified SWC could inject code or alter the application during the build process.
        *   **Long-Term Persistent Threat:** The tampered binaries could remain in place, affecting future builds.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
