# Attack Surface Analysis for swc-project/swc

## Attack Surface: [Malicious JavaScript/TypeScript Input Parsing](./attack_surfaces/malicious_javascripttypescript_input_parsing.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in SWC's parser can be exploited by providing crafted JavaScript or TypeScript code designed to trigger parser flaws.
*   **SWC Contribution:** SWC's core functionality is parsing and transforming JavaScript/TypeScript. Parser vulnerabilities are inherent to SWC's operation.
*   **Example:** A specially crafted JavaScript file with deeply nested expressions or unusual unicode characters could trigger a buffer overflow or infinite loop within the SWC parser, leading to a Denial of Service during the build process and halting development.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (build process disruption, preventing application deployment), potential for Remote Code Execution (if parser vulnerabilities are severe enough, though less likely in Rust, logic errors leading to unexpected behavior are still possible).
*   **Risk Severity:** High (DoS is a significant risk to development pipelines, potential for RCE elevates severity).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep SWC Updated:**  Immediately update SWC to the latest version to benefit from parser bug fixes and security patches released by the SWC project. Monitor SWC release notes for security advisories.
    *   **Restrict Input Sources:**  Control the sources of JavaScript/TypeScript code processed by SWC. Ensure code originates from trusted repositories and development pipelines. Limit processing of externally provided, untrusted code.
    *   **Build Environment Monitoring:** Monitor build environments for unusual resource consumption or crashes during SWC execution, which could indicate a parser exploit attempt.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration File Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/configuration_file_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** SWC configuration files (`.swcrc`, `swc.config.js`) can be maliciously modified to alter SWC's behavior, leading to compromised builds and potential supply chain attacks.
*   **SWC Contribution:** SWC relies on configuration files to define its transformation and compilation process. Malicious configuration directly manipulates SWC's actions.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the build environment and modifies `.swcrc` to disable security-related transformations (if implemented by SWC or plugins), inject malicious code into the output via custom transformations (if possible through configuration), or configure SWC to load a malicious plugin from an attacker-controlled location.
*   **Impact:** Compromised build process, injection of backdoors or malware into application builds, supply chain compromise affecting all users of the built application, potential for data exfiltration from the build environment if malicious plugins are used.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (Directly leads to compromised builds and supply chain risks, potentially affecting a wide user base).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Build Environment Access:** Implement strong authentication and authorization controls for access to build environments. Use multi-factor authentication where possible.
    *   **Configuration File Integrity Monitoring:** Implement mechanisms to detect unauthorized modifications to SWC configuration files. Use file integrity monitoring systems or version control with protected branches.
    *   **Immutable Infrastructure for Configuration:**  Consider using immutable infrastructure principles for build configurations, where configuration is defined and deployed in a read-only manner, preventing runtime modifications.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only necessary permissions to users and processes that require access to modify build configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious or Vulnerable Plugins (If Used)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_or_vulnerable_plugins__if_used_.md)

*   **Description:** If SWC's plugin architecture is utilized, malicious or vulnerable plugins can be introduced, executing arbitrary code within the SWC process and potentially compromising the build and output.
*   **SWC Contribution:** SWC's plugin system (if present and used) allows for extending its functionality with external code. This extension point becomes a critical attack surface if plugins are not vetted and secured.
*   **Example:** A developer unknowingly installs a seemingly useful SWC plugin from an untrusted source. This plugin contains malicious code that injects a backdoor into the compiled JavaScript output, exfiltrates sensitive environment variables from the build server, or compromises the integrity of the build process itself.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution within the build process, injection of backdoors or malware into the application, data exfiltration from the build environment, complete supply chain compromise, potential for persistent compromise of build infrastructure.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (Plugins execute code within the build process, offering extensive control and potential for severe compromise).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Plugin Vetting:**  Establish a rigorous plugin vetting process. Only use plugins from highly trusted and reputable sources with a proven security track record.
    *   **Security Audits of Plugins:** Conduct thorough security audits and code reviews of plugin code before deployment. Ideally, involve independent security experts in this process.
    *   **Plugin Sandboxing and Isolation (If Available):** Investigate if SWC or its plugin system offers any sandboxing or isolation mechanisms to limit the capabilities and impact of plugins. Utilize these mechanisms if available.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Plugins:**  If possible, configure SWC and the plugin system to operate with the principle of least privilege, limiting the permissions and system access granted to plugins.
    *   **Plugin Dependency Scanning:** Scan plugin dependencies for known vulnerabilities, similar to dependency scanning for SWC itself.
