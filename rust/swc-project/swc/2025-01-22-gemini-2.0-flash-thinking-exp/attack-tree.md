## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2.1 Supply Chain Attack via Malicious Dependencies (Critical Node & High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2_1_supply_chain_attack_via_malicious_dependencies__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Attacker compromises a dependency used by either the application itself or by SWC during its operation.
    *   This could involve:
        *   Exploiting known vulnerabilities in existing dependencies.
        *   Typosquatting: Creating malicious packages with names similar to legitimate dependencies.
        *   Compromising legitimate package repositories and injecting malicious code.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Especially for transitive dependencies, and common vulnerabilities in the wider npm ecosystem).
*   **Impact:** High (Code Execution, Data Breach). Successful exploitation allows the attacker to inject arbitrary code into the application's build process and potentially the final application itself, leading to data breaches or full system compromise.
*   **Effort:** Low (Leveraging existing vulnerabilities or typosquatting requires relatively low effort).
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium (Exploiting known vulnerabilities or basic package publishing skills are sufficient).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires dependency scanning tools and vigilant monitoring of dependency updates and sources).

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.3 Plugin contains malicious code that executes during SWC processing (Critical Node & High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_3_plugin_contains_malicious_code_that_executes_during_swc_processing__critical_node_&_high-risk__4fc8acdd.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Application uses SWC plugins (custom or third-party).
    *   Attacker introduces malicious code into a plugin. This can happen by:
        *   Compromising the plugin's repository or distribution channel.
        *   If using custom plugins, directly injecting malicious code during development or deployment.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (If plugins are used, and depends on the security of plugin sources).
*   **Impact:** High (Code Execution during build, potentially in final app). Malicious plugin code executes during the SWC build process, allowing for manipulation of the build output, injection of code into the final application, or compromise of the build environment.
*   **Effort:** Low (If plugin repository is compromised or custom plugin development is insecure).
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium (Using a compromised plugin or basic code injection skills).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Difficult (Requires thorough code review of all plugins used, which can be time-consuming and complex).

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1.1 Running SWC with excessive privileges (e.g., as root) (Critical Node & High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_1_running_swc_with_excessive_privileges__e_g___as_root___critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   SWC, and potentially the entire build process, is run with elevated privileges, such as root or administrator.
    *   This is often a misconfiguration in development or build environments for convenience or due to lack of awareness.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Common misconfiguration, especially in less mature development environments).
*   **Impact:** High (Increased impact of any SWC vulnerability). If any vulnerability in SWC is exploited, and SWC is running with excessive privileges, the attacker gains those elevated privileges on the build system, leading to severe compromise.
*   **Effort:** Very Low (No attacker action needed to create this vulnerability, it's an existing misconfiguration).
*   **Skill Level:** Low (Exploiting this misconfiguration is straightforward if any SWC vulnerability exists).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (Configuration review of build scripts and environment will easily reveal if SWC is running with excessive privileges).

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2.1 Application uses an old version of SWC with publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (Critical Node & High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_1_application_uses_an_old_version_of_swc_with_publicly_disclosed_vulnerabilities__critical_node__436a72ec.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Application uses an outdated version of SWC that has known, publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities.
    *   This is a common vulnerability management issue, often due to neglecting dependency updates.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (Common vulnerability management issue in software projects).
*   **Impact:** High (Exploitation of known vulnerabilities). Publicly known vulnerabilities often have readily available exploits, making exploitation easy and impactful.
*   **Effort:** Very Low (Publicly known exploits may exist, requiring minimal effort to use).
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium (Using existing exploits requires relatively low skill).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Easy (Version checking and vulnerability scanners can easily identify outdated SWC versions with known vulnerabilities).
