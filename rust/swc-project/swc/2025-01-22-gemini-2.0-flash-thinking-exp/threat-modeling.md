# Threat Model Analysis for swc-project/swc

## Threat: [Malicious Code Injection via Parsing Error](./threats/malicious_code_injection_via_parsing_error.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious JavaScript or TypeScript code that exploits a parsing vulnerability in SWC. This crafted code, when processed by SWC, could lead to the injection of unintended code or manipulation of the compilation process, potentially altering the application's behavior in a harmful way.
*   **Impact:** Code injection in the compiled output, potentially leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the application, or other unexpected and malicious behavior.
*   **Affected SWC Component:** Parser (JavaScript/TypeScript parser within SWC)
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep SWC updated to benefit from parser bug fixes and security patches.
    *   Report any suspicious parsing behavior or potential vulnerabilities to the SWC project maintainers.
    *   While less direct, perform security testing on the application's functionality after SWC integration to detect any unexpected behavior.

## Threat: [Insecure Code Transformation](./threats/insecure_code_transformation.md)

*   **Description:** A bug or flaw in SWC's code transformation logic (e.g., during transpilation, minification, or bundling) inadvertently introduces a security vulnerability in the output code. This could be due to incorrect code generation, removal of security-relevant code, or introduction of new attack vectors.
*   **Impact:** Introduction of security vulnerabilities in the compiled application, such as XSS, Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), or other weaknesses.
*   **Affected SWC Component:**  Transformer (various transformation modules within SWC, e.g., `jsc::transform`, `bundler`)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly test the application after integrating SWC, focusing on security-relevant functionalities and code paths.
    *   Carefully review SWC's configuration and transformation options to ensure they are not inadvertently weakening security.
    *   Stay informed about reported issues or security concerns related to SWC's transformations.
    *   Consider static analysis tools on the *output* code generated by SWC to detect potential security issues introduced during compilation.

## Threat: [Malicious Package Injection (Registry Compromise of SWC Package)](./threats/malicious_package_injection__registry_compromise_of_swc_package_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises a package registry (e.g., npm, crates.io) and injects a malicious version of the *SWC package itself*. Developers unknowingly download and use this compromised SWC package, introducing malicious code into their build process and application through the compiler.
*   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the build process and potentially the deployed application. Malicious code can be injected into the application's codebase *via the compiler itself*, leading to data theft, backdoors, or other severe security breaches.
*   **Affected SWC Component:** Package Distribution (npm package, crates.io crate - specifically the SWC package)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Download SWC from official and trusted sources (npm registry, crates.io, official GitHub releases).
    *   Use package managers with integrity checking features (e.g., npm's `package-lock.json`, yarn's `yarn.lock`, Cargo's `Cargo.lock`).
    *   Enable package signature verification if available in your package manager.
    *   Consider using dependency scanning tools that can verify package integrity and authenticity *of the SWC package*.
    *   Regularly audit project dependencies for unexpected changes, *especially for the SWC package*.
