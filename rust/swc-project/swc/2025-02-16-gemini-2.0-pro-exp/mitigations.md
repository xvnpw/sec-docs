# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for swc-project/swc

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Path Sanitization (for `swc`)](./mitigation_strategies/input_path_sanitization__for__swc__.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify `swc` Input Points:**  Within your build scripts or application code, pinpoint precisely where file/directory paths are fed *directly* to `swc` (command-line arguments to `swc` CLI, paths passed to `swc`'s Node.js API functions like `transform`, `transformFileSync`, `parse`, `parseFileSync`, etc.).
    2.  **Implement Sanitization *Before* `swc` Call:**  Immediately before calling any `swc` function, use a path sanitization library (e.g., `path-absolutize` in Node.js, Rust's `Path` and `PathBuf`).
    3.  **Relative Paths Enforcement:**  Ensure all paths are relative to the project root.  Reject absolute paths or those with `../` that could escape the project directory.
    4.  **`swc`-Specific Whitelist (Optional):** If feasible, create a whitelist of directories *specifically* for `swc`'s access, rejecting paths outside this list. This is distinct from a general project whitelist.
    5.  **`swc`-Focused Testing:**  Create test cases that *specifically* target `swc` with malicious paths to verify your sanitization's effectiveness *against* `swc`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Path Traversal (via `swc`) (Severity: High):** Prevents attackers from crafting input paths that would make `swc` read/write files outside the intended project directory, potentially leading to information disclosure or code execution *through* `swc`.
    *   **Arbitrary File Access (via `swc`) (Severity: High):**  A subset of path traversal, specifically preventing `swc` from accessing sensitive system files.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Path Traversal (via `swc`):** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low/Negligible).
    *   **Arbitrary File Access (via `swc`):** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low/Negligible).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   *Example (Hypothetical):* Partially implemented in `build.js` for CLI arguments, but not for paths within a configuration file read by `build.js` and then passed to `swc.transform()`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   *Example (Hypothetical):* Needs implementation for all paths passed to `swc`'s API, including those derived from configuration files or other indirect sources.
    *   *Example (Hypothetical):* Requires dedicated test cases targeting `swc` with malicious paths.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limits (for `swc` Process)](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limits__for__swc__process_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify `swc` Execution:** Determine *how* `swc` is run (CLI, Node.js API, within a larger process).
    2.  **Apply Limits *to* `swc`:** Use appropriate OS mechanisms to limit resources *specifically* for the `swc` process:
        *   **`ulimit` (Linux):**  If `swc` is run via the CLI, use `ulimit -t <cpu_seconds> -m <memory_kb> -n <file_descriptors> -u <processes>` *before* invoking `swc`.
        *   **Node.js `child_process` Options:** If using `swc` via Node.js's `child_process`, explore options like `maxBuffer` (for stdout/stderr) and potentially custom resource limiting logic.  This is less robust than `ulimit`.
        *   **Container Limits (Docker/Kubernetes):** If `swc` runs within a container, set resource limits in the container configuration.
    3.  **`swc`-Specific Limits:**  Tailor the limits (CPU time, memory, file descriptors, processes) to what's reasonable for *your* `swc` usage.  Start conservatively.
    4.  **Test `swc` Under Limits:**  Test your build process with the limits in place to ensure they don't break legitimate `swc` operations.
    5. **Monitor `swc`:** Monitor `swc`'s resource usage to detect attempts to exceed the limits.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) against `swc` (Severity: Medium/High):** Prevents attackers from crafting input that causes `swc` itself to consume excessive resources, making the build system or application unavailable.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) against `swc`:** Risk significantly reduced (Medium/High to Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   *Example (Hypothetical):* No resource limits are currently set specifically for `swc`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   *Example (Hypothetical):*  Needs implementation for all `swc` execution contexts (CLI, Node.js API, containers).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure `swc` Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/secure__swc__configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review `.swcrc` (and API Options):**  Carefully examine your `.swcrc` file (or equivalent configuration passed to `swc`'s API). Understand *every* option.
    2.  **Disable Unnecessary Features:**  Turn off any `swc` features you don't absolutely need.  This reduces the attack surface.
    3.  **Avoid Experimental/Unstable:**  Do *not* use experimental or unstable `swc` options in production.
    4.  **`swc`-Specific Security Review:**  Conduct a security-focused review of your `swc` configuration, looking for potentially risky settings.
    5. **Document Configuration Choices:** Clearly document the rationale behind your `swc` configuration choices, especially any security-related decisions.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **`swc` Misconfiguration (Severity: Variable, can be High):** Reduces the risk of configuring `swc` in a way that introduces vulnerabilities *through* `swc`'s own features.  For example, enabling an insecure plugin or an unstable feature that has undiscovered vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **`swc` Misconfiguration:** Risk reduced (severity depends on the specific misconfiguration, but generally from High/Medium to Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   *Example (Hypothetical):* Basic `.swcrc` review done, but no formal security-focused review.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   *Example (Hypothetical):*  Needs a dedicated security review of the `swc` configuration.
    *   *Example (Hypothetical):*  Configuration choices should be documented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure `swc` API Usage](./mitigation_strategies/secure__swc__api_usage.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Code Reviews (Focus on `swc`):**  If you use `swc`'s API (e.g., `swc.transform` in Node.js), conduct code reviews with a *specific focus* on how `swc` is being used.
    2.  **Validate *All* API Inputs:**  Carefully validate *all* inputs passed to `swc`'s API functions, not just file paths.  This includes options objects, source code strings, etc.
    3.  **Error Handling (Around `swc` Calls):**  Implement robust error handling around all calls to `swc`'s API.  Do *not* expose internal `swc` error messages to users.
    4.  **Least Privilege (for Code Using `swc`):**  Ensure the code that *calls* `swc`'s API runs with the minimum necessary privileges.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **`swc` API Misuse (Severity: Variable, can be High):** Reduces the risk of introducing vulnerabilities through incorrect or insecure use of `swc`'s API.  This could include passing malformed options, mishandling errors, or exposing sensitive information.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **`swc` API Misuse:** Risk reduced (severity depends on the specific misuse, but generally from High/Medium to Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   *Example (Hypothetical):* General code reviews are done, but not with a specific focus on `swc` API usage.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   *Example (Hypothetical):*  Code review checklists need to include specific checks for secure `swc` API usage.
    *   *Example (Hypothetical):*  Error handling around `swc` API calls needs to be reviewed and potentially improved.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Plugin Vetting and Isolation (for `swc` Plugins)](./mitigation_strategies/plugin_vetting_and_isolation__for__swc__plugins_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Minimize `swc` Plugins:**  Use only essential `swc` plugins.
    2.  **Source Code Review (of Plugin):**  Before using a plugin, *thoroughly* review its source code, looking for potential vulnerabilities or suspicious code.
    3.  **Reputation Check (Plugin Author):**  Investigate the plugin author and the plugin's history.
    4.  **`swc` Plugin Isolation (Ideal):**  If possible, isolate `swc` plugins:
        *   **Sandboxed Process (for `swc`):**  Use OS-level sandboxing (e.g., `seccomp` on Linux) to restrict the *entire* `swc` process (and thus the plugin) when plugins are enabled. This is more robust than trying to sandbox the plugin *within* `swc`.
        *   **Containerization (for `swc`):** Run the *entire* `swc` process (with plugins) within a container (Docker, etc.) with limited privileges.
    5.  **Regular Updates (of Plugin):** Keep `swc` plugins updated.
    6. **Monitor `swc` with Plugins:** If possible, monitor the behavior of `swc` *when plugins are active* to detect anomalies.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerable `swc` Plugins (Severity: Variable, often High):** Reduces the risk of using a plugin with vulnerabilities that could be exploited *through* `swc`.
    *   **Malicious `swc` Plugins (Severity: High):** Reduces the risk of intentionally malicious plugins compromising the system *via* `swc`.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerable `swc` Plugins:** Risk significantly reduced (severity depends on the vulnerability).
    *   **Malicious `swc` Plugins:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low/Negligible) with effective isolation.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   *Example (Hypothetical):* No formal plugin vetting or isolation.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   *Example (Hypothetical):*  Needs a plugin vetting process.
    *   *Example (Hypothetical):*  Needs to investigate and implement isolation techniques (sandboxing or containerization) for the `swc` process when plugins are used.
