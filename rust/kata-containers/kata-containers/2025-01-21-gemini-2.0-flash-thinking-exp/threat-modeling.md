# Threat Model Analysis for kata-containers/kata-containers

## Threat: [Guest Kernel Escape via Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/guest_kernel_escape_via_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability within the guest kernel running inside the Kata Container. This could involve techniques like buffer overflows, use-after-free vulnerabilities, or other kernel-level exploits. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to gain control of the guest kernel and potentially escape the confines of the virtual machine, gaining access to the underlying host system.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the host system, including access to sensitive data, the ability to execute arbitrary commands, and potentially impact other containers running on the same host.
    *   **Affected Component:** Guest Kernel (specifically kernel modules, system calls, or core kernel functionalities within the Kata guest OS).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use a minimal and hardened guest kernel specifically designed for Kata Containers.
        *   Keep the guest kernel updated with the latest security patches provided by the Kata Containers project or the guest OS vendor.
        *   Enable kernel security features like Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and Supervisor Mode Execution Prevention (SMEP) within the guest configuration for Kata.
        *   Consider using a security-focused guest operating system optimized for Kata Containers.

## Threat: [Hypervisor Escape via Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/hypervisor_escape_via_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the hypervisor (e.g., QEMU or Firecracker) used by Kata Containers. This could involve vulnerabilities in the hypervisor's device emulation, memory management, or other core functionalities that are part of the Kata Containers setup. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to break out of the guest VM managed by Kata and gain control of the host system.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the host system, including access to sensitive data, the ability to execute arbitrary commands, and potentially impact other containers running on the same host.
    *   **Affected Component:** Hypervisor (specifically its virtual device emulation, memory management, or core virtualization logic as integrated with Kata Containers).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the hypervisor used by Kata Containers updated with the latest security patches. Follow the security advisories and recommendations from the Kata Containers project regarding hypervisor versions.
        *   Use a minimal and hardened hypervisor configuration as recommended by the Kata Containers documentation.
        *   Enable hypervisor security features like Intel VT-d/AMD-Vi (IOMMU) for device isolation, which is a key aspect of Kata's security model.
        *   Regularly audit the hypervisor configuration used by Kata for security weaknesses.

## Threat: [Kata Agent Compromise](./threats/kata_agent_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Kata Agent, the process running inside the guest VM that communicates with the host. This could involve vulnerabilities in the agent's API, its handling of requests from the host (specifically those originating from Kata components), or its interaction with the guest OS within the Kata environment. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the host with the privileges of the Kata Agent or manipulate the guest VM from the host via the Kata control plane.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for host compromise, manipulation of the guest VM's state managed by Kata, data exfiltration through the agent's communication channels, or denial of service affecting Kata's functionality.
    *   **Affected Component:** Kata Agent (specifically its API endpoints, communication protocols used by Kata, and interaction with the guest OS within the Kata context).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the Kata Agent updated with the latest security patches provided by the Kata Containers project.
        *   Implement strong input validation and sanitization in the Kata Agent, especially for data received from the host.
        *   Minimize the attack surface of the Kata Agent by disabling unnecessary features or API endpoints.
        *   Secure the communication channel between the host and the Kata Agent, ensuring only authorized Kata components can interact with it.

## Threat: [Kata Runtime/Shim Vulnerability Leading to Container Breakout](./threats/kata_runtimeshim_vulnerability_leading_to_container_breakout.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Kata Runtime (e.g., the `kata-runtime` binary) or the Kata Shim (the process that sits between the container runtime and the hypervisor, specific to Kata). This could allow them to bypass the isolation provided by Kata Containers and gain access to the host or other containers managed by the same Kata installation.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for host compromise, access to other Kata-managed containers, and data breaches.
    *   **Affected Component:** Kata Runtime and Kata Shim (specifically their handling of container lifecycle operations, communication with the hypervisor, and security enforcement mechanisms within the Kata architecture).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the Kata Runtime and Shim updated with the latest security patches provided by the Kata Containers project.
        *   Secure the communication channels between the container runtime, the Kata Shim, and the hypervisor, ensuring only authorized components can communicate.
        *   Minimize the privileges of the Kata Runtime and Shim processes on the host system.

## Threat: [Guest OS Image Tampering](./threats/guest_os_image_tampering.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises the guest OS image specifically intended for use with Kata Containers. This could involve injecting malware, backdoors, or vulnerabilities into the image before it's used to create Kata Containers. When a Kata Container is started using the tampered image, the malicious code is executed within the isolated environment.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of the Kata Container's environment, potential data breaches, and the possibility of further attacks from within the Kata Container.
    *   **Affected Component:** Guest OS Image used by Kata Containers and the image management process of the container runtime as it interacts with Kata.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use trusted and verified base images specifically designed and recommended for Kata Containers.
        *   Implement image signing and verification mechanisms to ensure the integrity of Kata Container images.
        *   Regularly scan guest OS images intended for Kata Containers for vulnerabilities using security scanning tools.
        *   Build Kata Container images using a secure and auditable process.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attacks on Kata Components](./threats/supply_chain_attacks_on_kata_components.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises the build process or dependencies of Kata Containers or its core components (runtime, agent, shim). This could involve injecting malicious code into the source code, build tools, or third-party libraries used by the Kata Containers project.
    *   **Impact:** Introduction of vulnerabilities or backdoors directly into the Kata Containers environment, potentially leading to widespread compromise of systems using Kata.
    *   **Affected Component:** Kata Containers build process, dependencies, and release artifacts hosted on the Kata Containers GitHub repository or related infrastructure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Verify the integrity of Kata Containers releases using checksums and signatures provided by the project.
        *   Secure the build environment and infrastructure used by the Kata Containers project.
        *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by Kata.
        *   Follow secure software development practices within the Kata Containers project.
