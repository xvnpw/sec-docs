## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Kata Containers (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_kata_containers__critical_node_.md)

*   This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents the highest level of risk. Success at this node means the application's confidentiality, integrity, or availability has been compromised.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Kata Agent Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_kata_agent_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   Attack Vectors:
    *   Exploit Agent API Vulnerabilities (e.g., Buffer Overflow, Command Injection): Attackers target vulnerabilities in the Kata Agent's API to execute arbitrary code within the guest container. This could involve crafting malicious requests to vulnerable API endpoints.
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Agent's Interaction with Guest Kernel (CRITICAL NODE):** Attackers aim to exploit weaknesses in how the Kata Agent communicates and interacts with the guest kernel. Successful exploitation can lead to kernel-level compromise within the guest, granting extensive control.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Agent's Interaction with Guest Kernel (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_agent's_interaction_with_guest_kernel__critical_node_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Communication Channels Between Host and Guest](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_communication_channels_between_host_and_guest.md)

*   Attack Vectors:
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Vulnerabilities in Shared File Systems or Devices (CRITICAL NODE):** Attackers target vulnerabilities in how shared resources between the host and guest are managed. This allows them to inject malicious code or data into the container's environment via these shared resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Vulnerabilities in Shared File Systems or Devices (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_shared_file_systems_or_devices__critical_node_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Misconfigurations in Kata Containers Setup (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_misconfigurations_in_kata_containers_setup__critical_node_.md)

*   Attack Vectors:
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Insecurely Configured Shared Folders or Volumes (CRITICAL NODE):** Attackers exploit misconfigurations where shared folders or volumes are writable from the host. This allows them to place malicious files that can be executed within the container.
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Insecure Network Configuration (CRITICAL NODE):** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities arising from insecure network setups, such as exposed management ports or weak network policies, to gain unauthorized access to the Kata environment or the container itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Insecurely Configured Shared Folders or Volumes (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__insecurely_configured_shared_folders_or_volumes__critical_node_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Insecure Network Configuration (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__insecure_network_configuration__critical_node_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Vulnerabilities in the Guest Kernel (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_the_guest_kernel__critical_node_.md)

*   Attack Vectors:
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Leverage Known Guest Kernel Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE):** Attackers exploit publicly known vulnerabilities in the guest kernel. This is often achieved by identifying outdated or vulnerable kernel versions and using readily available exploits to gain root access within the container.
