## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Kata Containers (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_kata_containers__critical_node_.md)

This is the root goal of the attacker and represents the starting point for all potential attack paths. Success at this level means the attacker has achieved their objective of executing arbitrary code within the application's environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Kata Agent (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_kata_agent__high-risk_path_.md)

This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities or weaknesses within the Kata Agent, the process running inside the guest VM that manages the container lifecycle.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * Exploiting vulnerabilities in the agent's gRPC interface.
        * Exploiting vulnerabilities in the agent's internal logic for handling requests.
        * Abusing agent functionalities to gain unauthorized access or escalate privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Agent Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_agent_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

This path specifically targets software vulnerabilities within the Kata Agent's codebase.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * Exploiting buffer overflows or other memory corruption issues.
        * Exploiting injection vulnerabilities (e.g., command injection).
        * Exploiting logical flaws in the agent's code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Agent (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/remote_code_execution__rce__in_agent__critical_node_.md)

Achieving RCE in the Kata Agent grants the attacker the ability to execute arbitrary commands within the context of the agent process inside the guest VM. This is a significant step towards compromising the application.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * Sending specially crafted gRPC requests that exploit vulnerabilities.
        * Leveraging insecure deserialization of data.
        * Exploiting vulnerabilities in dependencies used by the agent.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Kata Hypervisor/Kernel (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_kata_hypervisorkernel__critical_node_.md)

This path targets the fundamental isolation provided by Kata Containers by attempting to exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying hypervisor or the guest kernel.

## Attack Tree Path: [Hypervisor Escape (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/hypervisor_escape__critical_node_.md)

A successful hypervisor escape allows the attacker to break out of the guest VM and gain control of the host system. This is a critical security breach.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * Exploiting vulnerabilities in the QEMU or Firecracker hypervisor.
        * Abusing hardware virtualization features.
        * Exploiting flaws in the hypervisor's memory management or device emulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Guest Kernel Exploitation (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/guest_kernel_exploitation__high-risk_path_.md)

This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities within the guest kernel running inside the Kata Container.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * Exploiting known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel.
        * Abusing kernel subsystems or drivers.
        * Leveraging race conditions or other concurrency issues in the kernel.

## Attack Tree Path: [Kernel Privilege Escalation (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/kernel_privilege_escalation__critical_node_.md)

Successfully exploiting a kernel vulnerability to gain root privileges within the guest VM is a critical step, often leading to further compromise or container breakout.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * Exploiting vulnerabilities in kernel modules.
        * Abusing setuid binaries or capabilities.
        * Overwriting kernel data structures.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Kata Configuration/Deployment (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_kata_configurationdeployment__high-risk_path_.md)

This path targets weaknesses introduced through misconfigurations or insecure deployment practices of Kata Containers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Configuration (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_configuration__high-risk_path_.md)

This focuses on exploiting misconfigurations in the setup of Kata Containers.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * Using weak or overly permissive security profiles (e.g., AppArmor, SELinux).
        * Insecurely sharing resources between the guest and host.
        * Using default or weak credentials.
        * Disabling security features.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Chain Attacks (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/supply_chain_attacks__high-risk_path_.md)

This path involves compromising the application by injecting malicious code into the Kata Containers image or related components during the build or distribution process.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * Using compromised base container images.
        * Introducing malicious dependencies into the build process.
        * Compromising the container registry.
        * Tampering with the Kata Containers installation packages.
