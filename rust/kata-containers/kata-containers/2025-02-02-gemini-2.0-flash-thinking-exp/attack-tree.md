## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Application Running in Kata Container [HIGH-RISK PATH]**](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__compromise_application_running_in_kata_container__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Description:** This is the ultimate goal. Success means the attacker has control over the application and potentially its data.
* **Attack Vectors (Summarized from Sub-Nodes):**
    * Escaping the Kata Container VM.
    * Compromising the host system via Kata Container misconfiguration.
    * Supply chain attacks targeting Kata Containers (specifically compromised base images).

## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL NODE] [1.0] Escape Kata Container VM [HIGH-RISK PATH]**](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node___1_0__escape_kata_container_vm__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Description:** Bypassing the primary isolation mechanism of Kata Containers by breaking out of the virtual machine.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **[CRITICAL NODE] [1.1] Exploit Hypervisor Vulnerability (QEMU/Firecracker) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        * **[1.1.1] Identify and Exploit Known Hypervisor CVE [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Leveraging publicly known vulnerabilities in the hypervisor software (QEMU or Firecracker). Attackers search for and exploit Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that affect the deployed hypervisor version.
        * **[1.1.2] Discover and Exploit Zero-Day Hypervisor Vulnerability:** Finding and exploiting previously unknown vulnerabilities in the hypervisor. This is more complex but can be highly effective.
    * **[CRITICAL NODE] [1.2] Exploit Guest Kernel Vulnerability [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        * **[1.2.1] Identify and Exploit Known Guest Kernel CVE [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel running inside the Kata Container VM. Similar to hypervisor CVEs, attackers target known weaknesses in the guest kernel.
    * **[CRITICAL NODE] [1.3] Exploit Virtio Device Vulnerability [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        * **[1.3.1] Exploit Virtio Driver Bug in Guest Kernel [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Targeting bugs in the virtio drivers within the guest kernel that handle communication with the host system. These drivers are a potential interface for exploitation.
    * **[CRITICAL NODE] [1.5] Exploit Kata Container Specific Components [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        * **[1.5.1] Exploit Kata Agent Vulnerability [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Kata Agent, a component running inside the VM that manages the container lifecycle and interacts with the host.
        * **[1.5.2] Exploit Kata Shim Vulnerability [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Targeting vulnerabilities in the Kata Shim, a component that acts as an intermediary between the container runtime (`containerd`) and the Kata Agent.
        * **[1.5.3] Exploit `containerd` Integration Vulnerability [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Exploiting weaknesses in how Kata Containers integrates with the `containerd` container runtime. This could involve vulnerabilities in the integration code or misconfigurations.
        * **[1.5.4] Exploit Image Management Vulnerability (Kata specific image handling) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Targeting vulnerabilities in the specific image handling processes within Kata Containers, which might differ from standard container image management.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL NODE] [2.0] Compromise Host System via Kata Container Misconfiguration [HIGH-RISK PATH]**](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node___2_0__compromise_host_system_via_kata_container_misconfiguration__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Description:** Gaining control of the host system by exploiting insecure configurations of the Kata Container environment. This bypasses VM escape by directly targeting the host.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **[CRITICAL NODE] [2.1] Insecure Container Image Configuration [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        * **[CRITICAL NODE] [2.1.1] Privileged Container Configuration (Accidental or Intentional) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Running a Kata Container in privileged mode, which grants it almost root-level capabilities on the host system, negating much of the isolation.
        * **[CRITICAL NODE] [2.1.2] Host Path Mounts with Write Access [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Mounting directories from the host file system into the container with write permissions. If misconfigured, this can allow the container to modify sensitive host files.
    * **[2.2.1] Host Networking Mode (Accidental or Intentional) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Using host networking mode for the Kata Container, which directly exposes the container to the host's network namespace, bypassing network isolation and potentially exposing host services.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[3.2] Compromised Base Images Used by Kata Containers [HIGH-RISK PATH]**](./attack_tree_paths/_3_2__compromised_base_images_used_by_kata_containers__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Description:**  Compromising the application by using a malicious or vulnerable base container image. This is a supply chain attack where the attacker injects malicious code or vulnerabilities into the foundation upon which the application container is built.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * Using base images from untrusted sources that may contain malware or backdoors.
    * Using outdated base images with known vulnerabilities that can be exploited from within the container.
