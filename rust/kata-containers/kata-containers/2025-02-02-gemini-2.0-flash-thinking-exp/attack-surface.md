# Attack Surface Analysis for kata-containers/kata-containers

## Attack Surface: [1. Hypervisor VM Escape](./attack_surfaces/1__hypervisor_vm_escape.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities within the hypervisor (QEMU/Firecracker) allowing an attacker to break out of the guest VM and gain control of the host system.
*   **Kata-containers Contribution:** Kata Containers relies on hypervisors for strong isolation. Hypervisor vulnerabilities are a direct and critical attack vector for Kata deployments.
*   **Example:** A memory corruption vulnerability in Firecracker is exploited from within a Kata container, allowing code execution on the host.
*   **Impact:** Full host compromise, data breach, denial of service, lateral movement.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regularly update** the hypervisor to the latest patched versions.
    *   **Enable hypervisor security features** like sandboxing and memory protection.
    *   **Minimize hypervisor attack surface** by disabling unnecessary features.
    *   **Perform vulnerability scanning** on hypervisor components.

## Attack Surface: [2. Guest Kernel Exploits](./attack_surfaces/2__guest_kernel_exploits.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities within the guest kernel running inside the Kata VM to gain elevated privileges within the guest.
*   **Kata-containers Contribution:** Kata Containers utilizes a guest kernel. Vulnerabilities in this guest kernel are a direct attack surface.
*   **Example:** A privilege escalation vulnerability in the Linux kernel is exploited from a container process within a Kata VM, granting root access inside the guest VM.
*   **Impact:** Container compromise, data exfiltration from the container, denial of service within the guest VM.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regularly update** the guest kernel within the Kata VM image.
    *   **Minimize guest kernel attack surface** by disabling unnecessary features and modules.
    *   **Enable kernel security features** like SELinux or AppArmor within the guest OS.
    *   **Frequently rebuild and update** guest OS images.

## Attack Surface: [3. Kata Agent API Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/3__kata_agent_api_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in the Kata Agent's API, used for communication between the agent (guest VM) and the shim/runtime (host).
*   **Kata-containers Contribution:** Kata Agent is a core Kata component. API vulnerabilities provide a direct path to control the guest VM from the host.
*   **Example:** An unauthenticated API endpoint in the Kata Agent allows sending malicious commands from the host to execute code within the guest VM.
*   **Impact:** Guest VM compromise, container escape (indirectly), potential host compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement robust authentication and authorization** for the Kata Agent API.
    *   **Thoroughly validate input** to the Agent API to prevent injection attacks.
    *   **Minimize the exposed API surface** to essential functionalities.
    *   **Keep Kata Agent updated** to the latest patched versions.

## Attack Surface: [4. Kata Shim Exploits](./attack_surfaces/4__kata_shim_exploits.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in the Kata Shim, running on the host and managing Kata VM lifecycle.
*   **Kata-containers Contribution:** Kata Shim is a host-level Kata component. Shim vulnerabilities can directly lead to host compromise.
*   **Example:** A buffer overflow in the Kata Shim is exploited by a malicious container runtime, allowing arbitrary code execution with Shim privileges on the host.
*   **Impact:** Host compromise, container escape, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Employ secure coding practices** during Shim development.
    *   **Thoroughly validate input** to the Shim from container runtime and other components.
    *   **Run Shim with least privilege** on the host.
    *   **Keep Kata Shim updated** to the latest patched versions.

## Attack Surface: [5. Shared Filesystem Vulnerabilities (virtiofs/9pfs)](./attack_surfaces/5__shared_filesystem_vulnerabilities__virtiofs9pfs_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in shared filesystem mechanisms (virtiofs, 9pfs) used for file sharing between host and Kata VM.
*   **Kata-containers Contribution:** Kata Containers often uses shared filesystems. Vulnerabilities here can break isolation and allow host access.
*   **Example:** A path traversal vulnerability in virtiofs allows a container process to access host files outside its intended shared volume.
*   **Impact:** Container escape, host filesystem access, data breach, potential host compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use secure and updated implementations** of virtiofs or 9pfs.
    *   **Minimize shared filesystem usage** and only share necessary directories.
    *   **Mount shared volumes with least privilege** and restrict access within the guest VM.
    *   **Keep shared filesystem components updated**.

## Attack Surface: [6. Insecure Kata Configuration](./attack_surfaces/6__insecure_kata_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Misconfigurations in Kata Containers settings, like weak security profiles, weakening the intended security isolation.
*   **Kata-containers Contribution:** Kata Containers offers configuration options that directly impact its security posture. Insecure configurations negate security benefits.
*   **Example:** Using a permissive AppArmor profile for Kata VMs allows containers to bypass intended restrictions, increasing the impact of a container compromise.
*   **Impact:** Weakened container isolation, potential privilege escalation, increased impact of other vulnerabilities.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (depending on the specific misconfiguration)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Utilize strong security profiles** (AppArmor, SELinux) for Kata VMs.
    *   **Enable and properly configure security features** of Kata Containers and underlying infrastructure.
    *   **Adhere to security best practices** for Kata and container deployments.
    *   **Regularly audit Kata configurations** for potential misconfigurations.
