# Threat Model Analysis for kata-containers/kata-containers

## Threat: [Hypervisor Escape via QEMU Vulnerability](./threats/hypervisor_escape_via_qemu_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in the QEMU hypervisor used by Kata Containers. This could involve sending specially crafted input to a QEMU service or leveraging a memory corruption bug. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to break out of the Guest VM and gain code execution on the host operating system.
    *   **Impact:** **Critical**. Full compromise of the host system. The attacker can access sensitive data, control the host, and potentially impact other containers or systems running on the same host.
    *   **Affected Kata Containers Component:** QEMU Hypervisor
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (if vulnerability is actively exploited in the wild) to **High** (for known but not widely exploited vulnerabilities).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly patch the hypervisor (QEMU) to the latest stable version.
        *   Enable and enforce mandatory access control (MAC) systems like SELinux or AppArmor on the host.
        *   Utilize hypervisor security hardening features.
        *   Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) on the host.

## Threat: [Guest OS Kernel Privilege Escalation](./threats/guest_os_kernel_privilege_escalation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability within the Linux kernel running inside the Kata Container Guest VM. This could be achieved through a local exploit executed within the containerized application or by leveraging a vulnerability in a system call or kernel module. Successful exploitation grants root privileges within the Guest VM.
    *   **Impact:** **High**.  Compromise of the Guest VM. The attacker gains full control over the Guest OS and can potentially access sensitive data within the container, modify application files, and potentially attempt further attacks. While isolated from the host by Kata, it compromises the container's security.
    *   **Affected Kata Containers Component:** Guest OS Kernel (within Kata VM)
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High** (if vulnerability is actively exploited in container environments) to **Medium** (for less easily exploitable vulnerabilities).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the Guest OS kernel and packages up-to-date within the Kata Container image.
        *   Minimize the attack surface of the Guest OS image.
        *   Implement security hardening within the Guest OS image.
        *   Utilize container security scanning tools to scan Guest OS images.

## Threat: [Kata Agent Vulnerability Leading to Guest OS Escape](./threats/kata_agent_vulnerability_leading_to_guest_os_escape.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Kata Agent, which runs inside the Guest VM and communicates with the CRI on the host. This could involve sending malicious commands or data to the Kata Agent through the CRI interface. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to bypass Guest OS isolation and potentially gain access to the host.
    *   **Impact:** **High**. Potential compromise of the host system. Depending on the nature of the vulnerability, an attacker might be able to escape the Guest VM and gain code execution on the host, although this is less direct than a hypervisor escape.
    *   **Affected Kata Containers Component:** Kata Agent
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High** (if vulnerability allows host escape) to **Medium** (if vulnerability allows Guest OS escape or container control).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Kata Containers components, including the Kata Agent, updated to the latest versions.
        *   Secure communication channels between CRI and Kata Agent.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization in the Kata Agent.
        *   Follow least privilege principles for the Kata Agent within the Guest OS.

## Threat: [Malicious Guest OS Initrd/Initramfs Injection](./threats/malicious_guest_os_initrdinitramfs_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises the Guest OS initrd/initramfs image used by Kata Containers. This could be done by tampering with the image during the build process or through a supply chain attack. A malicious initrd/initramfs can be crafted to execute arbitrary code during the Guest OS boot process, potentially installing backdoors, disabling security features, or compromising the Guest OS from the very beginning.
    *   **Impact:** **High**.  Full compromise of the Guest VM and potentially the application running within it. The attacker gains persistent control over the Guest OS from boot time.
    *   **Affected Kata Containers Component:** Guest OS Initrd/Initramfs Image
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High** (due to potential for persistent and early stage compromise).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the Guest OS image build pipeline.
        *   Use image signing and verification for Guest OS images.
        *   Regularly audit and scan Guest OS images for malware and vulnerabilities.
        *   Source Guest OS images from trusted and reputable sources.
