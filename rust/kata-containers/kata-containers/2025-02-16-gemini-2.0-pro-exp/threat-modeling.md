# Threat Model Analysis for kata-containers/kata-containers

## Threat: [Hypervisor Escape (VM Escape)](./threats/hypervisor_escape__vm_escape_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the hypervisor (QEMU, Cloud Hypervisor, Firecracker, etc.) or a flaw in the Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) logic within Kata. The attacker crafts malicious input or exploits a race condition to gain arbitrary code execution *outside* the guest VM, on the host system.
    *   **Impact:** Complete host system compromise. The attacker gains full control over the host, including all other containers, Kata or otherwise, and host resources. Data breach, system destruction, lateral movement within the network.
    *   **Affected Component:** Hypervisor (QEMU, Cloud Hypervisor, Firecracker), Kata-runtime (VMM interaction logic), potentially kata-shim (if involved in vulnerability exploitation).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Patching:** Apply hypervisor and Kata component security updates *immediately* upon release. This is the most critical mitigation.
        *   **Minimal Hypervisor Configuration:** Use a stripped-down, security-hardened hypervisor configuration. Disable all unnecessary features, devices, and emulated hardware.
        *   **Host Hardening:** Employ seccomp, AppArmor/SELinux on the *host* to restrict the hypervisor process's capabilities.
        *   **Vulnerability Monitoring:** Actively monitor for CVEs related to the chosen hypervisor and Kata components.
        *   **Hypervisor Selection:** Choose a hypervisor with a strong security track record and active development (e.g., Firecracker, if suitable).
        *   **Host Intrusion Detection:** Implement robust host-based intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS).

## Threat: [Kata Agent Compromise (Privilege Escalation within Guest)](./threats/kata_agent_compromise__privilege_escalation_within_guest_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains initial code execution within the Kata Container (e.g., through a web application vulnerability). They then exploit a vulnerability in the `kata-agent` or leverage misconfigurations to gain control of the `kata-agent` process running *inside* the guest VM.
    *   **Impact:** Control over the container's environment. Potentially a stepping stone to a VM escape (if combined with a hypervisor vulnerability). Data exfiltration from the container. Manipulation of containerized applications.
    *   **Affected Component:** `kata-agent` (running inside the guest VM).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Least Privilege (Guest):** Run applications *inside* the container with the absolute minimum necessary privileges.
        *   **Guest Hardening:** Use seccomp profiles and AppArmor/SELinux *inside* the guest OS to restrict the capabilities of all processes, including the `kata-agent`.
        *   **Minimal Guest OS:** Use a minimal, security-hardened guest OS image with a reduced attack surface.
        *   **Regular Auditing (Guest):** Audit the security of applications running *inside* the Kata Containers.
        *   **Integrity Checks:** Implement integrity checks (e.g., checksums, signatures) on the `kata-agent` binary to detect tampering.
        *   **Guest OS Patching:** Keep the guest OS image up-to-date with security patches.

## Threat: [Misconfiguration of Kata Runtime (Insecure Settings)](./threats/misconfiguration_of_kata_runtime__insecure_settings_.md)

*   **Description:** The Kata runtime is configured with insecure settings, such as allowing excessive privileges, disabling security features, or exposing unnecessary network interfaces. This weakens the isolation provided by Kata.
    *   **Impact:** Reduced container isolation. Increased risk of VM escape or other attacks. Exposure of host resources.
    *   **Affected Component:** `kata-runtime` configuration, potentially `kata-shim` and hypervisor configuration if influenced by runtime settings.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Defaults:** Use secure default settings whenever possible.
        *   **Documentation Review:** Thoroughly review the official Kata Containers documentation and security best practices.
        *   **Configuration Management:** Use configuration management tools (e.g., Ansible, Chef, Puppet) to ensure consistent and secure configurations across all nodes.
        *   **Regular Audits:** Regularly audit the Kata runtime configuration for any deviations from the security baseline.
        *   **Least Privilege (Configuration):** Apply the principle of least privilege to the Kata runtime configuration. Only enable features and capabilities that are absolutely necessary.

## Threat: [Insecure Communication between Kata Components (Interception/Tampering)](./threats/insecure_communication_between_kata_components__interceptiontampering_.md)

*   **Description:** Communication between the Kata runtime, shim, proxy, and agent is not properly secured. An attacker could intercept or modify this communication, potentially leading to container compromise or other malicious actions.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of container integrity. Potential for man-in-the-middle attacks. Leakage of sensitive information.
    *   **Affected Component:** Communication channels between `kata-runtime`, `kata-shim`, `kata-proxy`, and `kata-agent`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **TLS Encryption:** Ensure that all communication channels between Kata components are encrypted using TLS (Transport Layer Security).
        *   **Authentication:** Implement strong authentication mechanisms to verify the identity of communicating components.
        *   **vsock (where appropriate):** Use vsock (virtual sockets) for communication between the host and the guest VM, as it provides a more secure communication channel than traditional network sockets.
        *   **Regular Security Reviews:** Regularly review and update the security configuration of communication channels.

## Threat: [Insecure Device Passthrough](./threats/insecure_device_passthrough.md)

* **Description:** A host device is passed through to the Kata Container. A vulnerability in the device driver *within the guest OS*, or a misconfiguration of the passthrough mechanism itself, allows an attacker to compromise the guest or potentially the host.
    * **Impact:** Guest OS compromise, potential for VM escape (depending on the device and vulnerability), access to host resources.
    * **Affected Component:** Hypervisor (device passthrough mechanism), Guest OS (device driver), `kata-runtime` (configuration of device passthrough).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
      *   **Minimize Passthrough:** Only passthrough devices that are *absolutely essential* for the container's functionality.
      *   **Driver Security:** Carefully vet the security of device drivers used within the guest OS. Use drivers from trusted sources and keep them updated.
      *   **IOMMU:** Utilize an IOMMU (Input/Output Memory Management Unit) to restrict the device's access to host memory, limiting the impact of a driver compromise.
      *   **Configuration Audits:** Regularly audit device passthrough configurations to ensure they are secure and follow the principle of least privilege.
      * **Guest OS Hardening:** Apply security hardening measures to the guest OS, including seccomp and AppArmor/SELinux, to limit the capabilities of the device driver.
