## Attack Tree Path: [2.1: Known CVEs in Hypervisor (e.g., QEMU RCE)](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_known_cves_in_hypervisor__e_g___qemu_rce_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in the hypervisor (QEMU or Cloud Hypervisor) to gain control of the virtual machine and subsequently the host system.
*   **Steps:**
    *   **2.1.1 Identify vulnerable hypervisor version:** The attacker determines the specific version of the hypervisor being used. This can often be done through fingerprinting techniques or by exploiting information leaks.
        *   Likelihood: High
        *   Impact: N/A (Information Gathering)
        *   Effort: Very Low
        *   Skill Level: Novice
        *   Detection Difficulty: Very Easy
    *   **2.1.2 Craft exploit based on CVE:** The attacker develops or obtains an exploit specifically designed for the identified vulnerability. Exploit code for many CVEs is publicly available.
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: Very High
        *   Effort: Medium
        *   Skill Level: Intermediate
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
    *   **2.1.3 Deploy exploit within container:** The attacker delivers the exploit to the container, often through a compromised application or service running within the container.
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: N/A (Deployment)
        *   Effort: Low
        *   Skill Level: Intermediate
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
    *   **2.1.4 Escape container {CRITICAL NODE} [HIGH RISK]:** The exploit successfully breaches the hypervisor's isolation, allowing the attacker to gain control of the host system.
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: Very High
        *   Effort: N/A (Result)
        *   Skill Level: N/A
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [2.3: Hypervisor Misconfiguration (e.g., exposed debug ports, insecure default settings)](./attack_tree_paths/2_3_hypervisor_misconfiguration__e_g___exposed_debug_ports__insecure_default_settings_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers leverage misconfigured hypervisor settings to gain unauthorized access or escalate privileges.
*   **Steps:**
    *   **2.3.1 Enumerate host configuration:** The attacker probes the hypervisor and host system to identify misconfigurations, such as exposed debug ports, weak authentication settings, or overly permissive access controls.
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: N/A (Information Gathering)
        *   Effort: Low
        *   Skill Level: Intermediate
        *   Detection Difficulty: Easy
    *   **2.3.2 Exploit misconfiguration (e.g., gain access to host network) {CRITICAL NODE} [HIGH RISK]:** The attacker uses the identified misconfiguration to gain access to the host system or resources, potentially bypassing the container's isolation.
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: Very High
        *   Effort: Medium
        *   Skill Level: Intermediate
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1: Known Kernel CVEs (Shared Kernel Model)](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_known_kernel_cves__shared_kernel_model_.md)

*   **Description:**  This path *only* applies if a shared kernel configuration is used (which is strongly discouraged). Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in the shared kernel to escape the container.
*   **Steps:**
    *   **3.1.1 Identify vulnerable kernel version:** The attacker determines the kernel version running on the host.
        *   Likelihood: High
        *   Impact: N/A
        *   Effort: Very Low
        *   Skill Level: Novice
        *   Detection Difficulty: Very Easy
    *   **3.1.2 Craft/Deploy exploit:** The attacker obtains or creates an exploit for the specific kernel vulnerability and deploys it within the container.
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: Very High
        *   Effort: Medium
        *   Skill Level: Intermediate
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
    *   **3.1.3 Escape container {CRITICAL NODE} [HIGH RISK]:** The kernel exploit allows the attacker to break out of the container's isolation and gain control of the host.
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: Very High
        *   Effort: N/A
        *   Skill Level: N/A
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [5.1: Vulnerable Base Image used within the Kata Container](./attack_tree_paths/5_1_vulnerable_base_image_used_within_the_kata_container.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities within the base image used for the Kata Container. This provides an initial foothold *inside* the container, which can then be used to launch further attacks (e.g., hypervisor escape).
*   **Steps:**
    *   **5.1.1 Exploit known vulnerabilities in the base image [HIGH RISK]:** The attacker identifies and exploits known vulnerabilities in the software packages or libraries included in the base image. This often involves using publicly available exploits.
        *   Likelihood: High
        *   Impact: Medium (initial access)
        *   Effort: Low
        *   Skill Level: Novice/Intermediate
        *   Detection Difficulty: Easy (with vulnerability scanning)
