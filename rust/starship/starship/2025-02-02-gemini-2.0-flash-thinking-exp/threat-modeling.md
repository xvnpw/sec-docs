# Threat Model Analysis for starship/starship

## Threat: [Malicious or Misconfigured Starship Configuration Files](./threats/malicious_or_misconfigured_starship_configuration_files.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could craft a malicious `starship.toml` file or trick a user into using a misconfigured one. This file could contain commands that execute arbitrary code when Starship renders the prompt, potentially by exploiting command substitutions or module configurations.
*   **Impact:** Local code execution on the developer's machine, information disclosure of sensitive data, denial of service of the shell environment.
*   **Affected Component:** Configuration parsing, module loading, command execution within modules.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Treat `starship.toml` files as code and use version control.
    *   Implement code review for configuration changes.
    *   Starship should rigorously validate configuration options.
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege for users running Starship.
    *   Use secure default configurations for Starship.
    *   Regularly audit Starship configurations.

## Threat: [Command Injection via Starship Modules](./threats/command_injection_via_starship_modules.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in how Starship modules construct and execute external commands. If modules don't properly sanitize inputs or use insecure command construction methods, attackers could inject arbitrary commands to be executed by the shell when the prompt is rendered.
*   **Impact:** Local code execution on the developer's machine, data exfiltration, potential for lateral movement if the compromised machine has network access.
*   **Affected Component:** Starship modules, specifically modules that execute external commands.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Starship developers must use secure command construction methods (parameterized commands, safe execution).
    *   Sanitize any user-provided input used in command construction within modules.
    *   Thoroughly review and audit module code for command injection vulnerabilities.
    *   Modules should adhere to the principle of least privilege, executing only necessary commands.

## Threat: [Compromise of the Starship Supply Chain](./threats/compromise_of_the_starship_supply_chain.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could compromise the Starship project's infrastructure, developer accounts, or build/release processes. This could allow them to inject malicious code into Starship releases, which would then be distributed to users.
*   **Impact:** Widespread malware distribution, compromise of developer machines using compromised Starship versions, potential for large-scale attacks.
*   **Affected Component:** Starship project infrastructure, build and release pipeline, distribution channels.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Download Starship only from official and trusted sources (GitHub releases, official package managers).
    *   Verify signatures or hashes of downloaded releases.
    *   Support and encourage security audits of the Starship project.
    *   Monitor the Starship community for signs of compromise or suspicious activity.
    *   Utilize security best practices for open-source project development and maintenance.
