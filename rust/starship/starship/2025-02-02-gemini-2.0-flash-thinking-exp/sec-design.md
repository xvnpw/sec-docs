# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
 - Goal: To provide a highly customizable and efficient command-line prompt that enhances user productivity and experience across different shells and operating systems.
 - Priority: User experience and customization are paramount. The project aims to be easy to install, configure, and extend. Cross-platform compatibility and performance are also key priorities.
 - Priority: Community growth and adoption. As an open-source project, widespread adoption and a vibrant community are crucial for its success and sustainability.

- Business Risks:
 - Risk:  Complexity in maintaining cross-shell and cross-platform compatibility. Changes in shell behaviors or operating systems could break functionality and require significant maintenance effort.
 - Risk: Security vulnerabilities in the prompt itself or its configuration. A compromised prompt could potentially lead to information disclosure or execution of malicious code in a user's shell environment.
 - Risk:  Dependence on community contributions. The project's progress and maintenance rely heavily on community contributions, which can be unpredictable.
 - Risk:  Competition from alternative prompt customization tools. The project needs to continuously innovate and adapt to stay relevant and attract users.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
 - security control: Code is publicly available on GitHub, allowing for community review and scrutiny. (Implemented: GitHub Repository)
 - security control:  Project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD, which can include basic security checks like linters and formatters. (Implemented: GitHub Workflows - inferred from common open-source practices)
 - security control:  Reliance on Rust's memory safety features to reduce the risk of memory-related vulnerabilities. (Implemented: Language Choice - Rust)
 - accepted risk:  Vulnerability in dependencies. The project relies on external Rust crates, which could contain vulnerabilities. (Accepted Risk: Dependency Management)
 - accepted risk:  Configuration complexity.  Highly customizable nature can lead to users creating insecure configurations. (Accepted Risk: User Configuration)

- Recommended Security Controls:
 - security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to detect potential vulnerabilities in the code.
 - security control:  Regularly audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities and update them promptly. Use tools like `cargo audit`.
 - security control:  Provide secure configuration guidelines and examples to users to minimize the risk of insecure configurations.
 - security control:  Implement input validation and sanitization for user-provided configuration values to prevent injection attacks.

- Security Requirements:
 - Authentication: Not applicable. Starship is a client-side application and does not handle user authentication.
 - Authorization: Not applicable. Starship does not manage access control or authorization.
 - Input Validation:
  - Requirement: Validate user-provided configuration values (e.g., in `starship.toml`) to prevent injection attacks or unexpected behavior.
  - Requirement: Sanitize environment variables used by Starship to prevent command injection vulnerabilities.
 - Cryptography:
  - Requirement:  If Starship were to handle sensitive data in the future (currently it doesn't seem to), ensure proper encryption and secure storage mechanisms are implemented. (Currently not applicable, but good practice to consider for future development).

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
 - Process: Providing a functional and reliable command-line prompt to users. While not a direct business process in a traditional sense, for developers and system administrators, a functional prompt is crucial for their daily workflow and productivity.
 - Process: Maintaining the project's reputation and community trust.  Security vulnerabilities or instability could damage the project's reputation and lead to decreased adoption.

- Data Sensitivity:
 - Data: User configuration files (`starship.toml`). These files can contain user preferences and potentially sensitive information if users inadvertently include secrets or API keys (though this is not the intended use).
 - Sensitivity: Low to Medium. Configuration files are generally user-specific and not intended to contain highly sensitive data. However, misconfiguration could expose some user preferences or potentially accidentally included secrets.
 - Data: Environment variables accessed by Starship. These can contain sensitive information depending on the user's environment.
 - Sensitivity: Medium to High. Environment variables can contain API keys, passwords, and other sensitive credentials. Starship needs to handle environment variables securely to avoid accidental exposure or misuse.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
 - Question: What is the intended user base for Starship? (Assumed: Developers, system administrators, and general command-line users).
 - Question: Are there any specific compliance requirements for Starship? (Assumed: No specific compliance requirements as it's an open-source CLI tool, but general security best practices are expected).
 - Question: Are there any plans to introduce features that handle more sensitive data in the future? (Assumed: Currently, Starship is primarily focused on prompt display and doesn't handle sensitive data directly, but future features might require more stringent security considerations).

- Assumptions:
 - Assumption: Business Posture: The primary goal is user experience and community growth for an open-source project.
 - Assumption: Security Posture:  Security is important, but the project operates with typical open-source security practices. Focus is on preventing common vulnerabilities and ensuring code quality.
 - Assumption: Design: The architecture is relatively simple, client-side application focused on prompt customization. Deployment is primarily through pre-compiled binaries. Build process uses standard CI/CD practices with some basic security checks.
