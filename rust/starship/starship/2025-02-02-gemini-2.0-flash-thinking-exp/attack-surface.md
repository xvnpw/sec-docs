# Attack Surface Analysis for starship/starship

## Attack Surface: [Maliciously Crafted `starship.toml` Configuration File](./attack_surfaces/maliciously_crafted__starship_toml__configuration_file.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in Starship's TOML parser can be exploited by a specially crafted configuration file.
*   **Starship Contribution:** Starship *directly* uses a TOML parser to process user-provided `starship.toml` for customization. Parser vulnerabilities are inherent to Starship's core functionality.
*   **Example:** A `starship.toml` file with excessively long strings could trigger a buffer overflow in Starship's parser, leading to arbitrary code execution when Starship loads the configuration.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution with user privileges, potentially leading to system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Use a memory-safe and rigorously tested TOML parsing library.
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization during configuration parsing to prevent parser exploits.
        *   Conduct thorough fuzzing and security testing specifically targeting the TOML parsing logic.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via Configuration Values](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_configuration_values.md)

*   **Description:**  Embedding shell commands or expansions in configuration values that are later executed by Starship can lead to command injection.
*   **Starship Contribution:** If Starship's code *directly* interprets configuration values as commands or passes them to shell execution functions without proper escaping, it creates this vulnerability.
*   **Example:**  A configuration value like `format = "$($command)"` where `$command` is read from `starship.toml` and executed by Starship without sanitization, allows arbitrary command injection.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution with user privileges, potentially leading to system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Avoid executing shell commands directly based on configuration values. Design Starship to minimize or eliminate the need for dynamic command execution from configuration.
        *   If command execution is absolutely necessary, implement strict sanitization and escaping of all configuration values used in commands to prevent injection.  Prefer parameterized commands or safer alternatives to direct shell execution.

## Attack Surface: [Execution of Untrusted External Modules/Commands (Directly Invoked by Starship)](./attack_surfaces/execution_of_untrusted_external_modulescommands__directly_invoked_by_starship_.md)

*   **Description:** Starship's modularity allows execution of external commands and scripts. If Starship *directly* invokes untrusted or malicious external commands based on configuration, it introduces a critical risk.
*   **Starship Contribution:** Starship's architecture *directly* supports and encourages the use of modules and custom commands, and Starship's code is responsible for invoking these external processes.  The risk arises from how Starship handles the *execution* of these external components.
*   **Example:**  A user configures Starship to use a custom module path specified in `starship.toml`. If Starship blindly executes scripts from this path without validation, a malicious actor could place a harmful script at that path, which Starship would then execute.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution with user privileges, potentially leading to system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement strict validation and sanitization of module paths and command names specified in the configuration.
        *   Consider sandboxing or isolating the execution environment of external modules to limit potential damage.
        *   Provide clear security warnings to users about the risks of using external modules and emphasize the importance of using trusted sources.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Update Process](./attack_surfaces/insecure_update_process.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerable update mechanism, *implemented by Starship*, can be exploited to deliver malicious updates, compromising the Starship installation.
*   **Starship Contribution:** If Starship *itself* includes an automatic update feature, the security of this process is Starship's direct responsibility.  Vulnerabilities in the update mechanism are directly attributable to Starship.
*   **Example:** Starship's update process uses unencrypted HTTP and lacks signature verification. An attacker could perform a man-in-the-middle attack to replace a legitimate Starship update with a malicious version, which the user would then install.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Starship installation and potentially the user's system.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement a secure update mechanism using HTTPS for all communication.
        *   Digitally sign all updates and rigorously verify signatures before applying them.
        *   Utilize established and secure update frameworks or libraries to minimize implementation errors.
