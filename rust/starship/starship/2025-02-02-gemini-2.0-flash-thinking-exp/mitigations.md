# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for starship/starship

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Configuration Sources](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_configuration_sources.md)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Identify all potential locations where Starship might load its configuration file (`starship.toml`). This includes user-specific directories (e.g., `$HOME/.config/starship.toml`, `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/starship.toml`), system-wide directories (e.g., `/etc/starship/starship.toml`), and environment variables that can override configuration.
*   Step 2:  Configure the application environment to explicitly ignore user-specific configuration paths. This might involve setting environment variables or modifying the application's startup scripts to prevent Starship from searching in user directories.
*   Step 3:  Establish a designated, system-wide configuration directory managed by administrators. Place a validated and secure `starship.toml` file in this location.
*   Step 4:  Document the approved configuration source and communicate it to relevant teams (development, operations, security).
*   Step 5:  Implement automated checks during deployment or startup to verify that Starship is loading its configuration from the designated system-wide location and not from user-controlled paths.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Threat:** Malicious User Configuration Override. Severity: Medium. (A malicious or compromised user could modify their local `starship.toml` to inject harmful commands or modules if user configurations are allowed and processed by the application environment).
*   **Threat:** Unintended Configuration Drift. Severity: Low. (Inconsistent configurations across different user environments can lead to unexpected behavior and make troubleshooting difficult).

**Impact:**
*   Malicious User Configuration Override: High risk reduction. (Completely prevents user-level configuration overrides, ensuring a controlled and secure configuration).
*   Unintended Configuration Drift: Medium risk reduction. (Promotes consistent configuration across the application environment).

**Currently Implemented:** No.

**Missing Implementation:**  All environments where Starship is used within the application (e.g., development, staging, production servers, CI/CD pipelines).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configuration File Validation and Sanitization](./mitigation_strategies/configuration_file_validation_and_sanitization.md)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Define a strict schema or template for the `starship.toml` configuration file. This schema should specify allowed modules, configuration options for each module, and restrict potentially risky features (e.g., custom commands, overly complex formatting).
*   Step 2: Develop an automated validation script or tool that parses the `starship.toml` file and checks it against the defined schema. This script should identify any deviations from the allowed configuration.
*   Step 3: Implement a sanitization process that automatically removes or neutralizes any disallowed or potentially harmful configurations found in the `starship.toml` file. This could involve removing entire modules, resetting specific options to safe defaults, or flagging the configuration for manual review.
*   Step 4: Integrate the validation and sanitization process into the application's deployment pipeline. Ensure that only validated and sanitized `starship.toml` files are deployed to production environments.
*   Step 5: Regularly review and update the validation schema and sanitization rules to address new potential risks and adapt to changes in Starship features.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Threat:** Injection of Malicious Commands via Configuration. Severity: High. (A compromised or malicious configuration file could contain commands within modules or custom formats that, if executed by Starship or the shell, could lead to system compromise).
*   **Threat:** Unintended Information Disclosure via Configuration. Severity: Medium. (A misconfigured `starship.toml` could inadvertently display sensitive information in the prompt, such as internal paths, usernames, or system details).

**Impact:**
*   Injection of Malicious Commands via Configuration: High risk reduction. (Significantly reduces the risk by preventing the deployment of configurations with potentially harmful commands or modules).
*   Unintended Information Disclosure via Configuration: Medium risk reduction. (Helps to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive information through prompt configuration).

**Currently Implemented:** No.

**Missing Implementation:**  Configuration management processes, deployment pipelines, and potentially as a pre-commit hook for developers working with Starship configurations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Default Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/secure_default_configuration.md)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Start with a minimal `starship.toml` configuration that only includes essential modules and features required for the application's context.
*   Step 2:  Disable any Starship modules that are not strictly necessary. This reduces the attack surface and potential for misconfiguration or vulnerabilities in less-used modules.
*   Step 3:  Carefully review the default settings of enabled modules and ensure they are configured securely. Pay attention to formatting strings, command executions, and information displayed in the prompt.
*   Step 4:  Document the rationale behind the chosen default configuration and the modules that are enabled and disabled.
*   Step 5:  Regularly review the default configuration to ensure it remains secure and aligned with security best practices, especially after Starship updates or changes in application requirements.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Threat:** Exposure of Unnecessary Features and Modules. Severity: Low. (Enabling unnecessary modules increases the attack surface and potential for vulnerabilities, even if not directly exploited).
*   **Threat:** Misconfiguration due to Complexity. Severity: Low. (Complex configurations are more prone to errors and misconfigurations that could lead to security issues).

**Impact:**
*   Exposure of Unnecessary Features and Modules: Low risk reduction. (Reduces the overall attack surface, but the impact is limited if vulnerabilities are not present in disabled modules).
*   Misconfiguration due to Complexity: Low risk reduction. (Simplifies configuration and reduces the chance of accidental misconfigurations).

**Currently Implemented:** Partially. A basic default configuration might be in place, but not explicitly reviewed for security.

**Missing Implementation:**  Formal security review of the default configuration, documentation of secure defaults, and processes to maintain secure defaults over time.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Starship Updates](./mitigation_strategies/regular_starship_updates.md)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Establish a process for regularly monitoring for new releases and security advisories specifically related to Starship.
*   Step 2:  Implement a schedule for updating Starship to the latest versions. This should be done in a timely manner after new releases are available, especially for security patches.
*   Step 3:  Test Starship updates in a non-production environment (e.g., staging) before deploying them to production to ensure compatibility and identify any potential issues.
*   Step 4:  Document the update process and maintain a record of Starship versions used in different environments.
*   Step 5:  Consider using automated tools to streamline the Starship update process.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Threat:** Exploitation of Known Starship Vulnerabilities. Severity: High. (Outdated versions of Starship may contain known security vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit).

**Impact:**
*   Exploitation of Known Starship Vulnerabilities: High risk reduction. (Significantly reduces the risk of exploitation by patching known Starship vulnerabilities promptly).

**Currently Implemented:** Partially. Standard update processes might exist for system packages, but not specifically focused on Starship.

**Missing Implementation:**  Dedicated monitoring for Starship updates, a defined update schedule for Starship, and explicit inclusion of Starship in vulnerability management processes.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Unnecessary Custom Modules](./mitigation_strategies/disable_unnecessary_custom_modules.md)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Review the currently configured Starship modules and identify any custom modules that are not essential for the application's functionality.
*   Step 2:  Remove or disable these unnecessary custom modules from the `starship.toml` configuration file.
*   Step 3:  Establish a policy that discourages the use of custom modules unless there is a clear and justified business need.
*   Step 4:  If custom modules are required, implement a strict review and approval process (as described in strategy "Strict Review Process for Custom Modules" in the previous full list).
*   Step 5:  Regularly review the enabled modules and ensure that only necessary custom modules remain active.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Custom Modules. Severity: Medium to High (depending on module complexity and source). (Custom modules, especially if developed in-house or obtained from untrusted sources, may contain vulnerabilities that could be exploited).
*   **Threat:** Malicious Functionality in Custom Modules. Severity: Medium to High (depending on module source and review process). (Custom modules could intentionally contain malicious code if not properly vetted).

**Impact:**
*   Vulnerabilities in Custom Modules: Medium to High risk reduction. (Eliminating unnecessary custom modules removes potential sources of vulnerabilities).
*   Malicious Functionality in Custom Modules: Medium to High risk reduction. (Reduces the risk of deploying and executing malicious custom code).

**Currently Implemented:** No. Custom modules usage might not be explicitly controlled or reviewed.

**Missing Implementation:**  Policy on custom module usage, process for disabling unnecessary custom modules, and potentially tooling to identify and manage custom modules.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Prompt Content Review](./mitigation_strategies/prompt_content_review.md)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Carefully examine the configured prompt format in `starship.toml`. Pay close attention to the information being displayed by each module.
*   Step 2:  Identify any modules or formatting strings that might be inadvertently disclosing sensitive information, such as internal paths, usernames, server names, or application details.
*   Step 3:  Modify the `starship.toml` configuration to remove or redact any sensitive information from the prompt. Replace sensitive details with generic placeholders or remove the modules altogether if they are not essential.
*   Step 4:  Establish a process for reviewing prompt content whenever the `starship.toml` configuration is updated to ensure that no new sensitive information is introduced.
*   Step 5:  Educate developers and operations teams about the importance of avoiding information disclosure in prompts and provide guidelines for secure prompt configuration.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Threat:** Unintended Information Disclosure in Prompt. Severity: Low to Medium. (Displaying sensitive information in the prompt can aid attackers in reconnaissance and provide valuable details about the system or application).

**Impact:**
*   Unintended Information Disclosure in Prompt: Medium risk reduction. (Reduces the risk of information leakage through the prompt, making it harder for attackers to gather reconnaissance information).

**Currently Implemented:** No. Prompt content is likely not reviewed specifically for sensitive information disclosure.

**Missing Implementation:**  Process for reviewing prompt content for sensitive information, guidelines for secure prompt configuration, and potentially automated checks to detect potential information disclosure in `starship.toml`.
