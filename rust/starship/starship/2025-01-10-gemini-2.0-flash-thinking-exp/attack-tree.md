# Attack Tree Analysis for starship/starship

Objective: Attacker's Goal: To execute arbitrary code within the context of the application by exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations related to the Starship prompt.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Starship Configuration -> Inject Malicious Code via Custom Format String](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_starship_configuration_-_inject_malicious_code_via_custom_format_string.md)

Attack Vector:
    - Precondition: The application displays or logs information that includes the rendered Starship prompt.
    - Action: The attacker crafts a malicious custom format string within Starship's configuration. When Starship renders the prompt, this malicious string is interpreted, potentially executing arbitrary code or commands.
    - Likelihood: Medium - Depends on application logging and output practices.
    - Impact: High - Can lead to arbitrary code execution within the application's context.
    - Effort: Medium - Requires understanding Starship's format string syntax and crafting a working exploit.
    - Skill Level: Medium - Requires knowledge of format string vulnerabilities and shell command execution.
    - Detection Difficulty: Medium - Difficult to distinguish from legitimate prompt elements without specific monitoring.

Critical Node: Inject Malicious Code via Custom Format String
- This node is critical due to the direct potential for arbitrary code execution.
- If an attacker can successfully inject malicious code via a format string, they can directly compromise the application or the user's environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Starship Configuration -> Poison Starship Configuration File](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_starship_configuration_-_poison_starship_configuration_file.md)

Attack Vector:
    - Precondition: The attacker gains write access to the user's Starship configuration file (e.g., `.config/starship.toml`).
    - Action: The attacker modifies the configuration file to include malicious commands or scripts. These commands are executed when Starship renders the prompt in subsequent shell sessions.
    - Likelihood: Low - Requires gaining unauthorized write access.
    - Impact: High - Can lead to persistent arbitrary code execution whenever the prompt is rendered.
    - Effort: Medium - Requires gaining unauthorized access. Configuration modification is simple.
    - Skill Level: Medium - Requires skills to gain unauthorized access and basic shell scripting knowledge.
    - Detection Difficulty: Medium - Requires monitoring file changes and analyzing configuration content.

Critical Node: Poison Starship Configuration File
- This node is critical because it allows for persistent compromise.
- Once the configuration is poisoned, the attacker's code can be executed repeatedly without further direct action.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Starship's Code -> Trigger Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Starship](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_starship's_code_-_trigger_remote_code_execution__rce__via_starship.md)

Attack Vector:
    - Precondition: A remotely exploitable vulnerability exists in Starship's code (parsing logic, dependencies, etc.).
    - Action: The attacker crafts a specific input (e.g., a malicious prompt element or configuration value) that triggers the RCE vulnerability when processed by Starship.
    - Likelihood: Low - Requires the existence of a specific, exploitable vulnerability.
    - Impact: High - Direct code execution on the user's machine.
    - Effort: High - Requires identifying and exploiting a zero-day or known unpatched vulnerability.
    - Skill Level: High - Requires advanced reverse engineering and exploit development skills.
    - Detection Difficulty: Low to Medium - Known exploits might have signatures; zero-days are harder to detect.

Critical Node: Trigger Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Starship
- This node represents a direct exploitation of a vulnerability within Starship's code.
- Success here grants the attacker immediate code execution on the user's machine.
- It's critical due to the high impact of RCE.
