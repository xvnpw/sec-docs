# Threat Model Analysis for starship/starship

## Threat: [Malicious `starship.toml` from Untrusted Source](./threats/malicious__starship_toml__from_untrusted_source.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a developer with a crafted `starship.toml` file (e.g., via email, shared repository, or website). The file contains configuration settings that execute arbitrary commands when Starship initializes. The attacker might aim to gain access to the developer's machine, steal credentials, or disrupt their work environment.

**Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine, potentially leading to data breaches, malware installation, or denial of service.

**Affected Component:** `config` module (specifically the TOML parsing and configuration loading logic).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [Compromised `starship.toml` on Developer Machine](./threats/compromised__starship_toml__on_developer_machine.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to a developer's machine (e.g., through malware or social engineering) and modifies the existing `starship.toml` file to include malicious commands. When the developer opens a new terminal, these commands are executed.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine, potentially leading to data breaches, malware installation, or privilege escalation.

**Affected Component:** `config` module (specifically the file reading and processing logic).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [Command Injection via Git Status Module](./threats/command_injection_via_git_status_module.md)

**Description:** Starship's `git_status` module executes `git status` and parses its output. If a repository contains specially crafted filenames or branch names with shell metacharacters, and Starship doesn't properly sanitize the output before processing it, an attacker could potentially inject arbitrary commands that are executed by the shell.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the shell. This could lead to local privilege escalation or access to sensitive data within the repository.

**Affected Component:** `git_status` module (specifically the logic that parses the output of `git status`).

**Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Supply Chain Compromise of Starship](./threats/supply_chain_compromise_of_starship.md)

**Description:**  An attacker compromises the Starship repository, build process, or distribution channels and injects malicious code into a Starship release. Developers who download and install this compromised version would then be running the malicious code.

**Impact:**  Widespread arbitrary code execution on developer machines, potentially leading to significant data breaches and security incidents.

**Affected Component:** The entire Starship application and its installation process.

**Risk Severity:** Critical
