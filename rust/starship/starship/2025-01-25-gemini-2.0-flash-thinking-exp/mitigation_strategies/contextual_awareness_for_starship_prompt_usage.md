#### 4.1. Component 1: Educate developers about prompt context

*   **Description:** Train developers to be aware of the context in which they are using their Starship prompts and the potential visibility of their terminal screens. Emphasize that prompts displayed in shared environments, during screen sharing, in recorded sessions, or in public places should be considered potentially visible to others.

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Foundational Layer:** Education is the cornerstone of any security awareness program. It aims to create a security-conscious culture within the development team.
    *   **Low Cost & High Reach:**  Training can be relatively inexpensive to implement (e.g., online modules, internal presentations) and can reach all developers.
    *   **Addresses Root Cause:** By increasing awareness, it targets the human element, which is often a significant factor in security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Versatile & Applicable Beyond Starship:** The principle of contextual awareness extends beyond Starship prompts and applies to various aspects of secure development practices.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Relies on Human Behavior:**  Education alone is not a foolproof solution. Developers might forget, become complacent, or prioritize convenience over security.
    *   **Effectiveness Measurement Challenges:** Quantifying the impact of awareness training can be difficult.
    *   **One-Time Effort Limitation:**  Initial training needs to be reinforced and updated regularly to remain effective.
    *   **Potential for Information Overload:**  If not delivered effectively, developers might become overwhelmed or disengaged with security training.
