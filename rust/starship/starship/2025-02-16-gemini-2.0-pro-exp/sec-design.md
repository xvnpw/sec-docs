Okay, let's create a design document for the Starship project.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Starship is a customizable prompt for any shell. The project's primary goal is to provide a fast, aesthetically pleasing, and highly configurable prompt experience for developers and command-line users. The business priorities are:

*   User Experience: Providing a seamless and enjoyable user experience is paramount. This includes speed, customization, and ease of use.
*   Community Engagement: Fostering a strong and active community around the project is crucial for its long-term success. This includes contributions, feedback, and support.
*   Maintainability: Ensuring the project remains maintainable and easy to contribute to is important for its longevity.
*   Cross-Shell Compatibility: Supporting a wide range of shells ensures broad adoption and usability.

Business risks that need to be addressed:

*   Performance Degradation: Any changes that significantly impact the prompt's rendering speed could negatively affect user experience.
*   Configuration Complexity: Overly complex configuration options could deter users and make the prompt difficult to set up.
*   Security Vulnerabilities: While primarily a client-side tool, vulnerabilities in configuration parsing or external command execution could pose security risks.
*   Breaking Changes: Introducing changes that break existing user configurations could lead to user frustration and abandonment.
*   Lack of Community Adoption: If the project fails to attract and retain users and contributors, its long-term viability is at risk.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:

*   security control: Code Reviews: All contributions go through a code review process on GitHub. (Described in GitHub pull request process).
*   security control: Community Scrutiny: Being an open-source project, the codebase is subject to scrutiny by the community. (Described in GitHub repository).
*   security control: Limited External Dependencies: The project strives to minimize external dependencies to reduce the attack surface. (Described in project's `Cargo.toml` file).
*   security control: Regular Updates: The project is actively maintained, and updates are released regularly, including security patches. (Described in GitHub releases).
*   security control: Sandboxing: Starship executes within the user's shell environment, inheriting its security context. It doesn't run with elevated privileges. (Implicit in shell execution model).

Accepted risks:

*   accepted risk: User-Defined Configuration: The prompt's behavior is heavily influenced by user-defined configuration, which could potentially introduce vulnerabilities if not handled carefully.
*   accepted risk: External Command Execution: The prompt can execute external commands based on user configuration, which poses a risk if those commands are compromised.
*   accepted risk: Shell-Specific Vulnerabilities: The security of the prompt is ultimately dependent on the security of the underlying shell.

Recommended security controls:

*   security control: Input Sanitization: Implement rigorous input sanitization for all user-configurable values, especially those used in external command execution.
*   security control: Static Analysis: Integrate static analysis tools (e.g., Clippy for Rust) into the build process to identify potential security vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Fuzz Testing: Implement fuzz testing to identify potential vulnerabilities in configuration parsing and command execution.
*   security control: Dependency Auditing: Regularly audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities and update them promptly.
*   security control: Security Policy: Create a `SECURITY.md` file in the repository to provide clear instructions for reporting security vulnerabilities.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication: Not directly applicable, as Starship operates within the user's existing shell authentication context.
*   Authorization: Not directly applicable, as Starship inherits the user's shell permissions.
*   Input Validation: All user-configurable inputs, especially those used in external command execution, MUST be rigorously validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks.
*   Cryptography: If any cryptographic operations are performed (e.g., for future features like credential management), industry-standard cryptographic libraries and practices MUST be used.
*   Configuration Security: The configuration file parsing logic MUST be secure and resistant to injection attacks.

```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developers push code changes to the GitHub repository.
2.  GitHub Actions (the CI system) is triggered by push events and pull requests.
3.  The CI workflow performs the following steps:
    *   Checks out the code.
    *   Sets up the Rust toolchain.
    *   Runs unit and integration tests.
    *   Runs linters (Clippy) to check for code style and potential errors.
    *   Runs formatters (rustfmt) to ensure consistent code formatting.
    *   Builds the Starship binary for various target platforms.
    *   Creates release artifacts (binaries).
    *   Publishes the artifacts to GitHub Releases (on tagged commits).

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   security control: Automated Build: The build process is fully automated using GitHub Actions, ensuring consistency and reproducibility.
*   security control: CI/CD Pipeline: GitHub Actions provides a secure and controlled environment for building and testing the software.
*   security control: Static Analysis: Linters (Clippy) are used to perform static analysis and identify potential security vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Testing: Automated tests (unit and integration) help ensure the correctness and security of the code.
*   security control: Code Review: All code changes are reviewed before being merged into the main branch.
*   security control: Dependency Management: Cargo (Rust's package manager) manages dependencies, and regular audits should be performed.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

*   Critical Business Processes:
    *   Providing a fast and customizable prompt experience.
    *   Maintaining a healthy and active open-source project.

*   Data:
    *   Configuration Data (TOML file): Sensitivity is low, as it primarily contains user preferences for the prompt's appearance. However, vulnerabilities in parsing this data could lead to code execution.
    *   System Information (gathered by modules): Sensitivity varies depending on the modules used. Information like Git status is generally low sensitivity, but modules that access environment variables or other system data could have higher sensitivity.
    *   No user data is stored or transmitted by Starship itself. It operates entirely locally.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

*   Questions:
    *   Are there any plans to introduce features that would require handling sensitive data (e.g., credentials)?
    *   What is the process for handling security vulnerabilities reported by the community?
    *   Are there any specific shell versions or operating system configurations that are known to be problematic?
    *   Is there a mechanism for users to report performance issues or bugs?
    *   What level of assurance is provided for the integrity of the installation script and pre-built binaries?

*   Assumptions:
    *   BUSINESS POSTURE: The project prioritizes user experience and community engagement.
    *   BUSINESS POSTURE: The project aims to be cross-platform and support a wide range of shells.
    *   SECURITY POSTURE: Users are responsible for securing their own shell environment and configuration files.
    *   SECURITY POSTURE: The project relies on the security of external commands executed by modules.
    *   DESIGN: The installation script is the primary recommended installation method.
    *   DESIGN: GitHub Actions is used for CI/CD.
    *   DESIGN: The configuration file is in TOML format.
    *   DESIGN: Starship operates within the user's existing shell environment and does not require elevated privileges.
