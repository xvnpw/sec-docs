Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Sensitive Information Disclosure via Environment Variables" threat for applications using Starship, following a structured approach:

## Deep Analysis: Sensitive Information Disclosure via Environment Variables in Starship

### 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the mechanisms by which Starship might expose sensitive information through environment variables, assess the associated risks, and propose concrete, actionable steps to mitigate these risks effectively.  This goes beyond the initial threat model description to provide practical guidance for developers.

### 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the `starship` prompt customization tool and its interaction with environment variables.  The scope includes:

*   **Built-in `env_var` module:**  Analyzing its configuration options (`variable`, `prefix`, `format`, `disabled`) and their potential for misuse.
*   **Custom modules:**  Examining how custom modules can access and potentially expose environment variables.
*   **`starship.toml` configuration file:**  Identifying risky configurations within this file.
*   **Prompt rendering:** Understanding how the final prompt is constructed and where sanitization might be necessary.
*   **Web-based terminal scenarios:**  Specifically considering the increased risk when Starship is used in a web-based terminal emulator, where the rendered prompt is transmitted over a network.
* **Local terminal scenarios:** Considering the risk of shoulder surfing or screen recording.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   General environment variable security best practices outside the context of Starship.
*   Vulnerabilities in the terminal emulator itself (unless directly related to how Starship's output is handled).
*   Operating system-level security measures.

### 3. Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methods:

*   **Code Review:**  Examining the Starship source code (particularly the `env_var` module and related components) to understand how environment variables are accessed and processed.  This will be done using the provided GitHub link.
*   **Configuration Analysis:**  Creating and testing various `starship.toml` configurations, including both safe and intentionally vulnerable setups, to observe the behavior of Starship.
*   **Dynamic Testing:**  Running Starship in different environments (local terminal, web-based terminal) with various environment variables set, to observe the rendered output and identify potential leaks.
*   **Threat Modeling Extension:**  Building upon the provided threat model description to identify specific attack vectors and scenarios.
*   **Best Practices Research:**  Consulting security best practices for handling sensitive data and environment variables.

### 4. Deep Analysis

#### 4.1. Attack Vectors and Scenarios

*   **Web-Based Terminal Exposure:**  A user configures Starship to display an AWS access key ID in their prompt.  They then use a web-based terminal (e.g., through a cloud IDE or a remote access tool).  An attacker who can intercept the network traffic between the user's browser and the server hosting the terminal can see the rendered prompt, including the access key ID.  This could be achieved through a man-in-the-middle attack, compromised network infrastructure, or even by exploiting vulnerabilities in the web terminal application itself.

*   **Shoulder Surfing/Screen Recording:** A user working in a public space or sharing their screen during a meeting has Starship configured to display sensitive environment variables.  An attacker observing the screen (either directly or through a recording) can capture this information.

*   **Configuration File Leak:**  A user accidentally commits their `starship.toml` file, which contains a configuration exposing sensitive environment variables, to a public Git repository.  An attacker scanning public repositories for such misconfigurations can find and exploit the exposed information.

*   **Custom Module Vulnerability:**  A user installs a third-party Starship custom module that, either intentionally or unintentionally, displays sensitive environment variables.  This could be due to a bug in the module or a malicious design.

*   **Misunderstanding of `prefix`:** A user believes that using the `prefix` option with a value like `MY_` will only display variables starting with `MY_`. However, if they have a variable named `MY_SECRET_KEY`, it will still be displayed. The user intended to only show non-sensitive variables.

#### 4.2. Code Review Findings (Hypothetical - Requires Access to Starship Source)

*(Note: This section is hypothetical, as I'm acting as an expert, but I'm providing the *type* of analysis that would be done.  A real code review would require examining the actual Starship source code.)*

*   **`env_var` Module:**  The code review would focus on how the `env_var` module retrieves environment variables.  It would check for:
    *   **Direct Access:**  Does the module directly access environment variables using functions like `getenv()` or similar?
    *   **Filtering Logic:**  How is the `prefix` option implemented?  Is it a simple string comparison, or does it handle edge cases and potential bypasses correctly?
    *   **Sanitization:**  Is there any attempt to sanitize or escape the values of environment variables before they are included in the prompt?  (This is unlikely, as it's generally the responsibility of the application displaying the prompt, but it's worth checking.)
    *   **Error Handling:**  What happens if an environment variable is not found or if there's an error accessing it?  Does this lead to any unexpected behavior or information disclosure?

*   **Custom Module Interface:**  The code review would examine how custom modules are loaded and executed.  It would check for:
    *   **Access Restrictions:**  Are there any restrictions on what custom modules can do?  Can they access arbitrary environment variables, or are there any security boundaries?
    *   **Input Validation:**  If custom modules accept input, is this input properly validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks?

*   **Prompt Rendering Engine:** The code review would look at how the final prompt string is constructed. It would check:
    * **String concatenation:** How different parts of prompt are concatenated.
    * **Escaping:** If there is any escaping mechanism.

#### 4.3. Configuration Analysis Examples

*   **Vulnerable Configuration:**

    ```toml
    [env_var.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID]
    disabled = false

    [env_var.DATABASE_PASSWORD]
    disabled = false
    ```

    This configuration directly exposes the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `DATABASE_PASSWORD` environment variables in the prompt.

*   **Slightly Less Vulnerable (But Still Bad) Configuration:**

    ```toml
    [env_var.API_KEY]
    variable = "MY_SECRET_API_KEY"
    disabled = false
    ```

    This configuration exposes a specific environment variable named `MY_SECRET_API_KEY`.  While it's slightly better than exposing all variables, it's still highly vulnerable.

*   **Incorrect Use of `prefix`:**

    ```toml
    [env_var]
    variable = "MY_VAR"
    prefix = "MY_"
    disabled = false
    ```
    This will show `MY_VAR` but also `MY_VAR_SECRET`.

*   **Safer Configuration (Using Substitution):**

    ```toml
    [env_var.AWS_CREDENTIALS]
    variable = "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"  # We still need to know *which* variable to check
    format = "[AWS Credentials Configured]"  # But we display a static string
    disabled = false
    ```

    This configuration checks for the existence of `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` but displays a fixed string, indicating that AWS credentials are set up without revealing their value.  This is a much safer approach.

* **Safe Configuration (Using `disabled`):**
    ```toml
    [env_var.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID]
    disabled = true

    [env_var.DATABASE_PASSWORD]
    disabled = true
    ```
    This configuration completely disables displaying of sensitive variables.

#### 4.4. Dynamic Testing Results (Hypothetical)

*(Note: These are hypothetical results, illustrating the kind of observations that would be made during dynamic testing.)*

*   **Local Terminal:**  Setting `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and using the vulnerable configuration would display the key directly in the prompt.  This confirms the basic vulnerability.

*   **Web-Based Terminal (with Network Monitoring):**  Using a web-based terminal and capturing the network traffic (e.g., with a browser's developer tools or a proxy like Burp Suite) would reveal the rendered prompt, including the sensitive environment variable, being transmitted in plain text.

*   **Custom Module Test:**  Creating a simple custom module that accesses and prints `MY_SECRET_VARIABLE` would demonstrate that custom modules have unrestricted access to environment variables (unless specific security measures are implemented in Starship, which would be identified during the code review).

#### 4.5. Mitigation Strategies (Reinforced and Expanded)

The initial mitigation strategies are good, but we can expand on them with more detail and context:

1.  **Configuration Review (Prioritized):** This is the *most crucial* mitigation.  Developers *must* thoroughly review their `starship.toml` and remove any `env_var` configurations that expose sensitive variables.  Use `disabled = true` liberally.  This should be a mandatory step in any development workflow involving Starship.

2.  **Prefix Filtering (with Caution):** The `prefix` option can be helpful, but it's *not* a foolproof solution.  Developers should use it with extreme caution and understand its limitations.  It's best used for displaying *categories* of non-sensitive variables, not as a security mechanism to filter out sensitive ones.  Thorough testing is essential.  *Never* rely on `prefix` alone to protect sensitive data.

3.  **Substitution (Recommended):** This is the *recommended* approach for displaying information related to sensitive environment variables without actually revealing their values.  Use descriptive labels or placeholders (e.g., "[API Key Set]", "[Database Configured]").  This provides useful context to the user without compromising security.

4.  **Custom Module Audit (Mandatory):** If custom modules are used, a rigorous code audit is *mandatory*.  Developers should:
    *   Verify the source and trustworthiness of any third-party modules.
    *   Carefully examine the module's code to ensure it doesn't access or display sensitive environment variables.
    *   Prefer modules from reputable sources with a clear history of security best practices.
    *   Consider sandboxing or restricting the capabilities of custom modules if possible (this would require changes to Starship itself).

5.  **Application-Level Sanitization (Defense-in-Depth):** This is a critical layer of defense.  The application displaying the prompt (e.g., the web terminal emulator) should *always* sanitize the output, regardless of how Starship is configured.  This can involve:
    *   **Regular Expression Filtering:**  Use regular expressions to detect and remove patterns that match known sensitive data formats (e.g., AWS access key IDs, API keys).
    *   **Whitelisting:**  Only allow specific, known-safe characters and patterns to be displayed.
    *   **Encoding/Escaping:**  Encode or escape any potentially sensitive characters to prevent them from being interpreted as code or commands.
    * **Context aware filtering:** Sanitize prompt differently, based on context. For example, if prompt is displayed in web terminal, sanitization should be more strict.

6.  **Environment Variable Management:** While not directly related to Starship, it's crucial to follow best practices for managing environment variables:
    *   **Avoid Storing Secrets in Environment Variables Directly:** Use a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) to store and retrieve sensitive data.
    *   **Least Privilege:**  Grant only the necessary permissions to access environment variables.
    *   **Regular Auditing:**  Regularly audit environment variables to ensure they don't contain any unintended sensitive information.

7.  **Education and Awareness:** Developers should be educated about the risks of exposing sensitive information in the prompt and the proper use of Starship's configuration options.

### 5. Conclusion

The "Sensitive Information Disclosure via Environment Variables" threat in Starship is a serious concern, particularly in web-based terminal scenarios.  The primary vulnerability lies in misconfiguration or the use of custom modules that expose sensitive data.  By following the recommended mitigation strategies, particularly thorough configuration review, substitution, application-level sanitization, and careful auditing of custom modules, developers can significantly reduce the risk of exposing sensitive information through their Starship prompt.  A defense-in-depth approach, combining multiple layers of security, is essential for protecting against this threat.
