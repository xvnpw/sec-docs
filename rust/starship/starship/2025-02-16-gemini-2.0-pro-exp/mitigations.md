# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for starship/starship

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Command Whitelisting](./mitigation_strategies/strict_command_whitelisting.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Essential Commands:** Determine the minimum set of external commands your Starship configuration needs.
    2.  **Explicitly Define in `starship.toml`:**  Within each module in `starship.toml` that uses external commands, use the `command` key to specify *only* the allowed commands.  Do *not* rely on default command settings.  Example:
        ```toml
        [git_status]
        command = "git status --porcelain=v1"

        [git_branch]
        command = "git branch --show-current"
        ```
    3.  **Regular Review:** Periodically review and update the whitelist.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Arbitrary Command Execution (High Severity):** Prevents execution of commands not on the whitelist.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (High Severity):** Limits potential for privilege escalation through other utilities.
    *   **Data Exfiltration (High Severity):** Restricts the use of exfiltration tools.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Starship *allows* specifying the `command` in `starship.toml`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Argument Validation:** Starship does not have built-in argument validation (this would need external tools).
    *   **Centralized Whitelist Management:** No built-in mechanism for managing a global whitelist.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Timeout Enforcement](./mitigation_strategies/timeout_enforcement.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Edit `starship.toml`:** Open your `starship.toml` file.
    2.  **Set `scan_timeout`:** Add or modify the `scan_timeout` option at the top level. Set it to a reasonable value in milliseconds (e.g., `1000` for 1 second).
        ```toml
        scan_timeout = 1000
        ```
    3.  **Test:** Restart your shell and test.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Prevents hung commands from blocking the shell.
    *   **Slow Command Exploitation (Low Severity):** Reduces the window for exploiting slow commands.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Slow Command Exploitation:** Risk slightly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Fully implemented. Starship supports the `scan_timeout` option.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   None.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Explicit Environment Variable Whitelisting](./mitigation_strategies/explicit_environment_variable_whitelisting.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Necessary Variables:** Determine which environment variables (if any) you *need* to display.
    2.  **Use `env_var` Module:** In `starship.toml`, use the `env_var` module for each variable. Specify the variable name *explicitly*. Do *not* use wildcards.
        ```toml
        [[env_var]]
        variable = "MY_VARIABLE"
        format = "[$env_value]($style) "

        [[env_var]]
        variable = "ANOTHER_VARIABLE"
        format = "[$env_value]($style) "
        ```
    3.  **Avoid Sensitive Variables:** Do *not* include sensitive variables.
    4.  **Regular Review:** Periodically review the list.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium to High Severity):** Prevents sensitive information in environment variables from being displayed.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Starship *allows* specifying environment variables explicitly.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Stricter Enforcement:** Starship could offer a mode that *only* allows explicitly listed variables.
    *   **Documentation:** Documentation could emphasize the risks more strongly.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Updates](./mitigation_strategies/regular_updates.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Check for Updates:** Regularly check for new Starship releases (website, package manager, `starship --version`).
    2.  **Update Starship:** Update using your installation method (package manager, binary download, installation script).
    3.  **Test:** Test the prompt after updating.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Starship (Variable Severity):** Updates include security patches.
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Dependencies (Variable Severity):** Updates may include updated dependencies with security fixes.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced by applying patches.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Starship provides update mechanisms.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Automatic Update Notifications:** Starship could provide built-in notifications.
    *   **Signed Releases:** While checksums are provided, signatures would be stronger.
