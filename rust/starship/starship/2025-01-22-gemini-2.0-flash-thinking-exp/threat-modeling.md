# Threat Model Analysis for starship/starship

## Threat: [Malicious Configuration Injection](./threats/malicious_configuration_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized write access to the `starship.toml` configuration file. By modifying this file, they inject malicious commands within Starship's custom command feature, format strings, or module configurations. When Starship renders the prompt, these injected commands are executed with the privileges of the user running the shell. Attackers might exploit weak file permissions, compromised user accounts, or vulnerabilities in systems managing the configuration file to achieve this.

**Impact:** Arbitrary command execution leading to full system compromise, unauthorized data access and exfiltration, privilege escalation to root or administrator, and complete denial of service.

**Affected Starship Component:** Configuration loading mechanism, custom commands, format strings, module configurations, `starship.toml` file parsing and execution.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Strictly restrict write permissions on the `starship.toml` file to the owner user only.
*   Implement robust file integrity monitoring and alerting for unauthorized modifications to `starship.toml`.
*   Develop and enforce a configuration validation process to automatically detect and reject potentially dangerous commands or configurations within `starship.toml` before they are applied.
*   Apply the principle of least privilege to the shell environment and any applications utilizing Starship, limiting the potential damage from command execution.

## Threat: [Malicious Module Exploitation](./threats/malicious_module_exploitation.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a security vulnerability present within a Starship module, either a core module or a custom, user-installed module. This could involve command injection flaws in how modules execute external commands, path traversal vulnerabilities when modules access files, or exploitation of insecure dependencies used by the module. Attackers could trigger these vulnerabilities by crafting specific input or conditions that the vulnerable module processes during prompt rendering.

**Impact:** Arbitrary command execution, potentially leading to system compromise, sensitive information disclosure by modules accessing unauthorized data, or denial of service if a module can be made to consume excessive resources.

**Affected Starship Component:** Starship modules (both core and custom), the module execution environment, external commands invoked by modules, module dependency handling.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Conduct regular security audits of both core and custom Starship modules, with a focus on identifying command injection, path traversal, and insecure dependency usage.
*   Maintain up-to-date versions of Starship and all module dependencies to ensure known vulnerabilities are patched promptly.
*   Establish and enforce secure coding practices for the development of custom Starship modules, specifically preventing command injection and path traversal vulnerabilities.
*   Implement the principle of least privilege for any external processes spawned by Starship modules, limiting their access to system resources and sensitive data.
*   Modules should rigorously validate and sanitize all external input and data they process to prevent injection attacks and other input-based vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Dependency Chain Vulnerabilities in Modules](./threats/dependency_chain_vulnerabilities_in_modules.md)

**Description:** Starship modules rely on external libraries and commands to function. If a module depends on a vulnerable external dependency, attackers can exploit known vulnerabilities in these dependencies *through* the Starship module. Even if Starship's core code and module code are secure, a vulnerable dependency can be the entry point for attacks when triggered by module functionality during prompt generation.

**Impact:** Arbitrary command execution, information disclosure, or denial of service, originating from the exploited vulnerability in the dependency but triggered and executed within the context of Starship and the user's shell.

**Affected Starship Component:** Starship modules, module dependency management, external libraries and commands used by modules.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement regular and automated scanning of Starship's dependencies and all module dependencies for known security vulnerabilities using software composition analysis (SCA) tools.
*   Maintain a strict policy of keeping all dependencies updated to the latest security patches.
*   Utilize dependency pinning or locking mechanisms to ensure consistent and controlled dependency versions, preventing unexpected updates that might introduce new vulnerabilities.
*   Prioritize modules that minimize external dependencies and rely on well-maintained and actively secured libraries.

## Threat: [Compromised Starship Distribution](./threats/compromised_starship_distribution.md)

**Description:** The official Starship distribution channels, such as the GitHub repository, release packages, or package manager distributions, are compromised by an attacker. Malicious code is injected directly into the Starship binaries or source code at the distribution point. Users who download and install Starship from these compromised channels unknowingly install a trojanized version containing malware. This represents a severe supply chain attack targeting the Starship user base.

**Impact:** Critical and widespread system compromise across all systems installing the compromised Starship version. This can lead to mass data theft, installation of persistent backdoors, participation in botnets, and complete loss of system integrity and confidentiality.

**Affected Starship Component:** Starship distribution infrastructure, release process, binaries, installation process, entire user base.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Crucially**, always verify the integrity of Starship downloads using checksums (like SHA256) and digital signatures provided by the official Starship project and trusted sources.
*   Download Starship only from official and highly trusted distribution channels, such as the official Starship GitHub releases page or reputable and verified package managers.
*   Implement robust security monitoring on systems after installing or updating Starship to detect any unusual or malicious activity that might indicate a compromised installation.
*   For organizations with high security requirements, consider performing independent code audits of Starship, especially for critical deployments, to identify any potential backdoors or malicious code.
