# Attack Surface Analysis for starship/starship

## Attack Surface: [1. Unsafe Configuration Options Leading to Code Execution](./attack_surfaces/1__unsafe_configuration_options_leading_to_code_execution.md)

*   **Description:** Configuration options that allow for indirect or direct execution of arbitrary commands or loading of dynamic libraries.
*   **Starship Contribution:**  Starship's design, if it includes overly permissive configuration options for customization, can create pathways for malicious code execution through its configuration.
*   **Example:** A configuration option that allows specifying a path to an external script to be executed for a module, without proper input validation. An attacker could modify `starship.toml` to point to a malicious script, leading to execution when Starship renders the prompt.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary Code Execution, System Compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Strictly avoid introducing configuration options that directly or indirectly enable execution of arbitrary commands or loading of external code.
        *   If external command execution is absolutely necessary for modules, implement robust sandboxing, input validation, and the principle of least privilege.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Exercise extreme caution when using custom modules or configurations from untrusted sources.
        *   Thoroughly review and understand the implications of each configuration option in `starship.toml` before applying it.

## Attack Surface: [2. Command Injection in Modules](./attack_surfaces/2__command_injection_in_modules.md)

*   **Description:** Modules executing external commands without proper input sanitization, leading to command injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Starship Contribution:** Starship modules frequently execute external commands to gather information for the prompt. Vulnerabilities in module code that fail to sanitize inputs when constructing these commands can lead to command injection.
*   **Example:** A module might use an environment variable in a command without proper escaping. An attacker could manipulate this environment variable to inject malicious commands that are executed by the shell when Starship renders the prompt. For instance, setting `MY_VAR="; malicious_command"` and a vulnerable module using `$MY_VAR` in a shell command.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary Code Execution, System Compromise, Data Exfiltration.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement rigorous input sanitization and validation for all inputs used in constructing external commands within modules.
        *   Utilize parameterized commands or secure command execution methods provided by the programming language to prevent shell injection.
        *   Conduct regular security audits of module code, specifically focusing on identifying and eliminating potential command injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Be highly cautious when using custom modules, especially those from untrusted sources.
        *   If developing custom modules, adhere to secure coding practices to prevent command injection vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [3. Dependency on Vulnerable External Tools](./attack_surfaces/3__dependency_on_vulnerable_external_tools.md)

*   **Description:** Starship's functionality relies on external tools (like `git`, language interpreters). Vulnerabilities in these external tools can indirectly create attack vectors through Starship.
*   **Starship Contribution:** Starship modules depend on the availability and security of external tools. By relying on these tools, Starship's attack surface expands to include vulnerabilities present in those external dependencies, if exploitable through Starship's usage.
*   **Example:** A specific version of `git` might have a known remote code execution vulnerability. If Starship's `git_branch` module uses a vulnerable `git` command in a way that can be triggered by a malicious repository, an attacker could potentially leverage this vulnerability indirectly through Starship.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability in the external tool, potentially ranging up to Arbitrary Code Execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the severity of the external tool vulnerability and exploitability via Starship).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Clearly document the required and recommended versions of external tools that Starship depends upon.
        *   Consider implementing checks to warn users if outdated or potentially vulnerable versions of external tools are detected.
        *   Explore safer alternatives to relying on external commands where feasible, or minimize the extent of reliance.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Maintain external tools (like `git`, language interpreters) up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Be aware of Starship's dependencies and ensure those dependencies are also kept secure.

## Attack Surface: [4. Insecure Update Mechanism (Hypothetical)](./attack_surfaces/4__insecure_update_mechanism__hypothetical_.md)

*   **Description:**  If Starship were to implement an auto-update mechanism, a compromised update process could lead to the distribution of malicious versions of Starship itself.
*   **Starship Contribution:**  Introducing an auto-update feature, if not implemented with robust security measures, would create a significant supply chain attack vector directly within Starship.
*   **Example:** An attacker could compromise the update server and replace a legitimate Starship update with a malicious version. Users who utilize auto-update would unknowingly install the compromised and malicious Starship version.
*   **Impact:** Supply Chain Attack, Widespread Malware Distribution, System Compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if implemented insecurely).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   If implementing auto-updates, prioritize security by using secure channels (HTTPS), code signing, and rigorous verification mechanisms to guarantee the integrity and authenticity of updates.
        *   Adhere to established best practices for secure software update processes to minimize the risk of supply chain attacks.
    *   **Users:**
        *   If Starship implements auto-updates, ensure they are enabled and functioning correctly to receive legitimate security updates.
        *   If manual updates are used, always download updates exclusively from the official Starship repository or other highly trusted and verified sources.
