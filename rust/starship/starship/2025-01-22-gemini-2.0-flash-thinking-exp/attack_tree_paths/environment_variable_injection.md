### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Environment Variable Injection

#### 4.1. Environment Variable Injection: Overview

Environment Variable Injection in the context of Starship leverages the application's reliance on environment variables for configuration. Starship, like many applications, uses environment variables to allow users to customize its behavior without directly modifying configuration files.  This attack path exploits the fact that Starship reads and processes environment variables, specifically those starting with `STARSHIP_`, to configure its prompt. By controlling these environment variables, an attacker can inject malicious configurations that lead to arbitrary code execution.

#### 4.2. Attack Steps: Detailed Analysis

##### 4.2.1. Step 1: Control Environment Variables Read by Starship

*   **Description:** The initial and crucial step for the attacker is to gain control over the environment variables that Starship reads. Starship is designed to look for environment variables prefixed with `STARSHIP_` to customize its behavior.  The attacker needs to find a way to set or modify these variables in the environment where Starship is executed.

*   **Sub-step 1.1: Exploiting an application vulnerability that allows setting or modifying environment variables.**

    *   **Mechanism:** Many applications, especially those running in server environments or as part of larger systems, might have vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to influence their execution environment. This could include:
        *   **Web Application Vulnerabilities:**  If Starship is used in conjunction with a web application (e.g., to generate prompts in a web-based terminal), vulnerabilities like Command Injection, Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI), or even less direct vulnerabilities like insecure file uploads or path traversal could be chained to manipulate the environment. For example, a command injection vulnerability might allow an attacker to execute commands that set environment variables before Starship is invoked.
        *   **Containerization/Orchestration Vulnerabilities:** In containerized environments (like Docker, Kubernetes), vulnerabilities in the container runtime, orchestration platform, or application configuration could allow an attacker to modify the environment variables passed to a container running Starship.
        *   **Privilege Escalation:** If an attacker has gained initial access to a system with limited privileges, they might exploit privilege escalation vulnerabilities to gain higher privileges and then modify system-wide or user-specific environment variables.
        *   **Vulnerable Dependencies:** Applications might use libraries or dependencies with vulnerabilities that could be exploited to manipulate the application's environment.

    *   **Example Scenario:** Imagine a web application that uses Starship to display a customized prompt in a terminal emulator embedded in the browser. If this web application has a command injection vulnerability, an attacker could inject a command like `export STARSHIP_CUSTOM_MODULES='...'` before Starship is executed by the application.

*   **Sub-step 1.2: Compromising the application's environment setup process to inject malicious environment variables.**

    *   **Mechanism:**  Attackers might target the processes or scripts that set up the environment before Starship is executed. This could involve:
        *   **Compromising Configuration Files:**  If the environment variables are set in configuration files (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, system-wide environment files, application-specific configuration files), an attacker who gains write access to these files (through vulnerabilities or compromised credentials) can inject malicious `export STARSHIP_*` commands.
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** In scenarios where environment variables are fetched from a remote source during setup (less common for direct environment variables, but relevant for configuration management systems), a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack could allow an attacker to intercept and modify the environment variables before they are set.
        *   **Exploiting Build/Deployment Pipelines:** If Starship is part of an automated build or deployment pipeline, vulnerabilities in the pipeline itself could allow an attacker to inject malicious environment variables during the build or deployment process.
        *   **Social Engineering:** In some cases, an attacker might use social engineering to trick a user or administrator into manually setting malicious environment variables.

    *   **Example Scenario:** An attacker compromises a user's account and gains access to their `.bashrc` file. They can then append lines like `export STARSHIP_CUSTOM_MODULES='...'` to this file. The next time the user opens a new terminal, Starship will load this malicious configuration.

##### 4.2.2. Step 2: Inject Malicious Configuration via Environment Variables (STARSHIP_*)

*   **Description:** Once the attacker has control over the environment variables, the next step is to inject malicious configurations using `STARSHIP_*` variables. Starship's configuration system is designed to be flexible and customizable, and it reads environment variables to allow for dynamic configuration. This flexibility, however, becomes a vulnerability when an attacker can control these variables.

*   **Mechanism:** Starship allows users to configure various aspects of the prompt through environment variables.  Crucially, it allows defining custom modules using `STARSHIP_CUSTOM_MODULES`.  This variable can be used to define new modules with arbitrary commands and formatting.

*   **Example:** The provided example `export STARSHIP_CUSTOM_MODULES='[{ "command" = "malicious_command", "format" = "$custom" }]'` demonstrates this perfectly.
    *   `STARSHIP_CUSTOM_MODULES`: This environment variable tells Starship to load custom modules.
    *   `'[{ "command" = "malicious_command", "format" = "$custom" }]'`: This is a JSON-like string defining a custom module.
        *   `"command" = "malicious_command"`: This specifies the command that Starship will execute when rendering this module.  **This is the point of injection.** The attacker can replace `"malicious_command"` with any arbitrary command they want to execute on the user's system.
        *   `"format" = "$custom"`: This defines how the output of the command should be formatted in the prompt. While less critical for the attack itself, it can be used to control the visibility of the malicious output.

*   **Exploitable Configuration Options:**  While `STARSHIP_CUSTOM_MODULES` is a prime example, other `STARSHIP_*` variables that influence command execution or file paths could potentially be exploited, although `STARSHIP_CUSTOM_MODULES` offers the most direct and flexible way to inject arbitrary commands.

##### 4.2.3. Step 3: Use Environment Variables to Override or Inject Malicious `command` or `format`

*   **Description:** Starship prioritizes environment variables over configuration files. This design choice, intended for user convenience and dynamic configuration, becomes a critical factor in this attack path.  If a user has an existing Starship configuration (e.g., in `starship.toml`), environment variables will override those settings. This allows an attacker to not only inject *new* malicious modules but also to *modify* or *disable* existing, potentially secure, configurations.

*   **Mechanism:** Starship's configuration loading process is designed to prioritize environment variables. When Starship starts, it reads configuration from various sources, including configuration files and environment variables.  Environment variables are processed *after* configuration files, meaning that if a setting is defined in both a configuration file and an environment variable, the environment variable's value will take precedence.

*   **Impact of Priority:** This priority is crucial for the attack because:
    *   **Override Existing Configurations:** An attacker can override legitimate, user-defined configurations. For example, if a user has carefully configured their prompt modules in `starship.toml`, an attacker can completely replace or modify these modules by setting `STARSHIP_CUSTOM_MODULES` or other relevant `STARSHIP_*` variables.
    *   **Bypass Security Measures:** If a system administrator or user has attempted to secure Starship's configuration through file permissions or other means, these measures can be bypassed by environment variable injection, as environment variables are typically processed at runtime and are not subject to the same file-based security controls.
    *   **Persistent Malicious Configuration:** If the malicious environment variables are set persistently (e.g., in `.bashrc`), the malicious configuration will be loaded every time Starship is executed, ensuring persistence of the attack.

#### 4.3. Impact: Critical - Arbitrary Code Execution

*   **Description:** The impact of a successful Environment Variable Injection attack on Starship is **Critical**.  It allows for **Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE)** on the user's system with the user's privileges.

*   **Explanation:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting malicious configurations, specifically through the `command` field in custom modules, the attacker can force Starship to execute any command they choose. This command is executed in the context of the user running Starship.
    *   **User Privileges:** The malicious command is executed with the same privileges as the user running Starship. This means if a user is running Starship in their normal user account, the malicious command will also run with those user privileges. If the user is an administrator or has elevated privileges in certain contexts, the malicious command will inherit those privileges.
    *   **System Compromise:** Arbitrary code execution is a highly critical vulnerability because it allows an attacker to perform virtually any action on the compromised system. This can include:
        *   **Data Exfiltration:** Stealing sensitive data from the user's files or other applications.
        *   **Malware Installation:** Installing persistent malware, backdoors, or ransomware on the system.
        *   **System Manipulation:** Modifying system settings, deleting files, or disrupting system operations.
        *   **Lateral Movement:** Using the compromised system as a stepping stone to attack other systems on the network.
        *   **Denial of Service:** Causing the system to crash or become unresponsive.

*   **Severity:** The "Critical" severity rating is justified because ACE is one of the most severe types of vulnerabilities. It provides attackers with complete control over the compromised system, leading to potentially devastating consequences.

### 5. Conclusion

The "Environment Variable Injection" attack path against Starship is a serious security concern. By exploiting vulnerabilities in applications or system configurations to control environment variables, attackers can inject malicious configurations into Starship, leading to arbitrary code execution with user privileges. The prioritization of environment variables in Starship's configuration loading process exacerbates this issue by allowing attackers to override existing configurations and bypass potential security measures.  This analysis highlights the importance of securing application environments and carefully considering the security implications of configuration mechanisms that rely on external inputs like environment variables. Development teams should be aware of this attack vector and implement appropriate mitigation strategies to protect users from this type of attack.
