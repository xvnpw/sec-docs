*   **Attack Surface:** Malicious Configuration File (`starship.toml`)
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains the ability to modify the `starship.toml` configuration file.
    *   **How Starship Contributes:** Starship relies on this file to define its behavior, including the execution of custom commands within prompt modules.
    *   **Example:** An attacker modifies `starship.toml` to include a custom command in the `[command]` module that executes `rm -rf /tmp/*` when the prompt is rendered.
    *   **Impact:**  Arbitrary command execution with the privileges of the user running the shell, potentially leading to data loss, system compromise, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict write access to the `starship.toml` file to only the intended user.
        *   Use configuration management tools to ensure the integrity of the `starship.toml` file.
        *   Regularly audit the contents of the `starship.toml` file for unexpected or suspicious entries.

*   **Attack Surface:** External Command Injection via Configuration
    *   **Description:** An attacker leverages Starship's configuration to execute arbitrary commands by manipulating the paths to external tools used by Starship.
    *   **How Starship Contributes:** Starship allows specifying the paths to external tools (like `git`, language-specific binaries) within the `starship.toml` file.
    *   **Example:** An attacker modifies the `starship.toml` to point the `git` executable path to a malicious script. When Starship tries to get Git status, this malicious script is executed.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution with the privileges of the user running the shell, potentially leading to data loss, system compromise, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid directly specifying full paths to external tools in `starship.toml` if possible, relying on the system's `PATH` environment variable.
        *   If full paths are necessary, ensure they point to trusted and verified executables.
        *   Monitor for unexpected changes to the paths of external tools used by Starship.
