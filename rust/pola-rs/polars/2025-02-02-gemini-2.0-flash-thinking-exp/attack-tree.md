## Attack Tree Path: [Send extremely large files to be processed by Polars [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/send_extremely_large_files_to_be_processed_by_polars__high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: Attacker uploads or sends extremely large data files (CSV, Parquet, etc.) to the application, which are then processed by Polars.
Impact: Application becomes slow or unresponsive due to memory exhaustion or disk space filling up. Can lead to service unavailability.
Mitigation: Implement strict file size limits on uploads. Validate file sizes before processing. Implement resource quotas for Polars processes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Repeatedly trigger operations on large datasets [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/repeatedly_trigger_operations_on_large_datasets__high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: Attacker repeatedly sends requests that cause Polars to process large datasets, even if individual datasets are not excessively large.
Impact: Cumulative resource exhaustion over time, leading to application slowdown or crash.
Mitigation: Rate limiting on API endpoints that trigger Polars processing. Implement queueing mechanisms to manage processing load.

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft computationally expensive Polars queries [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/craft_computationally_expensive_polars_queries__high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: Attacker crafts and sends complex Polars queries (e.g., involving many joins, aggregations, or custom functions) that are resource-intensive to execute.
Impact: CPU exhaustion, slow response times, potential service degradation for other users.
Mitigation: Query complexity analysis and limits. Implement timeouts for long-running queries. Optimize Polars query logic where possible.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger these queries repeatedly [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_these_queries_repeatedly__high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: Attacker repeatedly sends computationally expensive Polars queries to amplify the resource exhaustion impact.
Impact: Severe CPU overload, application unresponsiveness, potential service outage.
Mitigation: Rate limiting on query execution. Implement request throttling. Use caching mechanisms for frequently executed queries.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application exposes detailed Polars error messages to users [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/application_exposes_detailed_polars_error_messages_to_users__high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: Application's error handling mechanism directly exposes detailed Polars error messages to users, potentially revealing sensitive information.
Impact: Information disclosure of internal file paths, data structures, or potentially even snippets of data processed by Polars.
Mitigation: Implement generic error messages for users in production. Log detailed errors securely for debugging purposes only. Sanitize error messages before displaying them to users.
