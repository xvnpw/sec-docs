# Threat Model Analysis for pola-rs/polars

## Threat: [Expression Injection](./threats/expression_injection.md)

- **Description:** Attacker provides malicious input directly incorporated into Polars expressions (e.g., filter conditions). By crafting expressions, they can bypass security checks, access unauthorized data, or cause errors.
- **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access, data manipulation, denial of service.
- **Polars Component Affected:** Polars expression engine, functions like `filter`, `select`, `groupby`, `agg`.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Avoid direct user input in Polars expressions.
    - Use parameterized queries or safe expression building methods.
    - Sanitize and validate user input before expression incorporation.
    - Enforce strict input validation and whitelisting for expression components.

## Threat: [File Format Deserialization Vulnerabilities (e.g., Parquet, Arrow IPC)](./threats/file_format_deserialization_vulnerabilities__e_g___parquet__arrow_ipc_.md)

- **Description:** Attacker provides malicious files in formats like Parquet or Arrow IPC. Exploiting vulnerabilities in Polars' deserialization libraries can lead to remote code execution or denial of service.
- **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, data corruption.
- **Polars Component Affected:** `polars.read_parquet`, `polars.read_ipc`, underlying deserialization libraries (e.g., `arrow2`).
- **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Keep Polars and deserialization libraries updated.
    - Sanitize and validate file inputs before processing.
    - Implement file type validation and restrict allowed formats.
    - Consider sandboxing Polars processing.

## Threat: [Memory Exhaustion via Large Datasets](./threats/memory_exhaustion_via_large_datasets.md)

- **Description:** Attacker causes the application to process excessively large datasets, leading to memory exhaustion and denial of service.
- **Impact:** Denial of service, application instability.
- **Polars Component Affected:** Polars core data processing engine, memory management.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Implement resource limits and quotas for data processing.
    - Use Polars' chunking and streaming capabilities.
    - Monitor memory usage and implement alerts.
    - Design applications to handle large datasets gracefully.
    - Implement input size limits and validation.

## Threat: [`apply` and `map_elements` Code Injection](./threats/_apply__and__map_elements__code_injection.md)

- **Description:** Attacker injects malicious code into custom functions used with `apply` or `map_elements` if these functions are dynamically generated or accept unsanitized user input.
- **Impact:** Code execution, data manipulation, privilege escalation.
- **Polars Component Affected:** `apply` and `map_elements` functions, custom function execution.
- **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Avoid dynamic generation of custom functions based on user input.
    - Strictly sanitize and validate user input if dynamic functions are necessary.
    - Thoroughly review and test custom functions.
    - Limit usage of `apply` and `map_elements` to trusted code paths.

## Threat: [Logic Errors in Custom Functions (`apply`, `map_elements`)](./threats/logic_errors_in_custom_functions___apply____map_elements__.md)

- **Description:** Bugs in custom functions used with `apply` or `map_elements` can lead to data corruption or unexpected behavior, potentially causing security breaches.
- **Impact:** Data corruption, unexpected application behavior, potential security breaches.
- **Polars Component Affected:** `apply` and `map_elements` functions, custom function logic.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Thoroughly test and review custom functions.
    - Implement unit and integration tests for custom functions.
    - Follow secure coding practices in custom functions.
    - Consider code reviews for custom functions.

## Threat: [Unforeseen Bugs in Polars Core Logic](./threats/unforeseen_bugs_in_polars_core_logic.md)

- **Description:** Undiscovered bugs in Polars core logic could be exploited to cause data corruption, unexpected behavior, or security breaches.
- **Impact:** Data corruption, unexpected application behavior, potential security breaches.
- **Polars Component Affected:** Polars core data processing engine, various modules and functions.
- **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (potential depending on bug nature)
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Stay updated with Polars releases and security advisories.
    - Report suspected bugs to the Polars team.
    - Implement robust error handling and input validation in the application.
    - Consider fuzzing or other testing techniques.
