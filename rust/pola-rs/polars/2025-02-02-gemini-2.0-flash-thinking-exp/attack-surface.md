# Attack Surface Analysis for pola-rs/polars

## Attack Surface: [Malicious CSV Input Parsing](./attack_surfaces/malicious_csv_input_parsing.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in Polars' CSV parsing logic by providing crafted CSV data.
*   **How Polars Contributes:** Polars provides functionalities to parse CSV files, making the application vulnerable if it processes user-supplied CSV data without proper validation.
*   **Example:** A user uploads a CSV file containing specially crafted rows that trigger a buffer overflow in Polars' CSV parser, potentially leading to remote code execution.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), potential data corruption, Remote Code Execution (RCE).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation:** Rigorously validate CSV structure and content before parsing. Enforce schema, data types, and acceptable ranges.
    *   **Resource Limits:** Implement strict limits on file size and parsing time to prevent resource exhaustion.
    *   **Polars Version Updates:**  Maintain Polars library at the latest version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
    *   **Sandboxing (Advanced):** Isolate CSV parsing processes in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of potential exploits.

## Attack Surface: [Expression/Query Injection](./attack_surfaces/expressionquery_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Injecting malicious expressions or queries into Polars operations when the application dynamically constructs Polars code based on user input.
*   **How Polars Contributes:** If the application exposes Polars' expression language or query capabilities directly or indirectly to users, it becomes vulnerable to injection attacks.
*   **Example:** A web application constructs a Polars filter expression based on user-provided input. A malicious user injects an expression designed to bypass access controls and exfiltrate sensitive data beyond their authorized scope.
*   **Impact:** Data Breach (exfiltration of sensitive data), Data Manipulation, Denial of Service (resource intensive queries), Bypass of Access Controls.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Dynamic Expression Construction:**  Prefer parameterized queries or pre-defined, safe operations instead of dynamically building Polars expressions from user input.
    *   **Input Sanitization and Validation (if unavoidable):** If dynamic expression construction is absolutely necessary, implement extremely strict input sanitization and validation. Use whitelisting of allowed characters and patterns.
    *   **Restrict Expression Capabilities:** Limit the Polars functions and operations available in user-provided expressions to a safe subset.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure Polars operations are executed with the minimum necessary data access permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion via Complex Operations](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_via_complex_operations.md)

*   **Description:** Causing Denial of Service by triggering computationally expensive Polars operations through legitimate application functionalities.
*   **How Polars Contributes:** Polars, while efficient, can still consume significant resources for complex operations, especially on large datasets. Uncontrolled operations can lead to DoS.
*   **Example:** A user initiates a request that triggers a very large join operation in Polars on massive datasets without appropriate filtering, causing the server to exhaust memory and become unresponsive.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), application unavailability.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Resource Limits:** Implement and enforce resource limits (CPU time, memory usage) for all Polars operations.
    *   **Query Complexity Limits:**  Define and enforce limits on the complexity of user-initiated queries (e.g., maximum dataset sizes, join complexity, aggregation depth).
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Limit the frequency of resource-intensive operations from individual users or IP addresses.
    *   **Background Processing:** Offload potentially long-running or resource-intensive Polars operations to background queues or dedicated processing services to prevent blocking the main application.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in Polars' dependencies.
*   **How Polars Contributes:** Polars relies on external Rust crates. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can indirectly compromise applications using Polars.
*   **Example:** A critical vulnerability is discovered in a compression library used by Polars. If the application uses a Polars version with this vulnerable dependency, it becomes susceptible to exploits targeting this dependency.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability. Can range from Denial of Service to Remote Code Execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific dependency vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Scanning:** Regularly scan Polars and its dependencies for known vulnerabilities using security scanning tools and vulnerability databases.
    *   **Polars Version Updates:**  Keep Polars and its dependencies updated to the latest versions to incorporate security patches.
    *   **Dependency Management:** Employ robust dependency management practices, including pinning dependency versions and regularly auditing and updating dependencies.
