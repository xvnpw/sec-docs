# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, Polars, is an extremely fast DataFrame library written in Rust, aiming to provide high-performance data manipulation and analysis capabilities.

- Business Priorities:
 - Performance: Polars is designed for speed and efficiency in data processing, which is a critical priority for users dealing with large datasets.
 - Scalability: The library should be able to handle increasing data volumes and complexity as user needs grow.
 - Ease of Use: Despite its performance focus, Polars aims to provide a user-friendly API that is accessible to data scientists and analysts.
 - Open Source Community:  Leveraging and growing an active open-source community is important for long-term sustainability, feature development, and user support.

- Business Goals:
 - Become the leading DataFrame library for high-performance data analysis in various programming environments (initially Python and Rust).
 - Enable users to process and analyze large datasets faster and more efficiently, reducing processing time and infrastructure costs.
 - Provide a robust and reliable tool for data manipulation, cleaning, and transformation.
 - Foster a collaborative open-source ecosystem around Polars, driving innovation and adoption.

- Business Risks:
 - Performance regressions: Introducing changes that negatively impact the performance, which is a core value proposition.
 - Data integrity issues: Bugs or vulnerabilities that could lead to data corruption or incorrect analysis results.
 - Security vulnerabilities: Although primarily a library, vulnerabilities in Polars could be exploited in applications that use it, potentially leading to data breaches or denial of service.
 - Community fragmentation: Lack of community engagement or disagreements within the community could hinder development and adoption.
 - Dependency issues: Reliance on external libraries that may have vulnerabilities or become unmaintained.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security Controls:
 - security control: Code review process on GitHub via Pull Requests. Implemented in: GitHub repository contribution guidelines and workflow.
 - security control: Unit and integration testing. Implemented in: GitHub Actions workflows and project testing framework.
 - security control: Fuzz testing. Implemented in: GitHub Actions workflows and project fuzzing framework.
 - security control: Memory safety provided by Rust language. Implemented in: Core language design and compiler.

- Accepted Risks:
 - accepted risk: Limited dedicated security team or security expert involvement in the project.
 - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities.
 - accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in dependencies that are not actively monitored or patched by the Polars project directly.
 - accepted risk: Lack of formal security audits or penetration testing.

- Recommended Security Controls:
 - security control: Implement static application security testing (SAST) tools in the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect potential code vulnerabilities.
 - security control: Integrate dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
 - security control: Establish a process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities, including a security policy and contact information.
 - security control: Consider performing periodic security audits or penetration testing, especially before major releases.
 - security control: Enhance input validation and sanitization practices throughout the codebase to prevent injection attacks and data corruption.

- Security Requirements:
 - Authentication: Not directly applicable to a library. Polars itself does not handle user authentication. Applications using Polars will be responsible for their own authentication mechanisms.
 - Authorization: Not directly applicable to a library. Polars does not enforce authorization. Applications using Polars are responsible for controlling access to data and operations.
 - Input Validation: Critical. Polars must robustly validate all external inputs, including data loaded from files, databases, and user-provided expressions, to prevent data corruption, crashes, or potential injection vulnerabilities. This should be implemented at the API boundaries where data enters the Polars library.
 - Cryptography: Potentially relevant for features that might involve handling or processing encrypted data. If cryptographic operations are implemented, they must use well-vetted and secure cryptographic libraries and follow best practices to avoid vulnerabilities. For general data processing, cryptography might be less directly relevant to the core library itself, but could be important in applications using Polars to handle sensitive data.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
 - Data analysis and reporting: Polars is used to perform data analysis that informs business decisions and generates reports. Incorrect or compromised data processing could lead to flawed insights and poor decision-making.
 - Data transformation and preparation: Polars is used to prepare data for various downstream applications and processes. Data integrity issues during transformation could propagate to other systems.
 - Performance-critical data pipelines: In performance-sensitive environments, Polars' speed is crucial. Availability and performance degradation due to vulnerabilities could disrupt critical data pipelines.

- Data Sensitivity:
 - The sensitivity of data processed by Polars depends entirely on the user's application. Polars itself is data-agnostic.
 - Data processed could range from publicly available datasets to highly sensitive personal or financial information.
 - The potential impact of a security breach or data integrity issue is directly related to the sensitivity of the data being processed by applications using Polars.
 - Polars itself should be designed to handle data securely, regardless of its sensitivity, as it cannot know the context of its usage. Focus should be on preventing data corruption, unauthorized access to Polars internals (less relevant for a library), and vulnerabilities that could be exploited in applications using Polars to process sensitive data.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
 - What are the specific types of data and industries that Polars users primarily work with? Understanding the typical use cases would help prioritize security requirements.
 - Are there any specific regulatory compliance requirements that Polars or its users need to adhere to (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS)?
 - What is the process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities in Polars currently? Is there a security contact or security policy?
 - Are there any plans for formal security audits or penetration testing in the future?
 - What is the tolerance for performance impact when implementing additional security controls?

- Assumptions:
 - Polars is primarily used as a library embedded within larger applications, rather than as a standalone service.
 - Security is a growing concern for the Polars project, but resources dedicated to security are currently limited.
 - The open-source community plays a significant role in identifying and addressing issues, including security vulnerabilities.
 - Users of Polars are responsible for securing their own applications and data pipelines that utilize the library. Polars aims to provide a secure foundation but cannot control the security practices of its users.
 - Performance remains a top priority for Polars, and security measures should be implemented without significantly degrading performance.
