## Attack Tree Path: [AND 1. Exploit Polars Weakness](./attack_tree_paths/and_1__exploit_polars_weakness.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [OR 1.1. Data Injection/Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/or_1_1__data_injectionmanipulation.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1. Inject Malicious Data via Supported Formats](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1__inject_malicious_data_via_supported_formats.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.1. CSV Injection [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_1__csv_injection__critical_node_.md)

*   Insight: Maliciously crafted CSV data (e.g., with formulas if processed by other tools) can be read by Polars and potentially cause harm if later used in other parts of the application or exported.

## Attack Tree Path: [OR 1.2. Resource Exhaustion [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/or_1_2__resource_exhaustion__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **1.2. Resource Exhaustion [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1. Memory Exhaustion [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1__memory_exhaustion__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **1.2.1. Memory Exhaustion [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1.1. Load Excessively Large Datasets [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_1__load_excessively_large_datasets__critical_node_.md)

*   Insight: An attacker could provide input data designed to create extremely large DataFrames, exceeding available memory and causing a denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2. CPU Exhaustion [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2__cpu_exhaustion__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **1.2.2. CPU Exhaustion [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2.1. Trigger Complex Computations [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2_1__trigger_complex_computations__critical_node_.md)

*   Insight: Crafted input could force Polars to perform computationally expensive operations, leading to CPU exhaustion and denial of service. This could involve complex string manipulations, aggregations on very large groups, or inefficient filtering.

## Attack Tree Path: [OR 1.3. Vulnerabilities in Polars Dependencies [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/or_1_3__vulnerabilities_in_polars_dependencies__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **1.3. Vulnerabilities in Polars Dependencies [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.1. Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Underlying Libraries (e.g., Arrow, DataFusion) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_1__exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_underlying_libraries__e_g___arrow__datafusion___critical_nod_ae46240a.md)

*   Insight: Polars relies on other libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be indirectly exploitable through Polars.

## Attack Tree Path: [OR 1.4. Logic Errors Leading to Security Issues [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/or_1_4__logic_errors_leading_to_security_issues__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **1.4. Logic Errors Leading to Security Issues [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   This high-risk path encompasses scenarios where the application's logic, when combined with Polars operations, creates security vulnerabilities. Specific attack vectors within this path were not marked as critical nodes but the overall path is high-risk and requires careful consideration of application-specific logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [OR 1.5. Exploiting File System Interactions (If Applicable) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/or_1_5__exploiting_file_system_interactions__if_applicable___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **1.5. Exploiting File System Interactions (If Applicable) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**

## Attack Tree Path: [1.5.1. Path Traversal via File Paths [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_5_1__path_traversal_via_file_paths__critical_node_.md)

*   Insight: If the application allows users to specify file paths for Polars to read or write, an attacker could potentially use path traversal techniques (e.g., "..") to access or modify files outside the intended directories.
