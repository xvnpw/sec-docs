# Threat Model Analysis for pola-rs/polars

## Threat: [Malicious Data Injection Leading to Resource Exhaustion](./threats/malicious_data_injection_leading_to_resource_exhaustion.md)

**Description:** An attacker uploads a crafted data file (e.g., CSV, JSON, Parquet) containing excessively large values, deeply nested structures, or a very large number of rows/columns. The application uses Polars to parse this data. Polars attempts to allocate memory to handle this data, leading to excessive memory consumption and potentially crashing the application or the server.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), application instability, potential server outage.

**Affected Polars Component:** `polars.read_csv`, `polars.read_json`, `polars.read_parquet`, data parsing logic within these functions.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement file size limits for uploads.
* Define and enforce data schemas before parsing.
* Use Polars' schema enforcement features during data loading.
* Implement timeouts for data loading operations.
* Monitor resource usage during data loading.

## Threat: [Path Traversal During File Operations](./threats/path_traversal_during_file_operations.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a malicious file path (e.g., containing "../") as input to a function that uses Polars to read from or write to a file. Polars, without proper validation in the application, attempts to access files outside of the intended directory, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or modification.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, unauthorized data modification, potential privilege escalation if the application runs with elevated privileges.

**Affected Polars Component:** `polars.read_csv`, `polars.read_json`, `polars.read_parquet`, `polars.DataFrame.write_csv`, `polars.DataFrame.write_json`, `polars.DataFrame.write_parquet`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Never directly use user-provided file paths with Polars.
* Implement strict validation and sanitization of file paths.
* Use whitelisting of allowed directories for file operations.
* Consider using Polars' `scan_` functions with restricted base directories.

## Threat: [Accessing Unauthorized Data Sources Through Polars](./threats/accessing_unauthorized_data_sources_through_polars.md)

**Description:** If the application uses Polars to connect to external data sources (e.g., databases, cloud storage) and the connection details are not securely managed, an attacker could potentially manipulate the application to connect to unauthorized data sources or use compromised credentials to access sensitive data.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, unauthorized access to sensitive data.

**Affected Polars Component:** Functions related to connecting to external data sources (e.g., database connectors).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Store database credentials and API keys securely (e.g., using environment variables or a secrets manager).
* Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms for accessing external data sources.
* Avoid hardcoding credentials in the application code.
* Restrict the data sources the application is allowed to connect to.
