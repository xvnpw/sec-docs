# Attack Surface Analysis for pola-rs/polars

## Attack Surface: [Malicious File Parsing](./attack_surfaces/malicious_file_parsing.md)

### 1. Malicious File Parsing

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities arising from Polars's parsing of untrusted or maliciously crafted files in formats like CSV, JSON, Parquet, and Arrow. Exploits target weaknesses in Polars's parsing logic.
*   **Polars Contribution:** Polars's file parsing functionalities are the direct source of this attack surface. Vulnerabilities within Polars's CSV, JSON, Parquet, Arrow, or other format parsers can be exploited.
*   **Example:** A crafted CSV file with excessively long fields triggers a buffer overflow vulnerability within Polars's CSV parsing engine, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), Remote Code Execution (RCE), Data Corruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate file format and basic structure *before* parsing with Polars.
    *   **Sandboxing:** Isolate Polars file parsing operations within a sandboxed environment to limit exploit impact.
    *   **Resource Limits:** Enforce strict resource limits (memory, CPU time) specifically for Polars file parsing.
    *   **Dependency Updates:** Regularly update Polars to benefit from fixes in its parsing logic and underlying dependencies.
    *   **File Size Limits:** Implement and enforce strict file size limits to prevent processing of excessively large, potentially malicious files.

## Attack Surface: [Expression Injection](./attack_surfaces/expression_injection.md)

### 2. Expression Injection

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities caused by injecting malicious code or logic into Polars expressions. This occurs when user-provided input is directly incorporated into Polars expressions without proper sanitization, allowing attackers to manipulate data processing logic.
*   **Polars Contribution:** Polars's expression language and the ability to dynamically construct expressions are the direct contributors.  Improper handling of user input within Polars expressions creates this vulnerability.
*   **Example:** An application uses user input to build a Polars `filter` expression. An attacker injects a malicious expression fragment that bypasses intended filters or performs unauthorized data access or manipulation within the Polars DataFrame.
*   **Impact:** Data Manipulation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service (DoS), Bypass of Security Controls.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Parameterization:** Utilize Polars's expression building methods and parameterization features to separate user input from the core expression logic. Avoid string concatenation for expression construction.
    *   **Input Sanitization:**  Strictly sanitize and validate user input *before* it is used in any part of a Polars expression. Use allow-lists and escape potentially harmful characters.
    *   **Expression Validation (Limited):**  Where feasible, validate the structure of user-influenced expressions against an expected pattern to detect anomalies.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Execute Polars operations with the minimum necessary privileges to reduce the potential damage from successful expression injection.

## Attack Surface: [Memory Exhaustion and DoS via Polars Operations](./attack_surfaces/memory_exhaustion_and_dos_via_polars_operations.md)

### 3. Memory Exhaustion and DoS via Polars Operations

*   **Description:** Denial of Service attacks achieved by exploiting resource-intensive Polars operations. Maliciously crafted inputs or requests can trigger Polars to consume excessive memory or CPU, leading to application unavailability.
*   **Polars Contribution:** Polars's design for high-performance data processing, while generally efficient, can be exploited if certain operations or combinations of operations become excessively resource-intensive under specific, potentially attacker-controlled, conditions.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a request that triggers a complex Polars aggregation or join operation on a large dataset, causing Polars to consume all available memory and crash the application or server.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), Application Unavailability.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Resource Limits:** Implement and enforce resource limits (memory, CPU time) specifically for Polars operations to prevent runaway resource consumption.
    *   **Input Size Limits:** Limit the size and complexity of input data processed by Polars operations, especially for user-controlled inputs.
    *   **Timeout Mechanisms:** Implement timeouts for Polars operations to prevent indefinite processing and resource holding.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Apply rate limiting to requests that trigger Polars operations to mitigate abuse and prevent rapid resource exhaustion.
    *   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Continuously monitor resource usage of applications using Polars and set up alerts for unusual resource consumption patterns that might indicate a DoS attempt.
