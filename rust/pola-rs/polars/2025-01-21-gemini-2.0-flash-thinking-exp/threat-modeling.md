# Threat Model Analysis for pola-rs/polars

## Threat: [Malicious CSV Parsing Exploitation](./threats/malicious_csv_parsing_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a maliciously crafted CSV file to the application. Polars' CSV parsing module attempts to process this file. The attacker leverages vulnerabilities in the CSV parser (e.g., buffer overflows, format string bugs) to execute arbitrary code on the server or cause a denial of service. This could be achieved by uploading the file, providing it as input to an API endpoint, or through other data ingestion mechanisms.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), data corruption, application crash.
*   **Polars Component Affected:** `polars::io::csv` module, specifically CSV parsing functions.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if RCE is possible), High (if DoS or data corruption is possible).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Polars library updated to the latest version.
    *   Sanitize and validate CSV input data before processing.
    *   Implement file size limits for uploaded CSV files.
    *   Consider using alternative, more robust data formats if CSV parsing vulnerabilities are a significant concern.
    *   Run Polars processing in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of potential RCE.

## Threat: [JSON Deserialization Attack](./threats/json_deserialization_attack.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a specially crafted JSON payload to the application, which is then parsed by Polars' JSON reader. The malicious JSON exploits vulnerabilities in Polars' JSON deserialization logic (e.g., excessive nesting, large strings, integer overflows) to cause a denial of service by exhausting memory or CPU, or potentially trigger code execution if vulnerabilities exist. This could happen through API requests, configuration files, or other JSON data sources.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), potential Remote Code Execution (RCE), application crash.
*   **Polars Component Affected:** `polars::io::json` module, specifically JSON parsing functions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (if DoS is likely), Critical (if RCE is possible).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Polars library updated to the latest version.
    *   Validate and sanitize JSON input data before processing.
    *   Implement limits on JSON payload size and nesting depth.
    *   Consider using schema validation for JSON data to enforce expected structure and data types.
    *   Run Polars processing with resource limits (memory, CPU).

## Threat: [Parquet Parsing Vulnerability](./threats/parquet_parsing_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a malicious Parquet file. Polars' Parquet reader processes this file, and a vulnerability in the Parquet parsing logic (e.g., issues with metadata parsing, data page handling) is exploited. This could lead to denial of service, data corruption, or potentially code execution. Parquet files might be received through file uploads, data pipelines, or external storage.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), data corruption, potential Remote Code Execution (RCE), application crash.
*   **Polars Component Affected:** `polars::io::parquet` module, specifically Parquet parsing functions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (if DoS or data corruption is possible), Critical (if RCE is possible).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Polars library updated to the latest version.
    *   Validate the source and integrity of Parquet files before processing.
    *   Implement file size limits for uploaded Parquet files.
    *   Consider using signed or encrypted Parquet files if data integrity and source verification are critical.
    *   Run Polars processing in a restricted environment.

## Threat: [Expression Language Injection](./threats/expression_language_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates user-controllable input that is directly incorporated into Polars expressions without proper sanitization. For example, if a user can influence a filter condition in a query, they could inject malicious expressions to bypass intended filters, access unauthorized data, or trigger resource-intensive operations. This could be achieved through URL parameters, form inputs, or configuration settings.
*   **Impact:** Data exfiltration, data modification, unauthorized data access, Denial of Service (DoS), logic bypass.
*   **Polars Component Affected:** `polars::lazy::dsl` module, expression building and execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid directly using user input in Polars expressions.
    *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for any user-provided data used in expressions.
    *   Use parameterized queries or pre-defined expression templates with safe parameterization.
    *   Employ allow-listing of allowed operations or data access patterns instead of blacklisting malicious inputs.
    *   Regularly audit code that constructs Polars expressions based on user input.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Large Joins](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_large_joins.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts input data or requests that trigger extremely large join operations in Polars. For instance, providing datasets with very large cardinality or triggering joins on unindexed columns. This can cause Polars to consume excessive CPU and memory, leading to a denial of service. This could be exploited through API calls that initiate data processing pipelines or by providing large datasets as input.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), application unresponsiveness, performance degradation.
*   **Polars Component Affected:** `polars::lazy::dsl::JoinBuilder` and related join operations within `polars::lazy`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement resource limits (memory, CPU time) for Polars operations.
    *   Monitor resource usage of Polars operations and set up alerts.
    *   Optimize join operations by using appropriate join strategies and indexing data where possible.
    *   Implement rate limiting to prevent excessive requests that trigger resource-intensive joins.
    *   Validate input data sizes and characteristics to prevent unexpectedly large joins.

## Threat: [Memory Exhaustion through Aggregations](./threats/memory_exhaustion_through_aggregations.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker triggers aggregations on extremely large datasets or with very high cardinality group keys using Polars. This can lead to excessive memory consumption by Polars, potentially causing out-of-memory errors and a denial of service. This could be achieved by providing large datasets for processing or crafting API requests that initiate aggregations on large datasets.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), application crash due to out-of-memory errors.
*   **Polars Component Affected:** `polars::lazy::dsl::GroupBy` and aggregation functions within `polars::lazy`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement memory limits for Polars operations.
    *   Monitor memory usage of Polars operations.
    *   Optimize aggregation queries and consider using streaming aggregations if Polars supports them (or similar techniques).
    *   Implement input data size limits and validation.
    *   Use resource isolation techniques (e.g., containers) to limit the impact of memory exhaustion.
