## Attack Tree Path: [[1.0] Exploit Input Data Handling Vulnerabilities (Critical Node & High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/_1_0__exploit_input_data_handling_vulnerabilities__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Applications using Polars frequently ingest data from external sources (files, APIs, user uploads). This makes input handling a primary and high-likelihood attack surface. Vulnerabilities here can lead to severe consequences due to direct interaction with Polars processing.

## Attack Tree Path: [[1.1] Malicious File Parsing (Critical Node & High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/_1_1__malicious_file_parsing__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Attackers provide crafted files in formats Polars supports (CSV, JSON, Parquet, etc.) to exploit weaknesses in Polars' parsing logic. File parsing is a complex operation and historically prone to vulnerabilities.
        - **[1.1.1.1] Achieve Arbitrary Code Execution via Format String (Critical Node - Critical Impact):**
            - **Attack Vector:** If Polars or its dependencies use format strings improperly when handling file content, attackers might inject format specifiers to execute arbitrary code on the server. While less common in Rust itself, external C/C++ libraries used for parsing could be vulnerable.
        - **[1.1.2.2] Achieve Memory Corruption leading to Code Execution (Critical Node - Critical Impact):**
            - **Attack Vector:**  Maliciously crafted files with oversized fields or unexpected structures can trigger buffer overflows or integer overflows during parsing. This can corrupt memory and potentially allow attackers to overwrite program instructions, leading to code execution.
        - **[1.1.3.1] Achieve Remote Code Execution via Deserialization (Critical Node - Critical Impact):**
            - **Attack Vector:** If Polars uses deserialization mechanisms (especially for complex data types in formats like Parquet), vulnerabilities in the deserialization process can be exploited. Attackers can craft serialized data to inject malicious objects that execute code upon deserialization.
        - **[1.1.4] Billion Laughs/Zip Bomb DoS (High-Risk Path):**
            - **Attack Vector:**  If Polars directly parses compressed file formats, attackers can provide highly compressed or recursively compressed files (like zip bombs or "billion laughs" XML) that expand to enormous sizes during parsing, causing extreme resource exhaustion and Denial of Service.
        - **[1.1.5] Path Traversal during File Loading (High-Risk Path):**
            - **Attack Vector:** If the application allows users to control file paths passed to Polars for loading data, attackers can use path traversal techniques (e.g., "../") to access and read sensitive files outside the intended directories on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [[1.2] Malicious Data Injection (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/_1_2__malicious_data_injection__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious data directly into the application's data flow, which is then processed by Polars. This can manipulate application logic or exploit vulnerabilities in data processing.
        - **[1.2.1.1] Execute Arbitrary Polars/System Commands (Critical Node - Critical Impact):**
            - **Attack Vector:** If the application uses Polars to process user-provided strings as queries or commands (e.g., via an `eval`-like feature or by dynamically constructing Polars expressions from user input), attackers might inject malicious commands to be executed by Polars or even the underlying system. This is analogous to SQL injection but in the context of Polars operations.
        - **[1.2.2] Data Poisoning via Crafted Input (High-Risk Path):**
            - **Attack Vector:** Attackers inject subtly malicious data designed to manipulate application logic without causing immediate errors. This "poisoned" data can lead to incorrect decisions, data corruption, or business logic flaws when processed by Polars and used by the application.
        - **[1.2.3] Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) (High-Risk Path):**
            - **Attack Vector:** If Polars uses regular expressions on user-controlled input (e.g., for string filtering or parsing operations), attackers can craft regular expressions that cause catastrophic backtracking and extremely long processing times, leading to Denial of Service.

## Attack Tree Path: [[2.1.3] Resource Exhaustion via Complex Operations (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/_2_1_3__resource_exhaustion_via_complex_operations__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers can intentionally trigger computationally expensive Polars operations by providing large datasets or crafting complex queries (e.g., very large joins, aggregations on massive datasets). This can overload the server's resources (CPU, memory) and cause Denial of Service.

## Attack Tree Path: [[2.2] Vulnerabilities in Custom Polars Expressions/UDFs (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/_2_2__vulnerabilities_in_custom_polars_expressionsudfs__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the application uses User Defined Functions (UDFs) within Polars expressions, these UDFs become a new attack surface. Insecurely written UDFs can introduce various vulnerabilities.
        - **[2.2.1] Insecure Code in UDFs (High-Risk Path):**
            - **Attack Vector:** Developers might write vulnerable code within UDFs, such as buffer overflows, format string bugs, or command injection if UDFs interact with the operating system.
                - **[2.2.1.1] Achieve Code Execution via Vulnerable UDF (Critical Node - Critical Impact):**
                    - **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities within UDF code to achieve arbitrary code execution on the server.
        - **[2.2.2] Injection Vulnerabilities in UDFs (High-Risk Path):**
            - **Attack Vector:** If UDFs interact with external systems (databases, APIs, file systems) based on user-provided data without proper sanitization, injection vulnerabilities can occur. For example, an attacker might inject commands into a system call made by a UDF.
                - **[2.2.2.1] Achieve External System Compromise via UDF Injection (Critical Node - High Impact):**
                    - **Attack Vector:** Exploiting injection vulnerabilities in UDFs to compromise external systems that the UDF interacts with.
        - **[2.2.3] Performance Issues in UDFs leading to DoS (High-Risk Path):**
            - **Attack Vector:** Inefficient or poorly performing UDF code can be exploited to cause Denial of Service. Attackers can trigger UDF execution with inputs that lead to extremely slow processing, overloading server resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [[3.0] Exploit Dependencies of Polars (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/_3_0__exploit_dependencies_of_polars__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Polars relies on numerous dependencies (Rust crates and potentially native libraries). Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can indirectly affect Polars-based applications.
        - **[3.1] Vulnerable Rust Crates (High-Risk Path):**
            - **Attack Vector:** Polars depends on various Rust crates. Known vulnerabilities in these crates can be exploited if not patched.
                - **[3.1.1.1] Exploit Known Vulnerability in Dependency (Critical Node - High Impact):**
                    - **Attack Vector:** Exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities in Polars' Rust dependencies to compromise the application.
            - **[3.1.2] Supply Chain Attacks via Malicious Crates (Critical Node - Critical Impact, Very Low Likelihood):**
                - **Attack Vector:**  Attackers might compromise Rust crate repositories or developer accounts to inject malicious code into seemingly legitimate crates that Polars depends on. This is a supply chain attack.
                    - **[3.1.2.1] Introduce Malicious Code via Compromised Dependency (Critical Node - Critical Impact):**
                        - **Attack Vector:** Malicious code introduced through a compromised dependency is incorporated into the application, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
        - **[3.2] Vulnerable Native Libraries (High-Risk Path):**
            - **Attack Vector:** If Polars uses Foreign Function Interface (FFI) to interact with native C/C++ libraries (for performance or specific functionalities), vulnerabilities in these native libraries become relevant.
                - **[3.2.1.1] Exploit Vulnerability in Native Library (Critical Node - High Impact):**
                    - **Attack Vector:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in native libraries used by Polars through FFI.
                - **[3.2.2] Insecure FFI Bindings (High-Risk Path):**
                    - **Attack Vector:** Even if native libraries are secure themselves, vulnerabilities can arise from insecure FFI bindings – the way Rust code interacts with native code. Incorrect memory management or data handling across the FFI boundary can lead to memory corruption or other issues.
                        - **[3.2.2.1] Exploit Insecure Interaction between Rust and Native Code (Critical Node - Critical Impact):**
                            - **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities arising from insecure FFI bindings to cause memory corruption, code execution, or other security issues.

## Attack Tree Path: [[4.1] Unsafe Operations or Features (High-Risk Path - if applicable)](./attack_tree_paths/_4_1__unsafe_operations_or_features__high-risk_path_-_if_applicable_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Rust, for performance reasons, allows "unsafe" code blocks. If Polars API exposes or relies on "unsafe" features, misuse of these in the application code can lead to vulnerabilities.
        - **[4.1.1.1] Cause Memory Safety Issues or Undefined Behavior (Critical Node - High Impact):**
            - **Attack Vector:** Incorrectly using `unsafe` blocks in application code when interacting with Polars API can bypass Rust's memory safety guarantees, leading to memory corruption, undefined behavior, and potential security vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [[4.2] Information Disclosure via Verbose Errors or Debugging Features (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/_4_2__information_disclosure_via_verbose_errors_or_debugging_features__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Verbose error messages or debugging features, especially in development or debug environments, might inadvertently leak sensitive information.
        - **Attack Vector:** Polars or the application might expose internal paths, data snippets, configuration details, or other sensitive information in error messages, logs, or debugging outputs. This information can aid attackers in reconnaissance and further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [[4.3] Denial of Service via API Abuse (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/_4_3__denial_of_service_via_api_abuse__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers can send a flood of malicious API calls to the application that, in turn, trigger resource-intensive Polars operations.
        - **Attack Vector:** By sending a high volume of requests or crafting specific API calls that cause Polars to perform expensive operations, attackers can overload the server and cause Denial of Service.

## Attack Tree Path: [[5.0] Social Engineering & Indirect Attacks (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/_5_0__social_engineering_&_indirect_attacks__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** While less directly related to Polars code, social engineering and indirect attacks can compromise the application environment and indirectly affect Polars usage or the data it processes.
        - **[5.1] Compromise Developer Environment (Critical Node - Critical Impact, Low Likelihood):**
            - **Attack Vector:** Attackers target the developer environment (developer machines, CI/CD pipelines) to inject malicious code directly into the application codebase.
                - **[5.1.1] Inject Malicious Code into Application via Developer Compromise (Critical Node - Critical Impact):**
                    - **Attack Vector:** Malicious code injected into the application by compromising the developer environment can manipulate Polars usage, introduce vulnerabilities, or directly compromise the application's functionality and data.
        - **[5.2] Supply Chain Attacks on Application Dependencies (Critical Node - Critical Impact, Very Low Likelihood):**
            - **Attack Vector:** Similar to Polars dependency supply chain attacks, but broader. Attackers compromise other application dependencies (not Polars itself) that might indirectly affect how Polars is used or the data it processes.
                - **[5.2.1] Compromise Application Dependencies to Affect Polars Usage (Critical Node - Critical Impact):**
                    - **Attack Vector:** Compromised application dependencies can be used to manipulate data before it's processed by Polars, alter application logic that uses Polars, or introduce vulnerabilities that indirectly affect Polars' security.
        - **[5.3] Phishing/Social Engineering targeting application users to manipulate data used by Polars (High-Risk Path):**
            - **Attack Vector:** Attackers use phishing or social engineering techniques to manipulate application users into providing malicious data or performing actions that compromise the application's data processed by Polars.
                - **Attack Vector:** By tricking users, attackers can inject malicious data into the application's data flow, which is then processed by Polars, leading to data poisoning, logic manipulation, or other security issues.
