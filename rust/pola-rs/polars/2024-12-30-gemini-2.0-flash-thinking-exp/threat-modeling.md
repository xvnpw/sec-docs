### High and Critical Polars Threats

This list details high and critical security threats directly involving the Polars library.

* **Threat:** Malicious File Injection via File Readers
    * **Description:** An attacker provides a crafted file (e.g., CSV, Parquet, JSON) to be read by Polars. This file is designed to exploit vulnerabilities in Polars' file parsing logic. The attacker might manipulate the file structure or content to trigger unexpected behavior *within Polars*.
    * **Impact:**  Could lead to denial of service (application crash or hang due to Polars), incorrect data loading and processing *within Polars*, potentially leading to flawed application logic or data corruption. In severe cases, it might expose internal application state or trigger unintended code execution *within the Polars process* if vulnerabilities exist in the parsing libraries.
    * **Affected Polars Component:** `polars.read_csv`, `polars.read_parquet`, `polars.read_json`, and other file reading functions within the `polars` module.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Validate and sanitize file paths provided by users *before passing them to Polars*.
        * Implement strict file size limits for uploaded files *processed by Polars*.
        * Consider using temporary directories with restricted permissions for file processing *by Polars*.
        * Regularly update Polars to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        * If possible, pre-process files with a trusted tool before loading them into Polars.

* **Threat:** Resource Exhaustion through Maliciously Crafted Data
    * **Description:** An attacker provides input data (either via files or other data sources) that is specifically crafted to cause Polars to consume excessive CPU or memory resources *during its processing*. This could involve extremely large datasets, data with specific patterns that trigger inefficient processing *within Polars*, or deeply nested structures.
    * **Impact:**  Denial of service, making the application unresponsive or crashing it *due to Polars' resource consumption*. This can impact availability and potentially lead to data loss if Polars operations are interrupted.
    * **Affected Polars Component:**  Various data processing functions within the `polars` module, including filtering, aggregations, joins, and data transformations. The impact is often amplified by the size and structure of the `DataFrame` being processed *by Polars*.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement resource limits (e.g., memory limits, processing time limits) for Polars operations.
        * Monitor resource usage during Polars operations.
        * Implement pagination or chunking for processing large datasets *with Polars*.
        * Sanitize and validate input data to prevent excessively large or complex structures *before processing with Polars*.

* **Threat:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Underlying Dependencies
    * **Description:** Polars relies on other libraries (e.g., Arrow, Rust standard library). Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could potentially be exploited *through Polars* if not properly managed.
    * **Impact:**  The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency. It could range from denial of service and data corruption *within Polars' operations* to remote code execution *within the Polars process*.
    * **Affected Polars Component:** Indirectly affects all components of Polars that rely on the vulnerable dependency.
    * **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the dependency vulnerability (can be Critical or High).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update Polars and all its dependencies to the latest versions to patch known security vulnerabilities.
        * Use dependency scanning tools to identify and manage vulnerabilities in dependencies.
        * Monitor security advisories for Polars and its dependencies.
