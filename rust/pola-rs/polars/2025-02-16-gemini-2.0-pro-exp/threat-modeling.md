# Threat Model Analysis for pola-rs/polars

## Threat: [Malicious CSV/JSON/Parquet/Arrow Injection](./threats/malicious_csvjsonparquetarrow_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious CSV/JSON/Parquet/Arrow Injection

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious CSV, JSON, Parquet, or Arrow file (or data stream) with specially designed content intended to exploit vulnerabilities in Polars' parsing or processing logic.  This might include:
        *   Extremely long strings in a single field.
        *   Deeply nested JSON objects.
        *   Malformed data types that violate the expected schema.
        *   Exploitation of known vulnerabilities in the underlying parsing libraries *used by Polars* (e.g., a buffer overflow in the CSV parser).
        *   Unexpected or extremely large numbers of columns or rows.
        *   Formula injection in CSV (if applicable and not properly sanitized).

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The application crashes or becomes unresponsive due to excessive memory consumption, CPU usage, or infinite loops triggered within Polars' parsing routines.
        *   **Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE):** (Less likely, but possible if a severe vulnerability exists in Polars or its underlying parsing libraries *as used by Polars*). The attacker gains control of the application server.
        *   **Data Corruption:** The in-memory DataFrame is corrupted, leading to incorrect results or application misbehavior.

    *   **Affected Polars Component:**
        *   `polars.read_csv()`
        *   `polars.read_json()`
        *   `polars.read_parquet()`
        *   `polars.read_ipc()` / `polars.read_ipc_stream()` (Arrow)
        *   Underlying parsing libraries *as integrated within Polars*.

    *   **Risk Severity:** High (DoS is likely, ACE is less likely but possible).

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** Before calling any `read_*` function, *rigorously* validate the input data:
            *   Check file size limits.
            *   Validate the structure (e.g., number of columns, nesting depth for JSON).
            *   Validate data types against a predefined schema.
            *   Use regular expressions to validate string content.
        *   **Data Sanitization:** Sanitize input data to remove or escape potentially harmful characters.  This is *crucial* for CSV and JSON, and should be done *before* Polars processes the data.
        *   **Schema Enforcement:**  Explicitly define the schema using `polars.Schema` and pass it to the `read_*` function.  This prevents Polars from inferring potentially incorrect or malicious types.  *Always* provide a schema.
        *   **Resource Limits:** Set resource limits (e.g., memory limits) on the process running Polars to prevent it from consuming all available resources.
        *   **Fuzz Testing:**  Use fuzzing tools specifically targeting Polars' `read_*` functions with a wide variety of malformed inputs. This is crucial for identifying vulnerabilities.
        * **Limit number of rows/columns:** Use parameters like `n_rows` in `read_csv` to limit the amount of data read.  Set reasonable limits based on the application's needs.

## Threat: [Untrusted Pickle Deserialization (Indirect through Polars DataFrames)](./threats/untrusted_pickle_deserialization__indirect_through_polars_dataframes_.md)

*   **Threat:** Untrusted Pickle Deserialization (Indirect through Polars DataFrames)

    *   **Description:** An attacker provides a malicious pickled file or byte stream. While Polars doesn't directly offer pickle loading, if *any part of the application* uses `pickle.loads()` (or similar) to deserialize a Polars DataFrame (or an object containing a DataFrame) from an untrusted source, this creates a vulnerability.

    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE). The attacker gains full control of the application server.

    *   **Affected Polars Component:**  *Indirectly* affects any code that uses `pickle.loads()` (or similar) on data that *might* contain a Polars DataFrame, even if nested within other objects.  This is a Python `pickle` vulnerability, but the presence of Polars DataFrames in the data makes it relevant.

    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never Use Pickle with Untrusted Data:**  Absolutely avoid using `pickle` to deserialize *any* data, including Polars DataFrames or objects that might contain them, from untrusted sources. This is the *only* reliable mitigation.
        *   **Use Safe Alternatives:**  Use `polars.read_ipc()`, `polars.read_parquet()`, `polars.read_json()`, or `polars.read_csv()` with appropriate input validation and sanitization (as described above) for data exchange.
        *   **Cryptographic Verification (Last Resort):** If `pickle` is *absolutely unavoidable* (which should be extremely rare), implement strong cryptographic verification (e.g., digital signatures) *before* deserialization. This is complex and error-prone, and should only be considered if there are no other options.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Large Data](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_large_data.md)

* **Threat:** Resource Exhaustion via Large Data

    * **Description:** An attacker provides an extremely large dataset (e.g., a massive CSV file) that exceeds the available RAM on the server. Polars attempts to load the entire dataset into memory, leading to a crash. This directly exploits Polars's data loading mechanisms.
    * **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS). The application becomes unavailable.
    * **Affected Polars Component:**
        * All `read_*` functions (`polars.read_csv()`, `polars.read_json()`, etc.).
        * Any operation that requires loading the entire DataFrame into memory.
    * **Risk Severity:** High.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Strict File Size Limits:** Enforce strict limits on the size of uploaded files or data streams *before* they reach Polars.
        * **Chunking/Streaming:** Use Polars' features for processing data in chunks (e.g., `scan_csv()`, `scan_parquet()`, `read_csv(n_rows=...)`). This is the primary defense.
        * **Lazy Evaluation:** Leverage Polars' lazy evaluation capabilities (`polars.LazyFrame`). Operations are only executed when the results are needed, minimizing memory usage. This is a core feature of Polars and should be used whenever possible.
        * **Memory Monitoring:** Monitor memory usage during development and testing to identify potential memory leaks or excessive memory consumption.
        * **Out-of-Core Processing (If Supported):** Explore using techniques like memory mapping or external memory algorithms if Polars supports them for datasets that don't fit in RAM.
        * **Data Sampling:** If the attacker's goal is to cause a DoS, and you are processing a large dataset, consider sampling the data before processing, *provided this is acceptable for the application's functionality*.
