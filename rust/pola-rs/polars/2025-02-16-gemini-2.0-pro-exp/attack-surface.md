# Attack Surface Analysis for pola-rs/polars

## Attack Surface: [Untrusted Data Parsing](./attack_surfaces/untrusted_data_parsing.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in Polars' data parsing routines (CSV, JSON, Parquet, Arrow) when processing data from untrusted sources. This is a direct attack on Polars' parsing logic.
    *   **How Polars Contributes:** Polars' core functionality is parsing and processing data. Bugs in these parsers are a direct attack vector *within* Polars.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious Parquet file that triggers a buffer overflow in Polars' Parquet parser, leading to arbitrary code execution *within the Polars process*.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Fuzz Testing:**  This is the *primary* mitigation for Polars developers.  Extensive fuzzing of all parsers is essential.
        *   **Input Validation (Application-Level):** While this is application-level, it's crucial. Validate data *before* it reaches Polars.
        *   **Keep Polars Updated:** Users should always use the latest version of Polars to benefit from security fixes.

## Attack Surface: [`unsafe` Code Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/_unsafe__code_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Memory safety vulnerabilities within Polars' `unsafe` Rust code blocks. This is an internal Polars vulnerability.
    *   **How Polars Contributes:** Polars uses `unsafe` code for performance. Bugs in this code are internal to Polars.
    *   **Example:** A bug in an `unsafe` block used for memory manipulation allows an attacker to trigger a use-after-free condition, leading to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution *within Polars*.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Code Auditing (Polars Developers):** Rigorous code auditing and static analysis of `unsafe` blocks are essential for Polars developers.
        *   **Fuzz Testing (Polars Developers):** Fuzzing should target code paths that utilize `unsafe` blocks.
        *   **Keep Polars Updated:** Users should always use the latest version of Polars.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (Direct Impact)](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities__direct_impact_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in *direct* dependencies of Polars (especially `arrow`) that can be triggered *through* Polars' normal operation. This focuses on vulnerabilities that Polars *exposes*, not just general dependency issues.
    *   **How Polars Contributes:** Polars' tight integration with libraries like `arrow` means vulnerabilities in those libraries can directly impact Polars' security.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in the `arrow` crate's IPC handling is exploited by sending malformed Arrow data *to* Polars, triggering the vulnerability *within* Polars' interaction with `arrow`.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the specific dependency and vulnerability, but could range from denial of service to arbitrary code execution *within the context of Polars*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the dependency and vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Dependency Auditing (Polars Developers):** Polars developers must actively monitor and audit their direct dependencies.
        *   **Prompt Dependency Updates (Polars Developers):** Polars developers need to quickly update dependencies when vulnerabilities are found.
        *   **Keep Polars Updated:** Users should always use the latest version of Polars.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion (Internal Logic)](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion__internal_logic_.md)

*   **Description:** Attacks that cause Polars to consume excessive resources (memory, CPU) due to vulnerabilities *within Polars' internal logic*, even with seemingly valid input. This differs from simply providing a large file; it focuses on triggering unexpected resource consumption through edge cases or bugs in Polars' algorithms.
    *   **How Polars Contributes:** Bugs in Polars' internal algorithms (e.g., join algorithms, expression evaluation) could lead to excessive resource consumption even with moderately sized or structured input.
    *   **Example:** A crafted dataset with specific characteristics triggers a worst-case scenario in Polars' join algorithm, causing it to consume excessive memory or CPU, even if the dataset itself is not exceptionally large. Or, a deeply nested expression, while syntactically valid, triggers excessive recursion within Polars' expression evaluator.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Fuzz Testing (Polars Developers):** Fuzzing should include tests designed to stress Polars' internal algorithms and identify potential resource exhaustion vulnerabilities.
        *   **Profiling and Performance Testing (Polars Developers):** Regular profiling and performance testing can help identify areas where Polars' performance degrades unexpectedly.
        *   **Keep Polars Updated:** Users should always use the latest version of Polars.
        * **Resource Limits (Application-Level):** While this is application-level, it's crucial. Limit resources available to the Polars process.
