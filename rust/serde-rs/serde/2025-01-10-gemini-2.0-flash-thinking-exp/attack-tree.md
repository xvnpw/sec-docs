## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

This path encompasses various ways an attacker can leverage weaknesses in Serde's deserialization process to compromise the application. The core idea is to provide malformed or unexpected input that triggers vulnerabilities during the conversion of data from a serialized format back into application objects.

## Attack Tree Path: [Type Confusion During Deserialization](./attack_tree_paths/type_confusion_during_deserialization.md)

Attackers aim to provide data that tricks Serde into deserializing it into an incorrect type. This can lead to memory corruption, unexpected behavior, or even code execution if the application logic relies on the assumed type.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Maliciously Crafted JSON/TOML/etc. with Incorrect Type Information](./attack_tree_paths/supply_maliciously_crafted_jsontomletc__with_incorrect_type_information.md)

This involves crafting input data that intentionally violates the expected data types defined in the application's Rust code. The goal is to cause a mismatch during deserialization.

***CRITICAL NODE*** Craft Input That Exploits Type System Mismatches

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service_via_resource_exhaustion.md)

The attacker aims to overload the application by providing input that consumes excessive resources (CPU, memory, network). This can lead to the application becoming unresponsive or crashing.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Deeply Nested Data Structures](./attack_tree_paths/supply_deeply_nested_data_structures.md)

Crafting input with excessive levels of nesting can cause stack overflow errors during deserialization as the parser recursively processes the structure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Extremely Large Data Structures](./attack_tree_paths/supply_extremely_large_data_structures.md)

Providing input with a massive amount of data can exhaust the application's memory, leading to crashes or slowdowns.

## Attack Tree Path: [Integer Overflow/Underflow During Deserialization](./attack_tree_paths/integer_overflowunderflow_during_deserialization.md)

Attackers try to manipulate size or length fields in the input data to cause integer overflows or underflows during deserialization. This can lead to buffer overflows or other memory safety issues.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Input Leading to Overflow in Size Calculations](./attack_tree_paths/supply_input_leading_to_overflow_in_size_calculations.md)

Crafting input where size-related fields exceed the maximum value of an integer type can lead to unexpected behavior when memory is allocated or accessed.

***CRITICAL NODE*** Craft Input Causing Integer Overflow

## Attack Tree Path: [Logic Errors in Custom Deserialization Implementations](./attack_tree_paths/logic_errors_in_custom_deserialization_implementations.md)

If the application uses custom `Deserialize` implementations, flaws in this logic can be exploited. Attackers can provide input that triggers these flaws, leading to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.

***CRITICAL NODE*** Analyze Implementation for Logical Flaws

## Attack Tree Path: [Unsafe Deserialization of Untrusted Data](./attack_tree_paths/unsafe_deserialization_of_untrusted_data.md)

This is a fundamental security flaw where the application directly deserializes data from untrusted sources without proper validation. This allows attackers to provide malicious payloads that are directly converted into application objects, potentially leading to code execution or data manipulation.

***CRITICAL NODE*** Supply Maliciously Crafted Data

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies of Serde](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies_of_serde.md)

***CRITICAL NODE*** Craft Input Leveraging the Vulnerability Through Serde

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Application Logic Flaws Exposed by Serde's Functionality](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_application_logic_flaws_exposed_by_serde's_functionality.md)

Even with a secure Serde implementation, vulnerabilities can arise from how the application uses the deserialized data. Attackers exploit the interaction between deserialized data and the application's logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse of Custom Deserialization Logic](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_of_custom_deserialization_logic.md)

Similar to the previous point, but focuses on how the *application's* logic surrounding custom deserialization can be flawed and exploitable.

***CRITICAL NODE*** Craft Input That Exploits Business Logic Flaws Revealed by Deserialization

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Injection via Deserialized Data](./attack_tree_paths/data_injection_via_deserialized_data.md)

Attackers inject malicious code or commands within the deserialized data. If this data is then used to construct database queries, system commands, or other sensitive operations without proper sanitization, it can lead to SQL injection, command injection, or other injection attacks.

***CRITICAL NODE*** Craft Input Containing Malicious Payloads (e.g., SQL Injection, Command Injection)
