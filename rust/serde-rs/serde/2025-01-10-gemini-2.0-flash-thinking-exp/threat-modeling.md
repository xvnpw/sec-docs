# Threat Model Analysis for serde-rs/serde

## Threat: [Type Confusion during Deserialization](./threats/type_confusion_during_deserialization.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input data intended to be deserialized into a Rust struct or enum. The crafted input exploits weaknesses in `serde`'s deserialization logic or lack of strict type checking within `serde` itself, causing it to deserialize the data into an unexpected type. This can lead to the application operating on data with incorrect assumptions about its structure and content, potentially causing memory safety issues if `unsafe` code is involved later in processing.
*   **Impact:** Logic errors, unexpected program behavior, potential memory corruption if the application makes unsafe assumptions based on the incorrect type, and in some scenarios, it could be a stepping stone to further exploitation.
*   **Affected Component:** `serde::de` module (deserialization logic), specifically the functions responsible for deserializing into specific types (e.g., `deserialize_i32`, `deserialize_string`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Employ strict type checking and validation *after* deserialization to ensure the data conforms to the expected structure and constraints.
    *   Utilize `serde`'s features for enforcing specific data types where possible.
    *   Be cautious when using `deserialize_any` and ensure proper handling of all possible types.
    *   Thoroughly test deserialization logic with various valid and invalid inputs, including edge cases and potentially malicious payloads.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion (Deserialization Bomb)](./threats/resource_exhaustion__deserialization_bomb_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted input payload (e.g., deeply nested JSON or YAML) that, when deserialized by `serde`, consumes excessive CPU time, memory, or stack space *within the `serde` deserialization process itself*, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The attacker aims to overwhelm the application's resources *during the deserialization phase*.
*   **Impact:** Application becomes unavailable, impacting legitimate users. Server resources are consumed, potentially affecting other services on the same infrastructure.
*   **Affected Component:** `serde::de` module, particularly the functions handling complex data structures like nested objects, arrays, and maps. The specific deserializer implementation (e.g., `serde_json::Deserializer`) is also affected.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement size limits on the input data *before* passing it to `serde` for deserialization.
    *   Set limits on the depth and nesting level of deserialized structures. Some `serde` formats offer configuration options for this.
    *   Consider using asynchronous deserialization to prevent blocking the main thread, although this doesn't prevent resource exhaustion itself.
    *   Implement timeouts for deserialization operations.

## Threat: [Arbitrary Code Execution via Custom Deserializers (Less Likely in Safe Rust)](./threats/arbitrary_code_execution_via_custom_deserializers__less_likely_in_safe_rust_.md)

*   **Description:** If developers implement custom `Deserialize` logic and utilize `unsafe` code *within that custom deserialization logic handled by `serde`*, an attacker might be able to craft input that, when deserialized, leads to the execution of arbitrary code on the server. This relies on vulnerabilities introduced *within the custom `serde` implementation*.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying system. Attackers can gain full control, steal data, or cause significant damage.
*   **Affected Component:** Custom implementations of the `Deserialize` trait. Any `unsafe` blocks within these implementations.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid using `unsafe` code in custom deserializers unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.
    *   Thoroughly audit and review all custom `Deserialize` implementations for potential vulnerabilities.
    *   Follow secure coding practices when implementing custom deserialization logic.
    *   Sanitize or validate any external data or operations performed within custom deserializers.
