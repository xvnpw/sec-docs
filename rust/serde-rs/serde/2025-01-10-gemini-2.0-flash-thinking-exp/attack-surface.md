# Attack Surface Analysis for serde-rs/serde

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Deeply Nested Structures](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_deeply_nested_structures.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides maliciously crafted serialized data with excessive nesting levels, leading to stack overflow errors or excessive memory consumption during deserialization.
    *   **How Serde Contributes:** Serde's deserialization process, by default, attempts to recursively deserialize nested structures. This can be exploited if the input data has extreme nesting, exceeding stack limits or consuming excessive memory.
    *   **Example:** A deeply nested JSON object like `{"a": {"b": {"c": ... } } }` with thousands of levels.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, service unavailability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement limits on the maximum nesting depth allowed during deserialization. This might involve custom deserialization logic or using format-specific options if available.
        *   Consider using iterative deserialization approaches where feasible, though Serde's core design is primarily recursive.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Large Data Volume](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_large_data_volume.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends an extremely large serialized data payload, overwhelming the application's memory and processing capabilities during deserialization.
    *   **How Serde Contributes:** Serde facilitates the deserialization of arbitrarily large data structures if the underlying format allows it. Serde itself doesn't inherently impose strict size limits.
    *   **Example:** A very large JSON array or a string containing millions of characters.
    *   **Impact:** Application slowdown, memory exhaustion, potential crash.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement limits on the maximum size of the serialized data accepted by the application.
        *   Consider using streaming deserialization techniques if the format and application logic allow it, to avoid loading the entire payload into memory at once.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Format-Specific Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_format-specific_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities within the underlying serialization format's parsing library (e.g., `serde_json`, `serde_yaml`) can be indirectly exploited through Serde.
    *   **How Serde Contributes:** Serde acts as an abstraction layer, but ultimately relies on format-specific crates for parsing. Vulnerabilities in these lower-level crates can affect applications using Serde with that format.
    *   **Example:** Integer overflow in a JSON parser when handling very large numbers, leading to unexpected behavior.
    *   **Impact:** Depends on the specific vulnerability in the underlying format parser, ranging from DoS to potential remote code execution (though less likely in Rust due to memory safety).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Serde and all its format-specific dependencies updated to benefit from security patches.
        *   Be aware of known vulnerabilities in the chosen serialization format and its parsing library.
        *   Consider using alternative serialization formats if a specific format has known security issues.
