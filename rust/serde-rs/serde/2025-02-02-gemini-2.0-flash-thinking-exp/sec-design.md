# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a general-purpose, efficient, and reliable serialization and deserialization framework for the Rust programming language.
  - Enable Rust developers to easily handle data serialization and deserialization across various formats and use cases.
  - Foster a strong and secure foundation for data handling within the Rust ecosystem.

- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in Serde could have widespread impact on the Rust ecosystem due to its broad adoption.
  - Performance bottlenecks in Serde could negatively affect the performance of applications that rely on it.
  - Lack of support for certain data formats or features could limit Serde's applicability and adoption.
  - Bugs or unexpected behavior could lead to data corruption or application instability.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Memory safety provided by the Rust programming language, reducing the risk of memory-related vulnerabilities. Implemented by: Rust compiler and language design.
  - security control: Open source project with public code review, allowing community scrutiny and identification of potential issues. Implemented by: GitHub repository and open development model.
  - security control: Unit and integration testing to ensure the correctness and robustness of the library. Implemented by: Test suite within the repository.
  - security control: Fuzzing to discover potential vulnerabilities through automated testing with invalid or unexpected inputs. Implemented by: Likely integrated into CI or as separate testing efforts (needs verification).

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Dependencies of Serde might introduce security vulnerabilities. Mitigation: Dependency scanning and updates.
  - accepted risk: Complex logic in serialization and deserialization can still contain subtle bugs that could be exploited. Mitigation: Thorough testing, code reviews, and security audits.
  - accepted risk: Misuse of Serde by developers in downstream projects can lead to security vulnerabilities in those projects, even if Serde itself is secure. Mitigation: Clear documentation and usage examples.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools in the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect potential code-level vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Integrate Dependency Scanning tools to automatically identify and alert on known vulnerabilities in Serde's dependencies.
  - security control: Enhance fuzzing efforts with broader coverage and continuous execution to proactively discover vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Conduct periodic security audits by external security experts to review the codebase and identify potential security weaknesses.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not applicable for a serialization/deserialization library. Serde itself does not handle authentication.
  - Authorization: Not applicable for a serialization/deserialization library. Serde itself does not handle authorization.
  - Input Validation: Critical for deserialization processes to prevent vulnerabilities such as denial of service, buffer overflows, or arbitrary code execution. Serde needs to ensure robust input validation based on the data format and schema being deserialized. Implemented by: Deserialization logic within Serde and format-specific implementations.
  - Cryptography: Serde itself does not implement cryptographic algorithms. However, it should be designed to be compatible with cryptographic libraries and not hinder the secure handling of sensitive data that might be encrypted or need to be encrypted during serialization/deserialization. Implemented by: Design considerations to avoid interference with cryptographic operations in user code.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Ensuring the integrity and reliability of data serialization and deserialization across the Rust ecosystem.
  - Maintaining the performance and efficiency of data handling in Rust applications.
  - Providing a secure and trustworthy foundation for data processing in Rust.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Integrity of the Serde library code itself to prevent malicious modifications. Sensitivity: High, as compromised library code could affect a vast number of applications.
  - Integrity of build artifacts (crates) to ensure users download and use unmodified and safe versions of Serde. Sensitivity: High, as compromised artifacts could directly lead to vulnerabilities in user applications.
  - Confidentiality of potential vulnerability information before patches are released. Sensitivity: Medium to High, depending on the severity of the vulnerability.
  - Integrity and confidentiality of data processed by applications using Serde. Sensitivity: Varies greatly depending on the application and the data it handles. Serde itself is format-agnostic and can be used with highly sensitive data.
