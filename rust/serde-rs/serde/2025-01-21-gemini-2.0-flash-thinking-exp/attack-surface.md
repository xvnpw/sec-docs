# Attack Surface Analysis for serde-rs/serde

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization of Large Input Payloads (DoS)](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_of_large_input_payloads__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends extremely large serialized data, causing Serde to consume excessive resources (memory, CPU) during deserialization, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Serde Contribution:** Serde is the component responsible for parsing and processing the input data. Without proper limits, it will attempt to deserialize arbitrarily large payloads.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a multi-gigabyte JSON payload to an API endpoint using Serde for deserialization. Serde attempts to allocate memory for this large payload, leading to memory exhaustion and application crash.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service, application unavailability.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Limit Input Size:** Implement strict input size limits *before* Serde deserialization. This can be done at the web server level, using middleware, or by checking the input stream size before passing it to Serde.
    *   **Streaming Deserialization (where applicable):** If the serialization format and application logic allow, utilize streaming deserialization capabilities offered by some Serde format parsers to process data in chunks, avoiding loading the entire payload into memory at once.

## Attack Surface: [Deeply Nested Structures (DoS)](./attack_surfaces/deeply_nested_structures__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts serialized data with excessively deep nesting levels, causing Serde's recursive deserialization process to consume excessive stack space or CPU time, leading to stack overflow or denial of service.
*   **Serde Contribution:** Serde's default deserialization for formats like JSON and YAML often involves recursion to handle nested structures. Deeply nested input can exploit this recursive nature.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a JSON payload with hundreds or thousands of nested objects or arrays. Serde's deserialization process recurses deeply, leading to a stack overflow and application crash, or extreme CPU consumption.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service, application crash.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Limit Nesting Depth:** Implement checks to limit the maximum allowed nesting depth during deserialization. This might require custom deserialization logic or leveraging format-specific parser options if available to restrict nesting.
    *   **Iterative Deserialization (if possible):** Explore if the chosen Serde format parser and format support iterative or non-recursive deserialization approaches for complex structures to avoid stack overflow issues.

## Attack Surface: [Critical Format-Specific Vulnerabilities (RCE in Format Parsers)](./attack_surfaces/critical_format-specific_vulnerabilities__rce_in_format_parsers_.md)

*   **Description:** Critical vulnerabilities, such as Remote Code Execution (RCE), exist within the underlying format parser libraries that Serde relies on (e.g., `serde_json`, `serde_yaml`). Exploiting these vulnerabilities through crafted input processed by Serde can lead to severe compromise.
*   **Serde Contribution:** Serde acts as the interface to these format parsers. If a parser has a critical vulnerability, Serde-based applications become vulnerable when processing untrusted data in that format.
*   **Example (YAML RCE):** A known vulnerability in a YAML parser allows for arbitrary code execution through specially crafted YAML input (e.g., exploiting YAML tags or aliases). If an application uses Serde with `serde_yaml` to deserialize untrusted YAML, it becomes vulnerable to RCE if the underlying `serde_yaml` version (and its YAML parser) is vulnerable.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution, complete system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use Secure and Updated Format Parsers:**  Strictly use well-maintained and actively updated format parser libraries. Regularly update Serde and *especially* its format parser dependencies to the latest versions to patch known critical vulnerabilities.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning and Monitoring:** Implement dependency vulnerability scanning tools to automatically detect known vulnerabilities in Serde and its format parser dependencies. Continuously monitor security advisories for these libraries.
    *   **Consider Format Complexity:**  If possible, avoid using overly complex serialization formats like YAML for untrusted input if simpler and safer alternatives like JSON are sufficient for the application's needs.

## Attack Surface: [Critical Vulnerabilities in Custom Deserialization Implementations (RCE, Auth Bypass)](./attack_surfaces/critical_vulnerabilities_in_custom_deserialization_implementations__rce__auth_bypass_.md)

*   **Description:**  Critical security vulnerabilities, such as Remote Code Execution or Authentication Bypass, are introduced due to flaws in custom `Deserialize` trait implementations written by developers. These flaws can be exploited through crafted input processed by Serde.
*   **Serde Contribution:** Serde provides the mechanism for custom deserialization. Incorrect or insecure custom `Deserialize` implementations directly introduce vulnerabilities into the application's attack surface via Serde.
*   **Example (Insecure Deserialization leading to Auth Bypass):** A custom `Deserialize` implementation for a user session token fails to properly validate the token's signature or expiration. An attacker crafts a malicious session token, and Serde deserializes it without proper validation due to the flawed custom implementation, leading to authentication bypass and unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution, Authentication Bypass, Authorization Bypass, Data Breach, depending on the nature of the vulnerability in custom deserialization.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Coding Practices in Custom Deserialization:**  Apply rigorous secure coding practices when writing custom `Deserialize` implementations. This includes thorough input validation, robust error handling, and careful consideration of potential security implications. Avoid complex or error-prone logic.
    *   **Security Code Reviews:** Mandate thorough security-focused code reviews for all custom `Deserialize` implementations by experienced security personnel.
    *   **Comprehensive Testing (including Security Testing):** Implement extensive unit and integration tests for custom `Deserialize` logic, specifically including security-focused test cases with malicious and boundary inputs to identify potential vulnerabilities. Consider penetration testing focused on deserialization points.

## Attack Surface: [Critical Dependency Vulnerabilities (RCE in Serde or Core Dependencies)](./attack_surfaces/critical_dependency_vulnerabilities__rce_in_serde_or_core_dependencies_.md)

*   **Description:** Critical security vulnerabilities, such as Remote Code Execution, are discovered in Serde itself or its core dependencies (beyond format parsers). Applications using vulnerable versions of Serde or its dependencies become susceptible to these critical flaws.
*   **Serde Contribution:** Applications directly depend on Serde and its ecosystem. Critical vulnerabilities within Serde or its core dependencies directly expose applications to severe risks.
*   **Example (Hypothetical Serde RCE):**  A hypothetical RCE vulnerability is discovered within the core Serde library itself. Applications using the vulnerable Serde version, when processing any data through Serde deserialization, could be exploited by an attacker who can control the input data.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution, complete system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Management and Updates (Critical):**  Employ a robust dependency management system and prioritize *immediate* updates of Serde and *all* its dependencies when security advisories announce critical vulnerabilities.
    *   **Automated Vulnerability Scanning (Continuous):** Implement continuous, automated dependency vulnerability scanning tools that actively monitor for and alert on newly discovered vulnerabilities in project dependencies, including Serde and its ecosystem.
    *   **Security Monitoring and Incident Response:** Establish security monitoring and incident response procedures to quickly react to and mitigate potential exploitation of dependency vulnerabilities, including rapid patching and deployment of updated versions.
