# Threat Model Analysis for serde-rs/serde

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Malicious Input](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_malicious_input.md)

* **Description:** An attacker sends specially crafted serialized data to the application. This data is designed to be computationally expensive to deserialize, causing the application to consume excessive CPU or memory resources. The attacker might repeatedly send such payloads to overwhelm the application and make it unresponsive to legitimate users.
    * **Impact:** Application becomes slow or unresponsive, potentially crashing and leading to service unavailability for legitimate users.
    * **Serde Component Affected:** Deserialization process (generic across all formats).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement input size limits on incoming serialized data.
        * Set timeouts for deserialization operations.
        * Choose deserialization formats and libraries known for performance and resilience against DoS attacks.
        * Consider using rate limiting to restrict deserialization requests.

## Threat: [Data Corruption or Logic Errors due to Unexpected Input](./threats/data_corruption_or_logic_errors_due_to_unexpected_input.md)

* **Description:** An attacker crafts serialized data that, when deserialized, results in unexpected or invalid data structures within the application. This data might bypass basic type checks during deserialization but violate application-specific logic or data integrity constraints. The attacker aims to manipulate application behavior by injecting unexpected data through Serde.
    * **Impact:** Application malfunctions, data corruption in the application's state, potential security vulnerabilities in application logic that relies on data integrity.
    * **Serde Component Affected:** Deserialization process, data mapping to application structures.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement robust input validation *after* deserialization to verify data against application-specific rules and constraints.
        * Design application logic to be resilient to unexpected or invalid data, using defensive programming techniques.
        * Utilize Rust's strong typing system and consider custom deserialization logic for complex data structures to enforce stricter validation.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure through Over-Serialization](./threats/information_disclosure_through_over-serialization.md)

* **Description:** When serializing data using Serde, the application might inadvertently include sensitive information that was not intended for external exposure. An attacker who gains access to the serialized data (e.g., through network interception or data breaches) could then extract this sensitive information that was serialized by Serde.
    * **Impact:** Leakage of sensitive data, potentially leading to privacy violations, identity theft, or further attacks if the disclosed information is used to compromise other systems or accounts.
    * **Serde Component Affected:** Serialization process, field selection for serialization.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Carefully design data structures to only include necessary information for serialization.
        * Use Serde attributes like `#[serde(skip_serializing)]` to explicitly exclude sensitive fields from serialization.
        * Implement data sanitization or filtering before serialization to remove or redact sensitive information.

## Threat: [Relying Solely on Serde for Input Validation](./threats/relying_solely_on_serde_for_input_validation.md)

* **Description:** Developers might mistakenly assume that successful deserialization using Serde is sufficient input validation. However, Serde only validates the *format* of the data, not its *semantic correctness* or adherence to application-specific business rules. An attacker can provide data that is format-valid for Serde but still invalid or malicious from the application's perspective, bypassing intended validation if only Serde is used.
    * **Impact:** Application logic errors, data corruption, security vulnerabilities due to processing semantically invalid or malicious data that passed format validation by Serde.
    * **Serde Component Affected:** Misunderstanding of Serde's role in input validation.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Always** perform explicit input validation *after* deserialization to ensure data meets application-specific requirements and security constraints.
        * Do not rely on Serde to enforce business rules or security policies. Treat deserialization as a data format conversion step, not a complete input validation solution.
