## Attack Tree Path: [1. [CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Application Using Serde](./attack_tree_paths/1___critical_node__compromise_application_using_serde.md)

* **Attack Vector:** This is the root goal, encompassing all potential attacks leveraging Serde weaknesses.
* **Likelihood:** Varies depending on specific attack path chosen.
* **Impact:** Critical - Full application compromise.
* **Effort:** Varies greatly depending on the specific vulnerability exploited.
* **Skill Level:** Varies greatly depending on the specific vulnerability exploited.
* **Detection Difficulty:** Varies greatly depending on the specific vulnerability exploited.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. [HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Deserialization Process](./attack_tree_paths/2___high-risk_path__exploit_deserialization_process.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Targeting the process of converting serialized data back into application objects using Serde. Deserialization is often more complex and error-prone than serialization, making it a prime target.
* **Likelihood:** High - Deserialization is a common entry point for attacks, especially when handling external data.
* **Impact:** Can range from moderate logic flaws to critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) and Denial of Service (DoS).
* **Effort:** Can be low for simple logic flaws to high for exploiting parser vulnerabilities.
* **Skill Level:** Can range from low for basic logic manipulation to high for parser exploitation.
* **Detection Difficulty:** Varies, from easy for DoS to very hard for RCE.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. [HIGH-RISK PATH] Format-Specific Vulnerabilities (Parser Exploits)](./attack_tree_paths/3___high-risk_path__format-specific_vulnerabilities__parser_exploits_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities within the parsers used by Serde format crates (like `serde_json` and `serde_yaml`). These parsers are responsible for interpreting the serialized data format, and bugs in them can lead to serious vulnerabilities.
* **Likelihood:** Low (for RCE/Memory Corruption bugs in mature parsers) to Medium (for DoS).
* **Impact:** Critical - Can lead to RCE, memory corruption, or DoS.
* **Effort:** High - Requires deep understanding of parser internals and often exploit development skills.
* **Skill Level:** High - Requires significant security expertise and reverse engineering skills.
* **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard - Parser vulnerabilities are often subtle and hard to detect without specialized tools and techniques like fuzzing. DoS attacks might be easier to detect through resource monitoring.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. [CRITICAL NODE] JSON Parser Vulnerabilities (serde_json)](./attack_tree_paths/4___critical_node__json_parser_vulnerabilities__serde_json_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Specifically targeting vulnerabilities in the `serde_json` crate, which is a very common JSON parser used with Serde. This includes bugs like integer overflows, stack overflows, or other parsing errors that can be triggered by crafted JSON input.
* **Likelihood:** Low (for new vulnerabilities in `serde_json` itself, as it's actively maintained).
* **Impact:** Critical - RCE, DoS, or other unexpected behavior depending on the specific vulnerability.
* **Effort:** High - Requires finding and exploiting specific bugs in `serde_json`.
* **Skill Level:** High - Requires expertise in parser vulnerabilities and exploit development.
* **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard (unless DoS) - Similar to general parser exploits, these are difficult to detect proactively.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. [CRITICAL NODE] YAML Parser Vulnerabilities (serde_yaml)](./attack_tree_paths/5___critical_node__yaml_parser_vulnerabilities__serde_yaml_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Similar to JSON parser vulnerabilities, but focusing on `serde_yaml` and YAML-specific parsing issues. YAML parsers are often more complex than JSON parsers, potentially leading to a wider range of vulnerabilities, including those related to YAML features like anchors and aliases.
* **Attack Vector (YAML Anchors/Aliases):** Specifically exploiting YAML anchors and aliases to cause resource exhaustion or unexpected behavior. This can involve creating deeply nested or recursive structures through anchor/alias references.
* **Likelihood:** Low (for core parser bugs) to Medium (for YAML-specific attacks like anchor/alias abuse).
* **Impact:** Critical - RCE, DoS, or logic flaws. YAML-specific attacks often lead to DoS or logic manipulation.
* **Effort:** High (for core parser bugs) to Medium (for YAML-specific attacks).
* **Skill Level:** High (for core parser bugs) to Medium (for YAML-specific attacks).
* **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard (for core parser bugs) to Medium (for DoS via YAML features).

## Attack Tree Path: [6. [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH] Deserialization of Untrusted Data without Validation](./attack_tree_paths/6___critical_node___high-risk_path__deserialization_of_untrusted_data_without_validation.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Directly deserializing data received from untrusted sources (e.g., user input, external APIs) without any prior sanitization or validation. This is a fundamental security flaw that makes the application vulnerable to a wide range of deserialization attacks.
* **Attack Vector (Direct Deserialization):** The core issue is the lack of validation *before* deserialization. This allows malicious data to be processed by the deserializer and potentially trigger vulnerabilities in the parser or application logic.
* **Likelihood:** High - If untrusted data is directly deserialized, exploitation is highly likely.
* **Impact:** Critical - Can lead to any of the vulnerabilities mentioned in the "Exploit Deserialization Process" section, including RCE, DoS, and data corruption.
* **Effort:** Very Low - Exploiting this is often trivial if the application directly deserializes untrusted input.
* **Skill Level:** Low - Basic understanding of web requests and data formats is sufficient.
* **Detection Difficulty:** Very Easy - Code review should immediately highlight this vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. [CRITICAL NODE] Application directly deserializes user-provided input without sanitization or validation](./attack_tree_paths/7___critical_node__application_directly_deserializes_user-provided_input_without_sanitization_or_val_dd66fd1f.md)

* **Attack Vector:** This is the specific point of vulnerability within the "Deserialization of Untrusted Data without Validation" path. It highlights the dangerous practice of taking user-provided data and immediately feeding it into Serde's deserialization functions.
* **Likelihood:** High - If this practice exists, it's a major vulnerability.
* **Impact:** Critical - Opens the door to all deserialization-related attacks.
* **Effort:** Very Low - Easily exploitable if present.
* **Skill Level:** Low - Requires minimal attacker skill.
* **Detection Difficulty:** Very Easy - Code review will easily identify this.

## Attack Tree Path: [8. [HIGH-RISK PATH] Denial of Service via Large/Complex Data](./attack_tree_paths/8___high-risk_path__denial_of_service_via_largecomplex_data.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Sending excessively large or deeply nested serialized data to the application to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory) during deserialization, leading to a Denial of Service.
* **Attack Vector (Large Data):** Sending extremely large JSON or YAML payloads that exceed memory limits or processing capabilities.
* **Attack Vector (Complex Data):** Sending deeply nested JSON or YAML structures that cause excessive CPU usage during parsing and deserialization due to algorithmic complexity in parsers or Serde itself.
* **Likelihood:** Medium - Relatively easy to execute, especially if input size limits are not in place.
* **Impact:** High - Application unavailability, service disruption.
* **Effort:** Low - Simple tools can be used to generate large or complex data.
* **Skill Level:** Low - Requires minimal technical skill.
* **Detection Difficulty:** Easy - Resource monitoring (CPU, memory usage) will easily detect this type of attack.

## Attack Tree Path: [9. [HIGH-RISK PATH] Information Leakage via Serialization](./attack_tree_paths/9___high-risk_path__information_leakage_via_serialization.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Accidentally serializing sensitive data that should not be exposed, leading to information leakage. This can happen if sensitive fields are not properly marked to be skipped during serialization or if default serialization behavior includes sensitive information. The leaked information can be exposed through logs, network traffic, error messages, or other outputs.
* **Attack Vector (Accidental Serialization):**  Forgetting to use `#[serde(skip_serializing)]` or implement custom serialization logic for sensitive fields.
* **Attack Vector (Logging/Exposure):** Sensitive serialized data being logged or exposed in error messages or other application outputs.
* **Likelihood:** Medium - Developers might overlook sensitive data during serialization, especially in complex data structures.
* **Impact:** Moderate to High - Data breach, exposure of confidential information, depending on the sensitivity of the leaked data.
* **Effort:** Low - Often unintentional on the developer's part, but easily exploitable if sensitive data is serialized.
* **Skill Level:** Low - Requires minimal attacker skill to observe leaked information.
* **Detection Difficulty:** Hard - Depends on where the data is leaked. If leaked in logs, log analysis might detect it. If leaked in network traffic, network monitoring might be needed. Code review is crucial for prevention.
