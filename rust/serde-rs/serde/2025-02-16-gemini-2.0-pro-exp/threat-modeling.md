# Threat Model Analysis for serde-rs/serde

## Threat: [Threat: Uncontrolled Deserialization of Arbitrary Data Leading to RCE via `deserialize_any` Misuse or Format-Specific Vulnerabilities](./threats/threat_uncontrolled_deserialization_of_arbitrary_data_leading_to_rce_via__deserialize_any__misuse_or_55df56fa.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input data that exploits either:
    *   **`deserialize_any` Misuse:** The application uses `deserialize_any` in a way that allows the attacker to influence the type being deserialized.  If the attacker can trick the application into deserializing data as a type with a vulnerable `Deserialize` implementation (including custom implementations or those in third-party crates), this can lead to RCE. This is especially dangerous with non-self-describing formats.
    *   **Format-Specific Deserializer Vulnerabilities:** The attacker exploits a known or zero-day vulnerability in the *format-specific* deserializer (e.g., a bug in `serde_json`, `serde_yaml`, or a less common format's deserializer).  `serde` provides the framework, but the actual parsing is done by these crates. A vulnerability here, combined with attacker-controlled input, can lead to RCE.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Serde Component Affected:**
    *   `serde::de::Deserialize` trait (and its implementations, especially those in third-party crates or custom implementations).
    *   `serde::de::Deserializer` trait.
    *   Format-specific deserializers (e.g., `serde_json::from_str`, `serde_yaml::from_str`, `bincode::deserialize`).
    *   Functions that use `deserialize_any` *incorrectly*.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid `deserialize_any` with Untrusted Input:** This is the *most crucial* mitigation for this specific threat.  If you *must* use `deserialize_any`, ensure the resulting type is *strictly* validated and cannot be influenced by the attacker.  Prefer strongly-typed deserialization whenever possible.
    *   **Use Safe Deserializers:** Choose well-vetted and actively maintained format-specific deserializers. Keep them updated to the latest versions to benefit from security patches.
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement rigorous input validation *before* deserialization, even with seemingly safe deserializers. This acts as a defense-in-depth measure.
    *   **Fuzz Testing:** Regularly fuzz test the deserialization logic, including the format-specific deserializers, with a wide range of malformed inputs.
    *   **Sandboxing:** Consider running the deserialization process in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of any potential RCE.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan your dependencies (including format-specific deserializers) for known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Threat: Vulnerabilities in Custom `Deserialize` Implementations Leading to RCE](./threats/threat_vulnerabilities_in_custom__deserialize__implementations_leading_to_rce.md)

*   **Description:** A developer implements the `Deserialize` trait manually and introduces a vulnerability that allows an attacker to achieve remote code execution. This could involve unsafe code, buffer overflows, use-after-free errors, or other memory safety issues within the custom implementation. The attacker provides crafted input that triggers the vulnerability during deserialization.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Serde Component Affected:**
    *   `serde::de::Deserialize` trait (specifically, the *custom* implementation).
    *   `serde::de::Deserializer` trait.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Unsafe Code:** Minimize or eliminate the use of `unsafe` code within the custom `Deserialize` implementation. If `unsafe` is absolutely necessary, ensure it is thoroughly reviewed and justified.
    *   **Extensive Testing:** Thoroughly test the custom `Deserialize` implementation, including fuzz testing and testing with a wide variety of malformed and edge-case inputs.
    *   **Code Reviews:** Have multiple experienced developers carefully review the custom implementation for security flaws, paying close attention to memory safety and potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Leverage `serde` Attributes:** Use `serde` attributes (e.g., `rename`, `default`, `skip`, `with`) whenever possible to reduce the amount of custom code and rely on `serde`'s built-in, well-tested logic.
    *   **Follow Rust Safety Practices:** Adhere to Rust's memory safety principles and best practices for error handling. Use appropriate data structures and avoid manual memory management.
    *   **Consider Alternatives:** If the custom deserialization logic is complex, explore alternative approaches, such as using a different serialization format or deriving `Deserialize` and using helper functions to transform the data after deserialization.

## Threat: [Threat: Accidental Serialization of Sensitive Data (Leading to Significant Exposure)](./threats/threat_accidental_serialization_of_sensitive_data__leading_to_significant_exposure_.md)

* **Description:**  A `struct` or `enum` containing highly sensitive data (e.g., private keys, internal database credentials) is inadvertently marked with `#[derive(Serialize)]`.  This data is then serialized and exposed, for example, by being included in an API response that is logged by an external monitoring service, or stored unencrypted in a database. The *direct* involvement of `serde` is the unintentional derivation of `Serialize`.
* **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:**  Highly sensitive data is leaked, potentially leading to severe consequences like system compromise or financial loss.
    *   **Credential Compromise:** Attackers gain access to credentials that grant them extensive control over the system or other sensitive resources.
* **Serde Component Affected:**
    *   `serde::ser::Serialize` trait (and its implementations, especially via `#[derive(Serialize)]`).
    *   `serde::ser::Serializer` trait.
* **Risk Severity:** High.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Selective Derivation:** *Only* derive `Serialize` on data structures that are *explicitly intended* to be serialized.  Avoid deriving it "just in case."
    *   **Field-Level Control:** Use `#[serde(skip)]` to *explicitly* prevent serialization of *all* sensitive fields, even if the struct itself is serializable. This is a crucial defense.
    *   **Custom `Serialize` Implementation:** Implement the `Serialize` trait manually for fine-grained control.  This allows you to redact, encrypt, or otherwise protect sensitive data *before* it is serialized.
    *   **Code Reviews:**  Thoroughly review all code changes that involve adding or modifying `Serialize` derivations, paying *very close* attention to the data being exposed.
    *   **Data Classification Policy:** Implement and enforce a strict data classification policy to identify sensitive data and ensure it is handled appropriately during serialization.
    *   **`#[serde(with = "...")]` for Encryption:** Use the `with` attribute to specify a custom serialization module that encrypts sensitive fields during serialization, providing an additional layer of protection.
