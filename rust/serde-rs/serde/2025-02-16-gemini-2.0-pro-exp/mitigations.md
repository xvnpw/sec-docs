# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for serde-rs/serde

## Mitigation Strategy: [serde Configuration - deny_unknown_fields](./mitigation_strategies/serde_configuration_-_deny_unknown_fields.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Structs:** Identify all Rust structs that are used with `serde` for deserialization (i.e., those that derive `Deserialize`).
2.  **Apply Attribute:** Add the `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]` attribute to each of these structs.  This is a single-line change per struct.
    ```rust
    #[derive(Deserialize)]
    #[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]
    struct MyData {
        // ... fields ...
    }
    ```
3.  **Test:** After applying the attribute, thoroughly test your application to ensure that it still functions correctly with valid input.  Also, test with input that *includes* unknown fields to verify that the application now correctly rejects such input.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Data Tampering/Injection - High Severity:** Prevents attackers from injecting extra fields that might be misinterpreted by your application logic, even if `serde` handles them safely. This is a *key* defense against a common attack pattern.
*   **Logic Errors - Medium Severity:** Helps prevent unexpected behavior caused by the presence of unexpected data.

**Impact:**
*   **Data Tampering:** Very effectively prevents data tampering via unknown fields.
*   **Logic Errors:** Reduces the risk of logic errors caused by unexpected fields.

**Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Applied to most structs used for API data deserialization (`src/api/models.rs`).

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Not consistently applied to structs used for internal data representation (`src/internal/models.rs`).
*   Not applied to structs used for configuration file parsing (`src/config.rs`).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid deserialize_any (When Possible)](./mitigation_strategies/avoid_deserialize_any__when_possible_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Review Usage:** Examine your code for uses of `serde`'s `deserialize_any` method (often encountered when working with `serde_json::Value`).
2.  **Refactor to Strong Types:** If possible, refactor your code to use strongly-typed deserialization.  This means defining specific structs or enums that match the expected data structure and using `deserialize` (or the derived `Deserialize` implementation) instead of `deserialize_any`.
3.  **Justify and Validate (If Unavoidable):** If `deserialize_any` is *absolutely necessary*, clearly document *why* it's needed.  Immediately after deserialization, implement *extremely rigorous* type checking and validation to ensure the resulting data is handled safely.  Consider using a `match` statement to exhaustively handle all possible types that could be produced.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Type Confusion - Medium Severity:** Reduces the risk of type confusion vulnerabilities, where the application misinterprets the type of deserialized data.
*   **Logic Errors - Medium Severity:** Helps prevent unexpected behavior caused by unanticipated data types.
*   **Data Tampering - Medium Severity:** Makes it harder for attackers to inject data that will be misinterpreted due to incorrect type assumptions.

**Impact:**
*   **Type Confusion:** Significantly reduces the risk of type confusion.
*   **Logic Errors:** Reduces the risk of logic errors related to data types.
*   **Data Tampering:** Adds a layer of defense against data tampering.

**Currently Implemented:** Mostly avoided.  Strongly-typed deserialization is preferred throughout the project.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   One instance of `deserialize_any` is used in a legacy module (`src/legacy/parser.rs`) for handling a dynamic data format. This needs to be reviewed and potentially refactored.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Custom Deserializers (with Caution)](./mitigation_strategies/custom_deserializers__with_caution_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Minimize Usage:** Avoid writing custom `Deserialize` implementations unless absolutely necessary.  Prefer using `serde`'s derive macro whenever possible.
2.  **Thorough Input Validation:** If you *must* write a custom deserializer, perform *extremely thorough* input validation within the deserializer itself.  Check for:
    *   Expected data types.
    *   Valid ranges for numerical values.
    *   Expected string lengths and patterns.
    *   Presence or absence of required fields.
    *   Any other constraints specific to the data format.
3.  **Handle Errors Gracefully:** Return appropriate `serde::de::Error` values for any invalid input.  Do not panic or crash.
4.  **Fuzz Testing:** *Mandatory:* Fuzz test your custom deserializer extensively using a tool like `cargo fuzz`.  This is crucial to uncover potential vulnerabilities.
5.  **Code Review:** Have another developer carefully review your custom deserializer code for potential security issues.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unknown Vulnerabilities - Variable Severity (Low to Critical):** Custom deserializers are a potential source of vulnerabilities if not implemented carefully.  Thorough validation and fuzzing are essential.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) - High Severity:** Prevents malicious input from causing crashes or excessive resource consumption within the deserializer.
*   **Data Tampering/Injection - High Severity:** Allows for fine-grained control over input validation, preventing various forms of data tampering.
*   **Logic Errors - Medium Severity:** Reduces the risk of logic errors caused by unexpected input.

**Impact:**
*   **Unknown Vulnerabilities:** The impact depends heavily on the quality of the implementation.  Good validation and fuzzing are critical.
*   **DoS:** Can significantly reduce the risk of DoS attacks.
*   **Data Tampering:** Provides strong protection against data tampering if implemented correctly.
*   **Logic Errors:** Reduces the risk of logic errors.

**Currently Implemented:** A few custom deserializers exist for handling specific data formats (`src/data/custom_format.rs`).

**Missing Implementation:**
*   The existing custom deserializers have not been fuzz tested. This is a *critical* gap.
*   Code review for security vulnerabilities has not been consistently performed for these deserializers.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limits - Recursion Depth (via Custom Deserializer)](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limits_-_recursion_depth__via_custom_deserializer_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Recursive Structures:** Identify data structures that can be recursively nested (e.g., trees, linked lists represented in JSON).
2.  **Determine Maximum Depth:** Determine a reasonable maximum depth for these structures based on legitimate use cases.
3.  **Implement Depth Limiting (Custom Deserializer):** Create a custom `Deserializer` implementation that tracks the current recursion depth and returns an error if the maximum depth is exceeded. This is the most precise and `serde`-integrated approach.
    *   Create a struct that wraps the inner `Deserializer` and maintains `max_depth` and `current_depth` fields.
    *   Implement the `Deserializer` trait for your wrapper struct.
    *   In the `visit_map` and `visit_seq` methods (and any other methods that handle nested structures), increment `current_depth` before delegating to the inner deserializer.
    *   Decrement `current_depth` after the inner deserializer returns.
    *   If `current_depth` exceeds `max_depth`, return a `serde::de::Error`.
4.  **Test:** Thoroughly test the depth limiting mechanism with both valid and maliciously nested inputs.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) - High Severity:** Prevents stack overflow errors caused by deeply nested input, which can lead to application crashes. This is a direct mitigation using `serde`'s extension points.

**Impact:**
*   **DoS:** Significantly reduces the risk of DoS attacks caused by stack overflows.

**Currently Implemented:** Not implemented.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   No recursion depth limiting is currently in place. This is a potential vulnerability for data structures that could be deeply nested. This needs a custom `Deserializer` implementation.
