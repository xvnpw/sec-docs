# Attack Surface Analysis for serde-rs/serde

## Attack Surface: [1. Untrusted Deserialization](./attack_surfaces/1__untrusted_deserialization.md)

*   **Description:**  Deserializing data from an untrusted source (e.g., network input, user-supplied files) without proper validation. This is the most common and dangerous attack vector.
*   **How Serde Contributes:** `serde` is the *direct target* here. It's the engine that processes the potentially malicious input and performs the deserialization. The vulnerability exists because `serde` *must* process the input to deserialize it, and without prior validation, that input can be malicious.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a crafted JSON payload that, when deserialized by `serde`, triggers unexpected behavior in a custom `Deserialize` implementation (even if the implementation itself is seemingly safe, type confusion or unexpected values can lead to issues), leading to remote code execution (RCE) or a denial-of-service (DoS). Another example is integer overflow caused by attacker providing large number.
*   **Impact:**  Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), Data Corruption, Information Disclosure.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation (Pre-Deserialization):**  *Always* validate the input *before* passing it to `serde`. Use format-specific validation (e.g., JSON Schema, XML Schema, custom validation logic for binary formats).  Validate data types, sizes, ranges, and structure. This is the *primary* defense.
    *   **Data Firewall:** Treat all external input as hostile.  Implement a "data firewall" that strictly enforces allowed data formats and structures.
    *   **Avoid `deserialize_any`:**  Minimize the use of `deserialize_any` as it bypasses type checking during deserialization.
    *   **Strict Type Definitions:** Use precise and unambiguous type definitions in your Rust code.
    *   **Robust Error Handling:**  Handle all `serde` errors meticulously.  Treat any deserialization error as a potential attack.  Don't ignore errors.

## Attack Surface: [2. Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/2__denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker crafts input designed to consume excessive resources (memory, CPU, stack) during `serde`'s deserialization process, leading to application crashes or unavailability.
*   **How Serde Contributes:** `serde`'s deserialization process is directly manipulated by the attacker's input.  The vulnerability exists because `serde` needs to allocate memory and perform operations based on the structure and content of the input.  If the input specifies excessively large structures or deep nesting, `serde` will attempt to process it, leading to resource exhaustion.
*   **Example:**
    *   **Deep Nesting:**  An attacker sends JSON with deeply nested objects, causing a stack overflow during `serde`'s recursive deserialization.
    *   **Large Collections:**  An attacker specifies a huge size for a vector or string in the serialized data, leading to a massive memory allocation by `serde`.
*   **Impact:**  Denial of Service (DoS), Application Crash.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Size Limits:**  Enforce strict limits on the *total* size of the input data *before* it reaches `serde`.
    *   **Depth Limits:**  Limit the maximum nesting depth of data structures during deserialization.  Many `serde` format implementations offer configuration options for this (this is a direct mitigation against `serde`'s recursive behavior).
    *   **Allocation Limits:**  Implement custom deserializers or wrappers that track and limit memory allocation *during* `serde`'s operation. This is a more advanced technique but provides fine-grained control over `serde`'s resource usage.
    *   **Resource Monitoring:**  Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory) during deserialization and terminate the process if limits are exceeded. This is a last line of defense.
    *   **Fuzz Testing:** Use fuzz testing (e.g., `cargo fuzz`) to specifically target `serde`'s deserialization process with malformed inputs to identify DoS vulnerabilities.
