## Attack Tree Path: [1. Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./attack_tree_paths/1__achieve_remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

*   **1.1 Exploit Deserialization of Untrusted Data [HIGH RISK]**

    *   **Description:** This is the core vulnerability.  Deserializing data from untrusted sources without proper validation opens the door to various attacks, including RCE.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   *Never* deserialize untrusted data without *strict* validation.
        *   Use a schema validation library.
        *   Enforce strict size limits.
        *   Prefer safer serialization formats (like JSON with size limits) over inherently riskier ones (like Bincode) for untrusted input.
        *   Consider sandboxing the deserialization process.

    *   **1.1.1 Find/Use Existing Deserialization Gadget Chain**
        *   **1.1.1.1 Identify vulnerable dependency with known gadget chain usable with Serde. [CRITICAL NODE]**
            *   **Description:** Attackers search for known vulnerabilities in the application's dependencies (including Serde itself and format crates) that can be used to construct a "gadget chain" – a sequence of operations that ultimately leads to RCE.
            *   **Mitigation:**
                *   Keep all dependencies updated.
                *   Use a dependency vulnerability scanner (e.g., `cargo audit`).
                *   Minimize the number of dependencies.
        *   **1.1.1.1.1 Craft malicious payload using the identified gadget chain and format.**
            *   **Description:** Once a gadget chain is found, the attacker crafts a malicious payload in the appropriate format (e.g., JSON, Bincode, YAML) that triggers the chain during deserialization.
            *   **Mitigation:**  Same as 1.1.1.1

        *   **1.1.1.2 Discover new gadget chain in application's custom Deserialize implementations.**
            *   **1.1.1.2.1 Analyze custom Deserialize implementations for code paths leading to unsafe operations. [CRITICAL NODE]**
                *   **Description:** Attackers carefully examine any custom `Deserialize` implementations in the application's code, looking for potential vulnerabilities that could be chained together to achieve RCE. This often involves looking for `unsafe` blocks, calls to `std::process::Command`, file system access, or other potentially dangerous operations.
                *   **Mitigation:**
                    *   Avoid `unsafe` code in `Deserialize` implementations if at all possible.
                    *   Thoroughly review and test all custom `Deserialize` implementations.
                    *   Use fuzzing to test these implementations.
                    *   Follow secure coding practices for Rust.
            *   **1.1.1.2.2 Craft malicious payload triggering the discovered gadget chain.**
                *   **Description:** After identifying a potential gadget chain, the attacker crafts a malicious payload to trigger it.
                *   **Mitigation:** Same as 1.1.1.2.1

    *   **1.1.2 Exploit Format-Specific Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]**

        *   **1.1.2.1 Bincode: Exploit potential integer overflows or underflows (if size limits are not enforced). [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL NODE]**
            *   **Description:** Bincode's encoding format can be vulnerable to integer overflows or underflows if the application doesn't enforce size limits during deserialization.  An attacker can craft a payload with manipulated size fields, causing Bincode to allocate an incorrect amount of memory, leading to memory corruption and potentially RCE.
            *   **Mitigation:**
                *   *Always* use `bincode::options().with_limit()` to set explicit size limits when deserializing Bincode data, especially from untrusted sources.
                *   Consider using a different serialization format for untrusted input.
        *   **1.1.2.1.1 Craft a Bincode payload with manipulated size fields.**
            *   **Description:** The attacker creates a Bincode payload with carefully crafted size values designed to trigger an integer overflow or underflow.
            *   **Mitigation:** Same as 1.1.2.1

        *   **1.1.2.3 YAML (via `serde_yaml`): Exploit known YAML vulnerabilities. [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL NODE]**
            *   **Description:** YAML is a complex format with a history of security vulnerabilities.  Attackers can exploit features like custom constructors, tags, and recursive references to achieve RCE or DoS.
            *   **Mitigation:**
                *   Avoid using YAML for untrusted input if possible.
                *   If you must use YAML, use a safe subset of the language.
                *   Disable custom constructors and tags.
                *   Use a YAML parser that is specifically designed for security (if available).
                *   Enforce strict size and recursion limits.
        *   **1.1.2.3.1 Craft a YAML payload with recursive references or custom constructors.**
            *   **Description:** The attacker creates a YAML payload that uses features like recursive references or custom constructors to trigger vulnerabilities in the YAML parser.
            *   **Mitigation:** Same as 1.1.2.3

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Achieve Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/2__achieve_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **2.1 Resource Exhaustion [HIGH RISK]**

    *   **2.1.1 "Billion Laughs" Attack (XML, YAML) [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **Description:** This attack uses nested entity references in XML or YAML to cause exponential expansion of the data during parsing, consuming all available memory and leading to a DoS.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Use a parser that limits entity expansion (most modern XML and YAML parsers have this feature).
            *   Set strict limits on the depth of nested structures.
            *   Avoid using XML or YAML for untrusted input if possible.
    *   **2.1.1.1 Craft a payload with deeply nested, recursive data structures.**
        *   **Description:** The attacker creates a payload with deeply nested, recursive structures designed to consume excessive memory.
        *   **Mitigation:** Same as 2.1.1

    *   **2.1.2 Large Allocation Attack [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker crafts a payload that tricks Serde into allocating a very large amount of memory (e.g., a huge array or string), exhausting available memory and causing a DoS.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Enforce strict size limits on all deserialized data.
            *   Validate the size of arrays, strings, and other data structures *before* deserialization.
    *   **2.1.2.1 Craft a payload that tricks Serde into allocating a very large amount of memory.**
        *   **Description:** The attacker creates a payload with large size values for arrays, strings, or other data structures.
        *   **Mitigation:** Same as 2.1.2
    *   **2.1.2.2 Bincode: Exploit integer overflows to cause large allocations.**
        *   **Description:** Similar to the RCE scenario, integer overflows in Bincode can be used to cause large, unintended memory allocations, leading to DoS.
        *   **Mitigation:** Same as 1.1.2.1 (use `bincode::options().with_limit()`).

*   **2.2 Panic-Induced DoS**

    *   **2.2.2 Exploit unwrap() or expect() calls in custom Deserialize implementations. [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **Description:** If a custom `Deserialize` implementation uses `unwrap()` or `expect()` on potentially invalid data, an attacker can craft input that causes a panic, crashing the application.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Avoid using `unwrap()` and `expect()` in `Deserialize` implementations.
            *   Use proper error handling (e.g., `Result` and the `?` operator) to gracefully handle potential errors.
            *   Validate input thoroughly before attempting to deserialize it.

*   **2.3 Deserialization loop**
    *   **2.3.1 Send cyclic data structures. [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **Description:** If the application doesn't handle cyclic data structures correctly, an attacker can send a payload containing cycles, causing an infinite loop during deserialization and leading to resource exhaustion or a stack overflow.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   If your application does not require cyclic data structures, configure Serde or the underlying format parser to reject them.
            *   Implement cycle detection if cyclic data structures are necessary.
