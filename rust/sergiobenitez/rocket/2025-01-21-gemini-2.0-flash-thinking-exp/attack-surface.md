# Attack Surface Analysis for sergiobenitez/rocket

## Attack Surface: [1. Path Traversal via Dynamic Path Segments](./attack_surfaces/1__path_traversal_via_dynamic_path_segments.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting dynamic path segments in Rocket routes to access files or directories outside the intended scope.
*   **Rocket Contribution:** Rocket's feature of dynamic path segments (`<param..>`) directly exposes path handling to developers, requiring them to implement robust validation and sanitization. If developers fail to do so, the framework's routing mechanism becomes a direct contributor to this attack surface.
*   **Example:** A Rocket route defined as `/files/<path..>` intended to serve files from a specific directory. An attacker could craft a request like `/files/../../etc/passwd` to access sensitive system files if the `path` parameter is not properly validated within the route handler.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, configuration data, or potentially code execution if attackers can access executable files.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement rigorous validation and sanitization of path parameters within route handlers.
    *   **Path Canonicalization:** Utilize path canonicalization functions to resolve paths and verify they remain within allowed directories.
    *   **Restrict File System Access:** Limit the application's file system access using techniques like chroot or containerization to minimize the impact of path traversal.

## Attack Surface: [2. Parameter Injection (Path & Query)](./attack_surfaces/2__parameter_injection__path_&_query_.md)

*   **Description:** Injecting malicious code or commands through path or query parameters that are not properly sanitized before being used in backend operations.
*   **Rocket Contribution:** Rocket's routing system readily extracts parameters from both path segments and query strings, making it easy for developers to use this data. However, Rocket itself does not provide automatic sanitization, placing the responsibility squarely on the developer to prevent injection vulnerabilities. The framework's ease of parameter access directly contributes to the attack surface if developers are not security-conscious.
*   **Example:** A Rocket route like `/search?query=<user_input>` where the `query` parameter is directly incorporated into a database query without using parameterized queries. This makes the application vulnerable to SQL injection attacks if an attacker provides malicious SQL code in the `query` parameter.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, unauthorized access to sensitive information, denial of service, or in severe cases, remote code execution depending on the type of injection vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (for SQL/Command Injection), High (for other injection types like LDAP injection)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Sanitization & Encoding:** Sanitize and encode all user inputs received from path and query parameters before using them in backend operations.
    *   **Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements:**  Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases to prevent SQL injection.
    *   **Command Parameterization (Avoid System Calls):**  Minimize or eliminate direct system calls based on user input. If necessary, use safe APIs and parameterization techniques for system commands.

## Attack Surface: [3. Deserialization Vulnerabilities via Data Guards](./attack_surfaces/3__deserialization_vulnerabilities_via_data_guards.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities during the deserialization of request bodies handled by Rocket's data guards (`Form`, `Json`, `Data`).
*   **Rocket Contribution:** Rocket's data guards simplify request body parsing and deserialization into Rust data structures. While Rocket leverages `serde`, which is generally considered safe, vulnerabilities can arise if developers introduce custom deserialization logic or if vulnerabilities are discovered in `serde` or related crates. Rocket's direct integration with deserialization processes makes it a relevant part of this attack surface.
*   **Example:**  If a Rocket application uses a custom deserialization implementation within a data guard that has a flaw, or if a vulnerability exists in a `serde` dependency used by Rocket, processing a maliciously crafted JSON payload could lead to remote code execution or denial of service.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, data corruption, or unexpected application behavior.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the nature and exploitability of the deserialization vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation (Post-Deserialization):**  Thoroughly validate the deserialized data *after* it has been processed by Rocket's data guards to ensure it conforms to expected schemas and constraints.
    *   **Secure Deserialization Practices:**  Avoid complex or custom deserialization logic if possible. Rely on standard and well-vetted `serde` features and data formats.
    *   **Dependency Management:**  Keep `serde` and all Rocket dependencies updated to the latest versions to patch any known deserialization vulnerabilities.
    *   **Limit Deserialization Scope:**  Avoid deserializing overly complex or deeply nested data structures that can increase the attack surface for deserialization exploits.

## Attack Surface: [4. Rocket Framework & Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/4__rocket_framework_&_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities that may be discovered within the Rocket framework's core code itself or in its direct dependencies.
*   **Rocket Contribution:**  Using Rocket inherently means relying on the framework's codebase and its dependency tree. Any vulnerability in Rocket's core routing, request handling, or data processing logic, or in critical dependencies like `tokio` or `serde`, directly impacts applications built with Rocket.
*   **Example:**  A hypothetical vulnerability found in Rocket's route parsing algorithm that could allow attackers to bypass route protections, or a discovered vulnerability in the `tokio` asynchronous runtime that Rocket relies upon.
*   **Impact:**  The impact is highly variable and depends on the specific vulnerability. It could range from denial of service and information disclosure to remote code execution, potentially affecting all applications using the vulnerable version of Rocket.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies, but can be Critical to High depending on the vulnerability's nature and exploitability.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates:**  Maintain Rocket and all its dependencies at the latest stable versions. Regularly update to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
    *   **Security Monitoring & Advisories:**  Actively monitor Rocket's official security advisories, community forums, and vulnerability databases for any reported security issues.
    *   **Dependency Scanning:**  Incorporate dependency scanning tools into the development and CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect and alert on known vulnerabilities in Rocket's dependencies.
    *   **Community Engagement:**  Engage with the Rocket community and report any suspected security issues to contribute to the framework's overall security posture.
