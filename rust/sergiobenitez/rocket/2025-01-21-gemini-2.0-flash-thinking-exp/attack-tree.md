```


## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Rocket Application [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_rocket_application__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the root goal of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized control or access to the Rocket application and its resources.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the application, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, reputational damage, and financial loss.
*   **Mitigation:** Implement comprehensive security measures across all layers of the application, focusing on the specific vulnerabilities outlined below.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Rocket Framework Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_rocket_framework_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers target weaknesses inherent in the Rocket framework itself, rather than application-specific logic.
*   **Impact:** Can lead to widespread vulnerabilities affecting many applications built with Rocket if a framework-level flaw is found.
*   **Mitigation:** Stay updated with Rocket security advisories, use stable versions, and contribute to community security efforts.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Request Handling Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/3__request_handling_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities arising from how the Rocket application processes incoming HTTP requests, including data parsing, validation, and handling.
*   **Impact:**  Wide range of impacts, from information disclosure to remote code execution, depending on the specific vulnerability.
*   **Mitigation:** Implement robust input validation, sanitization, and secure deserialization practices. Follow secure coding guidelines for request handlers.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Configuration and Deployment Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/4__configuration_and_deployment_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** Security weaknesses stemming from misconfigurations or insecure deployment practices of the Rocket application and its environment.
*   **Impact:** Can undermine application security even if the code is secure. May lead to data breaches, eavesdropping, or denial of service.
*   **Mitigation:** Follow secure deployment checklists, enforce strong TLS configuration, manage secrets securely, and configure resource limits.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Logic/Application-Specific Vulnerabilities Exploited via Rocket Features [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/5__logicapplication-specific_vulnerabilities_exploited_via_rocket_features__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in the application's business logic that are made exploitable or more impactful due to the way the application uses Rocket's features (routing, data guards, etc.).
*   **Impact:**  Depends on the nature of the business logic flaw, but can lead to unauthorized actions, data manipulation, or access control bypasses.
*   **Mitigation:** Thoroughly test business logic, especially in conjunction with Rocket's routing and data guard mechanisms. Apply the principle of least privilege in authorization logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Insecure Deserialization in Data Guards [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/6__insecure_deserialization_in_data_guards__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting custom data guards that deserialize untrusted data into objects.
*   **Description:** If a Rocket application uses custom data guards that deserialize data (e.g., from request bodies or headers) without proper validation, an attacker can inject malicious serialized data. When deserialized, this can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.
*   **Impact:** **Critical**. Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing the attacker to completely control the server, steal data, or disrupt services.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Avoid custom deserialization in data guards if possible.** Use Rocket's built-in data guards and request guards whenever feasible.
    *   **If custom deserialization is necessary, use safe deserialization libraries and practices.**  Validate deserialized data rigorously before using it in application logic. Consider using data formats that are less prone to deserialization vulnerabilities (e.g., JSON over formats like Pickle or YAML if not handled carefully).
    *   **Implement input validation and sanitization** even after deserialization to prevent further exploitation.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. Insecure Secrets Management [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/7__insecure_secrets_management__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exposing or leaking sensitive secrets like API keys, database credentials, or encryption keys.
*   **Description:**  If secrets are hardcoded in the application code, configuration files committed to version control, or stored insecurely, attackers can easily discover and exploit them.
*   **Impact:** **Critical**. Full compromise of the application and associated systems. Attackers can gain unauthorized access to databases, external services, and sensitive data.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Never hardcode secrets in code or configuration files.**
    *   **Use environment variables** to configure secrets outside of the codebase.
    *   **Employ dedicated secrets management tools** (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) for secure storage and access control of secrets.
    *   **Rotate secrets regularly.**
    *   **Avoid committing secrets to version control.** Use `.gitignore` or similar mechanisms to exclude secret files.

## Attack Tree Path: [8. Insecure TLS Configuration [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/8__insecure_tls_configuration__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting weak or outdated TLS configurations to eavesdrop on communication.
*   **Description:** If the Rocket application's TLS configuration is weak (e.g., using outdated TLS protocols like TLS 1.0 or 1.1, weak cipher suites), attackers can potentially perform man-in-the-middle attacks to decrypt communication between clients and the server, intercepting sensitive data.
*   **Impact:** **High**. Confidentiality breach, eavesdropping on sensitive data transmitted over HTTPS, potential data manipulation.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Enforce strong TLS protocols:** Use TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.3. Disable older, insecure protocols.
    *   **Select secure cipher suites:** Prioritize cipher suites that offer forward secrecy and strong encryption algorithms.
    *   **Regularly update TLS libraries and configurations.**
    *   **Use tools like `testssl.sh`** to audit and verify TLS configuration.

## Attack Tree Path: [9. Dependency Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/9__dependency_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in Rocket's dependencies or commonly used crates.
*   **Description:** Rocket applications rely on numerous dependencies (crates). If these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, attackers can exploit them to compromise the application.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, ranging from information disclosure to remote code execution.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Regularly update Rocket and all its dependencies.**
    *   **Use dependency scanning tools** (e.g., `cargo audit`) to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    *   **Monitor security advisories** for Rocket and its ecosystem.
    *   **Consider using dependency pinning** to manage and control dependency versions, but ensure regular updates are still performed.

## Attack Tree Path: [10. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Form Input [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/10__cross-site_scripting__xss__via_form_input__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious scripts through form inputs that are reflected in responses without proper sanitization.
*   **Description:** If a Rocket application takes user input from forms and displays it in web pages without proper output encoding or sanitization, attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code. When other users view the page, the injected script executes in their browsers, potentially stealing cookies, session tokens, or performing actions on their behalf.
*   **Impact:** **Medium**. Account takeover, data theft, website defacement, malware distribution.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Sanitize all user-provided input before displaying it in responses.**
    *   **Use proper output encoding/escaping** when rendering user-provided data in HTML.  Context-aware escaping is crucial (e.g., HTML escaping for HTML content, JavaScript escaping for JavaScript strings).
    *   **Consider using a templating engine with automatic escaping features.**
    *   **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)** to further mitigate XSS risks by controlling the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [11. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Form Input [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/11__server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_form_input__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Manipulating form inputs to induce the server to make requests to internal or external resources.
*   **Description:** If a Rocket application takes URLs or hostnames as input from forms and uses them to make server-side requests (e.g., fetching data from external APIs, accessing internal services), attackers can manipulate these inputs to force the server to make requests to unintended destinations. This can be used to access internal resources, bypass firewalls, or perform port scanning.
*   **Impact:** **Medium-High**. Access to internal network resources, data breaches, potential for further exploitation of internal systems.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Validate and sanitize URLs provided in form inputs** before making external requests.
    *   **Implement allowlists for allowed domains or protocols.** Only allow requests to explicitly permitted destinations.
    *   **Avoid directly using user-provided URLs for server-side requests if possible.**
    *   **If external requests are necessary, use a dedicated library or function** that provides SSRF protection.
    *   **Disable or restrict unnecessary network protocols** on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [12. Route Parameter Injection [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/12__route_parameter_injection__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Manipulating route parameters to bypass authorization or access unintended resources.
*   **Description:** If a Rocket application relies on route parameters for authorization or resource access decisions without proper validation, attackers can manipulate these parameters to bypass intended access controls or access resources they are not authorized to view or modify.
*   **Impact:** **Medium-High**. Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality, potential data breaches, or privilege escalation.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Carefully validate and sanitize all route parameters** used in application logic.
    *   **Avoid directly using raw route parameters in sensitive operations without validation.**
    *   **Implement robust input validation for route parameters.**
    *   **Use type-safe routing and data guards** to enforce expected data types and formats for route parameters.
    *   **Enforce authorization checks** in route handlers or data guards based on validated and sanitized route parameters.

## Attack Tree Path: [13. Race Conditions in Handlers [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/13__race_conditions_in_handlers__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting race conditions in asynchronous handlers to cause data corruption or inconsistent state.
*   **Description:** In Rocket applications using asynchronous handlers, if shared mutable state is accessed and modified concurrently without proper synchronization, race conditions can occur. Attackers can exploit these race conditions by sending carefully timed requests to cause unexpected behavior, data corruption, or authorization bypasses.
*   **Impact:** **Medium-High**. Data corruption, inconsistent application state, potential authorization bypasses, or denial of service.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Carefully review asynchronous handler logic for potential race conditions.**
    *   **Use Rust's concurrency primitives safely and correctly** (e.g., mutexes, channels, atomic operations) to protect shared mutable state.
    *   **Minimize shared mutable state** in asynchronous handlers if possible.
    *   **Thoroughly test concurrent code** to identify and eliminate race conditions.

## Attack Tree Path: [14. Business Logic Bypasses via Routing or Data Guards [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/14__business_logic_bypasses_via_routing_or_data_guards__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in application logic that are exposed or made exploitable due to how Rocket handles routing or data guards.
*   **Description:**  If the application's business logic has flaws, attackers might be able to exploit Rocket's routing or data guard mechanisms to bypass intended business rules or workflows. For example, manipulating routes to skip certain validation steps enforced by data guards, or crafting requests that exploit ambiguities in route matching to bypass logic.
*   **Impact:** **Medium-High**. Unauthorized actions, data manipulation, circumvention of business rules, potential financial loss or reputational damage.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Thoroughly test business logic** and ensure it is robust and resistant to manipulation through routing or data guards.
    *   **Design routes and data guards with security in mind.** Ensure they correctly enforce business rules and access controls.
    *   **Apply the principle of least privilege** in business logic and authorization checks.
    *   **Perform functional testing** to verify that business logic works as expected and cannot be easily bypassed.

## Attack Tree Path: [15. Authorization Bypasses via Route Guards [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/15__authorization_bypasses_via_route_guards__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Circumventing authorization checks implemented using Rocket's route guards due to flaws in guard logic or configuration.
*   **Description:** If authorization logic is implemented using Rocket's route guards, vulnerabilities in the guard logic itself or misconfigurations can allow attackers to bypass these checks and gain unauthorized access to protected resources or functionalities. This could be due to logic errors in the guard code, incorrect configuration of guards, or vulnerabilities in custom guard implementations.
*   **Impact:** **High**. Unauthorized access to protected resources, privilege escalation, potential data breaches or unauthorized actions.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Carefully design and implement route guards to enforce authorization correctly.**
    *   **Review and test route guard logic rigorously.** Ensure guards correctly check user permissions and roles.
    *   **Use well-established authorization patterns and libraries** where possible to reduce the risk of implementation errors.
    *   **Perform thorough authorization testing** to verify that access controls are enforced as intended and cannot be bypassed.
