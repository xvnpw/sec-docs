# Threat Model Analysis for sergiobenitez/rocket

## Threat: [Exposure of Rocket Configuration Files](./threats/exposure_of_rocket_configuration_files.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker gains access to Rocket's configuration files (e.g., `Rocket.toml`, `.env` files) due to misconfiguration or insecure practices. While not a vulnerability *in* Rocket code, the framework's reliance on configuration files for sensitive data (secrets, database credentials) makes their exposure a *direct* and critical threat in Rocket applications. An attacker can read these files if they are placed in web accessible directories by mistake, or if server configuration is flawed.
*   **Impact:** Credential compromise, unauthorized access to backend systems, data breaches, complete application compromise.
*   **Affected Rocket Component:** Configuration loading mechanism, `Rocket.toml` parsing, environment variable handling.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never** place `Rocket.toml` or `.env` files within the web root or publicly accessible directories.
    *   Utilize environment variables or secure secret management systems (like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) for sensitive configuration data instead of storing them directly in files.
    *   Implement strict file system permissions on configuration files, ensuring only the application process can read them.
    *   Avoid committing sensitive configuration files to version control. Use `.gitignore` and similar mechanisms.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Rocket Ecosystem](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_rocket_ecosystem.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker exploits known vulnerabilities in Rocket itself or its direct, critical dependencies. While dependency vulnerabilities are a general concern, vulnerabilities in *core* Rocket crates (like `tokio`, `hyper` if directly exploited via Rocket's API) are directly relevant to Rocket applications. An attacker can leverage publicly disclosed exploits or develop custom exploits targeting specific vulnerable versions of Rocket or its core dependencies that are exposed through Rocket's functionality.
*   **Impact:** Varies widely depending on the vulnerability, ranging from denial of service, information disclosure, to remote code execution, and full system compromise.
*   **Affected Rocket Component:** Core Rocket framework, dependent crates (specifically those tightly integrated and exposed through Rocket's API), dependency management within `Cargo.toml`.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies from High to Critical depending on the specific vulnerability and affected component.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Proactively monitor** for security advisories related to Rocket and its direct dependencies (crates.io, GitHub, security mailing lists).
    *   **Immediately update** Rocket and its dependencies to the latest versions upon release of security patches using `cargo update`.
    *   Employ dependency scanning tools (e.g., `cargo audit`, `Snyk`, `OWASP Dependency-Check`) to continuously identify known vulnerabilities in project dependencies, including Rocket and its ecosystem.
    *   Implement a robust vulnerability management process to track, prioritize, and remediate identified vulnerabilities in a timely manner.

## Threat: [Path Traversal via Unvalidated Path Parameters (If Rocket facilitates direct file serving)](./threats/path_traversal_via_unvalidated_path_parameters__if_rocket_facilitates_direct_file_serving_.md)

*   **Description:** If the Rocket application directly uses Rocket's features (or poorly designed custom handlers) to serve files based on user-provided path parameters *without sufficient validation*, an attacker can manipulate these parameters to access files outside the intended directory. They craft malicious URLs with path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`, `%2e%2e%2f`) to read sensitive files or potentially write to arbitrary locations if write access is mishandled.  This is only a *direct* Rocket threat if Rocket's API or features encourage or simplify insecure file serving patterns.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure (reading sensitive files), unauthorized access to system resources, potential for remote code execution if write access is exploited.
*   **Affected Rocket Component:** Routing system, path parameter handling, *potentially* file serving functionalities if Rocket provides built-in features that are misused.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid directly serving files based on user-provided path parameters if possible.**  If file serving is necessary, use a safer, more controlled approach.
    *   **If path parameters are used for file access, implement rigorous validation and sanitization.**  Use allow-lists of permitted characters and path components.  Canonicalize paths to prevent traversal attempts.
    *   **Utilize secure file access methods** provided by Rust's standard library and avoid directly constructing file paths from user input.
    *   **Leverage Rocket's type system and guards** to enforce input constraints and validate path parameters before file access.
    *   **Implement proper access controls and least privilege principles** for file system operations.  Limit the application's file system access to only necessary directories.
