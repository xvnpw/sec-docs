# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for sergiobenitez/rocket

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation using Rocket Guards](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation_using_rocket_guards.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Input Points:** Review all Rocket route handlers (`#[get]`, `#[post]`, `#[put]`, `#[delete]`, `#[patch]`) and identify all parameters that receive user input (e.g., path parameters, query parameters, request bodies, form data).
    2.  **Define Custom Guards:** For each input parameter, especially those representing complex data or requiring specific validation rules, create a custom Rocket Guard. This involves creating a struct and implementing the `FromRequest` trait for it.
    3.  **Implement Validation Logic in Guards:** Within the `from_request` method of each custom guard, implement validation logic. This can include:
        *   **Type Checking:** Ensure the input is of the expected data type. Rocket's type system helps here, but explicit checks might be needed for string formats or specific numeric ranges.
        *   **Range Checks:** Verify numeric inputs are within acceptable ranges.
        *   **Format Validation:** Use regular expressions or parsing libraries to validate string formats (e.g., email addresses, phone numbers, dates).
        *   **Business Logic Validation:** Enforce business rules and constraints on the input data (e.g., checking if a username is unique, validating product codes).
        *   **Sanitization (with caution):**  In some cases, carefully sanitize input to remove potentially harmful characters, but prioritize validation and rejection of invalid input over aggressive sanitization which can lead to bypasses or unexpected behavior.
    4.  **Use Guards in Route Handlers:** Replace direct parameter types in route handlers with your custom guards. Rocket will automatically use the guard to validate the input before the handler is executed. If validation fails, the guard will return an error response, preventing the handler from being called with invalid data.
    5.  **Test Thoroughly:** Write unit tests for your custom guards to ensure they correctly validate both valid and invalid inputs. Test edge cases and boundary conditions.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Injection Attacks (High Severity):** SQL Injection, Command Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - By validating input, you prevent malicious code or data from being injected into database queries, system commands, or rendered web pages.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues (Medium Severity):** Prevents processing of invalid or malformed data, which can lead to application errors, incorrect business logic execution, and data corruption.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Low to Medium Severity):**  Reduces the risk of DoS attacks caused by processing excessively large or malformed inputs that could consume excessive resources.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Injection Attacks:** High reduction - Significantly reduces the attack surface by preventing invalid and potentially malicious data from reaching vulnerable parts of the application.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues:** High reduction - Ensures the application operates on valid and consistent data, improving reliability and correctness.
    *   **Denial of Service:** Medium reduction - Mitigates some DoS vectors related to malformed input, but may not protect against all types of DoS attacks.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented in `src/api/user.rs` for user registration and login endpoints, using basic type checks and some length validations within route handlers directly.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Custom guards are not consistently used across all API endpoints, particularly in `src/api/product.rs`, `src/api/order.rs`, and `src/api/admin.rs`.
    *   More complex validation rules (e.g., regular expressions for email/phone numbers, cross-field validation for related data) are missing in many input validation points.
    *   Validation logic is sometimes mixed within route handlers instead of being encapsulated in reusable guards.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Session Management with HttpOnly, Secure, and SameSite Cookies](./mitigation_strategies/secure_session_management_with_httponly__secure__and_samesite_cookies.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Session Cookies:** When setting up Rocket's session management (or using a session management library), ensure session cookies are configured with the following attributes:
        *   **`HttpOnly`:** Set the `HttpOnly` flag to `true`. This prevents client-side JavaScript from accessing the session cookie, mitigating Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks that attempt to steal session IDs.
        *   **`Secure`:** Set the `Secure` flag to `true`. This ensures the session cookie is only transmitted over HTTPS connections, preventing session hijacking over insecure HTTP connections.
        *   **`SameSite`:** Set the `SameSite` attribute to `Strict` or `Lax`. `Strict` provides the strongest protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks by only sending the cookie when the request originates from the same site. `Lax` is more lenient and allows cookies to be sent with top-level navigations from other sites, which might be suitable for some applications but offers less CSRF protection than `Strict`. Choose the appropriate value based on your application's needs and CSRF risk assessment.
    2.  **Implement Session Timeout:** Configure a reasonable session timeout period. After this period of inactivity, the session should automatically expire, reducing the window of opportunity for session hijacking if a session is compromised.
    3.  **Session Renewal (Optional but Recommended):** Consider implementing session renewal. When a user performs a sensitive action or after a certain period, regenerate the session ID. This limits the lifespan of any potentially compromised session ID.
    4.  **Secure Session Storage:** If storing session data server-side (e.g., in a database or cache), ensure this storage is secure and access is restricted to authorized processes. If using cookie-based sessions, consider encrypting the session data stored in the cookie, although this can increase cookie size.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Session Hijacking (High Severity):**  Mitigates various session hijacking techniques, including:
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) based session theft:** `HttpOnly` prevents JavaScript access.
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks:** `Secure` ensures cookies are only sent over HTTPS.
        *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (Medium to High Severity depending on `SameSite` value):** `SameSite` attribute provides protection against CSRF attacks.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Session Hijacking:** High reduction - Significantly reduces the risk of session hijacking by making it much harder for attackers to steal or reuse session IDs.
    *   **CSRF:** Medium to High reduction - `SameSite` attribute provides a strong defense against CSRF, especially with `Strict` mode.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Session management is implemented using Rocket's built-in features in `src/auth.rs`.
    *   `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags are enabled for session cookies in the Rocket configuration (`Rocket.toml` or programmatically in `rocket()`).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `SameSite` attribute is currently not explicitly set and might be using the browser's default (often `Lax` or `None`). Explicitly setting `SameSite=Strict` should be considered for enhanced CSRF protection, after evaluating potential impact on legitimate cross-site navigation flows.
    *   Session timeout is set to a relatively long duration (e.g., 24 hours). Consider reducing this timeout to a shorter period (e.g., 2-4 hours) to limit the exposure window.
    *   Session renewal is not currently implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [TLS/HTTPS Configuration in Rocket](./mitigation_strategies/tlshttps_configuration_in_rocket.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Obtain TLS Certificates:** Acquire TLS certificates for your domain. Let's Encrypt is a free and automated certificate authority.
    2.  **Configure Rocket for TLS:** In your `Rocket.toml` configuration file (or programmatically when building the `Rocket` instance), specify the paths to your TLS certificate and private key files.
    3.  **Enforce HTTPS Redirection:** Configure Rocket to automatically redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS. This ensures all communication is encrypted. You can achieve this using Rocket's configuration or by implementing middleware.
    4.  **Strong TLS Cipher Suites (Advanced):**  While Rocket uses Rustls which generally defaults to secure configurations, you can further customize the TLS configuration if needed to explicitly define allowed cipher suites and protocols for stricter security. This is typically done at the server level or reverse proxy level if used in front of Rocket.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (High Severity):** HTTPS encryption prevents attackers from eavesdropping on or tampering with communication between clients and the server, protecting sensitive data like login credentials, personal information, and transaction details.
    *   **Session Hijacking (via insecure HTTP) (High Severity):**  Ensuring HTTPS and using `Secure` cookies prevents session IDs from being transmitted over unencrypted connections, reducing the risk of session hijacking.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** High reduction - HTTPS is essential for protecting data in transit and is a fundamental security control for web applications.
    *   **Session Hijacking (via insecure HTTP):** High reduction - Eliminates the risk of session hijacking due to insecure HTTP communication.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   HTTPS is configured in `Rocket.toml` with paths to TLS certificates and keys.
    *   Redirection from HTTP to HTTPS is implemented using Rocket's configuration.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   While HTTPS is enabled, the strength of TLS cipher suites is using defaults.  A review and explicit configuration of strong cipher suites at the server or reverse proxy level (if applicable) could be considered for defense-in-depth. This is more of an infrastructure concern than directly Rocket, but relevant to the overall security posture.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Custom Error Handling in Rocket](./mitigation_strategies/custom_error_handling_in_rocket.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement Error Catching:** Utilize Rocket's error handling mechanisms (e.g., `catchers![]` macro, `#[catch]` attribute) to define custom error handlers for different HTTP status codes (e.g., 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error).
    2.  **Generic Error Responses for Clients:** In your custom error handlers, return generic and user-friendly error messages to clients. Avoid exposing sensitive information like internal server paths, stack traces, or database connection details in these responses, especially in production environments.
    3.  **Detailed Error Logging Server-Side:** Within your error handlers, log detailed error information server-side. Include relevant details like the error type, request path, user ID (if available), and a timestamp. This detailed logging is crucial for debugging, security monitoring, and incident response.
    4.  **Differentiate Development vs. Production:** Configure different error handling behavior for development and production environments. In development, you might want to display more detailed error information for debugging purposes, while in production, prioritize security and user experience by showing generic messages and logging details internally.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Prevents attackers from gaining sensitive information about the application's internal workings, configuration, or code through overly verbose error messages.
    *   **Security Misconfiguration (Low Severity):** Reduces the risk of unintentionally exposing sensitive information due to default error pages or poorly configured error handling.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Medium reduction - Significantly reduces the risk of information leakage through error messages, making it harder for attackers to gather intelligence about the application.
    *   **Security Misconfiguration:** Low reduction - Improves overall security posture by ensuring error handling is configured securely.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Custom error handlers are defined in `src/main.rs` using `catchers![]` for 404 and 500 errors.
    *   Generic error messages are returned to clients in these handlers.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Detailed error logging within the custom error handlers is basic. Enhance logging to include more context like request path, user ID, and potentially error-specific details (without exposing sensitive internals).
    *   Environment-specific error handling (development vs. production) is not fully implemented. Error handlers behave the same in both environments. Implement logic to show more detailed errors in development builds only.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting using Rocket Middleware](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_using_rocket_middleware.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose a Rate Limiting Middleware:** Select a suitable rate limiting middleware for Rocket. You might need to create a custom middleware or use a community-developed crate if one exists. Alternatively, rate limiting can be implemented at a reverse proxy level (like Nginx or Apache) in front of Rocket.
    2.  **Configure Rate Limits:** Define rate limits based on your application's needs and resource capacity. Determine appropriate limits for different routes or user roles. Common rate limiting strategies include:
        *   **IP-based rate limiting:** Limit requests from a specific IP address.
        *   **User-based rate limiting:** Limit requests from a specific authenticated user.
        *   **Route-specific rate limiting:** Apply different rate limits to different API endpoints.
    3.  **Implement Rate Limiting Logic:** In your Rocket middleware (or reverse proxy configuration), implement the rate limiting logic. This typically involves:
        *   **Request Counting:** Track the number of requests from a specific source (IP, user, etc.) within a time window.
        *   **Limit Enforcement:** If the request count exceeds the defined limit, reject the request and return a 429 Too Many Requests HTTP status code.
        *   **Storage for Rate Limits:** Choose a storage mechanism for rate limit counters. In-memory storage is simple but not suitable for distributed deployments. Redis or other caching solutions can be used for shared rate limiting across multiple Rocket instances.
    4.  **Apply Middleware to Rocket:** Register your rate limiting middleware with your Rocket application. You can apply it globally to all routes or selectively to specific routes.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (Medium to High Severity):** Rate limiting makes brute-force attacks (e.g., password guessing, API abuse) significantly slower and less effective by limiting the number of attempts an attacker can make within a given time.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Rate limiting can help mitigate certain types of DoS attacks by preventing a single source from overwhelming the server with excessive requests.
    *   **API Abuse (Medium Severity):** Protects APIs from being abused by malicious actors or misbehaving clients making excessive requests.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Medium to High reduction - Significantly increases the time and resources required for brute-force attacks, making them less practical.
    *   **Denial of Service:** Medium reduction - Provides a layer of defense against some DoS attacks, but may not be sufficient to mitigate sophisticated distributed DoS attacks.
    *   **API Abuse:** Medium reduction - Helps control API usage and prevent abuse.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Rate limiting is not currently implemented in the project.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A rate limiting middleware needs to be implemented or integrated into the Rocket application.
    *   Rate limits need to be defined for different routes or user roles based on application requirements and resource capacity.
    *   A storage mechanism for rate limit counters needs to be chosen and implemented (e.g., in-memory, Redis).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Request Size Limits in Rocket](./mitigation_strategies/request_size_limits_in_rocket.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Request Limits:** In your `Rocket.toml` configuration file (or programmatically), configure Rocket's request limits. You can set limits for:
        *   **`limits.body`:**  Maximum size of the request body. This is crucial for preventing large request DoS attacks and controlling resource usage.
        *   **`limits.data-form`:** Maximum size of form data.
        *   **`limits.json`:** Maximum size of JSON request bodies.
        *   **`limits.string`:** Maximum size of string request bodies.
        *   **`limits.bytes`:** Maximum size of byte stream request bodies.
    2.  **Set Appropriate Limits:** Choose appropriate request size limits based on your application's expected data sizes and resource constraints. Avoid setting excessively large limits that could lead to resource exhaustion.
    3.  **Handle Limit Exceeded Errors:** Rocket will automatically return a 413 Payload Too Large error if a request exceeds the configured limits. Ensure your custom error handlers (see "Custom Error Handling in Rocket" mitigation strategy) handle this error gracefully and return a user-friendly message.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Prevents DoS attacks where attackers send excessively large requests to exhaust server resources (memory, bandwidth, processing time).
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Protects against resource exhaustion caused by processing very large requests, ensuring application stability and performance.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service:** Medium reduction - Mitigates DoS attacks based on large requests.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Medium reduction - Prevents resource exhaustion due to oversized requests.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Request size limits are partially configured in `Rocket.toml`, but using default values.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Review and adjust the default request size limits in `Rocket.toml` to values appropriate for the application's expected data sizes and resource constraints. Consider setting more restrictive limits, especially for file uploads or large data submissions.
    *   Verify that the custom error handlers gracefully handle 413 Payload Too Large errors and return user-friendly messages.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Setting Security Headers using Rocket Response Manipulation](./mitigation_strategies/setting_security_headers_using_rocket_response_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Security Headers:** Determine the security headers that are relevant for your application (e.g., `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Strict-Transport-Security`).
    2.  **Create Middleware or Response Function:** Create Rocket middleware or a reusable function that adds these security headers to HTTP responses.
    3.  **Set Header Values:** Configure appropriate values for each security header based on security best practices and your application's requirements. For example:
        *   `Content-Security-Policy`: Define a restrictive CSP policy (see "Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)" mitigation strategy).
        *   `X-Frame-Options: DENY` or `SAMEORIGIN`: Prevent clickjacking attacks.
        *   `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`: Prevent MIME-sniffing attacks.
        *   `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` or `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`: Control referrer information leakage.
        *   `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=..., includeSubDomains, preload`: Enforce HTTPS and enable HSTS.
    4.  **Apply Middleware/Function to Rocket:** Register your middleware or use the response function in your route handlers to ensure security headers are included in all (or relevant) responses.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):** `Content-Security-Policy` is a primary defense against XSS.
    *   **Clickjacking (Medium Severity):** `X-Frame-Options` prevents clickjacking attacks.
    *   **MIME-Sniffing Attacks (Low Severity):** `X-Content-Type-Options` mitigates MIME-sniffing vulnerabilities.
    *   **Referrer Information Leakage (Low Severity):** `Referrer-Policy` controls the amount of referrer information sent to other sites.
    *   **Insecure HTTP Usage (High Severity):** `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS) enforces HTTPS and prevents downgrade attacks.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** High reduction - CSP is a very effective XSS mitigation.
    *   **Clickjacking:** Medium reduction - `X-Frame-Options` effectively prevents clickjacking.
    *   **MIME-Sniffing Attacks:** Low reduction - Mitigates a less common but still relevant vulnerability.
    *   **Referrer Information Leakage:** Low reduction - Reduces information leakage, enhancing privacy and security.
    *   **Insecure HTTP Usage:** High reduction - HSTS strongly enforces HTTPS.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Security headers are not currently implemented in the project. No security headers are being explicitly set in responses.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Middleware or a response function needs to be created to add security headers to Rocket responses.
    *   Appropriate values for each security header need to be configured based on security best practices and application requirements.
    *   The middleware/function needs to be registered with the Rocket application to apply the headers to responses.

## Mitigation Strategy: [CORS Configuration in Rocket](./mitigation_strategies/cors_configuration_in_rocket.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Assess CORS Needs:** Determine if your Rocket application needs to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). This is typically needed if your frontend application is hosted on a different domain or port than your Rocket backend.
    2.  **Configure CORS in Rocket:** Use Rocket's built-in CORS support or a CORS middleware crate to configure CORS.
    3.  **Define Allowed Origins:** Specify the allowed origins (domains and ports) that are permitted to make cross-origin requests to your Rocket application. Be as specific as possible and avoid using wildcard origins (`*`) in production unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.
    4.  **Configure Allowed Methods and Headers:** Define the HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and headers that are allowed for cross-origin requests. Restrict these to only the necessary methods and headers to minimize security risks.
    5.  **Credentials Handling (if needed):** If your application needs to send credentials (e.g., cookies, authorization headers) in cross-origin requests, configure CORS to allow credentials (`Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`) and ensure `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` is *not* set to `*` but to specific origins.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (Medium to High Severity):** While CORS is primarily designed for enabling legitimate cross-origin requests, misconfigured CORS can *increase* CSRF risks if wildcard origins are used permissively. Proper CORS configuration helps control cross-origin access and can indirectly contribute to CSRF defense when combined with other CSRF mitigation techniques.
    *   **Unauthorized Cross-Origin Access (Medium Severity):** Prevents unauthorized websites from making requests to your Rocket API and potentially accessing or manipulating data.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **CSRF:** Low to Medium reduction (indirectly) - Properly configured CORS can reduce CSRF risks by controlling allowed origins, especially when `SameSite` cookies are not sufficient or applicable.
    *   **Unauthorized Cross-Origin Access:** Medium reduction - Prevents unwanted cross-origin access to your API.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   CORS is not currently explicitly configured in the project. Rocket is likely using default CORS behavior (which might be restrictive or permissive depending on Rocket's defaults and browser behavior).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   CORS configuration needs to be explicitly implemented in Rocket if cross-origin requests are expected.
    *   Allowed origins, methods, and headers need to be defined based on the application's CORS requirements.
    *   Carefully review and avoid overly permissive CORS configurations, especially wildcard origins, in production environments. If wildcard origins are necessary, understand the security implications and implement additional security measures.
