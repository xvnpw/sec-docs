    1.  **Code Review Process:** Establish a mandatory code review process for all custom Rocket fairings before merging. Reviews should be conducted by developers with security awareness, focusing on fairing-specific logic.
    2.  **Security-Focused Review Checklist (Fairing Specific):** Create a checklist tailored for Rocket fairing security reviews, including:
        *   Input validation and sanitization for data accessed *within the fairing* (e.g., request headers, cookies before passing to handlers).
        *   Proper error handling and logging *within the fairing's lifecycle methods* (on_request, on_response, etc.).
        *   Secure handling of sensitive data *processed or accessed by the fairing*.
        *   Adherence to the principle of least privilege for *fairing operations*.
        *   Review of dependencies used *by the fairing* for known vulnerabilities.
    3.  **Static Analysis Tools (Focus on Rust/Rocket):** Utilize Rust-specific static analysis tools (like `cargo clippy`, `rustsec`) to scan fairing code for potential security issues and coding style problems relevant to Rust and Rocket.
    4.  **Dynamic Testing (Fairing Context):** For complex fairings, consider dynamic testing techniques focused on fairing behavior within the Rocket application context, like testing how fairings interact with routes and handlers.
    5.  **Documentation and Justification (Fairing Specific):** Document the purpose, functionality, and *Rocket lifecycle interactions* of each custom fairing. Justify the need for each fairing and its specific actions within the Rocket request/response flow.
