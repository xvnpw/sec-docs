  - Performance bottlenecks in Rocket framework could lead to slow applications and poor user experience.
  - Lack of community support or documentation could hinder adoption and developer productivity.
  - Bugs or instability in Rocket framework could lead to application failures and downtime.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing security controls:
  - security control: Rust's memory safety features inherently prevent many common web application vulnerabilities like buffer overflows and use-after-free. Implemented by: Rust compiler and language design.
  - security control: Type system and compile-time checks in Rust reduce the likelihood of type-related errors that can lead to vulnerabilities. Implemented by: Rust compiler.
  - security control: Rocket framework encourages secure coding practices through its design, such as request guards for input validation and type-safe routing. Implemented by: Rocket framework design and API.
  - security control: HTTPS support is easily configurable in Rocket for secure communication. Implemented by: Rocket framework configuration and underlying Rust TLS libraries.
  - security control:  CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) configuration is available in Rocket to control cross-origin requests. Implemented by: Rocket framework configuration and fairings.
- Accepted risks:
  - accepted risk:  Vulnerabilities in dependencies used by Rocket or applications built with Rocket. Mitigation: Dependency scanning and updates are developer's responsibility.
  - accepted risk:  Developer errors in application code built with Rocket, such as insecure business logic or improper use of Rocket's features. Mitigation: Secure coding training and code reviews are developer's responsibility.
  - accepted risk:  Denial-of-service attacks targeting applications built with Rocket. Mitigation: Rate limiting and infrastructure security are developer's/operator's responsibility.
- Recommended security controls:
  - security control: Implement static application security testing (SAST) tools in the development pipeline to automatically detect potential vulnerabilities in application code.
  - security control: Implement dependency scanning tools to identify and manage vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by Rocket applications.
  - security control: Conduct regular penetration testing and security audits of applications built with Rocket to identify and remediate security weaknesses.
  - security control: Establish and enforce secure coding guidelines for developers using Rocket framework.
  - security control: Implement runtime application self-protection (RASP) or web application firewall (WAF) for applications built with Rocket to detect and prevent attacks in runtime.
- Security requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: Rocket applications should support various authentication mechanisms (e.g., session-based, token-based, OAuth) to verify user identity.
    - Requirement:  Authentication mechanisms should be resistant to common attacks like brute-force and credential stuffing.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Rocket applications should implement fine-grained authorization to control user access to resources and functionalities based on roles and permissions.
    - Requirement: Authorization decisions should be consistently enforced throughout the application.
  - Input validation:
    - Requirement: Rocket applications must validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).
    - Requirement: Input validation should be performed on both client-side and server-side. Rocket's request guards can be used for server-side validation.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Rocket applications should use strong and up-to-date cryptographic algorithms and libraries for sensitive data protection (e.g., password hashing, data encryption in transit and at rest).
    - Requirement:  Proper key management practices should be implemented for cryptographic keys.
