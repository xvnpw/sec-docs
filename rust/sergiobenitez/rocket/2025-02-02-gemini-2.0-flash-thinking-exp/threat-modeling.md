# Threat Model Analysis for sergiobenitez/rocket

## Threat: [Data Guard Logic Flaws](./threats/data_guard_logic_flaws.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input designed to bypass validation logic within custom Rocket data guards. They might send requests with unexpected data types, formats, or values that the data guard fails to properly sanitize or reject. This could lead to the application processing invalid data.
*   **Impact:** Data integrity compromise, potential for injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection if data guard output is used in database queries), application crashes due to unexpected data.
*   **Rocket Component Affected:** Custom Data Guards, Route Handlers
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust input validation within data guards, covering all expected data types, formats, and ranges.
    *   Use established validation libraries or patterns.
    *   Perform thorough testing of data guards with various valid and invalid inputs, including boundary and edge cases.
    *   Sanitize data further within route handlers before using it in sensitive operations (e.g., database queries).

## Threat: [Request Guard Logic Flaws and Bypass](./threats/request_guard_logic_flaws_and_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker identifies weaknesses in the logic of custom Rocket request guards used for authentication or authorization. They might exploit logic errors, race conditions, or incomplete checks to bypass authentication or authorization and gain unauthorized access to protected routes.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data and functionalities, privilege escalation, data breaches, account takeover.
*   **Rocket Component Affected:** Custom Request Guards, Routing System
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement request guards with well-defined and thoroughly tested authentication and authorization logic.
    *   Follow secure coding practices when implementing request guards.
    *   Conduct security reviews and penetration testing of authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    *   Consider using established authentication and authorization libraries or patterns instead of custom implementations where possible.

## Threat: [Malicious or Vulnerable Fairings](./threats/malicious_or_vulnerable_fairings.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in custom or third-party Rocket fairings. A malicious fairing could be designed to intercept and modify requests/responses, log sensitive data, or introduce new vulnerabilities. A vulnerable fairing, even if unintentionally flawed, could be exploited by attackers.
*   **Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the fairing's vulnerability, including data breaches, data manipulation, denial of service, remote code execution, introduction of new attack vectors.
*   **Rocket Component Affected:** Fairings, Application Lifecycle
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the fairing's function and vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly review and audit custom fairing code for security vulnerabilities.
    *   Exercise caution when using third-party fairings; evaluate their security posture and maintain them updated.
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege to fairings; ensure they only have the necessary permissions and access.
    *   Regularly update fairing dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Insecure Rocket Configuration (TLS and CORS Misconfiguration)](./threats/insecure_rocket_configuration__tls_and_cors_misconfiguration_.md)

*   **Description:** Misconfiguration of Rocket settings related to TLS and CORS can introduce vulnerabilities. Using outdated TLS versions or weak ciphers exposes the application to man-in-the-middle attacks. Overly permissive CORS policies can enable cross-site scripting attacks.
*   **Impact:** Man-in-the-middle attacks (TLS misconfiguration), cross-site scripting (CORS misconfiguration), potentially leading to data breaches or account compromise.
*   **Rocket Component Affected:** Rocket Configuration, Server Setup
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Configure Rocket with strong TLS settings: use modern TLS versions (TLS 1.3 or 1.2 minimum) and strong cipher suites.
    *   Implement restrictive CORS policies, allowing only explicitly trusted origins. Avoid wildcard (`*`) origins in production.
    *   Regularly review and update Rocket configuration settings to align with security best practices for TLS and CORS.
