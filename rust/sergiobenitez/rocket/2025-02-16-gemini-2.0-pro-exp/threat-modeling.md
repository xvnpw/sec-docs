# Threat Model Analysis for sergiobenitez/rocket

## Threat: [Threat: Form Data Validation Bypass (Tampering)](./threats/threat_form_data_validation_bypass__tampering_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker submits crafted form data that circumvents the validation logic implemented in a *Rocket-specific* `FromForm` implementation. This exploits weaknesses in the developer's custom validation code *within the context of Rocket's data binding*.
*   **Impact:** Data integrity compromise, potential injection attacks (if the invalid data is used unsafely in a Rocket handler), unexpected application behavior, or crashes *directly related to Rocket's processing of the form data*.
*   **Affected Component:** `FromForm` trait implementations (specifically, custom data structures used in Rocket forms), and any Rocket request handlers that rely on the potentially compromised data.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the data and its use within Rocket).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust validation *within* `FromForm` implementations, using appropriate Rust types and validation libraries (e.g., `validator`), ensuring it integrates correctly with Rocket's request handling.
    *   Perform comprehensive input sanitization *after* Rocket's `FromForm` processing.
    *   Use unit and integration tests to verify the validation logic thoroughly, focusing on how Rocket handles edge cases and boundary conditions.
    *   Employ a "defense in depth" approach, validating data at multiple layers, including within Rocket's request handling pipeline.

## Threat: [Threat: Route Parameter Manipulation (Tampering)](./threats/threat_route_parameter_manipulation__tampering_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker modifies *Rocket route parameters* (e.g., `/users/<id>`) to access resources they shouldn't, or to trigger unintended behavior *within Rocket's routing system*. This exploits insufficient validation of parameters *within Rocket's request handling*.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data or functionality *managed by Rocket routes*, information disclosure, potential for further attacks (e.g., if the parameter is used unsafely within a Rocket handler).
*   **Affected Component:** Rocket route handlers that accept parameters (e.g., `#[get("/users/<id>")]`), and any code *within those handlers* that uses the parameters without proper validation *in the context of Rocket's request processing*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the sensitivity of data accessed via Rocket routes).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Validate and sanitize all route parameters *within Rocket request handlers*.
    *   Use type-safe parameters whenever possible (e.g., `id: usize`) *as supported by Rocket*.
    *   Implement authorization checks *after* validating parameters, *within the Rocket handler*, ensuring access is permitted.
    *   Avoid using route parameters directly in operations without proper escaping or parameterization, *especially within Rocket's context*.

## Threat: [Threat: Request Guard Bypass (Elevation of Privilege)](./threats/threat_request_guard_bypass__elevation_of_privilege_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker bypasses the authentication/authorization checks implemented by *Rocket request guards*. This exploits a flaw in the guard's `FromRequest` implementation, a misconfiguration *within Rocket*, or an unhandled edge case *in Rocket's request processing*.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to *Rocket-protected routes* and resources, potential for privilege escalation *within the Rocket application*, data breaches.
*   **Affected Component:** Rocket request guards (types implementing the `FromRequest` trait), and the Rocket routes they protect.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly test and review all *Rocket request guard* implementations, including edge cases and error handling *specific to Rocket's request lifecycle*.
    *   Ensure guards are applied consistently to all relevant *Rocket routes*.
    *   Use a well-defined authorization strategy *integrated with Rocket's request handling*.
    *   Regularly audit the application's authorization logic *within the context of Rocket*.

## Threat: [Threat: Fairing-Induced Vulnerabilities (Multiple STRIDE Categories)](./threats/threat_fairing-induced_vulnerabilities__multiple_stride_categories_.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious or poorly written *Rocket fairing* introduces vulnerabilities. This could involve information disclosure (leaking data via Rocket's logging or response headers), tampering (modifying the Rocket request/response insecurely), elevation of privilege (manipulating the Rocket request context), or denial of service (consuming resources within Rocket).
*   **Impact:** Varies; could range from minor leaks to complete compromise *of the Rocket application*.
*   **Affected Component:** Rocket fairings (types implementing the `Fairing` trait), and any code interacting with the request/response *after the Rocket fairing is applied*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the fairing and the vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully review and audit all *Rocket fairing* implementations, *especially third-party fairings*.
    *   Limit the scope of changes made by *Rocket fairings*.
    *   Avoid logging sensitive data *within Rocket fairings*.
    *   Ensure fairings don't modify the *Rocket request or response* in ways that introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   Thoroughly test *Rocket fairings* in isolation and in combination.

## Threat: [Threat: Unbounded Request Body (Denial of Service)](./threats/threat_unbounded_request_body__denial_of_service_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a request with a large body, exploiting the *lack of proper limits within Rocket's request handling*, consuming server resources and causing a denial-of-service.
*   **Impact:** Application unavailability, resource exhaustion, potential crashes *due to Rocket's handling of the oversized request*.
*   **Affected Component:** Rocket request handlers accepting bodies, and *Rocket's configuration related to `limits.data`*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Configure appropriate request body size limits using *Rocket's `limits.data` configuration option*.
    *   Use streaming techniques *within Rocket* for large uploads, processing data in chunks.
    *   Implement rate limiting *to protect Rocket endpoints*.

## Threat: [Threat:  Unbounded Data Structures in `FromForm` (Denial of Service)](./threats/threat__unbounded_data_structures_in__fromform___denial_of_service_.md)

*   **Description:**  A *Rocket `FromForm` implementation* uses an unbounded data structure (like `Vec<String>`) without size limits.  An attacker submits a form with many values, causing excessive memory allocation *within Rocket's form processing* and a potential denial-of-service.
*   **Impact:**  Application unavailability, resource exhaustion, potential crashes *due to Rocket's handling of the form data*.
*   **Affected Component:** *Rocket `FromForm` implementations* that use unbounded collections.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use bounded data structures (e.g., fixed-size arrays) whenever possible *within Rocket's `FromForm` implementations*.
    *   Implement explicit size limits *within Rocket `FromForm` implementations*, validating collection sizes.
    *   Use a validation library that integrates with *Rocket's form handling* and supports collection size limits.

## Threat: [Threat:  Configuration Exposure (Information Disclosure)](./threats/threat__configuration_exposure__information_disclosure_.md)

*    **Description:** The `Rocket.toml` file is accidentally exposed.
*    **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive configuration data.
*    **Affected Component:** The `Rocket.toml` file.
*    **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*    **Mitigation Strategies:**
     *   Ensure the `Rocket.toml` file is *not* placed in a directory accessible from the web root.
     *   Use environment variables for sensitive configuration values.
     *   Implement file system permissions to restrict access to the configuration file.
