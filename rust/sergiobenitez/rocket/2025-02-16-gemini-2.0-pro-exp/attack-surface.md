# Attack Surface Analysis for sergiobenitez/rocket

## Attack Surface: [1. Insufficiently Strict Request Guards](./attack_surfaces/1__insufficiently_strict_request_guards.md)

*   **Description:** Rocket's request guards are the primary mechanism for validating incoming request data.  If they are too permissive, incorrectly implemented, or missing, attackers can bypass security checks and exploit application logic.
*   **Rocket Contribution:** This is *entirely* a Rocket-specific concern.  The framework's design relies heavily on request guards for data validation.
*   **Example:** A route expects a JSON payload with a `user_id` field (an integer). The request guard only checks for the *presence* of the `user_id` field, but not its type or value. An attacker could send `{"user_id": "malicious_string"}` or `{"user_id": -1}` to potentially cause errors or access unauthorized data.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data corruption, denial of service, application logic errors, potential for code injection depending on how the data is used.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the data being protected and how it's used).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   *Comprehensive Validation:* Validate *all* relevant aspects: type, range, format, length, and application-specific constraints.  Use Rocket's type system effectively (e.g., `i32`, `String`, custom types with `FromParam` or `FromData` implementations).
    *   *Use Built-in Guards:* Prefer Rocket's built-in guards (`Form`, `Json`, `FromParam`) as they provide robust, tested validation.
    *   *Custom Guard Review:* Rigorously review and test *all* custom request guards.  Use unit tests with various valid and invalid inputs.
    *   *Principle of Least Privilege:* Guards should only allow the *absolute minimum* necessary data.
    *   *Input Sanitization:* Sanitize input *after* validation to remove any potentially harmful characters, *especially* if the data will be used in contexts like HTML rendering or database queries (though this is a general security practice, not solely a Rocket concern).

## Attack Surface: [2. Malicious or Misconfigured Fairings](./attack_surfaces/2__malicious_or_misconfigured_fairings.md)

*   **Description:** Rocket fairings are powerful middleware that can intercept and modify requests and responses.  A malicious or poorly written fairing can introduce significant vulnerabilities.
*   **Rocket Contribution:** Fairings are a core, Rocket-specific feature.  Their power and flexibility create a large potential attack surface.
*   **Example:** A custom fairing designed to add a security header accidentally introduces a vulnerability by setting the header to an attacker-controlled value from the request.  Or, a fairing intended to rate-limit requests has a bug that allows an attacker to bypass the rate limits.
*   **Impact:** Data leakage, introduction of new vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF), denial of service, bypassing of security checks (including request guards).
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   *Trusted Sources Only:* *Only* use fairings from trusted sources.  Thoroughly review the source code of *any* third-party fairing.
    *   *Secure Fairing Development:* If writing custom fairings, follow *strict* secure coding practices.  Avoid logging sensitive data.  Handle errors gracefully and securely.  Minimize the fairing's impact on performance and security.
    *   *Fairing Ordering is Crucial:* The order of fairings *matters*.  Security-related fairings (authentication, authorization, input validation) should generally be placed *early* in the chain, *before* any fairings that might modify the request in a way that could bypass security checks.
    *   *Least Privilege:* Fairings should have the *absolute minimum* necessary permissions.
    *   *Auditing:* Regularly audit the behavior of *all* fairings to ensure they are not introducing security issues.

## Attack Surface: [3. Template Injection (with `rocket_dyn_templates`)](./attack_surfaces/3__template_injection__with__rocket_dyn_templates__.md)

*   **Description:** While `rocket_dyn_templates` uses generally safe templating engines, improper use can still lead to template injection if user-provided data isn't properly escaped. This is a high-risk vulnerability.
*   **Rocket Contribution:** `rocket_dyn_templates` is the official Rocket library for template integration. While the underlying engines (Handlebars, Tera) are designed to be safe, the *responsibility for correct usage rests with the developer*.
*   **Example:** A user's comment is displayed on a page without escaping. An attacker submits a comment containing: `{{#if true}} <script>alert('XSS')</script> {{/if}}`. If the templating engine doesn't automatically escape this, the attacker's JavaScript will execute.
*   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), data theft, session hijacking, website defacement, potential for server-side code execution (depending on the templating engine and configuration).
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   *Auto-Escaping (Primary Defense):* Ensure auto-escaping is *enabled* in your chosen templating engine (Handlebars, Tera). This is usually the default, but *verify it*.
    *   *Manual Escaping (Rarely Needed):* If you *absolutely must* disable auto-escaping for a specific variable (very rare and generally discouraged), use the templating engine's built-in escaping functions *explicitly*.
    *   *Content Security Policy (CSP):* Implement a strong CSP as a *defense-in-depth* measure to mitigate the impact of XSS, even if a template injection vulnerability exists.
    *   *Input Validation (Before Storage):* Validate user input *before* storing it in the database. This helps prevent storing malicious data that could be injected later. This is a general security best practice, but it's particularly important in the context of templating.
