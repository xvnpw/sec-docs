## Mitigation Strategy: [Fairing Principle of Least Privilege & Ordering](./mitigation_strategies/fairing_principle_of_least_privilege_&_ordering.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Fairing Principle of Least Privilege and Explicit Ordering

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Fairing Needs:** For each custom fairing, list the specific data it needs from the `Request` and `Response` objects. Avoid using `&Request` or `&Response` if only a small part is needed (e.g., a single header).
2.  **Refactor for Minimal Access:** Rewrite fairing code to only access the identified data. For example, if a fairing only needs the `Content-Type` header, access it directly via `request.headers().get_one("Content-Type")` instead of getting the entire `Request` object.
3.  **Define Explicit Order:** In `rocket::build()`, use `.attach()` with a specific `Fairing` rank (e.g., `Fairing::new(..., rank = 1)` for early, `rank = 10` for late). Security-critical fairings (authentication, authorization, input validation) should have lower ranks (run earlier on requests, later on responses).
4.  **Document Order and Purpose:** Create a comment block in the `main.rs` or fairing module clearly documenting the intended order of fairings and the purpose of each.
5.  **Review and Audit:** Regularly review fairing code to ensure it adheres to the principle of least privilege and the documented order.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Information Disclosure (Severity: High):** Prevents fairings from accidentally accessing and potentially leaking sensitive data they don't need.
*   **Authorization Bypass (Severity: High):** Ensures security-critical fairings run *before* fairings that might modify the request in a way that could bypass security checks.
*   **Injection Attacks (Severity: High):** By validating input *within* fairings that modify the request, we prevent injection attacks from propagating to later stages.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: Medium):** By limiting the scope of fairings, we reduce the potential for a single fairing to consume excessive resources.

**Impact:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Significantly reduces the risk by limiting data access.
*   **Authorization Bypass:** Significantly reduces the risk by enforcing a secure execution order.
*   **Injection Attacks:** Reduces the risk by providing an additional layer of defense.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Moderately reduces the risk by limiting the potential impact of a single fairing.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Partially implemented. Fairing order is defined, but some fairings still have broader access than necessary. Documentation is present but could be more detailed. Located in `src/fairings/`.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Refactor `AuditLogFairing` in `src/fairings/audit_log.rs` to only access the request method and URI, instead of the entire `Request` object.
*   Add more detailed comments to `src/main.rs` explaining the rationale behind the specific ranking of each fairing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Request Guard Implementation](./mitigation_strategies/secure_request_guard_implementation.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Request Guard Implementation with Fail-Closed Logic

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Spoofable Data:** Review all Request Guards and identify any reliance on easily spoofable data (e.g., `User-Agent`, `Referer`, custom headers without cryptographic verification).
2.  **Implement Secure Authentication/Authorization:** Replace reliance on spoofable data with secure mechanisms, utilizing Rocket's features where appropriate:
    *   **Custom Request Guards for JWTs/Sessions:** Create Request Guards that validate JWTs or session identifiers (using Rocket's `Cookies` or a custom fairing for secure cookie handling).
    *   **Database Lookups (within Guards):** Perform database lookups based on the authenticated user's ID (obtained from a validated token/session) to determine their permissions *within the Request Guard*.
3.  **Fail Closed:** Ensure all Request Guards have a default `Outcome::Failure` that denies access if the guard cannot definitively determine that access should be granted. Use `Outcome::Forward` *only* when the guard is certain about allowing access.
4.  **Centralize Logic (if possible):** Consolidate authorization logic into a smaller number of well-defined Request Guards (e.g., `AdminGuard`, `UserGuard`).
5.  **Unit Test Guards:** Create unit tests for each Request Guard, covering various scenarios (valid/invalid tokens, different user roles, missing data).  Use Rocket's testing framework (`local::Client`).
6.  **Generic Error Responses:** Ensure that failed Request Guards return generic 403 Forbidden or 401 Unauthorized responses (using Rocket's `Status` codes), without revealing details about the reason for denial.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Authentication Bypass (Severity: Critical):** Prevents attackers from accessing protected routes by spoofing request data.
*   **Authorization Bypass (Severity: Critical):** Ensures that only users with the correct permissions can access specific resources.
*   **Information Disclosure (Severity: Medium):** Prevents detailed error messages from revealing information about the application's security mechanisms.

**Impact:**
*   **Authentication Bypass:** Eliminates the risk if implemented correctly.
*   **Authorization Bypass:** Eliminates the risk if implemented correctly.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Significantly reduces the risk.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Mostly implemented. JWT-based authentication is used for API routes (custom Request Guard). Session-based authentication is used for web routes (custom Request Guard). Fail-closed logic is in place. Unit tests exist for most guards. Located in `src/guards/`.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Review `src/guards/user_guard.rs` to ensure that the session ID validation is robust against session fixation attacks (e.g., by regenerating the session ID after login - potentially using a custom fairing).
*   Add integration tests to verify that the interaction between `AuthGuard` and `AdminGuard` works as expected (using Rocket's `local::Client`).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Multipart Form Handling (using `rocket_multipart_form_data`)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_multipart_form_handling__using__rocket_multipart_form_data__.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Multipart Form Handling with Strict Limits and Validation (Rocket-Specific)

**Description:**
1.  **Global Size Limits (rocket.toml):** Set global size limits in `rocket.toml` using the `limits` configuration:
    ```toml
    [limits]
    data-form = "2 MiB"  # Limit for all forms
    file = "1 MiB"      # Limit for individual files
    ```
2.  **Per-Field Limits (rocket_multipart_form_data):** In your form handling code, use `rocket_multipart_form_data`'s features to set per-field limits and perform basic validation:
    ```rust
    use rocket_multipart_form_data::{mime, MultipartFormDataOptions, MultipartFormDataField, MultipartFormData};

    #[post("/upload", data = "<data>")]
    async fn upload(content_type: &ContentType, data: Data<'_>) -> Result<String, &'static str> {
        let mut options = MultipartFormDataOptions::with_multipart_form_data_fields(
            vec![
                MultipartFormDataField::file("image")
                    .content_type_by_string(Some(mime::IMAGE_STAR)) // Accept any image type
                    .unwrap()
                    .size_limit(1024 * 1024), // 1MB limit
                MultipartFormDataField::text("description").size_limit(256), // 256-byte limit
            ]
        );

        let mut multipart_form_data = MultipartFormData::parse(content_type, data, options).await.unwrap();

        // ... (Further processing and validation) ...
    }
    ```
3. **File Type Validation (Beyond Extensions - within Rocket handler):** While `rocket_multipart_form_data` can do basic MIME type checking, perform more robust validation *within your Rocket handler* using a library like `infer` to determine the file type based on its content (magic numbers).  This is crucial, as the `content_type` provided by the client can be spoofed.
4.  **Safe Filenames (within Rocket handler):** Generate random filenames *within your Rocket handler* using a cryptographically secure random number generator (e.g., `rand::rngs::OsRng`). Store the original filename separately (if needed) in a database, associated with the random filename.
5. **Path Traversal Prevention (within Rocket handler):** Sanitize filenames *before saving, within your Rocket handler*:
    ```rust
    use std::path::PathBuf;

    fn sanitize_filename(filename: &str) -> PathBuf {
        // ... (Implementation as before) ...
    }
    ```

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: High):** Prevents attackers from uploading excessively large files.
*   **Path Traversal (Severity: Critical):** Prevents attackers from writing files to arbitrary locations.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Severity: Critical):** Reduces the risk by validating file types and preventing direct execution (though server-side configuration is also needed).

**Impact:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Significantly reduces the risk (using Rocket's `limits` and `rocket_multipart_form_data`).
*   **Path Traversal:** Eliminates the risk if filename sanitization is implemented correctly *within the Rocket handler*.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Reduces the risk (requires additional server-side configuration to fully eliminate).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Partially implemented. Global size limits are set in `rocket.toml`. Basic extension validation is used (via `rocket_multipart_form_data`). Located in `src/routes/upload.rs`.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Implement magic number-based file type validation *within* the `upload` handler in `src/routes/upload.rs`, after parsing the multipart form data.
*   Implement robust filename sanitization using the `sanitize_filename` function (or a similar library) *within* the `upload` handler.
*   Use `rocket_multipart_form_data`'s per-field limits more comprehensively.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure State Management (Rocket's `State`)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_state_management__rocket's__state__.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Secure State Management with Synchronization

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Shared State:** Identify all data stored in Rocket's managed state (using `rocket::State`).
2.  **Use Synchronization:** If the state is mutable and accessed by multiple requests concurrently, use `Mutex` or `RwLock` to protect it *within your Rocket handlers and fairings*:
    ```rust
    #[derive(Debug, Default)]
    struct Counter(Arc<Mutex<usize>>);

    #[get("/count")]
    fn count(counter: &State<Counter>) -> String {
        let mut count = counter.0.lock().unwrap();
        *count += 1;
        format!("Count: {}", *count)
    }
    ```
3. **Clear Session State (if applicable):** If you have state associated with user sessions (likely managed via a custom fairing and/or Request Guard), ensure it's cleared when the session ends (e.g., on logout). This often involves interacting with Rocket's `Cookies` or a custom session management system.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Race Conditions (Severity: High):** Prevents data corruption due to concurrent access to shared state managed by Rocket.

**Impact:**
*   **Race Conditions:** Eliminates the risk if synchronization is implemented correctly using Rocket's `State` and appropriate locking mechanisms.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   `Mutex` is used to protect a shared counter in `src/routes/counter.rs` (accessed via `rocket::State`).

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Review `src/state.rs` to see if any other shared state (accessed via `rocket::State`) needs synchronization.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Error Handling (Rocket's Catchers)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_error_handling__rocket's_catchers_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Error Handling with Generic Messages using Rocket's Catchers

**Description:**
1.  **Custom Error Catchers:** Implement custom error catchers using Rocket's `#[catch]` attribute for common HTTP error codes (404, 500, etc.).
2.  **Generic Error Messages:** In the error catchers, return generic error messages to the user using Rocket's `Response` and `Status` types. Do *not* include any details about the internal error.
    ```rust
    #[catch(404)]
    fn not_found() -> &'static str {
        "Resource not found."
    }
    ```
3. **Test Error Catchers:** Write unit tests using Rocket's testing framework to verify that your error catchers handle different error conditions correctly and return the expected `Status` codes.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Information Disclosure (Severity: Medium):** Prevents internal error details from being leaked to attackers via error responses.

**Impact:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Significantly reduces the risk by ensuring only generic messages are returned to the client, controlled by Rocket's error handling mechanisms.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Custom error catchers are implemented for 404 and 500 errors using `#[catch]`. Generic error messages are returned. Located in `src/errors.rs`.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Add unit tests for the custom error catchers using Rocket's testing framework.
