# Attack Surface Analysis for sergiobenitez/rocket

## Attack Surface: [Route Confusion / Path Traversal](./attack_surfaces/route_confusion__path_traversal.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers can manipulate URL paths to access unintended routes or resources.
    *   **How Rocket Contributes:**  Overly permissive or poorly defined route matching patterns in Rocket can allow variations in the URL to still match a route, potentially bypassing intended access controls. Incorrect handling of trailing slashes or URL encoding within Rocket's routing logic can also contribute.
    *   **Example:** A route defined as `/users/{id}` might be accessed as `/users//1` or `/users/1/`. If the application logic doesn't account for these variations, it could lead to unexpected behavior or access to unintended resources.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data or functionality, potentially leading to data breaches or manipulation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Define precise and restrictive route patterns in Rocket.
        *   Enforce canonical URL formats (e.g., redirecting non-canonical URLs to the canonical form).
        *   Avoid using overly broad wildcard patterns in routes unless absolutely necessary and with careful validation.
        *   Regularly review and audit route definitions.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in the process of converting serialized data (e.g., JSON) back into objects. If untrusted data is deserialized without proper validation, it can lead to arbitrary code execution or other malicious outcomes.
    *   **How Rocket Contributes:** Rocket automatically deserializes request bodies based on content type. If the application directly deserializes untrusted input into complex data structures without validation, it becomes vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a specially crafted JSON payload that, when deserialized by Rocket, creates objects that trigger malicious code execution during their construction or destruction.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid deserializing untrusted data directly into complex objects.
        *   Implement strict validation of deserialized data before using it.
        *   Consider using safer serialization formats or libraries that offer built-in protection against deserialization attacks.
        *   Minimize the use of dynamic deserialization where the type is not explicitly known.

## Attack Surface: [Unrestricted File Uploads](./attack_surfaces/unrestricted_file_uploads.md)

*   **Description:** Allowing users to upload files without proper restrictions on file type, size, or content.
    *   **How Rocket Contributes:** Rocket provides mechanisms for handling file uploads. If the route handler for file uploads doesn't implement sufficient validation and security checks, it can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a malicious executable file disguised as an image. If the server doesn't properly validate the file content and stores it in a publicly accessible location, it could be executed by other users.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, storage exhaustion, serving malicious content, cross-site scripting (if the uploaded file is served without proper content type headers).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict validation of file types based on content (magic numbers) rather than just the file extension.
        *   Set appropriate file size limits.
        *   Store uploaded files in a non-executable directory.
        *   Generate unique and unpredictable filenames for uploaded files.
        *   Implement antivirus scanning on uploaded files.
        *   Set appropriate `Content-Disposition` and `Content-Type` headers when serving uploaded files.

## Attack Surface: [Logic Errors in Request Guards](./attack_surfaces/logic_errors_in_request_guards.md)

*   **Description:**  Flaws in the custom logic implemented within Rocket's request guards that can lead to bypassing security checks or unintended behavior.
    *   **How Rocket Contributes:** Rocket allows developers to create custom request guards for authentication, authorization, and input validation. Errors in the implementation of these guards can create vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A request guard intended to authorize access based on user roles has a flaw in its logic, allowing unauthorized users to pass through.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources or functionality, privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly test and review the logic of custom request guards.
        *   Follow secure coding practices when implementing guards.
        *   Consider using well-established and tested libraries for common security tasks within guards.
        *   Ensure guards handle edge cases and unexpected input correctly.
