Objective: Compromise Application Using Rocket Weaknesses

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
**Goal:** Compromise Application Using Rocket Weaknesses

**Sub-Tree:**

* **[CRITICAL NODE]** Execute Arbitrary Code on the Server
    * Exploit Routing Vulnerabilities
        * **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Path Traversal via Routing
            * **[CRITICAL NODE]** Exploit Insecure Path Parameter Handling (e.g., missing sanitization in custom guards)
            * **[CRITICAL NODE]** Access sensitive files or directories outside the intended scope
    * Abuse Data Binding Mechanisms
        * Leads to unexpected program behavior or vulnerabilities in handler logic. **[CRITICAL NODE]** (Indirectly through Type Coercion)
    * **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Exploit State Management Weaknesses
        * **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Managed State Poisoning
            * **[CRITICAL NODE]** Find a way to modify the application's managed state (e.g., through a vulnerable handler)
            * **[CRITICAL NODE]** Subsequent requests rely on this poisoned state, leading to unexpected behavior.
    * **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Bypass or Exploit Fairings (Middleware)
        * Fairing Ordering Issues
            * **[CRITICAL NODE]** Craft a request that exploits the order to bypass a security-related fairing.
        * **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** **[CRITICAL NODE]** Vulnerabilities in Custom Fairings
            * **[CRITICAL NODE]** Identify vulnerabilities within the application's custom fairings (e.g., insecure logging, flawed authentication).
            * **[CRITICAL NODE]** Exploit these vulnerabilities to gain access or influence application behavior.
    * **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Bypass or Exploit Guards (Authorization/Validation)
        * **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** **[CRITICAL NODE]** Logic Errors in Custom Guards
            * **[CRITICAL NODE]** Identify flaws in the logic of custom guards (e.g., incorrect conditional checks, missing edge cases).
            * **[CRITICAL NODE]** Craft requests that bypass the intended authorization or validation.
    * Leverage Rocket's Macro System for Code Injection
        * Rocket's macro expansion mechanism executes the injected code. **[CRITICAL NODE]**
