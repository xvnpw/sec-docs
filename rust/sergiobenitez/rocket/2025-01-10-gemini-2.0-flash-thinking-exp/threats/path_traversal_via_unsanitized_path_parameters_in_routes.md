## Deep Dive Analysis: Path Traversal via Unsanitized Path Parameters in Rocket

This document provides a deep analysis of the "Path Traversal via Unsanitized Path Parameters in Routes" threat within a Rocket web application. We will dissect the threat, explore its implications within the Rocket framework, and elaborate on the recommended mitigation strategies.

**1. Threat Breakdown and Context within Rocket:**

* **Core Vulnerability:** The fundamental issue lies in the application's failure to adequately sanitize user-provided input, specifically path parameters within Rocket routes. When these parameters are directly used to construct file paths or access server-side resources, an attacker can manipulate them to access locations outside the intended scope.

* **Rocket's Role:** Rocket's routing mechanism allows developers to define dynamic segments within URL paths. These segments capture user input that can be accessed within route handlers. If a handler uses this captured input without proper validation, it becomes a potential entry point for path traversal attacks.

* **Interaction with `fs::NamedFile`:**  The threat description correctly highlights `fs::NamedFile`. This Rocket struct is commonly used for serving static files. If a route handler uses a path parameter to determine which file to serve using `NamedFile::open()`, and that parameter isn't sanitized, an attacker can potentially access arbitrary files on the server.

* **Beyond `NamedFile`:**  It's crucial to understand that this threat extends beyond just serving static files. Any custom handler that uses unsanitized path parameters to interact with the file system, database (e.g., loading configuration files based on path input), or even external systems can be vulnerable.

**2. Technical Deep Dive:**

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request targeting a vulnerable route. The malicious payload is embedded within the path parameter. Common techniques include:
    * **Relative Path Traversal:** Using sequences like `../` to move up the directory structure. For example, a request to `/files/../../etc/passwd` could attempt to access the system's password file if the `/files/<filename>` route is vulnerable.
    * **Absolute Path Injection:**  In some cases, depending on how the path is constructed, providing an absolute path directly (e.g., `/files//etc/passwd`) might bypass naive sanitization attempts.
    * **URL Encoding:** Attackers might use URL encoding (e.g., `%2e%2e%2f`) to obfuscate the malicious payload and bypass basic filtering.

* **Root Cause Analysis:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of trust in user input. Developers might assume that path parameters will always be valid filenames within the intended directory. This assumption fails when malicious input is provided.

* **Impact Amplification within Rocket:**
    * **Information Disclosure:** Accessing sensitive configuration files, application code, or user data.
    * **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  While less direct, path traversal can be a stepping stone to RCE. For example, an attacker might overwrite configuration files used by the application, potentially leading to code execution. If the application allows file uploads and the upload path is vulnerable to traversal, an attacker could place executable files in accessible locations.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):** In some scenarios, attempting to access numerous non-existent files or large files outside the intended scope could lead to resource exhaustion and a denial of service.
    * **Privilege Escalation:** If the application runs with elevated privileges, a successful path traversal could allow access to system-level files and resources.

* **Affected Rocket Components in Detail:**
    * **`routing` module:**  The core of the issue lies in how the `routing` module captures and passes path parameters to route handlers. Without explicit sanitization within the handler, the raw input is vulnerable.
    * **Route Handlers:** Any route handler that receives a path parameter and uses it to interact with the file system or other resources is a potential point of vulnerability. This includes handlers using `fs::NamedFile`, custom file serving logic, or any code that constructs file paths based on user input.
    * **Form Data and Query Parameters (Indirectly):** While the threat focuses on path parameters, it's important to note that similar vulnerabilities can exist if file paths are constructed using data from form submissions or query parameters without proper sanitization.

**3. Detailed Mitigation Strategies with Rocket-Specific Implementation Examples:**

* **Strict Validation and Sanitization:** This is the most crucial defense.
    * **Whitelisting:** Define a strict set of allowed characters or patterns for path parameters. Reject any input that doesn't conform. For example, if you expect only alphanumeric characters and underscores, enforce that.
    * **Blacklisting (Use with Caution):**  Identify and block known malicious patterns like `../`, `..\\`, absolute paths, and URL-encoded equivalents. However, blacklisting can be easily bypassed, so it should be used as a secondary measure alongside whitelisting.
    * **Example (Route Handler with Validation):**

    ```rust
    #[get("/files/<filename>")]
    async fn serve_file(filename: String) -> Option<NamedFile> {
        // Strict whitelisting: Allow only alphanumeric and underscores
        if filename.chars().all(|c| c.is_alphanumeric() || c == '_') {
            NamedFile::open(Path::new("public/").join(filename)).await.ok()
        } else {
            None // Or return a 400 Bad Request
        }
    }
    ```

* **Avoid Directly Using User-Provided Input for File Paths:**  This is a fundamental principle of secure coding.
    * **Indirect Mapping:** Instead of directly using the filename from the request, use it as an index or key to look up the actual file path in a secure mapping or database.
    * **Example (Using a Mapping):**

    ```rust
    use std::collections::HashMap;

    lazy_static::lazy_static! {
        static ref FILE_MAPPING: HashMap<&'static str, &'static str> = {
            let mut m = HashMap::new();
            m.insert("document1", "protected_files/document1.pdf");
            m.insert("image_abc", "images/abc.png");
            m
        };
    }

    #[get("/documents/<doc_key>")]
    async fn serve_document(doc_key: String) -> Option<NamedFile> {
        if let Some(filepath) = FILE_MAPPING.get(doc_key.as_str()) {
            NamedFile::open(filepath).await.ok()
        } else {
            None
        }
    }
    ```

* **Using UUIDs or Database IDs:**  This completely abstracts away the direct file path. The user provides an ID, and the application retrieves the associated file path from a secure storage mechanism.

    ```rust
    // Assuming a database with a 'files' table with 'id' and 'filepath' columns
    #[get("/resources/<resource_id>")]
    async fn serve_resource(resource_id: i32) -> Option<NamedFile> {
        // Fetch the filepath from the database based on resource_id
        // ... database interaction ...
        let filepath = get_filepath_from_db(resource_id).await?;
        NamedFile::open(filepath).await.ok()
    }
    ```

* **Restricting Access to Specific Directories:** If file serving is necessary, explicitly limit access to a designated directory.
    * **Canonicalization and Prefix Checking:**  Use `PathBuf::canonicalize()` to resolve symbolic links and ensure the requested path stays within the allowed directory using `PathBuf::starts_with()`.
    * **Example (Restricting to "public/" directory):**

    ```rust
    use std::path::{Path, PathBuf};

    #[get("/assets/<path..>")]
    async fn serve_asset(path: PathBuf) -> Option<NamedFile> {
        let allowed_dir = Path::new("public/").canonicalize().ok()?;
        let requested_path = allowed_dir.join(&path).canonicalize().ok()?;

        if requested_path.starts_with(&allowed_dir) {
            NamedFile::open(requested_path).await.ok()
        } else {
            None // Or return a 403 Forbidden
        }
    }
    ```

* **Security Headers (Defense in Depth):** While not directly preventing path traversal, security headers can mitigate some of the potential consequences.
    * **`X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`:** Prevents the browser from trying to guess the content type, reducing the risk of interpreting uploaded malicious files as executables.
    * **`Content-Security-Policy (CSP)`:** Can restrict the sources from which the application can load resources, limiting the impact if an attacker manages to upload malicious content.

* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Proactively identify potential vulnerabilities through code reviews and security testing.

**4. Example of Vulnerable Code (Illustrative):**

```rust
#[get("/files/<filename>")]
async fn serve_file(filename: String) -> Option<NamedFile> {
    // Vulnerable: Directly using user input to construct the file path
    NamedFile::open(Path::new("public/").join(filename)).await.ok()
}
```

**Attack:** A request to `/files/../../etc/passwd` would attempt to access the `/etc/passwd` file.

**5. Example of Secure Code (Applying Mitigation):**

```rust
use std::path::{Path, PathBuf};

#[get("/files/<filename>")]
async fn serve_file(filename: String) -> Option<NamedFile> {
    // 1. Whitelist validation
    if !filename.chars().all(|c| c.is_alphanumeric() || c == '_') {
        return None; // Or return a 400 Bad Request
    }

    // 2. Safe path construction and restriction
    let allowed_dir = Path::new("public/").canonicalize().ok()?;
    let requested_path = allowed_dir.join(&filename).canonicalize().ok()?;

    if requested_path.starts_with(&allowed_dir) {
        NamedFile::open(requested_path).await.ok()
    } else {
        None // Or return a 403 Forbidden
    }
}
```

**6. Conclusion:**

Path Traversal via unsanitized path parameters is a critical vulnerability that can have severe consequences. Within the Rocket framework, it's crucial to treat all user-provided input, especially path parameters, with extreme caution. Implementing robust validation, avoiding direct file path construction, and restricting access to specific directories are essential mitigation strategies. By adopting these secure coding practices, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of this threat and build more secure Rocket applications. Continuous security awareness, code reviews, and penetration testing are vital to ensure ongoing protection against this and other potential vulnerabilities.
