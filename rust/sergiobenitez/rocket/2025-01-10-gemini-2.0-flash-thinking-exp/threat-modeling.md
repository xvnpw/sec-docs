# Threat Model Analysis for sergiobenitez/rocket

## Threat: [Route Overlapping Leading to Unauthorized Access](./threats/route_overlapping_leading_to_unauthorized_access.md)

*   **Threat:** Route Overlapping Leading to Unauthorized Access
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a specific request that matches a less restrictive route definition, unintentionally gaining access to functionality or data intended for a more restricted route. This happens because Rocket's route matching might prioritize certain routes over others without explicit disambiguation.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, unintended modification of resources, or execution of privileged actions.
    *   **Affected Rocket Component:** `routing` module, specifically the route matching logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Define routes with explicit specificity, avoiding ambiguous patterns.
        *   Utilize route guards to enforce specific conditions for route matching, ensuring only authorized requests are handled.
        *   Thoroughly test route definitions with various inputs to identify potential overlaps.
        *   Consider the order of route definitions, as Rocket evaluates them sequentially.

## Threat: [Guard Logic Bypass via Input Manipulation](./threats/guard_logic_bypass_via_input_manipulation.md)

*   **Threat:** Guard Logic Bypass via Input Manipulation
    *   **Description:** An attacker manipulates request data (headers, cookies, query parameters, body) in a way that exploits weaknesses in the logic of custom request guards, allowing them to bypass intended authorization or validation checks.
    *   **Impact:** Circumvention of security controls, leading to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or execution of unintended actions.
    *   **Affected Rocket Component:** Custom request guards implemented by the developer, leveraging Rocket's `request` module and guard traits.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation within guards, considering all possible variations and edge cases.
        *   Avoid relying on implicit assumptions about input data types or formats.
        *   Thoroughly test guards with a wide range of valid and invalid inputs, including boundary conditions.
        *   Follow secure coding practices when implementing guard logic, avoiding common pitfalls like case-sensitivity issues or incorrect logical operators.

## Threat: [Path Traversal via Unsanitized Path Parameters in Routes](./threats/path_traversal_via_unsanitized_path_parameters_in_routes.md)

*   **Threat:** Path Traversal via Unsanitized Path Parameters in Routes
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a request with a malicious path parameter (e.g., `../../etc/passwd`) that is used to access files or resources on the server without proper sanitization. Rocket's routing might pass this unsanitized input to file-serving functionalities or custom handlers.
    *   **Impact:** Access to sensitive files on the server, potential information disclosure, or even remote code execution in vulnerable scenarios.
    *   **Affected Rocket Component:** `routing` module when handling path parameters, potentially interacting with `fs::NamedFile` or custom file-serving logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict validation and sanitization of all path parameters used to access server-side resources.
        *   Avoid directly using user-provided input to construct file paths.
        *   Consider using UUIDs or database IDs to reference resources instead of direct file paths.
        *   If file serving is necessary, restrict access to specific directories and prevent traversal beyond those boundaries.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion in Route Handlers or Guards](./threats/denial_of_service_via_resource_exhaustion_in_route_handlers_or_guards.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion in Route Handlers or Guards
    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a large number of requests to specific routes or triggers guards that perform computationally expensive operations or consume excessive resources (memory, CPU), leading to the server becoming unresponsive or crashing.
    *   **Impact:** Application unavailability, impacting legitimate users and potentially causing financial or reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Rocket Component:** Route handlers defined by the developer, custom request guards, and potentially Rocket's core request handling mechanisms.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Profile route handlers and guards for performance and identify potential bottlenecks.
        *   Implement rate limiting to restrict the number of requests from a single source within a given timeframe.
        *   Set appropriate request size limits to prevent processing excessively large requests.
        *   Implement timeouts for long-running operations within handlers and guards.
        *   Consider using asynchronous processing for resource-intensive tasks.

## Threat: [Malicious or Vulnerable Fairings](./threats/malicious_or_vulnerable_fairings.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious or Vulnerable Fairings
    *   **Description:** If the application uses third-party or custom fairings, these components could contain vulnerabilities or be intentionally malicious, potentially compromising the entire application. A malicious fairing could intercept requests, modify responses, or access sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application, including data breaches, remote code execution, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Rocket Component:** `fairing` feature, including custom fairings and third-party fairings used by the application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly vet all third-party fairings before using them, checking for security audits and known vulnerabilities.
        *   Follow secure coding practices when developing custom fairings, including input validation and output encoding.
        *   Implement a mechanism to verify the integrity of fairings if possible.
        *   Regularly update fairings to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Exposure of Configuration Secrets](./threats/exposure_of_configuration_secrets.md)

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Configuration Secrets
    *   **Description:** Sensitive configuration information (API keys, database credentials, etc.) might be stored insecurely within the application's configuration files (e.g., `Rocket.toml`) or environment variables, making them accessible to attackers.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of sensitive credentials, leading to unauthorized access to external services or internal resources.
    *   **Affected Rocket Component:** Configuration loading mechanisms within Rocket, potentially interacting with `Rocket.toml` or environment variable access.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in configuration files.
        *   Utilize secure methods for managing secrets, such as environment variables (when deployed securely), dedicated secrets management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault), or encrypted configuration files.
        *   Ensure that configuration files containing sensitive information are not committed to version control systems.
