*   **Threat:** Insecure Deserialization of Request Data
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input data (e.g., JSON, form data) that, when deserialized by **Rocket's data binding mechanisms**, leads to arbitrary code execution on the server. The attacker might manipulate serialized objects to inject malicious code or trigger unintended actions during deserialization.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the server, including data breaches, system takeover, and denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** **Rocket's data extraction and binding features**, specifically the functions handling deserialization based on content type (e.g., `Json`, `Form`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly validate all deserialized data before use.
        *   Prefer using specific deserialization libraries with known security best practices and avoid default implementations if they are known to have vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement strict type checking and input sanitization.
        *   Consider using a "defense in depth" approach by combining deserialization with other security measures.
        *   Regularly update Rocket and its dependencies to patch known deserialization vulnerabilities.

*   **Threat:** Route Parameter Injection leading to unintended actions
    *   **Description:** An attacker manipulates route parameters (e.g., `/users/<id>`) to inject unexpected or malicious values. This could lead to accessing or modifying resources they shouldn't have access to, triggering unintended application logic, or causing errors. For example, an attacker might try to access `/users/admin` if the application doesn't properly validate the `id`. This directly involves **Rocket's routing system**.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data or functionality, data modification, or application errors.
    *   **Affected Component:** **Rocket's routing system** and route handlers that extract and use path parameters.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict validation and sanitization for all route parameters.
        *   Use type hints and guards provided by Rocket to enforce expected data types for route parameters.
        *   Avoid directly using route parameters in database queries or sensitive operations without validation.
        *   Employ principle of least privilege when designing route access controls.

*   **Threat:** Malicious Fairing Exploitation
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability within a custom or third-party **Rocket fairing** (middleware). This could involve the fairing logging sensitive information, introducing new vulnerabilities, bypassing security checks implemented in other parts of the application, or performing malicious actions on each request or response. **Fairings are a core component of Rocket.**
    *   **Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the fairing's functionality, including information disclosure, privilege escalation, and denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** **Rocket's fairing system** and the specific vulnerable fairing.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and audit all custom fairings for potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Use well-established and trusted fairings from reputable sources.
        *   Keep fairing dependencies up to date.
        *   Implement proper input validation and output encoding within fairings.
        *   Consider the order of fairings and their potential interactions.
