Detailed Breakdown of High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:

* Exploit Rocket-Specific Weaknesses [CRITICAL NODE]:
    * This represents the overarching category of attacks targeting vulnerabilities within the Rocket framework itself. Successfully exploiting these weaknesses is crucial for achieving the attacker's goal.

* Exploit Routing Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:
    * This category focuses on manipulating or exploiting Rocket's routing mechanism.
        * Route Overlap/Shadowing [HIGH RISK PATH]:
            * Attack Vector: Defining routes that unintentionally overlap or shadow intended routes.
            * Impact: Leads to unexpected handler execution, potentially granting access to unintended functionality or data.
        * Path Traversal via Route Parameters [HIGH RISK PATH]:
            * Attack Vector: Crafting requests with manipulated path parameters.
            * Impact: Allows access to files or resources outside the intended scope, potentially exposing sensitive information.

* Exploit Data Binding Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:
    * This category focuses on exploiting how Rocket binds data from requests to application logic.
        * Injection Attacks via Data Binding [HIGH RISK PATH]:
            * SQL Injection via Form/Query Parameters [HIGH RISK PATH]:
                * Attack Vector: Injecting malicious SQL code through data bound from form or query parameters.
                * Impact: Can lead to full database compromise, allowing the attacker to read, modify, or delete data.
            * Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Data Binding [HIGH RISK PATH]:
                * Attack Vector: Injecting malicious scripts through data bound from form or query parameters.
                * Impact: Can lead to account compromise, data theft, or redirection to malicious sites.

* Bypass Security Mechanisms (Guards) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:
    * This category focuses on circumventing Rocket's guard system, which is used for authorization and authentication.
        * Logic Flaws in Custom Guards [HIGH RISK PATH]:
            * Attack Vector: Exploiting vulnerabilities in the logic of custom `Guard` implementations.
            * Impact: Allows unauthorized access to protected resources.
        * Inconsistent Guard Application [HIGH RISK PATH]:
            * Attack Vector: Identifying routes where guards are not consistently applied.
            * Impact: Enables unauthorized access to protected resources due to missing security checks.

* Exploit Error Handling [HIGH RISK PATH]:
    * This category focuses on leveraging Rocket's error handling mechanisms for malicious purposes.
        * Information Disclosure via Error Messages [HIGH RISK PATH]:
            * Attack Vector: Triggering errors that reveal sensitive information in error messages or stack traces.
            * Impact: Can expose sensitive details about the application, its configuration, or underlying data.

* Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:
    * This category focuses on exploiting insecure configurations of the Rocket framework.
        * Insecure Default Configurations [HIGH RISK PATH]:
            * Attack Vector: Relying on default Rocket configurations that have security implications.
            * Impact: Can lead to various vulnerabilities, such as CORS bypass or exposure of sensitive endpoints.
        * Misconfiguration Leading to Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]:
            * Attack Vector: Incorrectly configuring Rocket settings.
            * Impact: Can introduce vulnerabilities like allowing insecure TLS versions or exposing sensitive information.
