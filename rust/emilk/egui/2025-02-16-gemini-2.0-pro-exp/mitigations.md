## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Text Input Filtering and Sanitization (within `egui`)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_text_input_filtering_and_sanitization__within__egui__.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Strict Text Input Filtering and Sanitization (within `egui`)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify `egui` Input Fields:** Locate all instances within your `egui` code where user input is accepted. This primarily involves `TextEdit` widgets, but also includes any custom input handling you've implemented.
    2.  **Define Allowed Character Sets:** For *each* `egui` input field, determine the precise set of acceptable characters.  A username field might allow alphanumerics and underscores; a numeric field would only allow digits.
    3.  **Implement Filtering *Within* `egui`:**  Inside the `egui` frame rendering loop (where the input widget is used), add code to filter the input string *before* it's used for *anything* (display, storage, processing).  This can be done:
        *   **Character-by-character:** Iterate through the input string and reject any character not in the allowed set.
        *   **Regular Expressions:** Use regular expressions to enforce more complex input patterns.
        *   **Combination:** Use a combination of both techniques for optimal validation.
    4.  **Enforce Length Limits (using `egui` features):** Utilize `egui`'s built-in features to set maximum lengths for text input fields.  This often involves the `TextEdit::desired_width` property, but you might need additional custom logic to truncate input if it exceeds the limit.
    5.  **Escape/Encode Output *Before* `egui` Display:** Before displaying *any* user-provided data back to the user *within `egui`*, escape or encode it appropriately. Since `egui` doesn't provide built-in escaping, you *must* do this manually. For web contexts, use a robust HTML escaping function (e.g., from a library like `html-escape` in Rust). For other contexts, use the appropriate escaping mechanism for that output format.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):** Prevents malicious JavaScript from being injected through `egui` input fields and executed.  The output escaping step is *critical* here.
    *   **Code Injection (High Severity):** If (and you should *avoid* this) user input is used to construct code, filtering within `egui` prevents malicious code injection.
    *   **Buffer Overflow (Medium to High Severity):** `egui`'s length limits, combined with your own checks, help prevent buffer overflows.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Length limits and filtering within `egui` prevent extremely large inputs that could cause performance issues.
    *   **Data Corruption (Medium Severity):** Prevents invalid data from being processed by the `egui` portion of your application.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Significantly reduces XSS risk *within the `egui` context*.  Proper escaping is essential.
    *   **Code Injection:** Significantly reduces risk, *provided user input is not used to generate code*.
    *   **Buffer Overflow:** Reduces risk, especially when combined with secure memory management.
    *   **DoS:** Reduces risk of certain DoS attacks targeting `egui` input.
    *   **Data Corruption:** Reduces risk of `egui`-related data corruption.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic length limits on most `TextEdit` widgets in `src/ui/input_forms.rs`.
    *   HTML escaping when displaying user names in `src/ui/user_profile.rs` *before* passing to `egui`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Character-level filtering is missing for several `egui` input fields: "search" (`src/ui/search_bar.rs`) and "comment" (`src/ui/comment_section.rs`).
    *   Regular expression validation is not used anywhere within the `egui` code.
    *   Output escaping is inconsistent. Missing in `src/ui/message_display.rs` *before* displaying user messages with `egui`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure State Management (within `egui`)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_state_management__within__egui__.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Secure State Management (within `egui`)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Mutable `egui` State:** Analyze your `egui` code to identify all variables and data structures that are modified during the `egui` rendering loop or between frames.
    2.  **Minimize `egui` Mutability:** Refactor your `egui` code to use immutable data structures whenever possible. Instead of modifying a `Vec` in place within the `egui` loop, create a new `Vec` with the changes.
    3.  **Isolate `egui` State:** Encapsulate `egui`-related state within specific `egui` components or modules. Avoid using global variables that are accessible from within the `egui` rendering loop.
    4.  **Clear Sensitive `egui` Data:** If sensitive data (passwords, tokens) is *temporarily* stored within `egui`'s state (e.g., during input in a `TextEdit`), explicitly overwrite that data in memory with zeros or random characters *immediately* after it's no longer needed, *within the same frame*. Don't rely on garbage collection. Use a secure memory wiping function if available.
    5. **Validate `egui::data`:** If you use `egui::data` to store data that persists between frames, *validate and sanitize* that data *every time* it is loaded and used within the `egui` rendering loop, especially if it originates from user input.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Tampering (Medium to High Severity):** Reduces the risk of attackers modifying `egui`-related application state.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium to High Severity):** Clearing sensitive data prevents leaks from `egui`'s temporary memory.
    *   **Logic Errors (Variable Severity):** Minimizing mutable state within `egui` improves code clarity and reduces vulnerability risks.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Tampering:** Reduces the attack surface for tampering with `egui`-managed data.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Significantly reduces risk of sensitive data leaks from `egui`'s in-memory state.
    *   **Logic Errors:** Improves `egui` code maintainability and reduces vulnerability introduction.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Some use of immutable data structures in `src/data/models.rs`, but this is not directly within the `egui` rendering logic.
    *   Sensitive data (passwords) are cleared after use in the `egui` login form (`src/ui/login_form.rs`).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Significant mutable state is still used within `src/ui/main_window.rs` for handling user interactions and data updates within the `egui` loop.  This needs refactoring.
    *   `egui::data` is used in `src/app_state.rs`, but the data is *not* validated *within the `egui` loop* when it's loaded and used.
    *   No secure memory wiping function is used; only simple overwriting.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Rendering and Output Handling (within `egui`)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_rendering_and_output_handling__within__egui__.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Rendering and Output Handling (within `egui`)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Avoid Dynamic `egui` Code Generation:** *Never* use user input to dynamically construct `egui` code or UI elements.  Do not use functions like `eval()` or string interpolation to create `egui` widgets based on user-provided data.  This is a fundamental security principle.
    2.  **Sanitize HTML *Before* `egui` Rendering (if used):** If you utilize `egui`'s limited HTML rendering capabilities (e.g., for rich text), you *must* use a dedicated HTML sanitization library (like `ammonia` in Rust) to sanitize *any* user-provided input that might be included in the HTML.  Do this *before* passing the string to `egui`.
    3. **Contextual Output Encoding *Before* `egui`:** Always encode or escape output based on the context where it is displayed *before* passing it to `egui` for rendering. Use HTML escaping for web contexts, and appropriate encoding for other output formats.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):** HTML sanitization and output encoding *before* passing data to `egui` are critical.
    *   **Code Injection (High Severity):** Avoiding dynamic `egui` code generation eliminates this risk within the `egui` context.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Sanitization and encoding drastically reduce XSS risk related to `egui`'s rendering.
    *   **Code Injection:** Eliminates the risk if dynamic `egui` code generation is avoided.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Dynamic `egui` code generation is *not* used.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   HTML sanitization is *not* implemented. Any user input displayed as rich text within `egui` should be sanitized *before* being passed to `egui`. This is missing in `src/ui/rich_text_display.rs`.
    * Contextual output encoding is not consistently used *before* data is given to `egui`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Robust Error Handling (within `egui`)](./mitigation_strategies/robust_error_handling__within__egui__.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Robust Error Handling (within `egui`)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Avoid Exposing Internal `egui` Errors:** Never display raw error messages, stack traces, or internal `egui` implementation details directly to the user *from within your `egui` code*.
    2.  **Use Generic Error Messages (within `egui`):** If an error occurs within your `egui` logic, display a user-friendly, generic error message *using `egui` widgets*. The message should not reveal sensitive information.
    3.  **Handle All `egui` Errors:** Use `Result` types (or the appropriate error handling mechanism for your language) to handle all potential errors that could occur within your `egui` code. Don't let errors propagate unhandled.
    4. **Fail Gracefully within `egui`:** Ensure that your `egui` code handles errors gracefully and doesn't cause the entire UI to crash or become unresponsive. Provide fallback UI elements or states where appropriate.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Prevents attackers from gaining information about `egui`'s internal workings or your application's structure.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Graceful error handling within `egui` prevents UI crashes.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Reduces risk of information leakage through `egui`-generated error messages.
    *   **DoS:** Improves `egui` UI resilience to errors.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Most `egui` code uses `Result` types.
    *   Generic error messages are displayed to the user in some `egui` contexts.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Some error handling paths within the `egui` code still expose internal error messages (this needs auditing).
    *   Fallback UI elements are not consistently implemented for error conditions within `egui`.
