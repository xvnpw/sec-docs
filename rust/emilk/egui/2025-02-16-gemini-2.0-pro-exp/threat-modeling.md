# Threat Model Analysis for emilk/egui

## Threat: [UI Spoofing via Rendering Manipulation](./threats/ui_spoofing_via_rendering_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in `egui`'s text rendering or layout engine to subtly alter the appearance of UI elements.  They might shift character positions in a password field, change button colors, or otherwise manipulate the *intended* rendering of `egui` components to mislead the user. This is *not* general XSS; it requires a bug in `egui`'s rendering.
    *   **Impact:** Users could be tricked into entering sensitive information into incorrect fields, clicking malicious buttons, or misinterpreting the UI, leading to credential theft, unauthorized actions, or data breaches.
    *   **Affected `egui` Component:**
        *   `egui::Painter`: Core rendering component.
        *   `egui::FontDefinitions`, `egui::FontData`, `egui::text::LayoutJob`: Font and text layout.
        *   `egui::Style`: Styling system vulnerabilities.
        *   Widgets like `egui::TextEdit`, `egui::Button`, `egui::Label` (if they have rendering-specific bugs).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Code Review:** Thorough manual review of `egui::Painter` and text rendering, focusing on off-by-one errors, clipping, and Unicode handling.
        *   **Fuzz Testing:** Extensive fuzzing of text rendering and layout with diverse inputs, including unusual Unicode, large fonts, and edge-case layouts.
        *   **Visual Regression Testing:** Automated tests to detect subtle UI rendering changes.

## Threat: [Input Injection via Widget Vulnerabilities](./threats/input_injection_via_widget_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a bug in an `egui` input widget (e.g., `TextEdit`, `Slider`, `DragValue`) to inject unexpected values or trigger unintended behavior *within the Wasm module*. This is *not* about bypassing application validation; it's about flaws in how the widget handles input *before* passing it to the application (e.g., a buffer overflow in `TextEdit`).
    *   **Impact:** Manipulation of application state, bypassing input validation, triggering unexpected code paths, or potential denial-of-service.
    *   **Affected `egui` Component:**
        *   `egui::TextEdit`: Text input vulnerabilities (buffer overflows, encoding issues, sanitization).
        *   `egui::Slider`, `egui::DragValue`: Numerical input vulnerabilities (overflows, range clamping).
        *   `egui::ComboBox`, `egui::RadioButton`: Selection input vulnerabilities.
        *   `egui::widgets::text_edit::TextBuffer`: Internal buffer used by `TextEdit`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation (within `egui`):** Each widget must perform robust validation *before* updating state or passing data.  Includes length checks, character restrictions, and range validation.
        *   **Fuzz Testing:** Fuzz each input widget with diverse inputs, including boundary values, invalid characters, and long strings.
        *   **Memory Safety (Rust):** Leverage Rust's features to prevent buffer overflows. Minimize `unsafe` code in input handling.
        *   **Defensive Programming:** Use assertions and defensive techniques to catch unexpected input or state inconsistencies.

## Threat: [Memory Corruption within `egui`](./threats/memory_corruption_within__egui_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a memory safety vulnerability (e.g., buffer overflow, use-after-free) *within the `egui` library itself* to corrupt the Wasm module's memory. This could be in `unsafe` Rust code, a dependency, or a rare compiler bug.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution *within the Wasm sandbox*, giving the attacker complete control of the application's behavior (though still sandboxed).
    *   **Affected `egui` Component:** Potentially any component, especially those using `unsafe` or interacting with external libraries (font rendering, image loading).
        *   `egui::Painter`: If it uses `unsafe` for optimization.
        *   Components using external crates with vulnerabilities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Minimize `unsafe`:** Drastically reduce `unsafe` code in `egui`. Justify and review each `unsafe` block thoroughly.
        *   **Dependency Auditing:** Regularly audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities (using `cargo audit`, `cargo crev`).
        *   **Fuzz Testing (Memory Safety):** Use fuzzers designed for memory safety (AFL, libFuzzer, Honggfuzz).
        *   **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools to find potential memory safety issues.
        *   **Compiler Updates:** Keep the Rust compiler and toolchain up-to-date.
