## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_handling_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

- Focus: Exploiting weaknesses in how the application processes user-provided data.
- Attack Vectors:
    - Text Input Injection (CRITICAL NODE): Injecting malicious text to manipulate the UI or potentially execute code.
        - UI Element Manipulation: Injecting specific characters or patterns to alter the layout or behavior of UI elements, misleading the user.
    - State Corruption via Input Manipulation: Exploiting input handling flaws to directly modify the application's internal state, bypassing security checks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Text Input Injection (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/text_input_injection__critical_node_.md)

UI Element Manipulation: Injecting specific characters or patterns to alter the layout or behavior of UI elements, misleading the user.

## Attack Tree Path: [State Corruption via Input Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/state_corruption_via_input_manipulation.md)

Exploiting input handling flaws to directly modify the application's internal state, bypassing security checks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit State Management Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_state_management_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

- Focus: Targeting vulnerabilities in how the application manages its internal data and state.
- Attack Vectors:
    - State Corruption via Input Manipulation: As described above, leveraging input handling weaknesses to corrupt the application's state.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Interoperability Vulnerabilities (if applicable) (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_interoperability_vulnerabilities__if_applicable___critical_node_.md)

- Focus: Exploiting weaknesses arising from the interaction of the egui application with other systems.
- Attack Vectors:
    - WASM Boundary Issues (if used in a web context): Exploiting vulnerabilities when the egui application runs in a web browser via WASM.
        - Malicious communication with JavaScript (if applicable): Injecting malicious data into the communication channel between WASM and JavaScript to execute arbitrary code or compromise the web page.

## Attack Tree Path: [WASM Boundary Issues (if used in a web context)](./attack_tree_paths/wasm_boundary_issues__if_used_in_a_web_context_.md)

Malicious communication with JavaScript (if applicable): Injecting malicious data into the communication channel between WASM and JavaScript to execute arbitrary code or compromise the web page.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Widget-Specific Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_widget-specific_vulnerabilities.md)

- Focus: Targeting vulnerabilities within the UI widgets themselves.
- Attack Vectors:
    - Vulnerabilities in Custom Widgets: Exploiting logic flaws or memory safety issues in developer-created UI widgets.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Widgets](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerabilities_in_custom_widgets.md)

Exploiting logic flaws or memory safety issues in developer-created UI widgets.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Build/Dependency Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_builddependency_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

- Focus: Exploiting vulnerabilities introduced through the application's build process or its dependencies.
- Attack Vectors:
    - Use of Vulnerable Egui Version: Leveraging known security flaws present in the specific version of the egui library being used.

## Attack Tree Path: [Use of Vulnerable Egui Version](./attack_tree_paths/use_of_vulnerable_egui_version.md)

Leveraging known security flaws present in the specific version of the egui library being used.
