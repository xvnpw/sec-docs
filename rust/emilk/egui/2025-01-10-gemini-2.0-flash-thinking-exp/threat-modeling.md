# Threat Model Analysis for emilk/egui

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Input](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_unsanitized_input.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious scripts into data that is subsequently rendered by `egui` without proper sanitization. This happens when the application displays user-generated content or data from external sources directly through `egui` elements. The attacker crafts input containing `<script>` tags or event handlers that execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser when the `egui` interface is displayed.

**Impact:** The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser within the context of the application. This could lead to session hijacking, stealing sensitive information, defacing the UI, redirecting the user to malicious sites, or performing actions on behalf of the user without their knowledge.

**Affected Egui Component:** `egui::widgets::Label`, `egui::text_edit::TextEdit`, potentially custom widgets that render text directly without proper escaping.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement proper HTML escaping for all user-provided data or data from untrusted sources before displaying it in `egui` elements.
* Use `egui`'s built-in text formatting capabilities carefully, ensuring they don't introduce vulnerabilities.
* Avoid directly rendering raw HTML within `egui` if possible. If necessary, use a carefully vetted and secure HTML sanitization library before passing data to `egui`.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Excessive Rendering Operations](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_excessive_rendering_operations.md)

**Description:** An attacker triggers actions within the `egui` interface that lead to an excessive number of rendering operations or the creation of a large number of UI elements. This could be achieved by manipulating application state or sending malicious requests that cause `egui` to perform computationally expensive rendering tasks *within the `egui` library itself*.

**Impact:** The application becomes slow and unresponsive, potentially leading to a crash due to memory exhaustion or excessive CPU usage *within the client's browser due to `egui`'s operations*.

**Affected Egui Component:** The core `egui` rendering pipeline and potentially specific widgets that are computationally expensive to render.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Optimize `egui` rendering logic and minimize unnecessary redraws within the application's usage of `egui`.
* Implement mechanisms to limit the number of UI elements or rendering operations that can be triggered by user actions or external events *within the application's logic interacting with `egui`*.
* Report performance bottlenecks in `egui` rendering to the `egui` developers.
