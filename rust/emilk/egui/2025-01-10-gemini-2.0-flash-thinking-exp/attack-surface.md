# Attack Surface Analysis for emilk/egui

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Input Injection within UI Elements](./attack_surfaces/malicious_input_injection_within_ui_elements.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious strings into UI elements designed to display user-provided content, potentially leading to unintended behavior or code execution by the rendering backend or host system.

**How Egui Contributes:** `egui` is directly responsible for rendering text and other content within its UI elements. If the application doesn't sanitize user input before displaying it via `egui`, malicious escape sequences or control characters could be interpreted by the underlying rendering engine or terminal.

**Example:** An application displays user-provided notes in an `egui` text area. A malicious user enters a string containing ANSI escape codes that, when rendered, could manipulate the terminal's display or even execute commands if the terminal emulator is vulnerable.

**Impact:** UI corruption, potential command execution (if the rendering context allows), information disclosure.

**Risk Severity:** High.

## Attack Surface: [Rendering Backend Exploits Triggered by Egui](./attack_surfaces/rendering_backend_exploits_triggered_by_egui.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in the underlying rendering backend used by `egui` (e.g., `wgpu`, `glow`) are exploited through specific rendering instructions generated by `egui`.

**How Egui Contributes:** `egui` translates its UI descriptions into commands for the rendering backend. If `egui` generates specific sequences of rendering commands based on user input or application state, and the backend has a vulnerability in handling those commands, it can be exploited.

**Example:** A carefully crafted UI layout or a specific combination of `egui` drawing operations triggers a buffer overflow or other memory corruption issue in the `wgpu` rendering library.

**Impact:** Application crash, arbitrary code execution (depending on the vulnerability in the rendering backend).

**Risk Severity:** High.

## Attack Surface: [State Manipulation via UI Interactions](./attack_surfaces/state_manipulation_via_ui_interactions.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates the application's state by interacting with `egui` UI elements in unexpected ways, potentially bypassing security checks or triggering unintended actions.

**How Egui Contributes:** `egui` provides mechanisms for users to interact with the application's state through buttons, sliders, checkboxes, etc. If the application logic doesn't properly validate state changes triggered by `egui` interactions, it can be exploited.

**Example:** A game uses an `egui` slider to control the player's health. A vulnerability in the game's logic might allow a player to set their health to an invalid or excessively high value by manipulating the slider beyond its intended range.

**Impact:** Logic errors, security bypasses, data corruption.

**Risk Severity:** High.

## Attack Surface: [Callback Vulnerabilities in Egui Event Handlers](./attack_surfaces/callback_vulnerabilities_in_egui_event_handlers.md)

**Description:**  Vulnerabilities in the code executed within `egui`'s event handlers or callbacks can be exploited to perform unintended actions.

**How Egui Contributes:** `egui` relies on developers defining callbacks for UI events (e.g., button clicks, text input changes). If these callbacks contain security flaws, they can be exploited.

**Example:** A button click handler in an `egui` application directly executes a shell command based on user input from a nearby text field without proper sanitization.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, privilege escalation, data breaches.

**Risk Severity:** Critical.

## Attack Surface: [Data Deserialization Issues with Egui State Persistence](./attack_surfaces/data_deserialization_issues_with_egui_state_persistence.md)

**Description:** If the application uses `egui` to save and load UI state (e.g., window positions, settings), vulnerabilities in the deserialization process could allow an attacker to inject malicious data.

**How Egui Contributes:** `egui` provides mechanisms for saving and loading UI state. If the format used for serialization is not secure or the deserialization process is flawed, it can be an attack vector.

**Example:** An application saves the positions of `egui` windows to a file. A malicious user modifies this file to contain crafted data that, when loaded by the application, causes a buffer overflow or other memory corruption.

**Impact:** Application crash, arbitrary code execution.

**Risk Severity:** High.
