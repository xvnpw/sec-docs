## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_input_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers target input fields, specifically text fields, to inject malicious code or commands.
*   **Mechanism:**  The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user input received through egui's text input elements. This allows attackers to embed scripts (for Cross-Site Scripting - XSS) or commands (for command injection) that are then processed by the application or the user's browser.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Execution of malicious scripts in the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, or defacement of the application.
    *   **Command Injection:** Execution of arbitrary commands on the server hosting the application, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
    *   **SQL Injection (if input is used in database queries):** Manipulation of database queries, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Malicious Input via Text Fields](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__malicious_input_via_text_fields.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Directly injecting malicious content into text fields.
*   **Mechanism:** Lack of input sanitization and validation allows attackers to insert harmful payloads.
*   **Potential Impact:** As described in the "Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities" path, this can lead to XSS, command injection, or SQL injection.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Bypassing Input Validation](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__bypassing_input_validation.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Circumventing the input validation mechanisms implemented in the egui UI.
*   **Mechanism:** Attackers might directly manipulate network requests (in web-based applications), use browser developer tools, or exploit vulnerabilities in the client-side code to send malicious data to the application's backend, bypassing the UI-level checks.
*   **Potential Impact:** If successful, attackers can submit data that would normally be blocked by the UI, potentially exploiting vulnerabilities in the application logic that were intended to be protected by the validation rules. This can lead to any vulnerability that the bypassed validation was meant to prevent.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Dependencies or Integration Issues](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_dependencies_or_integration_issues.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Leveraging vulnerabilities present in the third-party libraries that egui depends on.
*   **Mechanism:** Egui, like most software, relies on external libraries. If these dependencies have known security flaws, attackers can exploit them to compromise the application. This often involves using publicly known exploits for those vulnerabilities.
*   **Potential Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency. It could range from denial of service and information disclosure to remote code execution, potentially leading to full system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Vulnerabilities in Egui's Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__vulnerabilities_in_egui's_dependencies.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Specifically targeting known weaknesses in egui's dependent libraries.
*   **Mechanism:** Attackers identify and exploit publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in egui's dependencies.
*   **Potential Impact:** Similar to the "Exploit Dependencies or Integration Issues" node, the impact is determined by the nature of the dependency vulnerability, potentially leading to severe security breaches.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit WASM Integration (If Applicable)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_wasm_integration__if_applicable_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting weaknesses in the communication and data exchange between the WASM module (where egui might be running) and the JavaScript environment in a web browser.
*   **Mechanism:** Vulnerabilities can arise from improper handling of data types, lack of validation, or insecure interfaces when passing data between WASM and JavaScript. Attackers might manipulate data being passed across this boundary to trigger unexpected behavior or gain unauthorized access.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   **Data Corruption:** Modifying data in transit, leading to incorrect application state or behavior.
    *   **Code Execution within WASM:** Injecting malicious code that is executed within the WASM environment.
    *   **Escalation of Privileges:** Potentially gaining access to functionalities or data that should be restricted.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Manipulating Data Passed Between WASM and JavaScript](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__manipulating_data_passed_between_wasm_and_javascript.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Directly altering data as it's transferred between the WASM and JavaScript layers.
*   **Mechanism:** Attackers intercept or manipulate the data being exchanged, exploiting vulnerabilities in the communication interface.
*   **Potential Impact:** As described in the "Exploit WASM Integration" path, this can lead to data corruption or code execution within the WASM environment.
