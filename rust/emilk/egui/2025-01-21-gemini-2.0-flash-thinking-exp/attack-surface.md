# Attack Surface Analysis for emilk/egui

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Input via UI Elements](./attack_surfaces/malicious_input_via_ui_elements.md)

*   **Description:**  The application processes user input received through `egui` UI elements (text fields, sliders, etc.) without proper validation or sanitization, leading to potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Egui Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `egui` provides the framework for creating interactive UI elements that accept user input. The application's reliance on this input creates an entry point for malicious data.
    *   **Example:** A user enters a specially crafted string into an `egui` text input field that is then used by the application to construct a command-line argument without sanitization, leading to command injection.
    *   **Impact:**  Command injection, data corruption, unexpected application behavior, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all data received from `egui` input elements. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases. Avoid directly executing user-provided input as commands.
        *   **Users:**  Be cautious about the data you enter into application UI elements, especially if the application's behavior seems unpredictable.

## Attack Surface: [State Manipulation through UI Interactions](./attack_surfaces/state_manipulation_through_ui_interactions.md)

*   **Description:**  A malicious actor manipulates the application's state by interacting with `egui` UI elements in unexpected ways, leading to unintended consequences.
    *   **How Egui Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `egui` allows users to interact with the application's state through UI elements. If the application's state management is not robust, these interactions can be exploited.
    *   **Example:**  A user manipulates a series of `egui` checkboxes and sliders in a specific order to trigger a logic flaw in the application that grants them unauthorized access or privileges.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access, data corruption, unexpected application behavior.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust state management with proper validation and authorization checks for state transitions triggered by UI interactions. Avoid relying solely on the UI for enforcing business logic. Implement server-side validation if applicable.
        *   **Users:**  Be mindful of the actions you take within the application's UI and avoid performing actions that seem to have unintended or unexpected consequences.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Egui Integration Code](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_egui_integration_code.md)

*   **Description:**  The application implements custom logic or integrations with `egui` that contain security vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Egui Contributes to the Attack Surface:** While `egui` itself might be secure, the way the application integrates and extends its functionality can introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:**  A custom painting function within `egui` uses user-provided data to determine drawing parameters without proper sanitization, leading to a buffer overflow.
    *   **Impact:**  Code execution, crashes, memory corruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Follow secure coding practices when implementing custom logic within the `egui` context. Thoroughly review and test any custom integrations. Be mindful of potential vulnerabilities when handling external data or performing complex operations within custom `egui` code.
        *   **Users:**  This is primarily a developer concern, but users can report unexpected behavior or crashes that might indicate underlying integration issues.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if Rendering Untrusted Content (Less Common in Typical Egui Use)](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__if_rendering_untrusted_content__less_common_in_typical_egui_use_.md)

*   **Description:** If the application uses `egui` to render untrusted HTML or other web content (less common in typical `egui` desktop applications but possible in web integrations), it could be vulnerable to XSS attacks.
    *   **How Egui Contributes to the Attack Surface:** If `egui`'s rendering capabilities are used to display content from external or untrusted sources without proper sanitization, it can become a vector for XSS.
    *   **Example:** An application using `egui` in a web context displays user-generated HTML within an `egui` element without sanitizing it, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript.
    *   **Impact:**  Execution of malicious scripts in the user's browser, session hijacking, data theft.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (in web contexts where this is applicable)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Avoid rendering untrusted content directly within `egui`. If necessary, implement strict content security policies (CSP) and thoroughly sanitize any external content before rendering. Use secure rendering mechanisms that prevent script execution.
        *   **Users:** Be cautious about interacting with applications that display content from untrusted sources.
