# Threat Model Analysis for emilk/egui

## Threat: [Malicious UI Rendering / UI Redressing](./threats/malicious_ui_rendering__ui_redressing.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate the application's state or data in a way that causes `egui` to render misleading or deceptive UI elements. This could trick users into performing unintended actions, such as clicking on fake buttons or entering information into fake input fields rendered by `egui`. The vulnerability lies in the application's logic allowing untrusted data to influence `egui`'s rendering without proper sanitization or validation.

**Impact:** Users might be tricked into performing actions they didn't intend, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized actions, or exposure of sensitive information (depending on the application's functionality).

**Affected Component:** `egui`'s rendering pipeline and the application's state management logic that directly feeds data to `egui` for rendering.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the application side *before* passing data to `egui` for rendering.
* Carefully design the UI and ensure that critical actions rendered by `egui` require explicit confirmation and are clearly distinguishable.
* Implement security measures to protect the application's state from unauthorized manipulation that could influence `egui` rendering.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via UI Elements](./threats/information_disclosure_via_ui_elements.md)

**Description:** If the application displays sensitive information through `egui` without proper access controls or sanitization, an attacker who gains unauthorized access to the application's UI rendered by `egui` could potentially view this information. This occurs when the application logic directly feeds sensitive data to `egui` for display without considering the user's privileges or the potential for information leakage through the UI.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information to unauthorized users, potentially leading to privacy breaches or security compromises.

**Affected Component:** `egui`'s rendering pipeline and the application's logic for deciding what data to display through `egui`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement proper access control mechanisms in the application logic to ensure that only authorized users can access the parts of the application and data rendered by `egui` that contain sensitive information.
* Avoid directly rendering sensitive data through `egui` without appropriate sanitization or masking at the application level *before* passing it to `egui`.
* Consider the principle of least privilege when deciding what information to display through `egui` to different users.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Custom `egui` Widgets or Integrations](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_custom__egui__widgets_or_integrations.md)

**Description:** If the application developers create custom `egui` widgets or integrate `egui` with other libraries or systems, vulnerabilities in this custom code or integration logic could be exploited. This could include issues like buffer overflows, incorrect memory management, or insecure handling of external data within the custom `egui` components.

**Impact:**  Depends on the nature of the vulnerability, but could range from application crashes and denial-of-service to arbitrary code execution within the WebAssembly environment (if applicable) or the host environment, directly stemming from flaws in the `egui` extension.

**Affected Component:** Custom `egui` widgets or the integration code that directly extends `egui`'s functionality.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical if it leads to code execution)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Follow secure coding practices when developing custom `egui` widgets or integrations.
* Conduct thorough testing and code reviews of custom `egui` code.
* Be cautious when integrating with external libraries within custom `egui` components and ensure they are from trusted sources and are regularly updated.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Layout Manipulation](./threats/denial_of_service_via_layout_manipulation.md)

**Description:** An attacker might be able to manipulate the application state to cause `egui` to perform extremely complex layout calculations, potentially leading to excessive CPU usage and a denial-of-service. This could involve creating deeply nested UI elements or elements with complex sizing constraints that overwhelm `egui`'s layout engine.

**Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive or crashes due to excessive CPU usage within `egui`'s layout calculations.

**Affected Component:** `egui`'s layout engine.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Design the UI to avoid excessively complex layouts within `egui`.
* Implement safeguards in the application logic to prevent the creation of UI structures within `egui` that could lead to layout performance issues.
* Monitor performance of `egui` rendering and identify potential layout bottlenecks. Consider limiting the complexity of UI elements rendered by `egui`.
