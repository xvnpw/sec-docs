## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization for `egui` UI Inputs](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization_for__egui__ui_inputs.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Input Validation and Sanitization for `egui` UI Inputs
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify `egui` input elements:** Review your `egui` application code and pinpoint all uses of `egui` UI elements that accept user input. This includes elements like `egui::TextEdit`, `egui::Slider`, `egui::DragValue`, and any custom widgets built using `egui` primitives that handle user input.
    2.  **Define validation rules for each `egui` input:** For every identified `egui` input element, determine the expected data type, format, valid range, and maximum length of the input.  For example, if a `egui::TextEdit` is intended for integer input between 1 and 100, define these constraints.
    3.  **Implement validation logic *after* receiving input from `egui`:** In your application code, immediately *after* retrieving user input from an `egui` element (e.g., when the user finishes editing a `TextEdit` or moves a Slider), implement validation checks. Use Rust's conditional statements or validation libraries to enforce the rules defined in the previous step.  If the input is invalid according to your rules, reject it.
    4.  **Provide user feedback within `egui` on invalid input:** When input validation fails, use `egui` UI elements to provide immediate feedback to the user. Display error messages directly within the `egui` UI, near the input element that caused the error, to guide the user to correct their input.
    5.  **Sanitize input *after* validation if needed for `egui` display:** If the validated user input is subsequently displayed back to the user within other `egui` elements (e.g., in labels or other text displays), sanitize it to prevent unexpected rendering issues within `egui`.  While `egui` is not HTML-based, encoding or escaping special characters can prevent potential misinterpretations by `egui`'s text rendering engine.
    6.  **Enforce input length limits in `egui` elements:** Utilize `egui`'s built-in features, such as `TextEdit::char_limit()`, to directly enforce maximum length limits on text inputs within the `egui` UI itself. This prevents users from entering excessively long strings directly in the UI, mitigating potential DoS risks related to input length.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Input Injection Exploits via UI (Low to Medium Severity):**  While `egui` itself is not directly vulnerable to typical web-based injection attacks, unsanitized input from `egui` elements, if used in backend commands or file operations, can lead to injection vulnerabilities *in the broader application context*.  Mitigation here reduces the risk of the application as a whole being vulnerable due to UI input.
    *   **Unexpected UI Behavior due to Malformed Input (Low Severity):**  Invalid or malformed input entered through `egui` elements could potentially cause unexpected behavior or rendering glitches within the `egui` UI itself, although this is less critical than security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Client-Side Denial of Service (DoS) via Input (Low Severity):**  Entering extremely long strings into `egui` text fields, if not limited, could potentially consume excessive client-side resources, leading to a localized denial of service for the `egui` application on the user's machine.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Input Injection Exploits via UI: Partially reduces risk by preventing UI from being a source of bad input for other parts of the application.
    *   Unexpected UI Behavior: Partially reduces risk.
    *   Client-Side DoS via Input: Partially reduces risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic type validation for numeric inputs in settings panels using `if let Ok(value) = input.parse::<i32>()` after `egui` input.
    *   Length limits on file path inputs in file selection dialogs using `text_edit.char_limit(256)` within `egui::TextEdit`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Sanitization of user-provided text *before* displaying it in other `egui` elements.
    *   Comprehensive validation logic for all `egui` text fields and input widgets across the application, including format and range checks.
    *   Consistent user feedback within `egui` UI for invalid input across all input elements.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dependency Management and Updates for `egui` and Related Crates](./mitigation_strategies/dependency_management_and_updates_for__egui__and_related_crates.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Dependency Management and Updates for `egui` and Related Crates
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Regularly check for `egui` updates:** Periodically check the official `egui` repository (https://github.com/emilk/egui) and crates.io for new releases of the `egui` crate. Stay informed about announcements and release notes specifically related to `egui`.
    2.  **Review `egui` release notes for security fixes:** When new `egui` versions are released, carefully review the release notes and changelogs, paying particular attention to any mentions of security fixes, vulnerability patches, or bug fixes that could have security implications.
    3.  **Update `egui` crate regularly:** Update the `egui` crate in your `Cargo.toml` file to the latest stable version. Use `cargo update egui` to update specifically the `egui` dependency.
    4.  **Monitor dependencies of `egui`:** Be aware that `egui` itself depends on other Rust crates. While `cargo audit` will check transitive dependencies, be mindful of the crates that `egui` directly depends on (listed in `egui`'s `Cargo.toml` on GitHub) and consider their security status as well.
    5.  **Use `cargo audit` to check `egui`'s dependency tree:** Utilize the `cargo audit` tool to scan your project's dependencies, including `egui` and all its transitive dependencies, for known security vulnerabilities. Integrate `cargo audit` into your development workflow and CI/CD pipeline to automate this process.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in `egui` Crate (High Severity):**  Outdated versions of the `egui` crate may contain security vulnerabilities that are specific to `egui`'s code and could be exploited in applications using it.
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Dependencies of `egui` (Medium to High Severity):**  Vulnerabilities in crates that `egui` depends on can indirectly affect the security of `egui` applications.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Vulnerabilities in `egui` Crate: Significantly reduces risk.
    *   Vulnerabilities in Dependencies of `egui`: Significantly reduces risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Occasional updates of `egui` and other dependencies using `cargo update`.
    *   Checking `egui` GitHub repository for new releases periodically.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Automated dependency vulnerability scanning using `cargo audit` specifically for `egui` and its dependencies in CI/CD.
    *   Systematic review of `egui` release notes and changelogs for security-related information.
    *   Proactive monitoring of security advisories related to `egui` and its direct dependencies.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Handling of User-Provided Content Rendered by `egui`](./mitigation_strategies/secure_handling_of_user-provided_content_rendered_by__egui_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Handling of User-Provided Content Rendered by `egui`
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify `egui` elements displaying user content:** Locate all `egui` UI elements in your application that are used to display user-provided content. This could include `egui::Label`, `egui::TextEdit` (in read-only mode), `egui::Image`, and custom widgets that render user data.
    2.  **Avoid directly rendering raw, untrusted content in `egui`:**  Refrain from directly passing raw, untrusted user-provided content to `egui` rendering functions without any processing.
    3.  **Encode user-provided text for `egui` display:** When displaying user-provided text in `egui` elements, ensure it is properly encoded or escaped to prevent unexpected rendering behavior or issues within `egui`. While `egui` is not susceptible to web-style XSS, encoding can prevent misinterpretations of special characters by `egui`'s text layout and rendering.
    4.  **Validate and process complex user content before `egui` rendering:** For more complex user-provided content types (like images, custom data visualized in charts, etc.) that are rendered using `egui`'s drawing capabilities or custom widgets, implement thorough validation and processing *before* passing this data to `egui` for rendering.
        *   **Image validation for `egui::Image`:** If displaying images using `egui::Image`, validate image file formats, sizes, and content to prevent issues with `egui`'s image handling or the underlying image decoding libraries it uses.
        *   **Data validation for custom `egui` rendering:** If you are rendering custom data visualizations using `egui`'s drawing API, validate the data to ensure it is within expected ranges and formats to prevent rendering errors or resource exhaustion within `egui`.
    5.  **Implement resource limits for `egui` content rendering:**  Set limits on the size and complexity of user-provided content that is rendered by `egui`. For example, limit the maximum size of images displayed in `egui::Image` or the maximum number of data points rendered in a custom chart widget to prevent resource exhaustion during `egui` rendering.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Rendering Issues/Unexpected UI in `egui` (Low to Medium Severity):**  Malicious or malformed user content could cause unexpected rendering behavior, visual glitches, or layout problems within the `egui` UI.
    *   **Client-Side Resource Exhaustion via `egui` Rendering (Low Severity):**  Displaying excessively large or complex user content through `egui` rendering could consume excessive client-side resources (CPU, memory, GPU), potentially leading to performance degradation or a localized denial of service of the `egui` application on the user's machine.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Rendering Issues/Unexpected UI in `egui`: Partially reduces risk.
    *   Client-Side Resource Exhaustion via `egui` Rendering: Partially reduces risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic image loading for `egui::Image` from user-selected files.
    *   No specific encoding or sanitization of user-provided text before displaying it in `egui` labels or text areas.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Encoding/escaping of user-provided text before rendering in `egui` elements.
    *   Robust validation of image files before displaying them using `egui::Image`.
    *   Resource limits on the size and complexity of user-provided content rendered by `egui`.
    *   Validation of data used in custom `egui` rendering operations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure State Management in `egui` UI](./mitigation_strategies/secure_state_management_in__egui__ui.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure State Management in `egui` UI
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Minimize sensitive data in `egui` UI state:** Avoid storing sensitive information (passwords, API keys, confidential data) directly within the application state that is directly managed and rendered by `egui` if possible. Keep sensitive data separate from the UI state when feasible.
    2.  **Encrypt sensitive data if stored in `egui` state:** If sensitive data must be part of the application state that is used by `egui` for rendering or UI logic, consider encrypting this data *before* storing it in the state. Decrypt it only when needed for display or processing within the UI logic, and handle decryption securely.
    3.  **Be mindful of `egui` state serialization (if implemented):** If your application implements state saving/loading and this state includes `egui` UI related data, ensure that the serialization process is secure. Avoid insecure serialization formats that could introduce vulnerabilities. If serializing sensitive data that is part of the `egui` state, encrypt it before serialization.
    4.  **Regularly review `egui` state management code:** Periodically review the code that manages the application state used by `egui`, looking for potential vulnerabilities related to how sensitive data is handled within the UI state, how state transitions are managed, and how state is persisted (if at all).
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exposure of Sensitive Data via UI State (Medium to High Severity):**  If sensitive data is stored insecurely within the application state that is directly used by `egui`, it could be unintentionally exposed through debugging tools, memory dumps, or if state persistence is compromised.
    *   **State Manipulation via UI State Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):**  Vulnerabilities in how `egui` UI state is managed could potentially be exploited to manipulate application behavior or bypass security checks if state transitions are not handled securely.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exposure of Sensitive Data via UI State: Significantly reduces risk.
    *   State Manipulation via UI State Vulnerabilities: Significantly reduces risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Application state is primarily in memory and used directly by `egui` for UI rendering and logic.
    *   No encryption or special handling of sensitive data within the `egui` application state.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Encryption of sensitive data if it were to be stored in the `egui` application state.
    *   Secure serialization mechanisms for `egui` application state if state persistence were to be implemented.
    *   Formal security review of `egui` state management logic.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Management and DoS Prevention in `egui` Applications](./mitigation_strategies/resource_management_and_dos_prevention_in__egui__applications.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Resource Management and DoS Prevention in `egui` Applications
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement rate limiting on UI interactions in `egui` (if applicable):** If your `egui` application is exposed to external networks or untrusted users and involves actions triggered by UI interactions that could be resource-intensive, consider implementing rate limiting or throttling on these UI interactions. For example, limit the frequency of button clicks that trigger backend requests or heavy computations.
    2.  **Optimize computationally expensive `egui` rendering or UI logic:** Identify computationally expensive rendering operations or UI logic within your `egui` application. Optimize these operations to reduce resource consumption. This could involve optimizing custom painting, reducing the complexity of UI layouts, or improving the efficiency of data processing performed within `egui`'s UI update loop.
    3.  **Limit complexity of user-driven `egui` operations:** For operations triggered by user interactions in the `egui` UI that can be computationally expensive (e.g., complex filtering, large data processing, heavy calculations), consider limiting the complexity or scope of these operations based on user input or system resources. For example, limit the maximum number of items that can be processed in response to a user action in the UI.
    4.  **Monitor resource usage of `egui` application:** Monitor the resource usage (CPU, memory, GPU) of your `egui` application, especially during user interactions and rendering updates. Use system monitoring tools to identify potential resource bottlenecks or excessive consumption related to `egui` usage.
    5.  **Handle resource exhaustion gracefully in `egui` context:** Implement error handling and graceful degradation mechanisms to handle situations where `egui` rendering or UI logic encounters resource exhaustion. Prevent application crashes and provide informative error messages within the `egui` UI if resource limits are reached, guiding the user to reduce the load or complexity of their actions.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Client-Side Denial of Service (DoS) via `egui` (Medium Severity):**  Attackers or even unintentional user actions could potentially overload the `egui` application on the client-side by triggering excessively resource-intensive UI operations or rendering, leading to a denial of service for the user.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion in `egui` Application (Medium Severity):**  Inefficient `egui` rendering or UI logic, or malicious input designed to trigger resource-intensive operations, can lead to resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, GPU) and application instability or crashes on the client side.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Client-Side Denial of Service (DoS) via `egui`: Significantly reduces risk.
    *   Resource Exhaustion in `egui` Application: Significantly reduces risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic performance optimizations for rendering complex `egui` UI elements.
    *   No specific rate limiting or throttling mechanisms for UI interactions within `egui`.
    *   Limited resource monitoring focused on general application performance, not specifically `egui`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Rate limiting or throttling for resource-intensive UI interactions within `egui`.
    *   Detailed resource monitoring specifically focused on `egui` rendering and UI logic performance.
    *   Graceful degradation mechanisms within the `egui` UI for resource exhaustion scenarios.
    *   Explicit limits on the complexity of user-triggered operations within `egui` to prevent resource overload.
