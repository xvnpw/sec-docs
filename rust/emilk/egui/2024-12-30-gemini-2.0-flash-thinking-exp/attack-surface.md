*   **Attack Surface:** Text Input Buffer Overflow
    *   **Description:**  The application fails to properly limit the size of text input received from `egui` text fields, leading to a buffer overflow when processing this input in the application's memory.
    *   **How Egui Contributes:** `egui` provides the text input widgets and the mechanism for retrieving the user-entered text. If the application doesn't check the length of this text before copying it into a fixed-size buffer, an overflow can occur.
    *   **Example:** A user enters an extremely long string into an `egui::TextEdit` field, and the application attempts to store this string in a fixed-size character array without checking its length.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, potential for arbitrary code execution if the overflow overwrites critical memory regions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement input validation with size limits before processing text received from `egui` text fields. Use data structures that automatically manage memory allocation (e.g., `String` in Rust) instead of fixed-size buffers.

*   **Attack Surface:** Injection Attacks via Text Input
    *   **Description:** Malicious input entered into `egui` text fields is used by the application in a way that allows for the execution of unintended commands or code (e.g., SQL injection, command injection).
    *   **How Egui Contributes:** `egui` provides the user interface elements (text fields) that can be the entry point for malicious data. The application's failure to sanitize or properly handle this input is the core issue, but `egui` facilitates the input.
    *   **Example:** A user enters a malicious SQL query into an `egui::TextEdit` field that is then used directly in a database query by the application without proper sanitization (e.g., escaping special characters).
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access to resources, potential for remote code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Sanitize user input received from `egui` before using it in sensitive operations (e.g., database queries, system calls). Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection. Avoid directly executing commands based on user input.

*   **Attack Surface:** Malicious File Paths via Drag and Drop
    *   **Description:** If the application accepts file paths from drag-and-drop events provided by `egui`, a malicious user could drag a path to a sensitive system file, potentially leading to unintended access or modification.
    *   **How Egui Contributes:** `egui` provides the drag-and-drop functionality and the mechanism for the application to receive the file paths.
    *   **Example:** A user drags a file path pointing to `/etc/passwd` onto an `egui` window, and the application attempts to read this file without proper validation.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, potential for data exfiltration or system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Validate and sanitize file paths received from `egui` drag-and-drop events. Restrict access to specific directories or file types. Consider sandboxing the application's file system access.

*   **Attack Surface:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via User Input (in Web Context)
    *   **Description:** If `egui` is used in a web context (e.g., compiled to WebAssembly), and the application displays user-provided content without proper sanitization, it can be vulnerable to XSS attacks.
    *   **How Egui Contributes:** `egui` renders the user interface, including displaying text that might originate from user input. If this rendering doesn't escape or sanitize HTML characters, malicious scripts can be injected.
    *   **Example:** A user enters `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` into an `egui::TextEdit` field, and the application displays this text directly in the web page without escaping, causing the script to execute in other users' browsers.
    *   **Impact:** Session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious websites, defacement.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  When using `egui` in a web context, ensure that all user-provided content displayed through `egui` is properly sanitized or escaped to prevent the execution of malicious scripts. Utilize browser security features like Content Security Policy (CSP).
