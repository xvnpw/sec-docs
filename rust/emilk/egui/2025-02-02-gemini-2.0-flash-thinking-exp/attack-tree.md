## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Client-Side Vulnerabilities in Egui Application -> Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities -> Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Egui Rendering -> Inject Malicious HTML/JavaScript through Egui Text Input -> Application fails to sanitize user input rendered by Egui [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_client-side_vulnerabilities_in_egui_application_-_exploit_input_handling_vuln_513f0349.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability arising from the application's failure to properly sanitize user-provided input before rendering it using Egui. An attacker injects malicious HTML or JavaScript code into an Egui text input field. If the application renders this input without sanitization, the malicious script will execute in the user's browser, within the context of the application.

*   **Critical Node:** Application fails to sanitize user input rendered by Egui

*   **Actionable Insight [CRITICAL]:** Implement robust input sanitization before rendering user-provided text with Egui. Use Egui's escaping features correctly.

*   **Estimations:**
    *   Likelihood: High
    *   Impact: Major
    *   Effort: Minimal
    *   Skill Level: Beginner
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Egui's Integration with Application Backend (if applicable) -> Data Injection via Egui Input to Backend -> Egui input fields are directly used in backend queries or commands without sanitization [CRITICAL NODE] -> Application backend is vulnerable to injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_egui's_integration_with_application_backend__if_applicable__-_data_injection__9e4ca823.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Data Injection vulnerability, specifically targeting backend systems through unsanitized input originating from Egui UI elements. An attacker manipulates Egui input fields to inject malicious commands or queries (e.g., SQL injection, command injection). If the application backend directly uses this input in database queries or system commands without proper sanitization and validation, it becomes vulnerable to injection attacks.

*   **Critical Nodes:**
    *   Egui input fields are directly used in backend queries or commands without sanitization
    *   Application backend is vulnerable to injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection)

*   **Actionable Insight [CRITICAL]:** While not directly an Egui vulnerability, Egui facilitates user input. Ensure all backend interactions based on Egui input are properly sanitized and validated on the server-side. Follow secure coding practices for backend development.

*   **Estimations:**
    *   Likelihood: High
    *   Impact: Critical
    *   Effort: Minimal
    *   Skill Level: Beginner
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
