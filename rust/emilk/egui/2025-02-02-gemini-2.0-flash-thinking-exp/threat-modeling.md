# Threat Model Analysis for emilk/egui

## Threat: [Input Injection via UI Elements](./threats/input_injection_via_ui_elements.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides malicious or excessively large input through `egui` UI elements like text fields. If the application backend is vulnerable and lacks proper input validation *after* receiving data from `egui`, this can lead to serious vulnerabilities. For example, an attacker might inject commands or exploit buffer overflows in the backend processing logic.
*   **Impact:** Application crash, denial of service, data corruption, remote code execution if backend vulnerabilities are exploited due to unsanitized input originating from `egui` UI.
*   **Egui Component Affected:** `egui` UI elements (TextEdit, Slider, etc.), specifically the data they provide to the application.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Crucially**, implement robust input validation and sanitization on the application side *after* receiving input from `egui` and *before* processing or passing it to backend systems.
    *   Limit input length in UI elements where appropriate to reduce the risk of buffer overflows in backend processing.
    *   Employ secure coding practices in backend input processing to prevent injection vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Input Processing Vulnerabilities within Egui (Library Bugs)](./threats/input_processing_vulnerabilities_within_egui__library_bugs_.md)

*   **Description:** Critical bugs or vulnerabilities might exist within `egui`'s input processing code itself. Attackers could craft specific, potentially malformed, input sequences or events that exploit these bugs. This could lead to memory corruption, unexpected program behavior, or even potentially arbitrary code execution if the vulnerability is severe enough.
*   **Impact:** Application crash, memory corruption, potential for arbitrary code execution, information disclosure depending on the nature of the vulnerability within `egui`.
*   **Egui Component Affected:** `egui` input handling modules, event processing logic, text input handling, potentially core library components involved in input management.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the exploitability and impact of the specific vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Immediately** update `egui` to the latest stable version as security patches are released.
    *   Actively monitor `egui`'s issue tracker, security advisories, and release notes for reported vulnerabilities and security updates.
    *   Report any suspected vulnerabilities in `egui`'s input processing to the `egui` development team promptly.
    *   For applications with stringent security requirements, consider performing security audits or fuzzing of `egui`'s input handling code to proactively identify potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Rendering Engine Vulnerabilities (Library Bugs)](./threats/rendering_engine_vulnerabilities__library_bugs_.md)

*   **Description:** Critical vulnerabilities could be present in `egui`'s rendering backend, particularly in its integration with graphics APIs like OpenGL or WebGL. Attackers could craft specific UI elements or rendering commands that trigger these vulnerabilities. Exploitation could lead to memory corruption within the rendering engine, application crashes, or in the most severe scenarios, potentially allow for escape from the rendering sandbox and exploitation of underlying system-level graphics drivers.
*   **Impact:** Application crash, memory corruption within the rendering process, potential for system-level exploitation through graphics driver vulnerabilities, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the user's system.
*   **Egui Component Affected:** `egui` rendering modules (`egui-wgpu`, `egui-glow`, or other rendering backends), integration with underlying graphics APIs (OpenGL, WebGL, etc.).
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the severity and exploitability of the rendering vulnerability, and potential for system-level impact).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Immediately** update `egui` to the latest stable version to benefit from security fixes in the rendering backend.
    *   Ensure users are using up-to-date graphics drivers and web browsers, as these often contain security patches for graphics-related vulnerabilities.
    *   Monitor `egui`'s issue tracker and security advisories for reports of rendering-related vulnerabilities.
    *   Report any suspected rendering vulnerabilities in `egui` to the development team.
    *   For high-security applications, consider using more robust and well-audited rendering backends if available and feasible.
