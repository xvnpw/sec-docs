# Attack Surface Analysis for emilk/egui

## Attack Surface: [Input Injection via Text Fields](./attack_surfaces/input_injection_via_text_fields.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities arising from processing user-provided text input from `egui` text fields without proper sanitization or validation, leading to backend injection attacks.
*   **Egui Contribution:** `egui` provides the text input widgets that are the entry point for user-supplied text. While `egui` itself is not vulnerable to XSS-style injection within the UI, it facilitates the collection of user input that can become the source of injection vulnerabilities in the application's backend if not handled securely.
*   **Example:** An application uses an `egui` text field to get user input for a database query. If the application directly embeds this input into an SQL query without sanitization, an attacker could use SQL injection techniques via the `egui` text field to manipulate the database.
*   **Impact:**  Database breaches, data modification, unauthorized data access, potential for command execution on the backend database server.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements:**  Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases to prevent SQL injection. Never directly embed user input into SQL queries.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Validate and sanitize user input received from `egui` text fields before using it in backend operations. Use appropriate encoding and escaping techniques for the target backend system (e.g., database, command line).
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the application's backend components operate with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of successful injection attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Clipboard Interaction Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/clipboard_interaction_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Risks associated with using `egui`'s clipboard interaction features, potentially allowing injection of malicious content into the application via copy/paste, leading to unexpected or harmful behavior when the application processes clipboard data.
*   **Egui Contribution:** `egui` provides functions to copy and paste text to/from the system clipboard. This feature, while useful, can be exploited if the application naively processes data pasted via `egui` without proper validation, as `egui` itself does not sanitize clipboard content.
*   **Example:** An application allows users to paste text into an `egui` text area that is then interpreted as commands or configuration data. An attacker could craft malicious commands or configuration and place them on the clipboard. If a user pastes this content into the `egui` application, it could lead to unintended actions or system compromise.
*   **Impact:**  Code execution, configuration manipulation, data injection, unexpected application behavior, potentially leading to system compromise depending on how the application processes pasted data.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Clipboard Data Validation:**  Treat all data pasted from the clipboard via `egui` as untrusted input. Implement strict validation and sanitization of clipboard data before processing it within the application.
    *   **Context-Specific Pasting:** If possible, limit clipboard pasting to specific contexts and data types. For example, if only plain text is expected, reject pasting of rich text or other formats.
    *   **User Confirmation for Sensitive Actions:** For actions triggered by pasted clipboard data that have security implications, require explicit user confirmation before execution to prevent accidental or malicious pasting attacks.
    *   **Disable Clipboard Feature (if unnecessary):** If clipboard functionality is not essential for the application's security-critical features, consider disabling or restricting `egui`'s clipboard interaction to reduce this attack surface.
