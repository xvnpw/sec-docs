# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for iced-rs/iced

## Mitigation Strategy: [Type-Safe Input Handling and Validation (Iced-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/type-safe_input_handling_and_validation__iced-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Iced Widget Events:** Utilize Iced's built-in widget events, such as `TextInput::on_input`, `Slider::on_change`, and similar events for other input widgets.  These events are *specific to Iced* and are the primary mechanism for reacting to user input.
    2.  **Message Passing:**  Within the event handlers (e.g., the closure passed to `on_input`), construct Iced messages that encapsulate the input data.  These messages are then passed to the `update` function.  This is the core Iced architecture.
    3.  **`update` Function Validation:**  Perform all type conversion (e.g., `string.parse::<u32>()`) and validation (range checks, length limits, etc.) *within the `update` function* after receiving the message.  This ensures that the application's state is only updated with valid data.
    4.  **Custom Widget `update`:** If you create *custom Iced widgets*, implement the validation logic within the `update` method of your custom widget's `Component` implementation.  This is crucial for maintaining consistency and security.
    5.  **Iced-Specific Error Display:** Use Iced's `Text` widget or other Iced UI elements to display error messages to the user if validation fails.  Do *not* update the application state if validation fails.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Logic Errors (Medium Severity):** Prevents Iced-specific logic errors caused by invalid data being processed by Iced widgets or the Iced rendering pipeline.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):**  By validating input *within the Iced event loop*, you prevent excessively large or malformed input from consuming resources within Iced's rendering or layout processes.
    *   **Code Injection (Low Severity - in most Iced contexts):** While Rust mitigates traditional code injection, Iced-specific validation prevents logic-level injection that could manipulate the Iced UI or application state.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Logic Errors:** Risk significantly reduced within the Iced UI.
    *   **DoS:** Risk reduced for DoS attacks targeting the Iced event loop and rendering.
    *   **Code Injection:** Risk significantly reduced in typical Iced scenarios.

*   **Currently Implemented (Example):**
    *   Basic message passing from `TextInput` to `update` is likely implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation (Example):**
    *   Consistent use of `on_input` for real-time validation might be missing.
    *   Custom widgets might not have thorough validation within their `update` method.
    *   Iced-specific error display using `Text` might be inconsistent.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Message Type Checking (Iced-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_message_type_checking__iced-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Central `Message` Enum:** Define a Rust `enum` that represents *all* possible messages that can be handled by your Iced application's `update` function. This is a fundamental part of the Iced architecture.
    2.  **Specific Message Payloads:**  Use specific data types within the enum variants to represent the data associated with each message (e.g., `Message::Increment(u32)`, `Message::TextChanged(String)`). Avoid generic types.
    3.  **Exhaustive `match` in `update`:**  In your Iced application's `update` function, use a `match` statement to handle *all* possible variants of the `Message` enum.  This is enforced by the Rust compiler and is a core part of how Iced applications process events.
    4.  **Iced Command Handling:** Use `Command::none()` or construct appropriate `Command` values within the `match` arms to handle side effects (e.g., fetching data, interacting with the system). This is the Iced-specific way to manage asynchronous operations.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Logic Errors (Medium Severity):** Prevents Iced-specific logic errors caused by the `update` function receiving and processing unexpected or malformed messages.
    *   **Code Injection (Low Severity - in most Iced contexts):** Reduces the risk (though already low due to Rust's safety) of an attacker somehow injecting malicious messages into the Iced event loop.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Logic Errors:** Risk significantly reduced within the Iced application logic.
    *   **Code Injection:** Risk further reduced, though the primary defense is still Rust's memory safety.

*   **Currently Implemented (Example):**
    *   A central `Message` enum is likely defined.
    *   `match` statements are used in the `update` function.

*   **Missing Implementation (Example):**
    *   Some message variants might use generic types.
    *   Error handling for unexpected messages (a wildcard `_` arm in the `match`) might be missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Subscription Handling (Iced-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_subscription_handling__iced-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **`iced::Subscription`:**  This strategy focuses specifically on the use of `iced::Subscription` for handling external events.
    2.  **Resource Limits (within Subscription):** When creating an `iced::Subscription`, implement limits *within the subscription's logic* on the resources it can consume.  This is crucial for preventing DoS attacks that might try to flood the Iced application with events. For example, if the subscription reads from a network stream, limit the rate at which data is read and processed *before* it's turned into an Iced message.
    3.  **Error Handling (within Subscription):** Implement robust error handling *within the subscription's logic itself*.  Use `Result` types to handle potential errors and, if necessary, generate an Iced message to notify the `update` function of the error.
    4.  **Cancellation (`Subscription::none()`):** Ensure that subscriptions can be cancelled properly using `Subscription::none()` when they are no longer needed. This is essential for preventing resource leaks and ensuring that the Iced application doesn't continue processing irrelevant events. This is a core part of managing Iced subscriptions.
    5. **Timeout (within Subscription):** If subscription is waiting for some external event, implement timeout *within the subscription's logic*, to avoid indefinite waiting.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Prevents attackers from overwhelming the Iced application with events through `iced::Subscription`.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Prevents Iced subscriptions from consuming excessive resources.
    *   **Logic Errors (Medium Severity):** Proper error handling within the subscription prevents Iced-specific logic errors.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Risk reduced for DoS attacks targeting Iced subscriptions.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk significantly reduced for Iced-related resource consumption.
    *   **Logic Errors:** Risk reduced within the Iced event handling.

*   **Currently Implemented (Example):**
    *   Some basic `iced::Subscription` usage might exist.

*   **Missing Implementation (Example):**
    *   Resource limits *within the subscription logic* might be missing.
    *   Error handling *within the subscription* might be incomplete.
    *   Proper cancellation using `Subscription::none()` might be missing.
    *   Timeouts might be missing.
