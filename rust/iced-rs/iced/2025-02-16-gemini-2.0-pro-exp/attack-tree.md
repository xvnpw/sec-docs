## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_memory_corruption_vulnerabilities__high_risk_.md)

*   **Critical Node: 1.1 Buffer Overflow in Iced's Rendering Engine**
    *   **Description:**  This is a fundamental vulnerability where data written to a buffer exceeds its allocated size, overwriting adjacent memory.  This can lead to control-flow hijacking.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **1.1.1 Maliciously Crafted Image/Font/SVG [HIGH RISK]:**
            *   **1.1.1.1 Trigger Overflow via Image Loading [HIGH RISK]:**  An attacker provides a specially crafted image file (e.g., PNG, JPEG, GIF) that, when parsed by Iced's image loading routines, causes a buffer overflow.  The image file might have invalid dimensions, corrupted chunks, or exploit known vulnerabilities in specific image codecs.
            *   **1.1.1.2 Trigger Overflow via Font Rendering [HIGH RISK]:**  An attacker provides a malicious font file (e.g., TTF, OTF) that, when processed by Iced's font rendering engine, triggers a buffer overflow.  The font file might contain malformed glyph data, hinting instructions, or exploit vulnerabilities in the font shaping or rasterization process.
            *   **1.1.1.3 Trigger Overflow via SVG Parsing [HIGH RISK]:** An attacker provides a malicious SVG file that exploits vulnerabilities in Iced's SVG parsing logic.  This could involve excessively large path data, deeply nested elements, or other techniques to trigger a buffer overflow.
        *   **1.1.2 Exploit Weaknesses in Custom Widgets [HIGH RISK]:**
            *   **1.1.2.1 Trigger Overflow via User Input to Custom Widget [HIGH RISK]:** If the Iced application uses custom widgets (developed by the application developers, not part of the Iced library), these widgets might have their own buffer overflow vulnerabilities.  An attacker could provide specially crafted input to the custom widget to trigger the overflow. This is particularly dangerous if the custom widget handles text input, network data, or other untrusted sources.

*   **Critical Node: 1.2 Use-After-Free in Iced's Event Handling**
    *   **Description:** This vulnerability occurs when memory is accessed after it has been freed.  This can lead to unpredictable behavior and, if exploited carefully, can allow an attacker to overwrite critical data structures and gain control of the application.
    *   **Attack Vectors (Not marked high-risk individually, but the node itself is critical):**
        *   Rapid event sequences (e.g., mouse clicks, keyboard presses) might trigger race conditions that lead to use-after-free errors.
        *   Concurrent creation and destruction of widgets could also expose use-after-free vulnerabilities if the event handling logic doesn't properly manage object lifetimes.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Dependencies Used by Iced [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_dependencies_used_by_iced__high_risk_.md)

*   **Critical Node: 3.1 Vulnerabilities in `wgpu` (Graphics)**
    *   **Description:** `wgpu` is a low-level graphics library that Iced uses for rendering.  Vulnerabilities in `wgpu` can have severe consequences, potentially allowing an attacker to compromise the GPU and the entire system.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **3.1.1 Shader Exploits [HIGH RISK]:**
            *   **3.1.1.1 Inject Malicious Shader Code [HIGH RISK]:**  Shaders are programs that run on the GPU.  If an attacker can inject malicious shader code (e.g., through a specially crafted image or other data that influences shader generation), they can potentially execute arbitrary code on the GPU.  This could lead to data exfiltration, denial of service, or even full system compromise.

*   **Critical Node: 3.3 Vulnerabilities in Font Rendering Libraries (e.g., `rusttype`, `font-kit`) [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** Iced relies on external libraries for font rendering. These libraries are complex and often handle untrusted font files.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **3.3.1 Font Parsing Vulnerabilities {CRITICAL NODE}:**
            *   **3.3.1.1 Trigger Buffer Overflow via Malicious Font File [HIGH RISK]:**  An attacker provides a malicious font file designed to trigger a buffer overflow in the font parsing library. This is a classic and very common attack vector against font rendering engines.

*   **Critical Node: 3.4 Vulnerabilities in Image Decoding Libraries (e.g., `image`) [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** Iced uses external libraries for image decoding. These libraries are also complex and handle untrusted image files.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **3.4.1 Image Parsing Vulnerabilities {CRITICAL NODE}:**
            *   **3.4.1.1 Trigger Buffer Overflow via Malicious Image File [HIGH RISK]:** An attacker provides a malicious image file designed to trigger a buffer overflow in the image parsing library. This is another classic and very common attack vector.
