# Threat Model Analysis for iced-rs/iced

## Threat: [Malicious Input Injection via User Interface Elements](./threats/malicious_input_injection_via_user_interface_elements.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Input Injection via User Interface Elements
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input strings or values within UI elements like text fields, sliders, or dropdowns provided by Iced. This input, when processed by the application's logic without proper sanitization or validation, can lead to unexpected behavior. The attacker might aim to trigger errors, bypass security checks, or even influence the application's state in unintended ways *due to how Iced handles and exposes input events and data from its widgets*.
    *   **Impact:** Application crashes, denial of service, information disclosure (if the injected input is used in database queries or file system operations), or manipulation of application state leading to incorrect functionality.
    *   **Affected Iced Component:** Input handling mechanisms within Iced, specifically the widgets that receive user input (e.g., `TextInput`, `Slider`, custom widgets handling input events) and the way Iced exposes input data to the application's logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all user-provided data *received from Iced widgets* before processing it.
        *   Use type-safe data structures and parsing libraries to ensure input conforms to expected formats *after receiving it from Iced*.
        *   Avoid directly using user input *obtained through Iced* in system calls or external commands without careful sanitization.
        *   Consider using allow-lists for input validation instead of relying solely on deny-lists.

## Threat: [Event Handling Exploits](./threats/event_handling_exploits.md)

*   **Threat:** Event Handling Exploits
    *   **Description:** An attacker attempts to trigger specific sequences of events or flood the application with a large number of events *that Iced manages and dispatches*. This could lead to unexpected state transitions, resource exhaustion, or denial of service. The attacker might use automated tools to rapidly interact with UI elements, exploiting how Iced's event loop processes these interactions.
    *   **Impact:** Application crashes, unresponsiveness, denial of service, or exploitation of race conditions in state updates.
    *   **Affected Iced Component:** The core event loop and message passing system within Iced, as well as the specific event handlers defined in the application's logic that react to Iced's events.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Design event handlers to be resilient to unexpected event sequences and high event volumes *generated and managed by Iced*.
        *   Implement rate limiting or debouncing for certain event types *within the application's event handling logic*.
        *   Ensure state updates triggered by events are atomic and thread-safe if concurrency is involved.
        *   Thoroughly test event handling logic with various input scenarios and edge cases.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Iced's Dependencies](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_iced's_dependencies.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Iced's Dependencies
    *   **Description:** Iced relies on various underlying libraries (e.g., `winit` for windowing, `pixels` for pixel buffers). Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited to compromise the Iced application. An attacker might leverage known vulnerabilities in these libraries to gain control over the application or the underlying system *through Iced's usage of these libraries*.
    *   **Impact:**  Wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, potentially including remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.
    *   **Affected Iced Component:**  Indirectly affects the entire application as it relies on the vulnerable dependencies *that Iced integrates*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability (can be Critical or High).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update Iced and all its dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Monitor security advisories for Iced's dependencies and promptly update when necessary.
        *   Consider using dependency scanning tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in your project's dependencies.
