# Attack Surface Analysis for iced-rs/iced

## Attack Surface: [Event Injection/Spoofing](./attack_surfaces/event_injectionspoofing.md)

* **Description:** Malicious actors might attempt to inject or spoof user input events (mouse clicks, keyboard presses, window events) to trigger unintended application behavior.
    * **How Iced Contributes:** Iced relies on the underlying operating system's event system and processes these events to update the application state and UI. If the application doesn't properly validate the source or content of these events, it could be tricked into performing actions it shouldn't.
    * **Example:** A crafted accessibility tool or a malicious program could send fake mouse click events to trigger actions in the Iced application without the user's actual interaction.
    * **Impact:** Can lead to unauthorized actions, state corruption, or triggering unintended application logic.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement robust input validation within the `update` function, checking the validity and expected context of events.
        * Be cautious when integrating with external libraries or systems that might generate events.
        * Consider the security implications of accessibility features and how they might be abused.

## Attack Surface: [Loading Untrusted Resources (Fonts, Images)](./attack_surfaces/loading_untrusted_resources__fonts__images_.md)

* **Description:** If the application allows users to specify custom fonts or images from untrusted sources, vulnerabilities in the font parsing or image decoding libraries could be exploited.
    * **How Iced Contributes:** Iced provides mechanisms for loading and rendering fonts and images. If the application allows loading these resources from arbitrary paths or URLs controlled by the user, it introduces a risk.
    * **Example:** A user could provide a malicious font file that exploits a vulnerability in the font rendering library, potentially leading to code execution.
    * **Impact:** Can range from application crashes to potential remote code execution depending on the vulnerability in the underlying libraries.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid allowing users to load arbitrary fonts or images.
        * If loading user-provided resources is necessary, sanitize the input and validate the file types.
        * Use well-maintained and regularly updated image and font decoding libraries.
        * Consider sandboxing the rendering process if loading untrusted resources is unavoidable.
