* **Malicious Event Injection:**
    * **Description:** An attacker crafts and sends malicious events to the Iced application, potentially triggering unintended behavior or exploiting vulnerabilities in event handlers.
    * **How Iced Contributes:** Iced's core functionality revolves around processing events. If the application doesn't properly validate or sanitize event data handled by Iced's event loop, it becomes susceptible to malicious input.
    * **Example:** An attacker might send a crafted "button press" event with manipulated data that bypasses intended logic or triggers an unexpected state change within the Iced application.
    * **Impact:** Application crash, unexpected behavior, data corruption, potential for privilege escalation if event handlers interact with sensitive system resources without proper checks.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all event data received and processed by the Iced application. Define clear expectations for event structures and reject malformed events. Utilize type-safe event handling mechanisms where possible within the Iced framework.

* **Custom Widget Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Description:** Security flaws within custom widgets developed for the Iced application can be exploited by attackers.
    * **How Iced Contributes:** Iced allows developers to create custom widgets, extending its functionality. If these widgets, which are integrated into the Iced rendering and event handling pipeline, are not developed with security in mind, they can introduce vulnerabilities directly within the Iced application's context.
    * **Example:** A custom widget rendering user-provided text might be vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) if it doesn't properly escape the text before rendering within the Iced UI. Another example could be a widget that handles file input without proper validation, leading to path traversal vulnerabilities accessible through the Iced application's interface.
    * **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary code within the application's context, information disclosure, denial of service, UI manipulation.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Follow secure coding practices when developing custom widgets for Iced. Sanitize user inputs processed by the widget, avoid direct execution of untrusted data within the widget's logic, and be mindful of potential rendering vulnerabilities within the Iced rendering context. Conduct thorough testing of custom widgets.

* **Unsafe FFI (Foreign Function Interface) Usage:**
    * **Description:** If the Iced application uses FFI to interact with native code, vulnerabilities in the native code or improper handling of data passed across the FFI boundary can introduce security risks directly impacting the Iced application.
    * **How Iced Contributes:** Iced provides mechanisms for interacting with native code. If this interaction, facilitated by Iced's FFI capabilities, is not handled securely, it can create an attack surface that directly compromises the Iced application.
    * **Example:** Passing unsanitized user input received through the Iced UI to a native function that is vulnerable to buffer overflows.
    * **Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution within the application's process, memory corruption, privilege escalation.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Thoroughly audit and secure the native code being called via Iced's FFI. Carefully validate and sanitize all data passed across the FFI boundary between the Iced application and the native code. Use memory-safe languages for native code where possible.
