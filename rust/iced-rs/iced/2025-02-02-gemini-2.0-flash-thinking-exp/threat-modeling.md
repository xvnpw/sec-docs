# Threat Model Analysis for iced-rs/iced

## Threat: [Vulnerable Dependencies](./threats/vulnerable_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits known vulnerabilities within Iced's dependencies (Rust crates). By crafting specific inputs or triggering application states that interact with a vulnerable dependency, they could achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the user's system. This is possible if a dependency used by Iced has a critical vulnerability that allows arbitrary code execution.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) - Attacker gains full control of the user's machine, able to execute arbitrary commands, install malware, steal data, etc.
*   **Iced Component Affected:** Dependency Management (Cargo, Crates.io, transitive dependencies)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Immediately address vulnerabilities reported by `cargo audit` and security advisories.
        *   Prioritize updating dependencies with known critical vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement automated dependency vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipelines to catch issues early.
        *   Consider using tools that provide vulnerability intelligence and prioritize critical fixes.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Ensure the application is updated promptly to the latest version provided by developers to receive security patches.

## Threat: [Rendering Engine Exploits](./threats/rendering_engine_exploits.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker leverages critical vulnerabilities within the rendering engine used by Iced (e.g., wgpu). By crafting malicious UI layouts or triggering specific rendering operations, they could exploit memory corruption or logic flaws in the rendering engine to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE). This would require a severe vulnerability in the rendering engine itself.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) - Attacker gains control of the user's machine through a flaw in the graphics rendering process.
*   **Iced Component Affected:** Rendering Pipeline (wgpu or similar graphics library), Iced Core (UI layout and rendering commands)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Stay vigilant for security advisories related to the rendering engine (e.g., wgpu).
        *   Update Iced and its rendering engine dependencies immediately when security patches are released.
        *   Report any suspected rendering engine vulnerabilities to the Iced and rendering engine maintainers.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Keep the application updated to benefit from patches to the rendering engine.
        *   Ensure graphics drivers are up-to-date, as rendering engine issues can sometimes be driver-related and driver updates may include security fixes.

## Threat: [Platform-Specific Bugs and Exploits Leading to Privilege Escalation or RCE](./threats/platform-specific_bugs_and_exploits_leading_to_privilege_escalation_or_rce.md)

*   **Description:**  Critical platform-specific bugs or vulnerabilities in operating systems or system libraries could be triggered by Iced applications in a way that allows an attacker to escalate privileges or achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE). This would involve a complex interaction between Iced's platform abstraction layer and a specific OS vulnerability.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Privilege Escalation - Attacker gains elevated privileges on the user's system, potentially allowing them to perform administrative actions.
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) - In extreme cases, platform-specific bugs could be chained to achieve RCE.
*   **Iced Component Affected:** Platform Abstraction Layer (Iced's interaction with OS APIs), Windowing and Input Handling (platform-specific implementations)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Conduct thorough testing on all target platforms, especially focusing on platform-specific interactions.
        *   Stay informed about security advisories for target operating systems and system libraries.
        *   Implement platform-specific mitigations or workarounds if critical platform bugs are identified that affect Iced applications.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Keep the operating system and system libraries updated with the latest security patches.
        *   Be cautious about running applications from untrusted sources, especially if platform-specific vulnerabilities are a concern.
