# Attack Surface Analysis for iced-rs/iced

## Attack Surface: [Rendering Bugs and Exploits](./attack_surfaces/rendering_bugs_and_exploits.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the rendering engine or graphics subsystem used by Iced.
*   **Iced Contribution:** Iced relies on rendering backends like `wgpu` or `glow` (through crates like `iced_wgpu` and `iced_glow`). Vulnerabilities in these underlying libraries or in Iced's integration can be exploited. This is a direct dependency and integration point of Iced.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability in the `wgpu` library (used by `iced_wgpu`) allows an attacker to craft specific UI elements or interactions that trigger a buffer overflow during rendering, leading to a crash or potentially GPU-level code execution. This directly impacts Iced applications using `iced_wgpu`.
*   **Impact:** Application crash, memory corruption, potential GPU-level exploits, information disclosure if sensitive data is rendered incorrectly.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the severity of the rendering vulnerability and the underlying library).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Updates:** Regularly update Iced and its rendering backend dependencies (`wgpu`, `glow`, `iced_wgpu`, `iced_glow`) to patch known vulnerabilities. This is crucial as Iced directly depends on these.
    *   **Security Audits of Rendering Libraries:** Stay informed about security advisories and audits related to the rendering libraries used by Iced.  This is relevant because Iced's security posture is tied to these libraries.
    *   **Report Rendering Issues:** If you encounter unusual rendering behavior or crashes, report them to the Iced and relevant rendering library developers. Contributing to the ecosystem helps improve Iced's overall security.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries that Iced depends on.
*   **Iced Contribution:** Iced relies on various Rust crates for core functionalities like windowing (`winit`), rendering (`wgpu`, `glow`), and more. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies directly impact Iced applications. Iced's functionality is built upon these dependencies.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability is discovered in the `winit` crate (used by Iced for window management) that allows an attacker to escape the application sandbox or gain unauthorized access to system resources. This directly affects Iced applications as `winit` is a core dependency for windowing and input handling in Iced.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, can range from application crash to arbitrary code execution or system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Auditing:** Regularly audit Iced's dependencies using tools like `cargo audit` to identify known vulnerabilities. This is a standard practice for any project, but especially important for frameworks like Iced that rely on many dependencies.
    *   **Dependency Updates:** Keep Iced and all its dependencies updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.  Staying up-to-date is the primary defense against dependency vulnerabilities.
    *   **Dependency Pinning/Locking:** Use `Cargo.lock` to ensure consistent dependency versions and prevent unexpected updates that might introduce vulnerabilities. This provides stability and control over dependency versions.
    *   **Vulnerability Monitoring:** Subscribe to security advisories for Rust crates and Iced's dependencies to stay informed about new vulnerabilities. Proactive monitoring is key to timely mitigation.
