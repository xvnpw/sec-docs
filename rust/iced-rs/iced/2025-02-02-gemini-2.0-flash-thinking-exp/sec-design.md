# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, `iced-rs/iced`, is a cross-platform GUI library for Rust.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a user-friendly and productive framework for Rust developers to create graphical applications.
  - Enable the development of cross-platform applications with a single codebase, targeting desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux) and web (via WebAssembly) environments.
  - Offer a performant and efficient GUI solution leveraging Rust's capabilities.
  - Foster a strong community around the library to ensure its long-term sustainability and growth.
  - Encourage adoption of Rust for GUI application development.

- Business Risks:
  - Adoption risk: Developers may prefer established GUI frameworks or find `iced` too complex or lacking features compared to alternatives.
  - Security vulnerabilities: Bugs in the library could lead to security issues in applications built with `iced`.
  - Performance bottlenecks: Inefficient rendering or resource management could negatively impact application performance and user experience.
  - Community dependency: Reliance on community contributions for maintenance and feature development introduces risks if community support wanes.
  - Platform compatibility issues: Maintaining cross-platform compatibility across diverse operating systems and browser environments can be challenging.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: GitHub repository with version control and history. Implemented in: GitHub.
  - security control: Open-source project, allowing for community security reviews. Implemented in: Project nature.
  - security control: Rust's memory safety features mitigate certain classes of vulnerabilities. Implemented in: Rust language.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on external dependencies (crates) which may have their own vulnerabilities. Accepted risk: Dependency management.
  - accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities in the core library code. Accepted risk: Software development.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated dependency scanning to identify vulnerabilities in dependencies.
  - security control: Integrate static analysis security testing (SAST) tools into the CI/CD pipeline to detect potential code-level vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Establish a clear vulnerability reporting and response process.
  - security control: Conduct regular security code reviews, especially for critical components and contributions.
  - security control: Provide security guidelines and best practices for developers using `iced` to build applications.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to the library itself. Applications built with `iced` may require authentication, which should be implemented by the application developer using appropriate methods outside of the `iced` library.
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to the library itself. Applications built with `iced` will likely require authorization, which should be implemented by the application developer. `iced` should provide mechanisms to facilitate secure UI rendering based on application-level authorization decisions.
  - Input Validation: Applications built with `iced` must perform thorough input validation on all user inputs received through the GUI to prevent injection attacks (e.g., cross-site scripting if rendering web content, command injection if interacting with system commands). `iced` should provide safe and robust input handling mechanisms to assist developers in implementing input validation.
  - Cryptography: Not directly required by the core `iced` library. If applications built with `iced` require cryptography, they should use well-vetted, external cryptography libraries. `iced` should not implement custom cryptography. If `iced` provides any utilities related to data handling, ensure they do not inadvertently introduce cryptographic vulnerabilities.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Adoption and usage of the `iced` library by Rust developers.
  - Community contributions and maintenance of the library.
  - Development of secure and performant applications using `iced`.
  - Distribution of the `iced` library through crates.io.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Source code of the `iced` library: High sensitivity. Integrity and confidentiality are important to prevent malicious modifications and maintain trust.
  - Documentation: Medium sensitivity. Integrity is important to ensure accurate and safe usage guidance.
  - Build artifacts (libraries, binaries): Medium sensitivity. Integrity is crucial to prevent distribution of compromised artifacts.
  - Community contributions: Low to Medium sensitivity. Intellectual property of contributors, but generally intended for public use.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What are the specific target applications or use cases for `iced`? (e.g., desktop utilities, embedded systems, web applications).
  - Are there any specific regulatory compliance requirements for applications built with `iced`? (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS).
  - What is the expected level of security for applications built with `iced`? (e.g., basic security, high security for sensitive data).
  - Are there any specific performance requirements or constraints for applications built with `iced`?

- Assumptions:
  - The primary goal of `iced` is to provide a general-purpose, cross-platform GUI library for Rust.
  - Security is a concern for the `iced` project and applications built with it, but not necessarily the absolute highest priority compared to usability and performance.
  - Applications built with `iced` will handle user input and potentially sensitive data, requiring attention to input validation and secure data handling at the application level.
  - The `iced` project relies on community contributions and open-source development practices.
