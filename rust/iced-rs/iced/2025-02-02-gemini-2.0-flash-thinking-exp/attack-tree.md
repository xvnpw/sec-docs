## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Iced Application [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_iced_application__critical_node_.md)

* This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success here means the attacker has achieved unauthorized access, control, or disruption of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. [1.0] Exploit Iced Framework Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/2___1_0__exploit_iced_framework_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

* Exploiting vulnerabilities within the Iced framework itself is a critical path because it can potentially affect all applications built using that version of Iced.
* Success here can lead to widespread impact and potentially more severe vulnerabilities than application-specific flaws.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. [1.1] Input Handling Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/3___1_1__input_handling_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

* Input handling is a consistently high-risk area in software security. Applications built with Iced, like any other software, are vulnerable to input-based attacks.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **[1.1.1] Malicious Message Injection [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * Iced applications communicate using messages. If message handling is not robust, attackers can inject malicious messages to:
            * **[1.1.1.b] Inject Unexpected Data Types/Values [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Cause errors or unexpected behavior by sending messages with incorrect data types or values that the application is not designed to handle.
            * **[1.1.1.c] Trigger Unintended Application State Changes [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Manipulate the application's state by sending messages that alter variables or trigger logic in unintended ways.
    * **[1.1.2] Widget Input Manipulation [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * Iced widgets receive user input. Vulnerabilities can arise if widget input is not properly validated.
            * **[1.1.2.b] Inject Special Characters/Control Codes [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Inject special characters or control codes into widget inputs to bypass input validation, manipulate UI behavior, or potentially exploit backend processing.
    * **[1.1.3] Event Handling Exploits [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * Iced uses events to manage UI interactions. Exploiting event handling logic flaws can lead to unexpected application states or denial of service.
            * **[1.1.3.1] Trigger Unexpected Event Sequences [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                * **[1.1.3.1.a] Flood Application with Specific Events [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Send a large number of specific events to overwhelm the application's event handling mechanism, leading to denial of service.
            * **[1.1.3.2] Exploit Event Handler Logic Flaws [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                * **[1.1.3.2.a] Identify Vulnerable Event Handlers [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Analyze application code to find event handlers with logic flaws or insufficient security checks.
                * **[1.1.3.2.b] Craft Events to Trigger Logic Errors [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Create specific events designed to trigger identified logic errors in vulnerable event handlers, potentially bypassing security checks or causing unintended actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. [1.2] Rendering Engine Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/4___1_2__rendering_engine_vulnerabilities.md)

* **[1.2.1] Resource Exhaustion via Rendering [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * Attackers can exploit the rendering engine to cause denial of service by consuming excessive resources.
            * **[1.2.1.1] Trigger Complex Rendering Operations [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                * **[1.2.1.1.a] Craft UI Elements with High Rendering Cost [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Design UI elements that are computationally expensive to render, such as complex shapes, excessive layers, or inefficient drawing operations.
                * **[1.2.1.1.b] Repeatedly Trigger Resource-Intensive Redraws [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Force the application to repeatedly redraw resource-intensive UI elements, overwhelming the rendering engine and causing performance degradation or crashes.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. [1.5] Dependency Vulnerabilities (in Iced's dependencies) [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/5___1_5__dependency_vulnerabilities__in_iced's_dependencies___high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

* Dependency vulnerabilities are a significant and frequently exploited attack vector in modern software development. Iced, like most projects, relies on external dependencies.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **[1.5.1] Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Iced Dependencies [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * Iced's dependencies may contain known vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities if the application uses a vulnerable version of Iced or its dependencies.
            * **[1.5.1.1] Identify Iced Dependencies [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Determine the dependencies used by Iced (e.g., by examining `Cargo.toml` or build files).
            * **[1.5.1.2] Scan Dependencies for Known Vulnerabilities (e.g., using `cargo audit`) [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Use tools like `cargo audit` or other vulnerability scanners to identify known vulnerabilities in Iced's dependencies.
            * **[1.5.1.3] Exploit Discovered Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Research and exploit any discovered vulnerabilities in Iced's dependencies, potentially gaining code execution or other forms of compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. [2.0] Exploit Application Logic Vulnerabilities (within the Iced application itself, facilitated by Iced) [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/6___2_0__exploit_application_logic_vulnerabilities__within_the_iced_application_itself__facilitated__f53647f5.md)

* Vulnerabilities in the application's own logic, especially when interacting with the UI framework (Iced), are a high-risk path.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **[2.1] Logic Errors in Message Handlers [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * Application-specific message handlers are crucial for application logic. Errors in these handlers can be exploited.

    * **[2.1.2] Denial of Service via Message Flooding [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * Attackers can flood the application with messages to cause denial of service.
            * **[2.1.2.1] Flood Application with Resource-Intensive Messages [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Send a large volume of messages that are resource-intensive to process, overwhelming the application's message processing capabilities.
            * **[2.1.2.2] Overload Message Queue and Application Logic [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Flood the message queue with messages, causing it to grow excessively and overload the application's logic, leading to performance degradation or crashes.
    * **[2.2] Insecure Data Handling in Iced Application [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * Insecure handling of data, especially user input, within the Iced application is a major risk.
