# Threat Model Analysis for iced-rs/iced

## Threat: [Event Flooding Denial of Service](./threats/event_flooding_denial_of_service.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates the application or its environment to generate an excessive number of events (e.g., mouse clicks, keyboard presses) that overwhelm Iced's event loop. This can prevent the application from processing legitimate events and cause it to become unresponsive.

**Impact:** Application freeze, denial of service, making the application unusable for legitimate users.

**Affected Component:** Iced's event loop (`iced_runtime::executor` and related modules), potentially affecting all widgets and application logic that rely on event processing.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement rate limiting or throttling within the application's event handling logic to prevent overwhelming Iced's event loop. This might involve custom logic on top of Iced's event handling.
* Design the application to handle a large number of events gracefully, potentially by batching or debouncing event processing.
* Consider if Iced itself could offer more built-in mechanisms for event throttling or prioritization.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Underlying Graphics Library (WGPU)](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_underlying_graphics_library__wgpu_.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts specific UI elements or interactions within the Iced application that trigger a known or zero-day vulnerability in the `wgpu` rendering backend. This could involve manipulating rendering parameters or exploiting bugs in how `wgpu` handles certain drawing operations.

**Impact:** Application crash, memory corruption, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution depending on the nature of the `wgpu` vulnerability.

**Affected Component:** Iced's renderer integration (`iced_wgpu` or similar backend implementations), specifically the interaction with the `wgpu` library. While the vulnerability is in `wgpu`, Iced's integration is the point of interaction.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep the `wgpu` dependency used by Iced updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities. This requires Iced to update its dependencies.
* Monitor security advisories for `wgpu` and other relevant graphics libraries that Iced depends on.
* Report any suspected rendering-related crashes or unusual behavior to the Iced and `wgpu` development teams.

## Threat: [Memory Corruption within Iced's Core Rendering or Widget Logic](./threats/memory_corruption_within_iced's_core_rendering_or_widget_logic.md)

**Description:** A vulnerability exists within Iced's core rendering engine or in the logic of a built-in widget that allows for memory corruption. This could be triggered by specific input, data, or rendering operations.

**Impact:** Application crash, unpredictable behavior, potential for arbitrary code execution if the memory corruption is exploitable.

**Affected Component:** Iced's core rendering modules (`iced_renderer`), widget implementations (`iced_widget`), and potentially the layout engine (`iced_layout`).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Report any suspected memory corruption issues to the Iced development team with detailed reproduction steps.
* Keep Iced updated to the latest stable version, as updates often include bug fixes and security patches.
* If possible, try to isolate the problematic widget or rendering scenario to help identify the root cause.

## Threat: [Unsanitized Input Leading to Unexpected Behavior within Iced Widgets](./threats/unsanitized_input_leading_to_unexpected_behavior_within_iced_widgets.md)

**Description:** Malicious input provided through Iced's built-in widgets (like `Text`, `TextInput`) is not properly sanitized by Iced itself, leading to unexpected behavior or potentially exploitable conditions within the widget's internal logic. This differs from command injection as the issue lies within Iced's handling of the input, not the application's subsequent use of it.

**Impact:** Application crash, UI glitches, potential for denial of service if the widget enters an invalid state, or potentially other vulnerabilities depending on the specific widget and flaw.

**Affected Component:** Specific Iced widgets (`iced_widget::text`, `iced_widget::text_input`, etc.) and their internal input processing logic.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Report any instances of unexpected widget behavior with specific input examples to the Iced development team.
* Consider if application-level sanitization is needed even for Iced's built-in widgets as a defensive measure.
* Monitor Iced release notes for bug fixes and security updates related to input handling in widgets.
