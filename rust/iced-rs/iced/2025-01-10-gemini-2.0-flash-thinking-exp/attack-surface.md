# Attack Surface Analysis for iced-rs/iced

## Attack Surface: [Malicious or Unexpected Event Handling](./attack_surfaces/malicious_or_unexpected_event_handling.md)

*   **Description:** The application relies on processing events (user interactions, system events) to function. Crafted or unexpected events could trigger unintended behavior or errors.
    *   **How Iced Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Iced's core mechanism is event-driven. It provides the framework for defining and handling events. Vulnerabilities can arise in how the application *interprets* and *reacts* to these events within the Iced structure.
    *   **Example:** A specially crafted mouse event with extreme coordinates or a sequence of rapid button clicks could exploit a logic flaw in the application's event handler, leading to an incorrect state update or a crash.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, unexpected behavior, denial of service, potential for logic errors leading to data corruption or unintended actions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization within event handlers.
            *   Design event handling logic to gracefully handle unexpected or out-of-bounds event data.
            *   Consider rate-limiting or debouncing for rapidly occurring events if necessary.
            *   Thoroughly test event handling logic with various inputs and event sequences.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Widgets](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_widgets.md)

*   **Description:** Developers can create custom widgets to extend Iced's functionality. Bugs or security flaws in these custom widgets can introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Iced Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Iced provides the API and structure for creating custom widgets. The security of these widgets is entirely the responsibility of the developer implementing them. Iced's framework allows their integration, thus extending the application's attack surface.
    *   **Example:** A custom widget rendering user-provided text without proper escaping could be vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) if the rendered output is displayed in a web context (though Iced is primarily for native apps, this illustrates the principle). A custom widget handling numerical input without validation could lead to integer overflows.
    *   **Impact:**  Application crash, unexpected behavior, potential for arbitrary code execution (depending on the widget's functionality and the underlying libraries used), information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Apply the same security best practices to custom widget development as to any other software component.
            *   Thoroughly test custom widgets for vulnerabilities, including input validation, boundary conditions, and potential for resource exhaustion.
            *   Consider security reviews or code audits for complex custom widgets.
            *   Avoid using unsafe or deprecated APIs within custom widget implementations.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal through File Dialogs](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_through_file_dialogs.md)

*   **Description:** When applications allow users to select files or directories, improper handling of the selected paths can lead to path traversal vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Iced Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Iced provides file dialogs (`FileDialog`) for opening and saving files. If the application doesn't properly validate or sanitize the paths returned by these dialogs, it can be vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** A user could manipulate the file dialog (or a vulnerability in the dialog itself) to select a file path outside the intended directory, potentially allowing access to sensitive files or overwriting critical system files if the application performs actions based on the selected path.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized file access, data breaches, potential for system compromise if the application operates with elevated privileges.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Canonicalize and validate file paths returned by file dialogs to ensure they are within the expected boundaries.
            *   Avoid directly using user-provided paths for critical operations without thorough validation.
            *   Implement proper access controls and permissions.
