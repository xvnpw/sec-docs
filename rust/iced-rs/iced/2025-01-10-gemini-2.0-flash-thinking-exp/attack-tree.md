## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities ***HIGH-RISK PATH***](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_input_handling_vulnerabilities_high-risk_path.md)

* **[CRITICAL] Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities ***HIGH-RISK PATH***:**
    * This represents a broad category of attacks that leverage weaknesses in how the Iced application processes user input. Successful exploitation can lead to various negative outcomes, including code execution and denial of service.
    * **Risk Factors:** High likelihood of finding input-related vulnerabilities in complex applications, potential for significant impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Input](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_input.md)

* **Inject Malicious Input:**
    * This is a sub-category of input handling vulnerabilities where the attacker attempts to inject data that is not intended to be processed as normal input.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploit Text Input Fields ***HIGH-RISK PATH***](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_text_input_fields_high-risk_path.md)

* **[CRITICAL] Exploit Text Input Fields ***HIGH-RISK PATH***:**
    * Text input fields are a common target for attackers. If not properly sanitized and validated, they can be used to inject malicious code or cause unexpected behavior.
    * **Risk Factors:** Text input is a fundamental part of most applications, making it a frequent target.

        * **Trigger Buffer Overflows in Input Processing:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Sending excessively long strings to text input fields, potentially overflowing allocated buffers and leading to crashes or code execution.
            * **Likelihood:** Low (modern frameworks often have protections).
            * **Impact:** High (crash, potential code execution).
            * **Effort:** Medium.
            * **Skill Level:** Medium.
            * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.

        * **Inject Control Characters/Sequences:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Injecting special characters or escape sequences that might be interpreted by the rendering engine or operating system, leading to unexpected behavior or even command injection.
            * **Likelihood:** Medium (depends on Iced's sanitization).
            * **Impact:** Medium (unexpected behavior, potential UI disruption, limited command execution).
            * **Effort:** Low.
            * **Skill Level:** Low.
            * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploit Rendering Engine Vulnerabilities ***HIGH-RISK PATH***](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_rendering_engine_vulnerabilities_high-risk_path.md)

* **[CRITICAL] Exploit Rendering Engine Vulnerabilities ***HIGH-RISK PATH***:**
    * This category involves attacks that target weaknesses in how Iced renders the user interface. Exploiting these vulnerabilities can lead to crashes, information leaks, or even the exploitation of underlying graphics libraries.
    * **Risk Factors:** Complexity of rendering engines, potential for interaction with lower-level graphics libraries.

        * **Trigger Rendering Errors Leading to Crashes:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Providing malformed or excessively complex UI definitions, especially if the application allows dynamic UI updates based on external data.
            * **Likelihood:** Medium.
            * **Impact:** High (crash, denial of service).
            * **Effort:** Medium.
            * **Skill Level:** Medium.
            * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploit Underlying Graphics Library Vulnerabilities ***HIGH-RISK PATH***](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_underlying_graphics_library_vulnerabilities_high-risk_path.md)

* **[CRITICAL] Exploit Underlying Graphics Library Vulnerabilities ***HIGH-RISK PATH***:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Crafting input or interactions that force Iced to use vulnerable functions within the underlying graphics library (e.g., wgpu).
            * **Likelihood:** Low.
            * **Impact:** High (potential code execution, arbitrary memory access).
            * **Effort:** High.
            * **Skill Level:** High.
            * **Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium.

            * **Trigger Code Paths Utilizing Vulnerable Functions:**
                * This is the specific action within the "Exploit Underlying Graphics Library Vulnerabilities" node.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploit Vulnerabilities in Iced Library Itself ***HIGH-RISK PATH***](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_iced_library_itself_high-risk_path.md)

* **[CRITICAL] Exploit Vulnerabilities in Iced Library Itself ***HIGH-RISK PATH***:**
    * This represents direct vulnerabilities within the Iced library code itself. Exploiting these can have a widespread impact on all applications using the vulnerable version.
    * **Risk Factors:**  Software vulnerabilities are common; popular libraries are often targets.

        * **[CRITICAL] Leverage Known Vulnerabilities ***HIGH-RISK PATH***:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Exploiting publicly disclosed security flaws in specific versions of the Iced library.
            * **Likelihood:** Depends on the existence and severity of known vulnerabilities and the application's update status.
            * **Impact:** Can range from Low to High.
            * **Effort:** Low to Medium.
            * **Skill Level:** Low to Medium.
            * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.

            * **Exploit Published Security Flaws:**
                * This is the specific action within the "Leverage Known Vulnerabilities" node.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploit Dependencies of Iced ***HIGH-RISK PATH***](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_dependencies_of_iced_high-risk_path.md)

* **[CRITICAL] Exploit Dependencies of Iced ***HIGH-RISK PATH***:**
    * This category highlights the risk of vulnerabilities in libraries that Iced relies on. Exploiting these vulnerabilities can indirectly compromise the Iced application.
    * **Risk Factors:**  Applications are often built on numerous dependencies, creating a larger attack surface.

        * **[CRITICAL] Target Vulnerabilities in Libraries Used by Iced ***HIGH-RISK PATH***:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in libraries such as `wgpu` or other dependencies.
