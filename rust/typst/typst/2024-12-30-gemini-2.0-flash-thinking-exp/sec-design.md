### 2.1. Key Components

*   **Typst Compiler:** The core component, written in Rust, responsible for parsing Typst markup, resolving dependencies (including standard library and external packages), performing type checking and semantic analysis, and generating the final output document (e.g., PDF). It operates within a defined execution environment.
*   **Standard Library:** A collection of built-in functions, macros, and styles essential for typesetting documents. It is tightly coupled with the compiler and accessed during the compilation process. It defines the core capabilities of the Typst language.
*   **Web Application Frontend:** A client-side, browser-based user interface, typically implemented using JavaScript frameworks, that allows users to write and edit Typst markup, configure compilation settings, initiate compilation requests, and view the rendered output. It communicates with the backend via HTTPS.
*   **Web Application Backend:** A server-side application that handles user authentication and session management, manages user projects and files (if persistence is implemented), receives compilation requests from the frontend, securely invokes the Typst compiler, and serves the rendered output back to the frontend. It also handles package management requests initiated by the user through the frontend.
*   **Package Manager CLI:** A command-line interface tool, also written in Rust, that allows users to manage Typst packages. It interacts with the package registry to install, update, and remove packages. This is typically used outside the web application context or by the backend on behalf of the user.
*   **Package Registry:** A repository that stores and serves Typst packages (libraries, themes, fonts, etc.). It provides an API for the package manager CLI and potentially the compiler to access and download packages. It needs to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the hosted packages.

## 3. Component Details

## 4. Data Flow

The following outlines the typical data flow within the Typst system for a compilation request initiated through the web application:

1. **User Interaction:** The user writes or edits Typst code in the **Web App Frontend**.
2. **Compilation Request:** The frontend sends an HTTPS compilation request, including the Typst code and settings, to the **Web App Backend**. This request is authenticated and authorized.
3. **Backend Processing:** The backend receives the request, authenticates the user, and authorizes the action. It may queue the compilation request.
4. **Compiler Invocation:** The backend securely invokes the **Typst Compiler**, passing the Typst code and settings as input. This might involve creating a temporary directory and copying the code.
5. **Dependency Resolution:** The compiler attempts to resolve dependencies. If external packages are required and not already available, the compiler or the backend (using the **Package Manager CLI**) will interact with the **Package Registry** to download the necessary packages. This download should be over HTTPS and the package integrity verified.
6. **Compilation:** The compiler parses the code, utilizes the **Standard Library**, and generates the output document in memory or a temporary file.
7. **Output Delivery:** The compiler sends the compiled document data back to the **Web App Backend**.
8. **Response to Frontend:** The backend sends the compiled document (e.g., as a PDF byte stream) back to the **Web App Frontend** via an HTTPS response.
9. **Display to User:** The frontend receives the compiled document and displays it to the user.

## 5. Security Considerations

Based on the architecture and component descriptions, the following security considerations are important for threat modeling:

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Rigorous validation and sanitization of all user-provided input across all components (Typst code, settings, package names, file uploads) is crucial to prevent injection attacks (e.g., command injection, XSS).
*   **Authentication and Authorization:** Implementing strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., multi-factor authentication) and fine-grained authorization controls to protect user accounts and resources. Secure session management is also essential.
*   **Dependency Management Security:**  Verifying the integrity and authenticity of packages fetched from the package registry using cryptographic signatures and checksums. Protecting against dependency confusion attacks by ensuring packages are sourced from trusted registries.
*   **Secure Code Execution Environment:**  Running the Typst compiler in a sandboxed environment or with restricted privileges to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities. Preventing the compiler from accessing sensitive system resources.
*   **Data Security and Privacy:** Protecting user data (projects, settings, personal information) at rest (using encryption) and in transit (using HTTPS). Adhering to privacy regulations.
*   **Web Application Security Best Practices:** Implementing standard web security measures to prevent common vulnerabilities like XSS, CSRF, SQL injection (if a database is used), and session hijacking. Regularly updating web framework dependencies.
*   **Supply Chain Security:**  Maintaining an inventory of all third-party libraries and dependencies used by the various components and monitoring them for known vulnerabilities. Using tools like Software Bill of Materials (SBOM).
*   **Rate Limiting and DoS Protection:** Implementing rate limiting on API endpoints and other measures to protect against denial-of-service attacks.
*   **Error Handling and Logging:**  Implementing secure error handling to avoid leaking sensitive information. Maintaining comprehensive audit logs for security monitoring and incident response.

## 6. Technologies Used

*   **Programming Language (Compiler, Package Manager CLI):** Rust (known for memory safety)
*   **Web Application Frontend:** Likely JavaScript frameworks (e.g., React, Vue, Svelte), HTML5, CSS3
*   **Web Application Backend:**
    *   Likely a web framework (e.g., Rust-based like Actix, Rocket, or Warp; or frameworks like Node.js with Express, Python with Flask/Django, Go with Gin/Echo)
    *   Potentially a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite)
    *   Potentially a message queue (e.g., Redis, RabbitMQ, Kafka)
*   **Package Registry:**
    *   Likely a database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for metadata
    *   Object storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage) for package files
    *   Web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache) with an API framework
*   **Communication Protocols:** HTTPS, potentially WebSockets

## 7. Deployment Model

The Typst project can be deployed in various ways, each with its own security implications:

*   **Local Installation:** Users install the Typst compiler and potentially the package manager CLI directly on their local machines. Security relies on the user's system security and the integrity of the downloaded binaries.
*   **Web Application (Self-Hosted):**  Organizations or individuals deploy the web application components (frontend and backend) on their own infrastructure. This requires managing server security, network configurations, and application security.
*   **Web Application (Hosted Service):**  The Typst developers or a third party provide a hosted service, managing the infrastructure and application. Users rely on the security measures implemented by the service provider. This model introduces trust in the provider's security practices.

## 8. Future Considerations

Future development of Typst might introduce new security considerations:

*   **Plugin System:** Allowing users to create and install custom plugins could introduce significant security risks if plugins are not properly sandboxed or vetted. Plugin APIs need to be carefully designed to prevent malicious actions.
*   **Collaboration Features:** Real-time collaboration on documents will require secure communication channels (e.g., WebSockets with encryption) and robust access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access and modifications.
*   **Extended Output Formats:** Supporting additional output formats might introduce new dependencies and potential vulnerabilities related to the processing of those formats.
*   **Integration with External Services:**  Integration with external services (e.g., cloud storage, version control systems) will require secure authentication and authorization mechanisms for accessing those services.

This document provides a more detailed and refined understanding of the Typst project's design, emphasizing security considerations. This information is crucial for conducting a thorough threat model to identify potential security vulnerabilities and develop appropriate mitigation strategies for each component and interaction.
