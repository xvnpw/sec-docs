*   **Attack Surface:** Malicious Typst Markup Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides crafted Typst markup as input to the application, designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the Typst compiler or rendering engine.
    *   **How Typst Contributes:** Typst's core functionality involves parsing and processing user-provided markup. If the parser or rendering engine has vulnerabilities, malicious markup can trigger unintended behavior.
    *   **Example:**  A deeply nested structure in the Typst markup that causes the compiler to consume excessive memory, leading to a denial-of-service. Alternatively, markup exploiting a potential buffer overflow in the rendering process.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service (application crash or slowdown), potential information disclosure if the vulnerability allows access to server resources, or in extreme cases, remote code execution if the vulnerability is severe enough.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Sanitization and Validation:**  Carefully sanitize and validate user-provided Typst markup before passing it to the Typst library. This can involve whitelisting allowed tags and attributes, or using a robust parsing library to identify and reject potentially malicious constructs.
        *   **Resource Limits:** Implement resource limits (CPU time, memory usage) for the Typst compilation and rendering process to prevent resource exhaustion attacks.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Run the Typst compilation and rendering process in a sandboxed environment with limited privileges to restrict the impact of potential exploits.
        *   **Regularly Update Typst:** Keep the Typst library updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.

*   **Attack Surface:** Resource Exhaustion via Input
    *   **Description:** An attacker submits extremely large or complex Typst documents that consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory, disk space) during compilation or rendering.
    *   **How Typst Contributes:** Typst needs to process the entire input document. Large or complex documents naturally require more resources. Inefficient processing within Typst can exacerbate this.
    *   **Example:** Submitting a Typst document with thousands of deeply nested elements or a very large number of images, causing the Typst process to consume all available memory and crash the application.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, impacting the availability of the application for legitimate users.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium to High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Size Limits:** Implement limits on the size of uploaded Typst documents.
        *   **Complexity Limits:**  If possible, implement checks to limit the complexity of the Typst markup (e.g., maximum nesting depth, number of elements).
        *   **Timeouts:** Set timeouts for the Typst compilation and rendering process. If the process takes too long, terminate it to prevent resource hogging.
        *   **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor server resources (CPU, memory) and implement alerts to detect and respond to potential resource exhaustion attacks.

*   **Attack Surface:** Malicious Content in Generated Output
    *   **Description:** Typst generates output files (primarily PDFs). Vulnerabilities in the PDF generation process or the underlying PDF libraries could lead to the creation of malicious PDFs.
    *   **How Typst Contributes:** Typst is responsible for generating the PDF content. If the generation process has flaws, it could create PDFs with exploitable features.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in the PDF library used by Typst could allow the generation of a PDF containing malicious JavaScript that executes when the PDF is opened by a vulnerable viewer.
    *   **Impact:**  Compromise of the user's system when they open the generated PDF, potentially leading to information disclosure or further attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium to High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure PDF Generation Libraries:** Ensure Typst uses secure and up-to-date PDF generation libraries.
        *   **Content Security Policies (for web contexts):** If the generated PDFs are served through a web application, implement Content Security Policies to restrict the capabilities of the PDF viewer.
        *   **User Education:** Educate users about the risks of opening PDFs from untrusted sources.
        *   **Scanning Generated Output:** Consider scanning generated PDFs for known malicious content before making them available to users.

*   **Attack Surface:** Vulnerabilities in Typst's Dependencies
    *   **Description:** Typst relies on third-party libraries (Rust crates). Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be indirectly exploitable through Typst.
    *   **How Typst Contributes:** Typst integrates and uses the functionality provided by its dependencies. If a dependency has a security flaw, Typst's use of that dependency can expose the application to that flaw.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in a parsing library used by Typst could be exploited by providing specially crafted input that triggers the vulnerability within the dependency.
    *   **Impact:**  The impact depends on the nature of the vulnerability in the dependency, potentially ranging from denial of service to remote code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium to High (depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Dependency Management:** Use a robust dependency management system (like Cargo in Rust) and regularly update dependencies to their latest versions to benefit from security patches.
        *   **Security Auditing of Dependencies:**  Periodically audit Typst's dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `cargo audit`.
        *   **Supply Chain Security:** Be mindful of the security of the sources from which Typst and its dependencies are obtained.
