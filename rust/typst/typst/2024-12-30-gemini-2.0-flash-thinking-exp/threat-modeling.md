### High and Critical Typst Threats

This list details high and critical security threats directly involving the Typst library.

**I. Input Processing Threats:**

*   **Threat:** Malicious Typst Code Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides crafted Typst markup containing malicious code or commands that exploit vulnerabilities within the Typst parser or compiler. This could lead to the execution of unintended logic or access to restricted resources *during the Typst compilation process itself*. The attacker might embed code that attempts to read local files accessible to the Typst process, make network requests (if Typst's design allows for such interaction during compilation), or cause resource exhaustion within the Typst runtime.
    *   **Impact:** Server-side resource exhaustion leading to denial of service, potential information disclosure if the Typst process has access to sensitive data on the server, or in severe cases, remote code execution on the server if vulnerabilities in Typst's internal sandbox or underlying runtime are exploited.
    *   **Affected Typst Component:** Parser, Compiler, potentially the Sandbox (if implemented and bypassed).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Sanitization:** Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user-provided Typst code *before* passing it to the Typst library. Implement a strict whitelist of allowed Typst features and reject any input containing potentially dangerous constructs.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Execute the Typst compilation process within a robust sandbox environment *internal to Typst* with limited access to system resources, the file system, and the network. This relies on the security of Typst's own sandboxing mechanisms.
        *   **Resource Limits within Typst:** Configure or rely on Typst's internal mechanisms to enforce strict limits on compilation time, memory usage, and output size to prevent resource exhaustion attacks *within the Typst process*.
        *   **Regular Typst Updates:** Keep the Typst library updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches released by the Typst developers.

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Typst Language Features for Resource Exhaustion
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts Typst code that leverages legitimate Typst language features in a way that consumes excessive resources (CPU, memory, time) *during the Typst compilation process*. This could involve creating deeply nested structures, excessively large tables, or complex calculations that overwhelm the Typst compiler's internal workings.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, making the application unresponsive or unavailable due to the overloaded Typst process.
    *   **Affected Typst Component:** Compiler, potentially the Memory Management within Typst.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Resource Limits within Typst:** Configure or rely on Typst's internal mechanisms to implement timeouts for compilation processes. Set limits on the maximum document size, number of elements, or complexity allowed *within Typst's processing*.
        *   **Code Analysis (if feasible):**  If possible, analyze user-provided Typst code for potentially resource-intensive patterns *before* passing it to the Typst compiler. This might involve static analysis techniques specific to Typst's syntax.

*   **Threat:**  Type Confusion or Memory Safety Issues
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides specific Typst input that triggers a type confusion error or a memory safety issue (e.g., buffer overflow, use-after-free) *within the Typst library's code itself*. This could lead to crashes, unexpected behavior within the Typst process, or potentially arbitrary code execution *within the context of the Typst process* on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service due to Typst process crashes, potential for remote code execution on the server *within the Typst process*.
    *   **Affected Typst Component:** Various internal modules depending on the specific vulnerability (e.g., Memory Management, Parser, Compiler).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Typst Updates:** Keep the Typst library updated to the latest version, as these underlying vulnerabilities are the responsibility of the Typst development team to address.
        *   **Fuzzing (for Typst developers):**  The Typst development team should employ fuzzing techniques to test the Typst library with a wide range of inputs to proactively identify potential crashes and vulnerabilities.
        *   **Memory Safety Practices (for Typst developers):** The Typst development team should adhere to strict memory safety practices in the development of the Typst library.

**II. Output Generation Threats:**

*   **Threat:** Malicious Content Generation Leading to Viewer Exploits
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts Typst code that, when compiled, generates output (e.g., a PDF) containing malicious content that exploits vulnerabilities in the *viewer application* used to render the output. While the vulnerability lies in the viewer, the *generation* of the malicious content is facilitated by Typst. This could involve embedding JavaScript or other active content within the generated document that could compromise the user's system when they open it.
    *   **Impact:** Client-side vulnerabilities, potential for arbitrary code execution on the user's machine when viewing the document generated by Typst.
    *   **Affected Typst Component:** Renderer (specifically the PDF generation module).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Output Validation within Typst:** Implement checks within Typst's rendering process to prevent the generation of output containing known malicious patterns or elements that could be exploited by viewers.
        *   **Secure Defaults:** Ensure Typst's default settings for output generation are as secure as possible, minimizing the inclusion of potentially dangerous features.
