# Attack Surface Analysis for typst/typst

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Typst Source Code leading to Resource Exhaustion (DoS)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_typst_source_code_leading_to_resource_exhaustion__dos_.md)

**Description:** A specially crafted Typst document is designed to consume excessive computational resources (CPU, memory) during the compilation process, making the application or server unresponsive.

**How Typst Contributes:** Typst's compiler needs to process the input document. Complex or deeply nested structures, large amounts of repetitive content, or inefficient code within the Typst document can overwhelm the compiler.

**Example:** A Typst document with thousands of deeply nested loops or extremely large tables could cause the compiler to consume all available memory or CPU time.

**Impact:** Denial of service, application downtime, performance degradation for other users.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement resource limits (CPU time, memory usage) for the Typst compilation process.
*   Set maximum input file size limits.
*   Implement timeouts for the compilation process.
*   Use a sandboxed environment for Typst compilation to limit resource access.
*   Consider pre-compiling or caching frequently used Typst templates.

## Attack Surface: [Abuse of Built-in Typst Functions (Potential Future Risk)](./attack_surfaces/abuse_of_built-in_typst_functions__potential_future_risk_.md)

**Description:** If Typst introduces built-in functions for file system access, network requests, or other privileged operations, malicious Typst code could abuse these functions if not properly controlled by the application.

**How Typst Contributes:** Typst's functionality could expand to include features that allow interaction with the underlying system.

**Example:**  (Hypothetical, based on potential future features) A Typst document using a `file-read()` function to access sensitive files on the server or a `network-request()` function to send data to an external server.

**Impact:**  Unauthorized access to files, data exfiltration, remote code execution (depending on the nature of the abused function).

**Risk Severity:**  Potentially High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Carefully evaluate the security implications of any new Typst features that involve system interaction.
*   Implement strict access controls and permissions for any such functions within the application.
*   Consider running Typst compilation in a highly restricted sandbox if such features are used.
*   Thoroughly validate and sanitize any user-provided Typst code if it can utilize these functions.

## Attack Surface: [Inclusion of Malicious External Resources (If Supported)](./attack_surfaces/inclusion_of_malicious_external_resources__if_supported_.md)

**Description:** If Typst allows including external resources (images, fonts, other data files) via URLs, malicious actors could use this to make requests to internal network resources or external malicious sites.

**How Typst Contributes:** Typst's functionality might allow fetching resources from external locations during compilation.

**Example:** A Typst document including an image from an internal network address that should not be accessible from the outside, potentially revealing information about the internal network structure. Or including a resource from a known malicious site.

**Impact:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), potential exposure of internal resources, fetching and processing of malicious content.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Restrict the domains or IP ranges from which Typst can fetch external resources.
*   Disable the ability to include external resources if not strictly necessary.
*   Implement robust validation and sanitization of URLs used for external resources.
*   Use a proxy server for external resource fetching to control and monitor requests.
