### 6. Detailed Component Breakdown

#### 6.1. Typst Compiler Core

*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   **Parsing:** Converts the input Typst markup into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). This involves lexical analysis and syntax analysis.
    *   **Semantic Analysis:** Checks the AST for type correctness, variable scope, and other semantic rules. This stage resolves symbols and ensures the code is meaningful.
    *   **Layout Engine:** Determines the spatial arrangement of elements on the page, considering factors like margins, spacing, and element sizes.
    *   **Rendering Engine:** Translates the layout information into the final output format (e.g., drawing commands for PDF).
    *   **Error Reporting:** Generates and presents diagnostic messages to the user during compilation.
*   **Key Aspects for Threat Modeling:**
    *   Handles untrusted user input, making it a primary target for injection and denial-of-service attacks.
    *   Complexity of parsing and semantic analysis can introduce vulnerabilities if not implemented carefully.
    *   Interaction with the Standard Library exposes potential attack vectors through malicious library calls.
    *   Resource consumption during compilation needs to be controlled to prevent resource exhaustion.

#### 6.2. Standard Library Interface

*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Provides a well-defined API for the Compiler Core to access built-in functionalities.
    *   Encapsulates common typesetting operations and data structures.
    *   May provide access to system resources or external data sources (e.g., file system for including images).
*   **Key Aspects for Threat Modeling:**
    *   Vulnerabilities within the Standard Library can be exploited by malicious Typst code.
    *   Unrestricted access to system resources through the Standard Library could lead to security breaches.
    *   The interface needs to be designed to prevent the compiler from performing unintended or unsafe operations.

#### 6.3. Input Processing Module

*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Reads the Typst markup from the input source (file or string).
    *   Handles character encoding and normalization.
    *   May perform initial pre-processing steps like stripping comments.
*   **Key Aspects for Threat Modeling:**
    *   Vulnerable to path traversal attacks if processing includes file system operations based on user input.
    *   Improper handling of character encodings could lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
    *   Large input files could be used for denial-of-service attacks.

#### 6.4. Output Generation Module

*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Takes the processed layout information and generates the final output document in the desired format (e.g., PDF).
    *   Handles embedding fonts and other resources into the output.
*   **Key Aspects for Threat Modeling:**
    *   Vulnerabilities in the output generation logic could lead to the creation of malicious output files.
    *   Improper handling of embedded resources could introduce security risks.
    *   The process needs to ensure the integrity and validity of the generated document.

#### 6.5. Resource Management

*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Locates and loads external resources referenced in the Typst document (e.g., fonts, images).
    *   May involve accessing the file system or network resources.
    *   Potentially caches resources for performance.
*   **Key Aspects for Threat Modeling:**
    *   Susceptible to path traversal vulnerabilities if resource paths are not properly sanitized.
    *   Downloading resources from untrusted sources could introduce malicious content.
    *   Resource exhaustion could occur if a document references a large number of external resources.

#### 6.6. Web Playground Environment (Optional)

*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Provides a web interface for users to write and execute Typst code.
    *   Handles communication between the frontend and the backend.
    *   Manages user sessions and potentially stores user code.
    *   Executes the Typst Compiler on the server-side.
*   **Key Aspects for Threat Modeling:**
    *   Introduces typical web application security concerns (e.g., XSS, CSRF, injection attacks).
    *   Requires robust sandboxing to prevent malicious code from affecting the server or other users.
    *   Secure handling of user data and code is crucial.
    *   Authentication and authorization mechanisms are necessary if user accounts are supported.

### 7. Data Flow

The data flow within the Typst system can be described as follows:

*   **Local Compilation:**
    1. The user provides a Typst markup file to the Typst Compiler.
    2. The **Input Processing Module** reads and prepares the input.
    3. The **Typst Compiler Core** parses the input, performs semantic analysis, and determines the layout, interacting with the **Standard Library Interface** as needed.
    4. The **Resource Management** component loads any required external resources.
    5. The **Output Generation Module** creates the final formatted document.

*   **Web Playground Compilation:**
    1. The user enters Typst markup in the web browser.
    2. The browser sends the markup to the **Web Playground Environment** on the server.
    3. The **Web Playground Environment** invokes the **Typst Compiler Core** with the provided markup.
    4. The compilation process proceeds as in local compilation, involving the **Input Processing Module**, **Standard Library Interface**, and **Resource Management**.
    5. The **Output Generation Module** produces the formatted document.
    6. The **Web Playground Environment** sends the output document back to the browser for display.

The optional Web Playground would be deployed as a web application, accessible via standard web browsers. Distribution of the command-line tool will likely involve platform-specific packages or binaries.

### 10. Security Considerations

This section outlines potential security considerations for the Typst project. A dedicated threat modeling exercise will further explore and detail these aspects.

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   The **Input Processing Module** and **Typst Compiler Core** must rigorously validate and sanitize all input markup to prevent injection attacks (e.g., command injection, cross-site scripting if rendering to web formats).
    *   Strict limits on input size and complexity should be enforced to mitigate denial-of-service attacks.
*   **Resource Access Control:**
    *   The **Resource Management** component needs to implement strict controls on accessing external resources, preventing access to sensitive files or unauthorized network locations.
    *   Consider using sandboxing or containerization to limit the compiler's access to the file system and network.
*   **Standard Library Security:**
    *   The **Standard Library Interface** must be carefully designed to prevent the compiler from performing unsafe operations.
    *   Regular security audits and testing of the Standard Library code are crucial.
*   **Memory Safety:**
    *   Leveraging Rust's memory safety features helps prevent common vulnerabilities like buffer overflows and use-after-free errors in the **Typst Compiler Core** and **Standard Library**.
*   **Web Playground Security:**
    *   Implement robust server-side input validation and output encoding to prevent XSS and other web-based attacks.
    *   Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources of content the browser is allowed to load.
    *   Employ secure authentication and authorization mechanisms for user accounts and data.
    *   Isolate the compilation process within the **Web Playground Environment** using sandboxing or virtualization to prevent malicious code execution from affecting the server.
*   **Dependency Management:**
    *   Carefully review and manage third-party dependencies to avoid introducing known vulnerabilities.
    *   Regularly update dependencies to patch security flaws.
*   **Output Security:**
    *   Ensure the **Output Generation Module** produces valid and secure output formats, preventing vulnerabilities in the generated documents (e.g., malicious PDF features).
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages.
    *   Ensure error handling logic does not introduce new vulnerabilities.
