## Deep Dive Analysis: Information Disclosure via Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Typst

This document provides a deep analysis of the identified threat – Information Disclosure via Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) through External Resource Inclusion – within the Typst application. We will delve into the attack mechanics, potential impact, affected components, and provide detailed recommendations for mitigation and prevention.

**1. Threat Breakdown and Analysis:**

**1.1. Attack Vector:**

The core of this SSRF vulnerability lies in Typst's ability to fetch and include external resources based on URLs provided within a Typst document. An attacker can exploit this by crafting a malicious document containing URLs that point to internal resources or services that are not intended to be publicly accessible.

**Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the attack:**

1. **Attacker Crafts Malicious Typst Document:** The attacker creates a `.typ` file containing directives to include external resources via URLs. These URLs are specifically crafted to target internal resources.
2. **User Compiles the Malicious Document:** A legitimate user (or a server processing user-submitted Typst documents) compiles the attacker's malicious document using the Typst compiler.
3. **Typst Compiler Resolves and Fetches External Resources:** During compilation, the Typst compiler encounters the malicious URLs and attempts to fetch the resources from the specified locations.
4. **SSRF Triggered:** Instead of fetching legitimate external resources, the compiler unknowingly makes requests to the attacker's specified internal targets.
5. **Information Disclosure:** The response from the internal resource is returned to the Typst compiler (and potentially logged or exposed in error messages), revealing information about the internal network or services.

**Examples of Malicious URLs:**

*   `image("http://localhost:6379/INFO")`: Attempts to fetch data from a local Redis instance.
*   `image("http://192.168.1.10/admin")`: Probes for an internal administration panel.
*   `image("http://internal-database:5432/healthcheck")`: Checks the health status of an internal database server.
*   `image("http://metadata.internal/latest/meta-data/")`: Attempts to access cloud provider metadata services (if the server is hosted in the cloud).

**1.2. Impact Assessment (Detailed):**

The impact of this SSRF vulnerability can be significant, leading to various security breaches:

*   **Internal Port Scanning and Service Discovery:** Attackers can use SSRF to probe the internal network, identify open ports, and discover running services. This information can be used to plan further attacks.
*   **Access to Sensitive Internal Data:** By targeting internal services, attackers can potentially access sensitive data such as:
    *   Configuration files
    *   Database credentials
    *   API keys
    *   Internal documentation
    *   User data
*   **Interaction with Internal Services:** Attackers can interact with internal services, potentially leading to:
    *   Modifying internal configurations
    *   Triggering actions within internal systems
    *   Bypassing authentication mechanisms if internal services rely on IP-based trust.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) on Internal Resources:**  A large number of requests generated through SSRF can overwhelm internal resources, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Cloud Metadata Access:** If the Typst application is running in a cloud environment, attackers can potentially access instance metadata, which can contain sensitive information like API keys, instance roles, and other configuration details. This can lead to full compromise of the cloud instance.

**1.3. Affected Typst Components (Deep Dive):**

To effectively mitigate this threat, we need to pinpoint the specific Typst components responsible for handling external resource inclusion. Based on the threat description, the following areas are likely involved:

*   **Resource Loading Mechanism:** This is the core module responsible for fetching external resources. It likely involves:
    *   **URL Parsing:**  Code that parses the provided URL strings.
    *   **HTTP Client:**  A library or function used to make HTTP requests to the specified URLs.
    *   **Resource Handling:**  Code that processes the fetched resource (e.g., decoding images, loading fonts).
*   **Specific Directives/Functions:** Identify the specific Typst syntax that triggers external resource loading. This could include:
    *   `@import url(...)`: For importing external stylesheets or other Typst files.
    *   `image(url: "...")`: For including external images.
    *   `font.load(url: "...")`: For loading external fonts.
    *   Potentially other directives that might allow referencing external resources.

**Understanding how these components interact is crucial for implementing targeted mitigation strategies.**

**1.4. Risk Severity Justification (Reinforced):**

The "High" risk severity assigned to this threat is justified due to the potential for significant impact. Successful exploitation can lead to:

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Exposure of sensitive internal data.
*   **Integrity Breach:** Potential modification of internal systems.
*   **Availability Breach:** Denial of service on internal resources.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  A security breach of this nature can severely damage the reputation of the application and the organization.
*   **Compliance Violations:**  Exposure of sensitive data may lead to violations of data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

**2. Detailed Mitigation Strategies and Implementation Considerations:**

The provided mitigation strategies are sound starting points. Let's elaborate on each with implementation considerations:

**2.1. Disable or Strictly Control External Resource Inclusion via URLs:**

*   **Implementation:**  Introduce a configuration option to completely disable the ability to include external resources via URLs. This is the most secure approach but might limit functionality.
*   **Considerations:**  Assess the impact on legitimate use cases. If external resources are essential, this option might not be feasible. Provide clear documentation on how to enable/disable this feature.

**2.2. Implement a Whitelist of Allowed External Domains or IP Addresses:**

*   **Implementation:**  Maintain a whitelist of trusted domains or IP addresses from which resource loading is permitted. The Typst compiler should only fetch resources from URLs matching this whitelist.
*   **Considerations:**
    *   **Maintenance Overhead:**  Maintaining an accurate and up-to-date whitelist can be challenging.
    *   **Granularity:**  Decide on the level of granularity (domain vs. specific paths).
    *   **User Experience:**  Provide a mechanism for users to request additions to the whitelist if necessary.
    *   **Dynamic Whitelisting:** Explore options for dynamic whitelisting based on content or other criteria, but be cautious about potential bypasses.

**2.3. Sanitize and Validate URLs Provided for External Resources:**

*   **Implementation:**  Implement robust URL parsing and validation logic. This should include:
    *   **Protocol Filtering:**  Only allow `https://` URLs. Avoid `http://`, `file://`, `ftp://`, etc.
    *   **Hostname Validation:**  Verify the hostname is a valid public domain name.
    *   **IP Address Validation:**  If IP addresses are allowed, ensure they are public IP addresses and not within private ranges (e.g., 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16).
    *   **Path Validation:**  Sanitize the path component to prevent traversal attacks or access to sensitive files.
    *   **DNS Resolution Check:**  Perform DNS resolution to verify the domain exists and resolves to a public IP address. Be mindful of DNS rebinding attacks.
*   **Considerations:**
    *   **Complexity:**  Implementing thorough URL validation can be complex and requires careful attention to detail.
    *   **Bypass Potential:**  Attackers might find creative ways to bypass validation rules. Regular security reviews are crucial.
    *   **Library Usage:**  Leverage well-vetted and maintained URL parsing libraries to avoid common pitfalls.

**2.4. Ensure the Compilation Process Does Not Have Unnecessary Access to Internal Networks:**

*   **Implementation:**  Implement network segmentation and access control policies for the server or environment where the Typst compilation process runs.
    *   **Firewall Rules:**  Configure firewalls to restrict outbound connections from the compilation server to only necessary external resources. Block access to internal network ranges.
    *   **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate the compilation environment from the internal network.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant the compilation process only the necessary network permissions.
*   **Considerations:**
    *   **Infrastructure Changes:**  Implementing network segmentation might require significant infrastructure changes.
    *   **Operational Overhead:**  Managing firewall rules and network configurations requires ongoing effort.

**3. Detection and Prevention Strategies:**

Beyond mitigation, implementing detection and prevention mechanisms is crucial:

*   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Configure IDS/IPS to detect and block suspicious outbound requests originating from the Typst compilation server, especially those targeting internal IP ranges or common internal service ports.
*   **Web Application Firewalls (WAF):** If Typst is used in a web application context, a WAF can help identify and block malicious requests containing URLs targeting internal resources.
*   **Logging and Monitoring:** Implement comprehensive logging of outbound requests made by the Typst compiler. Monitor these logs for unusual patterns or requests to internal addresses.
*   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities, including SSRF, and validate the effectiveness of implemented mitigations.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** If Typst is used to generate web content, implement a strong CSP to restrict the sources from which resources can be loaded. This can help mitigate client-side SSRF vulnerabilities.

**4. Proof of Concept (Conceptual):**

To demonstrate the vulnerability, a simple Typst document can be created:

```typst
#image(url: "http://localhost:80") // Trying to access a local web server
```

If the Typst compiler attempts to fetch this resource, it will send a request to `http://localhost:80` from the server where the compilation is happening. This could reveal information about whether a web server is running on that port.

**5. Conclusion and Recommendations:**

The Information Disclosure via SSRF through External Resource Inclusion is a serious threat to the security of applications using Typst. It is crucial to prioritize the implementation of robust mitigation strategies.

**Our primary recommendations are:**

*   **Prioritize Disabling External Resource Inclusion via URLs:** If feasible, this offers the strongest protection.
*   **Implement a Strict Whitelist:** If disabling is not an option, a well-maintained whitelist is the next best approach.
*   **Implement Thorough URL Sanitization and Validation:**  This is essential even with whitelisting as a defense-in-depth measure.
*   **Restrict Network Access:**  Limit the compilation process's access to internal networks.
*   **Implement Detection and Monitoring:**  Actively monitor for suspicious outbound requests.

By taking these steps, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of this SSRF vulnerability and protect sensitive information and internal systems. Continuous vigilance and regular security assessments are essential to maintain a secure environment.
