# Threat Model Analysis for typst/typst

## Threat: [Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Markup](./threats/arbitrary_code_execution_via_malicious_markup.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts specifically designed Typst markup that exploits vulnerabilities within the Typst compiler's parsing or processing logic. Upon compilation, this malicious markup causes the Typst process to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the application. This could involve using features intended for benign purposes in unintended ways or exploiting bugs in the compiler itself.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the server, allowing the attacker to steal sensitive data, install malware, disrupt services, or pivot to other internal systems.
    *   **Affected Typst Component:** Compiler (specifically the parser, evaluator, or code generation modules).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Run the Typst compilation process within a securely configured sandbox or container with restricted privileges and resource limits.
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization, although this can be challenging with a complex language like Typst. Focus on known potentially dangerous constructs or patterns.
        *   Keep Typst updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
        *   Consider using a security-focused compilation environment that monitors for unexpected behavior.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Resource Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__through_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides Typst markup that, when compiled, consumes excessive server resources such as CPU, memory, or disk I/O. This could be achieved through deeply nested structures, infinite loops, or the generation of extremely large output. The goal is to make the server unresponsive or crash, preventing legitimate users from accessing the application.
    *   **Impact:** Application unavailability, performance degradation for other users, potential server crashes.
    *   **Affected Typst Component:** Compiler (specifically the evaluator or layout engine).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement resource limits (CPU time, memory usage, disk space) for the Typst compilation process.
        *   Set timeouts for compilation tasks to prevent indefinitely running processes.
        *   Implement rate limiting on compilation requests to prevent a single attacker from overwhelming the system.
        *   Analyze and potentially restrict language features known to be resource-intensive.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) through External Resource Inclusion](./threats/information_disclosure_via_server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__through_external_resource_inclusion.md)

*   **Description:** If Typst allows the inclusion of external resources (e.g., images, fonts) via URLs during compilation, an attacker could provide URLs pointing to internal network resources or services. This allows the attacker to probe the internal network, potentially accessing sensitive information or interacting with internal services that are not publicly accessible.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of internal services and data, potential for further exploitation of internal systems.
    *   **Affected Typst Component:** Resource loading mechanism (e.g., functions handling `@import` or image inclusion).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Disable or strictly control the ability to include external resources via URLs.
        *   Implement a whitelist of allowed external domains or IP addresses for resource inclusion.
        *   Sanitize and validate URLs provided for external resources.
        *   Ensure the compilation process does not have unnecessary access to internal networks.

## Threat: [File System Access Abuse during Compilation](./threats/file_system_access_abuse_during_compilation.md)

*   **Description:** If the Typst compilation process has write access to the file system beyond designated temporary directories, an attacker might exploit vulnerabilities to write arbitrary files to the server. This could involve overwriting critical system files, planting malicious code, or exfiltrating data to attacker-controlled locations.
    *   **Impact:** Server compromise, data corruption, service disruption, potential for persistent malware installation.
    *   **Affected Typst Component:** File system interaction modules (e.g., functions for output generation, temporary file handling).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Run the Typst compilation process with the least necessary file system permissions.
        *   Restrict write access to specific, isolated temporary directories.
        *   Implement strict output directory controls and prevent writing to sensitive system locations.
        *   Regularly monitor file system activity for suspicious changes.
