## Attack Tree Path: [AND 1: Exploit Typst Input Handling (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/and_1_exploit_typst_input_handling__critical_node_.md)

This represents the fundamental attack vector where an attacker manipulates the input provided to the Typst compiler. If successful, it can lead to various forms of compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [OR 1.1: Inject Malicious Typst Markup (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/or_1_1_inject_malicious_typst_markup__critical_node_.md)

Attackers aim to insert harmful Typst code into the compilation process. This can be achieved if the application doesn't properly sanitize or validate user-provided input that is later used to generate Typst documents.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1: Server-Side Injection (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_server-side_injection__critical_node_.md)

This is a critical attack vector where the application dynamically generates Typst code on the server-side based on user input. If this input is not properly sanitized, an attacker can inject malicious Typst commands that will be executed with the server's privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [Goal: Execute arbitrary Typst code with server privileges (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/goal_execute_arbitrary_typst_code_with_server_privileges__critical_node_.md)

This is a high-impact goal where an attacker successfully injects and executes their own Typst code on the server. This allows them to perform actions with the server's permissions, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [AND 1.1.1.1: Application constructs Typst dynamically based on user input (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/and_1_1_1_1_application_constructs_typst_dynamically_based_on_user_input__critical_node_.md)

This highlights a specific dangerous practice. When the application builds Typst code by incorporating user-provided data, it creates an opportunity for injection attacks if the input is not carefully handled.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.1.2: Inject commands that could lead to resource exhaustion during compilation](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_1_2_inject_commands_that_could_lead_to_resource_exhaustion_during_compilation.md)

Attackers can inject Typst commands or structures that are computationally expensive for the Typst compiler to process. This can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) by overwhelming the server's resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.2: Exploit vulnerabilities in Typst's parsing or rendering logic (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_2_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_typst's_parsing_or_rendering_logic__critical_node_.md)

This involves leveraging known or zero-day vulnerabilities within the Typst library itself. By crafting specific malicious Typst input, an attacker can trigger these vulnerabilities, potentially leading to crashes, unexpected behavior, or even code execution within the Typst process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Goal: Trigger crashes, unexpected output, or potential code execution within Typst (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/goal_trigger_crashes__unexpected_output__or_potential_code_execution_within_typst__critical_node_.md)

This is a significant goal for attackers. Crashing the Typst process can lead to DoS. Unexpected output might reveal sensitive information or lead to application errors. Code execution within Typst, even if not with full server privileges, can still be leveraged for malicious purposes.

## Attack Tree Path: [AND 2: Exploit Typst Compilation Process (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/and_2_exploit_typst_compilation_process__critical_node_.md)

This attack vector focuses on vulnerabilities or weaknesses within the Typst compilation process itself, regardless of the input.

## Attack Tree Path: [OR 2.1: Trigger Vulnerabilities within the Typst Compiler (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/or_2_1_trigger_vulnerabilities_within_the_typst_compiler__critical_node_.md)

Attackers directly target flaws in the Typst compiler's code. These vulnerabilities could be related to memory management, logic errors, or improper handling of certain input conditions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Goal: Cause crashes, unexpected behavior, or potentially gain code execution during compilation (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/goal_cause_crashes__unexpected_behavior__or_potentially_gain_code_execution_during_compilation__crit_dc0f2ef4.md)

Similar to the input manipulation goal, this aims to disrupt the compilation process or gain control during it. Successful exploitation can have severe consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1: Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1_memory_corruption_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

This is a specific type of vulnerability within the Typst compiler where memory is mishandled. Attackers can exploit these flaws to overwrite memory locations, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the process running the Typst compiler. This is a high-impact and often difficult-to-detect vulnerability.
