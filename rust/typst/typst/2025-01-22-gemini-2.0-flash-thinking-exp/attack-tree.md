## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Typst Input Processing [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_typst_input_processing__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted Typst input designed to exploit vulnerabilities during the parsing or processing stage of Typst.
    *   **Breakdown:**
        *   **Server-Side Scripting Injection [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Description:** If the application processes Typst output on the server-side (e.g., parsing intermediate formats, using callbacks), attackers can inject malicious scripts into the Typst input. These scripts are then executed by the server when processing the output.
            *   **Example:** Injecting code that gets executed when the application parses a specific Typst output format (if such interaction exists).
        *   **Path Traversal / File System Access [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Description:** Attackers exploit Typst features that handle file paths (e.g., font loading, image inclusion) to access files outside the intended directories.
            *   **Example:** Using `../` sequences in file paths within Typst input to read sensitive files on the server.
            *   **Read Arbitrary Files [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                *   **Description:** Successful path traversal leading to unauthorized reading of files.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Description:** Crafting Typst input that causes Typst to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O), leading to service disruption.
            *   **Example:** Using deeply nested structures or very large documents in Typst input to overload the server.
            *   **Resource Exhaustion [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                *   **Description:** Successful DoS attack by exhausting server resources.
        *   **Information Disclosure [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Description:** Triggering Typst or the application to reveal sensitive information through error messages or other outputs.
            *   **Example:** Crafting input that causes verbose error messages containing internal paths or configuration details.
            *   **Reveal Internal Paths/Configurations [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
                *   **Description:** Successful information disclosure revealing sensitive system information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Typst Binary Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_typst_binary_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities directly within the Typst binary itself.
    *   **Breakdown:**
        *   **Known Vulnerabilities (CVEs) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Description:** Exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) present in the specific version of Typst used by the application.
            *   **Example:** Using readily available exploits for known buffer overflows or other vulnerabilities in Typst.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Application's Typst Integration [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_application's_typst_integration__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities arising from how the application integrates and uses Typst. This is often a more likely attack surface than core Typst vulnerabilities.
    *   **Breakdown:**
        *   **Insecure Input Handling [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Description:** Weak or missing input validation and sanitization in the application's code that handles user-provided Typst input before passing it to Typst.
            *   **Example:**  Failing to sanitize user input, allowing malicious Typst markup to bypass security checks and be processed.
        *   **Insecure Output Handling [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in how the application handles the output generated by Typst (e.g., PDFs, images). This could include insecure storage, serving with incorrect headers, or vulnerable post-processing.
            *   **Example:** Storing generated PDFs in publicly accessible directories without proper access controls.
        *   **Dependency Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Description:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in the libraries and dependencies that Typst relies upon.
            *   **Example:**  Typst using an outdated and vulnerable version of a font rendering library, which is then exploited.
