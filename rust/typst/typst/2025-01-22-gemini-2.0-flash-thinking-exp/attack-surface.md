# Attack Surface Analysis for typst/typst

## Attack Surface: [Maliciously Crafted Typst Source Files (.typ)](./attack_surfaces/maliciously_crafted_typst_source_files___typ_.md)

*   **Description:**  Typst processes user-provided `.typ` files. Malicious files can be designed to exploit vulnerabilities in Typst's parser, compiler, or runtime, potentially leading to severe consequences.
*   **Typst Contribution:** Typst's core functionality is to interpret and execute code within `.typ` files, making it inherently vulnerable to malicious input if vulnerabilities exist in its processing logic.
*   **Example:** A user uploads a `.typ` file that exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in Typst's parser. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server processing the file.
*   **Impact:**  **Critical:** Code Execution, Denial of Service (DoS), Information Disclosure, potentially complete system compromise depending on the vulnerability and execution context.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation and Fuzzing:** Implement robust input validation where feasible and utilize fuzzing techniques to proactively identify parsing and compilation vulnerabilities in Typst.
    *   **Resource Limits:** Enforce strict CPU, memory, and time limits on Typst processing to mitigate DoS attempts, even if code execution is not directly achieved.
    *   **Sandboxing:**  Run Typst in a heavily sandboxed environment with minimal privileges to contain the impact of any successful exploit. Consider using secure containerization or virtual machines.
    *   **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:** Conduct regular security audits of Typst's codebase and perform thorough code reviews, especially for parser and compiler components.
    *   **Regular Updates:**  Immediately update Typst to the latest versions to patch any discovered critical vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Typst's Ecosystem](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_typst's_ecosystem.md)

*   **Description:** Typst relies on numerous third-party Rust crates for core functionalities. Critical vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be directly exploited through Typst, inheriting the risk.
*   **Typst Contribution:** Typst's architecture depends on external libraries, and vulnerabilities in these libraries become vulnerabilities in Typst itself when exploited through Typst's functionalities.
*   **Example:** A critical vulnerability is discovered in a Rust crate used by Typst for font rendering that allows for remote code execution when processing a malicious font file included in a `.typ` document. An attacker could exploit this by crafting a `.typ` file with a malicious font.
*   **Impact:** **Critical:** Code Execution, Denial of Service (DoS), Information Disclosure, potentially complete system compromise depending on the vulnerability and affected dependency.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High to Critical** (Severity depends on the specific vulnerability and the affected dependency's role).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Automated Dependency Auditing:** Implement automated dependency auditing using tools like `cargo audit` in CI/CD pipelines to continuously monitor for known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Proactive Dependency Updates:**  Establish a process for promptly updating Typst's dependencies, especially critical and high-risk ones, following security advisories.
    *   **Dependency Pinning and Locking:** Use `Cargo.lock` to ensure reproducible builds and to manage dependency updates in a controlled manner.
    *   **Vulnerability Monitoring and Alerting:** Subscribe to security advisories for Rust crates and Typst itself to receive timely notifications about new vulnerabilities.
    *   **Consider Dependency Security Policies:**  Evaluate and potentially implement policies for selecting and managing dependencies, prioritizing crates with strong security track records and active maintenance.
