# Threat Model Analysis for typst/typst

## Threat: [Parsing Vulnerabilities](./threats/parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

  **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious Typst document containing syntax that exploits a weakness in the Typst parser. This could cause the parser to crash, hang indefinitely, or potentially execute arbitrary code on the server processing the document. The attacker might submit this document through an upload form, API endpoint, or any other input mechanism that processes Typst documents.
  *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing the application or consuming excessive resources. In a worst-case scenario, Remote Code Execution (RCE) could allow the attacker to gain control of the server.
  *   **Affected Typst Component:** `typst/compiler/parser` module.
  *   **Risk Severity:** High
  *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
      *   Keep the `typst` library updated to the latest version to benefit from parser bug fixes.
      *   Implement input validation to reject overly complex or large Typst documents before parsing.
      *   Consider using fuzzing techniques to test the parser for vulnerabilities with a wide range of inputs.
      *   Run Typst processing in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of potential RCE.
