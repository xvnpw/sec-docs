# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for typst/typst

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Syntax Validation](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_syntax_validation.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Define a clear and restrictive grammar for the allowed Typst syntax that users can provide, focusing on necessary features.
    2.  Implement validation *before* Typst compilation using regular expressions or a dedicated parser to check against the defined grammar.
    3.  Reject invalid input with informative error messages.
    4.  Utilize a "safe subset" of Typst features, disallowing potentially risky ones.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unexpected Parsing Behavior (Medium Severity): Exploiting parser vulnerabilities through crafted Typst input.
    *   Resource Exhaustion (Low Severity): DoS via complex syntax consuming excessive parsing resources.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unexpected Parsing Behavior: High - Significantly reduces parser exploit risks.
    *   Resource Exhaustion: Medium - Reduces DoS risk from syntax complexity.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partial - Basic regex-based frontend validation.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Backend validation with a dedicated Typst parser, definition and enforcement of a strict Typst grammar.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Feature Whitelisting](./mitigation_strategies/feature_whitelisting.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify the minimal Typst feature set required for application functionality.
    2.  Create a whitelist of allowed Typst commands, functions, and packages.
    3.  Restrict Typst compiler to only use whitelisted features through pre-processing, configuration, or a compiler wrapper.
    4.  Regularly review and update the whitelist for security and evolving needs.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Abuse of Powerful Features (Medium to High Severity): Misuse of legitimate Typst features for malicious purposes (e.g., file access if introduced in future).
    *   Unintended Functionality (Low to Medium Severity): Unexpected behavior from unnecessary features increasing complexity.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Abuse of Powerful Features: High - Prevents exploitation of disallowed features.
    *   Unintended Functionality: Medium - Reduces risks from a larger feature set.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No - All Typst features are implicitly allowed.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Feature analysis, whitelist creation, and enforcement mechanism implementation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Length and Complexity Limits](./mitigation_strategies/input_length_and_complexity_limits.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Define limits for Typst input size and complexity (nesting depth, elements) based on application needs and resources.
    2.  Enforce these limits *before* Typst compilation.
    3.  Reject exceeding input with error messages.
    4.  Consider dynamic limits based on user roles or context.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity): DoS by overwhelming compilation resources with large/complex input.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): Medium - Mitigates resource exhaustion DoS by limiting input.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partial - Basic frontend character limit.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Backend enforcement of size and complexity limits, complexity metrics implementation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Context-Aware Data Sanitization](./mitigation_strategies/context-aware_data_sanitization.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify all points where user data is incorporated into Typst documents.
    2.  Analyze the context of data usage within Typst markup.
    3.  Implement context-aware sanitization/escaping of user data *before* embedding in Typst, escaping special Typst characters based on context (e.g., string escaping).
    4.  Prefer Typst's parameterization/templating for data insertion over string concatenation if available.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Typst Injection (Potential Medium to High Severity): Injection of malicious Typst code via unsanitized user data, potentially leading to unintended actions or information disclosure (if Typst gains more features).
*   **Impact:**
    *   Typst Injection: High - Prevents injection by treating user data as data, not code.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No - Direct embedding of user data into Typst strings without sanitization.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Context-aware escaping functions, refactoring data insertion to use safer parameterization if possible.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limits for Compilation Process](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limits_for_compilation_process.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Implement OS-level or container-based resource limits for Typst compilation.
    2.  Set limits for:
        *   CPU Time
        *   Memory Usage
        *   Output File Size
        *   Compilation Timeout
    3.  Use tools like `ulimit`, container resource limits, or process management libraries.
    4.  Monitor and adjust limits based on performance and load.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion (High Severity): DoS from resource-intensive Typst compilation.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): High - Effectively mitigates resource exhaustion DoS.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partial - Backend compilation service timeout implemented.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  CPU and memory limits, output file size limits.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sandboxing the Typst Compiler](./mitigation_strategies/sandboxing_the_typst_compiler.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Isolate the Typst compiler in a sandbox to restrict system and network access.
    2.  Use sandboxing technologies:
        *   Containers (Docker, Podman) - Recommended for good isolation.
        *   Virtual Machines (Lightweight VMs) - Stronger isolation for highly untrusted input.
        *   OS-level sandboxing (seccomp, AppArmor, SELinux) - Requires deeper system configuration.
    3.  Minimize compiler privileges and access within the sandbox.
    4.  Regularly review and update sandbox configuration.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   System Compromise (High Severity): Limiting attacker's ability to compromise the system if Typst has code execution vulnerabilities.
    *   Data Breaches (Medium to High Severity): Restricting access to sensitive data outside the sandbox.
*   **Impact:**
    *   System Compromise: High - Significantly reduces impact of code execution vulnerabilities.
    *   Data Breaches: Medium - Reduces risk of unauthorized data access.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes - Typst compiler runs in a Docker container.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Hardening Docker container with restrictive security profiles (seccomp, AppArmor/SELinux).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Control File System Access](./mitigation_strategies/control_file_system_access.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Restrict Typst compiler's file system access to the minimum necessary.
    2.  Configure sandbox or compiler process to limit access.
    3.  Specifically:
        *   Restrict Working Directory: to a temporary, isolated directory.
        *   Font/Resource Whitelisting: Whitelist font directories, deny other access.
        *   Disable File Writing: If possible, configure Typst to operate without file writing.
    4.  Regularly review file system access restrictions.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Local File Inclusion/Traversal (Potential Medium to High Severity): If Typst gains file inclusion features, uncontrolled access could allow reading sensitive files.
    *   Data Exfiltration (Medium Severity): Potential data exfiltration if compiler has write access.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Local File Inclusion/Traversal: High - Prevents file inclusion/traversal attacks.
    *   Data Exfiltration: Low - Reduces data exfiltration risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partial - Docker container restricts access, but font directories are mounted without specific whitelisting.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Explicit font directory whitelisting in container, stricter working directory permissions, disabling file writing if feasible.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Output Format Validation](./mitigation_strategies/output_format_validation.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  If expecting a specific output format (e.g., PDF), validate the generated output.
    2.  Use format-specific libraries to verify structure, integrity, and standard conformance (e.g., PDF parsing libraries).
    3.  Reject or handle unexpected/malformed output gracefully, log validation failures.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Output Manipulation (Low to Medium Severity): Detecting manipulated/malformed output from Typst vulnerabilities.
    *   Downstream Vulnerabilities (Low Severity): Reducing risk of malformed output triggering vulnerabilities in output processing systems.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Output Manipulation: Medium - Prevents use of potentially manipulated output.
    *   Downstream Vulnerabilities: Low - Reduces risk in output processing systems.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No - Output assumed correct without validation.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Output format validation, especially for PDF, using parsing libraries.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Handling of Generated Output](./mitigation_strategies/secure_handling_of_generated_output.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Handle output securely based on format and content sensitivity.
    2.  For PDF:
        *   Apply password protection/access control for sensitive content.
        *   Be aware of PDF vulnerabilities, keep PDF libraries updated.
        *   Use CSP headers when displaying PDFs in browsers.
    3.  For future HTML output:
        *   Thoroughly sanitize HTML output to prevent XSS using sanitization libraries.
        *   Implement robust CSP headers.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Information Disclosure (Medium to High Severity): Insecure handling of sensitive output leading to disclosure.
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - (Potential High Severity): XSS vulnerabilities in future HTML output if not sanitized.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information Disclosure: Medium - Reduces risk of unauthorized access to output data.
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): High - Prevents XSS in potential future HTML output.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partial - Basic CSP headers, no PDF security measures. HTML output not currently generated.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  PDF security measures (password protection, access control). Planning for HTML sanitization and CSP for future HTML output.
