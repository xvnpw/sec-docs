# Deep Analysis: Strict Typst Feature Whitelisting

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly evaluate the "Strict Typst Feature Whitelisting" mitigation strategy for its effectiveness in preventing security vulnerabilities within a Typst-based application.  This includes assessing its feasibility, identifying potential implementation gaps, and proposing concrete steps for its realization.  We aim to provide actionable recommendations for the development team.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on the "Strict Typst Feature Whitelisting" strategy as described.  It considers:

*   The Typst compiler (version 0.10 as per the provided GitHub link, but acknowledging that future versions may introduce changes).
*   Potential attack vectors related to Typst feature abuse (RCE, XSS, DoS).
*   The practical implementation challenges of enforcing a whitelist.
*   The interaction between this strategy and other potential security measures.
*   The analysis does *not* cover general application security best practices (e.g., input validation, output encoding) *except* where they directly relate to the Typst feature whitelisting.

**Methodology:**

1.  **Typst Documentation Review:**  Exhaustively examine the official Typst documentation (including the guide, reference, and any available developer documentation) to identify:
    *   Existing security features or recommendations.
    *   Mechanisms for controlling compiler behavior (command-line flags, configuration files, API options).
    *   Descriptions of potentially dangerous features.
2.  **Typst Source Code Examination (Targeted):**  If documentation is insufficient, perform a targeted examination of the Typst compiler's source code (available on GitHub) to:
    *   Identify how features are parsed and processed.
    *   Look for potential hooks for feature control.
    *   Assess the feasibility of implementing a custom preprocessor.
3.  **Vulnerability Research:** Search for known vulnerabilities or security discussions related to Typst (though, given its relative newness, this may be limited).
4.  **Implementation Scenario Analysis:**  Develop concrete scenarios for how the whitelisting strategy could be implemented, considering different application architectures and Typst integration methods.
5.  **Risk Assessment:**  Evaluate the residual risk after implementing the strategy, considering potential bypasses or limitations.
6.  **Recommendations:** Provide clear, actionable recommendations for implementing and maintaining the whitelisting strategy.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Mitigation Strategy

**2.1.  Description Review and Clarifications:**

The provided description is a good starting point, but we need to refine it based on Typst's specifics.  The key challenge is step 3: "Disable Unlisted Features (Compiler Configuration)."  The success of this strategy *hinges* on the ability to control the Typst compiler's behavior.

**2.2.  Typst Documentation and Source Code Analysis (Key Findings):**

*   **No Built-in Whitelisting:**  As of Typst v0.10, the official documentation and a review of the command-line interface (`typst compile --help`) reveal *no* built-in mechanism for feature whitelisting or a "safe mode."  There are no flags like `--disable-raw` or `--disable-math`.
*   **Limited Configuration Options:** Typst's configuration options are primarily focused on output formatting (page size, fonts, etc.) and do *not* provide security-related settings.
*   **`raw` Block is a Major Concern:** The `raw` block feature, which allows embedding raw content (e.g., HTML, LaTeX), is a significant security risk if misused.  This is a prime example of a feature that *must* be disabled in most untrusted input scenarios.
*   **`query` Function:** The `query` function, which allows querying elements within the document, could potentially be abused for information disclosure or DoS if not carefully controlled.
*   **Module Imports:** Typst supports importing external modules.  This introduces a potential attack vector if untrusted modules are allowed.  Strict control over module imports is crucial.
*   **No Apparent API for Feature Control:** While Typst is primarily used as a command-line tool, it's also a Rust library.  However, a cursory examination of the API documentation doesn't reveal obvious methods for controlling enabled features at compile time.  Deeper investigation might be needed, but it's unlikely.
* **WASM Compilation:** Typst can compile to WASM. This opens another attack vector.

**2.3.  Threats Mitigated (Detailed Assessment):**

*   **RCE via Typst Features:**
    *   **`raw` Block:**  The most direct path to RCE.  An attacker could inject raw HTML containing malicious JavaScript, leading to XSS and potentially further compromise.  Whitelisting *must* disable this.
    *   **Module Imports:**  Malicious modules could contain arbitrary code.  Strict control over allowed modules is essential.
    *   **Other Features (Potential):**  While less obvious, other features *might* have undiscovered vulnerabilities that could lead to RCE.  A strict whitelist minimizes this risk.
*   **XSS via Typst Features:**
    *   **`raw` Block (Again):**  The primary vector for XSS.
    *   **Potentially Other Features:**  Any feature that allows embedding content or manipulating the output DOM could be a potential XSS vector.
*   **DoS via Complex Typst Features:**
    *   **Complex Layouts/Calculations:**  Intentionally crafted Typst documents with extremely complex layouts or mathematical expressions could consume excessive resources.
    *   **`query` Function Abuse:**  Repeated or complex queries could overload the compiler.
    *   **Large Images/Files:**  While not strictly a Typst feature, embedding very large images or other files could lead to DoS.

**2.4.  Impact (Refined):**

The impact remains largely as described, but with the added understanding that the effectiveness is *entirely dependent* on the ability to enforce the whitelist.

**2.5.  Currently Implemented (Confirmed):**

As suspected, there is **no built-in whitelisting mechanism** in Typst v0.10.

**2.6.  Missing Implementation (Critical Gaps):**

The core missing piece is the **enforcement mechanism**.  Since Typst doesn't provide built-in options, we must consider alternatives:

*   **Custom Preprocessor (Most Likely Solution):**  This is the most feasible, albeit complex, approach.  It would involve:
    1.  **Parsing the Typst Input:**  Using a robust Typst parser (potentially leveraging the Typst compiler's own parsing library, if accessible).
    2.  **Analyzing the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST):**  Traversing the AST to identify all used Typst features.
    3.  **Whitelist Validation:**  Comparing the identified features against the predefined whitelist.
    4.  **Rejection or Sanitization:**  If non-whitelisted features are found, either:
        *   Reject the entire input (recommended for untrusted input).
        *   Attempt to sanitize the input by removing or replacing the offending features (more complex and error-prone).
    5.  **Passing to Typst Compiler:**  Only if the input passes validation, pass the (potentially sanitized) input to the Typst compiler.

*   **Compiler Modification (Highly Complex, Less Recommended):**  Forking the Typst compiler and adding whitelisting functionality directly would be a significant undertaking, requiring deep understanding of the compiler's internals and ongoing maintenance.  This is generally not recommended unless absolutely necessary.

*   **WASM Sandboxing (For WASM Compilation):** If the application uses Typst's WASM compilation, a robust WASM sandbox is *essential*.  This sandbox should restrict the WASM module's access to system resources and prevent it from executing arbitrary code.

## 3. Recommendations

1.  **Implement a Custom Preprocessor:** This is the most practical and recommended approach.  Prioritize a robust parsing library and a well-defined whitelist.
    *   **Prioritize Rejection:** For untrusted input, reject any input containing non-whitelisted features.  Sanitization is significantly more complex and prone to bypasses.
    *   **Leverage Typst's Parser (If Possible):**  If the Typst compiler's parsing library is accessible and usable, leverage it to avoid reimplementing a parser.
    *   **Regularly Update the Preprocessor:**  As Typst evolves, the preprocessor may need updates to handle new features or changes in syntax.

2.  **Define a Strict Whitelist:**  Start with the absolute minimum set of features required by your application.  Err on the side of caution.  Examples:
    *   **Basic Text Formatting:** `#text`, `#strong`, `#emph`, `#underline`
    *   **Lists:** `#list`, `#enum`
    *   **Images:** `#image` (with strict size and format restrictions)
    *   **Headings:** `#heading`
    *   **Explicitly *Disallow*:** `raw`, `query`, `include`, and any features related to scripting or external module imports.

3.  **Input Validation (Beyond Whitelisting):**  Even with whitelisting, perform thorough input validation:
    *   **Length Limits:**  Impose reasonable length limits on all text inputs.
    *   **Character Restrictions:**  Restrict allowed characters to prevent injection attacks.
    *   **Image Validation:**  Validate image dimensions, file sizes, and formats.

4.  **WASM Sandboxing (If Applicable):** If using WASM compilation, implement a robust WASM sandbox.

5.  **Monitor Typst Development:**  Stay informed about new Typst releases and security advisories.  Be prepared to update the preprocessor and whitelist as needed.

6.  **Security Audits:**  Regularly conduct security audits of the application, including the preprocessor and whitelisting implementation.

7.  **Consider Alternatives (If Feasible):** If the complexity of implementing a secure preprocessor is prohibitive, consider alternative typesetting solutions that offer better built-in security features.

## 4. Conclusion

The "Strict Typst Feature Whitelisting" strategy is a crucial security measure for mitigating RCE, XSS, and DoS vulnerabilities in Typst-based applications. However, its effectiveness depends entirely on the ability to enforce the whitelist.  Because Typst does not provide built-in mechanisms for this, a custom preprocessor is the most viable solution.  This requires careful design, implementation, and ongoing maintenance.  By following the recommendations outlined above, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of security vulnerabilities related to Typst feature abuse.
