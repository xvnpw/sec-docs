# Deep Analysis of Typst Package Management Attack Vector: Malicious Package

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**  To thoroughly analyze the "Malicious Package" attack vector within Typst's package management system, focusing on the sub-vectors "Typst Code" and "Typst Code (Init)".  The goal is to understand the specific vulnerabilities, exploitation techniques, potential impacts, and mitigation strategies related to this attack path.  We aim to provide actionable recommendations for the Typst development team to enhance the security of the package management system.

**Scope:** This analysis focuses exclusively on the following attack tree path:

*   **I. Exploit Typst Package Management**
    *   **3. Malicious Package [CRITICAL]**
        *   **3a. Typst Code [CRITICAL]**
        *   **3b. Typst Code (Init) [CRITICAL]**

We will *not* analyze other potential attack vectors within the Typst ecosystem (e.g., vulnerabilities in the Typst compiler itself, attacks on the web interface, etc.) unless they directly relate to the execution of malicious code introduced through a package.  We will consider the entire lifecycle of a package, from publication to installation and execution.

**Methodology:**

1.  **Threat Modeling:** We will use the provided attack tree as a starting point and expand upon it by considering various attack scenarios and techniques.
2.  **Code Review (Hypothetical):**  While we don't have direct access to the Typst package manager's source code, we will make informed assumptions about its likely implementation based on common package management practices and the Typst documentation.  We will identify potential areas of weakness based on these assumptions.
3.  **Vulnerability Analysis:** We will analyze potential vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to inject and execute malicious code through a Typst package.
4.  **Exploitation Scenario Development:** We will create concrete examples of how an attacker might exploit the identified vulnerabilities.
5.  **Impact Assessment:** We will assess the potential impact of successful exploitation, considering various levels of compromise (e.g., data exfiltration, system takeover, denial of service).
6.  **Mitigation Recommendation:** We will propose specific, actionable recommendations to mitigate the identified vulnerabilities and reduce the risk of this attack vector.
7. **Dependency Analysis:** We will analyze how dependencies of malicious package can be used to increase impact.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Tree Path

### 2.1.  Malicious Package (3)

**Description (Expanded):**  An attacker creates and publishes a package to the Typst package repository (or a compromised mirror) that appears legitimate but contains malicious code.  The package might masquerade as a popular utility, a useful library, or even a seemingly innocuous theme.  The attacker's goal is to trick users into installing and using this package, thereby executing the malicious code on their systems.

**Likelihood (Justification):** Medium.  While Typst is a relatively new project, the general threat of malicious packages in package repositories is well-established (e.g., npm, PyPI, RubyGems).  The lack of established, robust security review processes for new packages increases the likelihood.

**Impact (Justification):** Very High (RCE).  Typst code, by its nature, has access to the file system and potentially other system resources.  Malicious code could read, write, or delete files, exfiltrate data, install further malware, or even achieve full remote code execution (RCE).

**Effort (Justification):** Medium.  Creating a convincing malicious package requires some effort in designing the package's functionality and potentially obfuscating the malicious code.  However, the process of publishing a package is likely straightforward.

**Skill Level (Justification):** Intermediate.  The attacker needs a good understanding of Typst syntax and how to interact with the system from within Typst code.  They also need some knowledge of social engineering to make the package appear legitimate.

**Detection Difficulty (Justification):** Medium/Hard.  Detecting malicious code can be challenging, especially if the attacker uses obfuscation techniques or if the malicious code is only executed under specific conditions.  Automated analysis tools may have limited effectiveness, and manual code review is time-consuming.

### 2.2. Typst Code (3a)

**Description (Expanded):** The malicious code is embedded directly within the main Typst files of the package (e.g., `main.typ`, or other `.typ` files called by `main.typ`).  This code is executed when a user calls functions or uses features provided by the package.

**Likelihood (Justification):** Medium.  This is a straightforward approach for an attacker, as it's the most obvious place to include functionality.

**Impact (Justification):** Very High (RCE).  Same as the parent vector.

**Effort (Justification):** Medium.  Slightly easier than the "Init" variant, as the attacker doesn't need to worry about initialization hooks.

**Skill Level (Justification):** Intermediate.  Same as the parent vector.

**Detection Difficulty (Justification):** Medium.  Easier to detect than the "Init" variant, as the code is likely to be more directly related to the package's advertised functionality, making deviations more apparent.

**Exploitation Scenario:**

1.  **Attacker's Actions:**
    *   The attacker creates a package named `useful-pdf-utils` that claims to provide helpful functions for manipulating PDF documents.
    *   Within `main.typ`, the attacker includes a function called `process-pdf` that takes a file path as input.
    *   Hidden within the `process-pdf` function, the attacker adds code that reads the user's SSH private key (`~/.ssh/id_rsa`) and sends it to a remote server controlled by the attacker.  This is done using Typst's file I/O capabilities and potentially network capabilities (if available).  The attacker might use `read` and a hypothetical `http.post` function.
    *   The attacker publishes the `useful-pdf-utils` package to the Typst package repository.

2.  **Victim's Actions:**
    *   A user searches for a Typst package to help with PDF processing.
    *   They find the `useful-pdf-utils` package and install it.
    *   The user calls the `process-pdf` function in their Typst document, providing the path to a PDF file.
    *   The malicious code within `process-pdf` executes, stealing the user's SSH key.

### 2.3. Typst Code (Init) (3b)

**Description (Expanded):** The malicious code is placed within code that executes during the package's initialization phase.  This could be code that runs when the package is first imported, installed, or when the Typst compiler starts up (if the package management system allows for such hooks).  This is a more stealthy approach, as the malicious code might execute before the user explicitly uses any of the package's functions.

**Likelihood (Justification):** Medium.  Attackers often prefer stealth, and initialization code provides a good opportunity for that.

**Impact (Justification):** Very High (RCE).  Same as the parent vector.

**Effort (Justification):** Medium.  Requires a deeper understanding of how Typst handles package initialization.

**Skill Level (Justification):** Intermediate.  Same as the parent vector.

**Detection Difficulty (Justification):** Hard.  Initialization code is often less scrutinized than the main package code, and it might be executed in a less predictable context, making it harder to detect anomalies.

**Exploitation Scenario:**

1.  **Attacker's Actions:**
    *   The attacker creates a package named `beautiful-themes` that provides visually appealing themes for Typst documents.
    *   The attacker discovers (or assumes) that Typst executes a specific function (e.g., `__init__.typ` or a similar convention) when a package is imported.
    *   Within this initialization function, the attacker adds code that downloads a malicious executable from a remote server and executes it in the background.  This could be achieved using Typst's file I/O and process execution capabilities (if available). The attacker might use a hypothetical `http.get`, `write`, and `exec` function.
    *   The attacker publishes the `beautiful-themes` package.

2.  **Victim's Actions:**
    *   A user searches for Typst themes and installs the `beautiful-themes` package.
    *   The user imports the package in their Typst document using `#import "@user/beautiful-themes"`.
    *   The initialization code within the package executes *immediately* upon import, downloading and running the malicious executable.  The user is compromised even before they use any of the theme's features.

### 2.4 Dependency Analysis

Malicious packages can leverage dependencies to increase their impact and evade detection. Here's how:

1.  **Compromised Dependency:** The attacker might not directly inject malicious code into their published package. Instead, they could compromise a *dependency* of their package.  If the dependency is widely used, the attacker's malicious code could be indirectly executed by many users who install seemingly unrelated packages.

2.  **Typosquatting:** The attacker could create a package with a name very similar to a popular, legitimate package (e.g., `usefull-utils` instead of `useful-utils`).  Users might accidentally install the malicious package due to a typo.  This malicious package could then declare the legitimate package as a dependency, ensuring that the user gets the functionality they expect, while also executing the attacker's code.

3.  **Dependency Confusion:** If Typst's package manager doesn't properly distinguish between internal (private) and external (public) packages, an attacker could publish a malicious package with the same name as an internal dependency used by a legitimate package.  The package manager might then mistakenly install the attacker's malicious package instead of the intended internal dependency.

## 3. Mitigation Recommendations

The following recommendations are crucial for securing Typst's package management system against the analyzed attack vector:

1.  **Sandboxing:**
    *   **Implement a robust sandboxing mechanism for Typst code execution.** This is the *most critical* mitigation.  The sandbox should strictly limit the capabilities of Typst code, preventing it from accessing sensitive system resources (e.g., arbitrary files, network connections, process execution) without explicit user permission.  This could involve:
        *   **Capability-based security:**  Packages would need to declare the capabilities they require (e.g., "read files in the project directory," "access network").  The user would be prompted to grant these capabilities during installation or execution.
        *   **Virtualization or containerization:**  Typst code could be executed within a lightweight virtual machine or container, isolating it from the host system.
        *   **WebAssembly (Wasm):**  Consider compiling Typst code to WebAssembly, which provides a built-in sandboxed execution environment.

2.  **Package Signing and Verification:**
    *   **Require all packages to be digitally signed by their authors.** This allows users to verify the authenticity and integrity of a package.
    *   **Implement a system for verifying package signatures before installation.**  This prevents attackers from publishing packages under a false identity.
    *   **Consider using a "chain of trust" model,** where trusted authorities can vouch for the identities of package authors.

3.  **Package Review Process:**
    *   **Establish a process for reviewing new packages before they are made publicly available.** This could involve:
        *   **Automated analysis:**  Use static analysis tools to scan packages for potentially malicious code patterns.
        *   **Manual review:**  Have human reviewers examine the code of new packages, especially those that request sensitive capabilities.
        *   **Community-based review:**  Allow trusted members of the Typst community to review and flag suspicious packages.

4.  **Dependency Management:**
    *   **Implement robust dependency management features to prevent dependency confusion and typosquatting attacks.**
    *   **Clearly distinguish between internal and external dependencies.**
    *   **Use version pinning and lockfiles to ensure that the correct versions of dependencies are installed.**
    *   **Provide tools for auditing dependencies and identifying potential vulnerabilities.**

5.  **User Education:**
    *   **Educate users about the risks of installing untrusted packages.**
    *   **Encourage users to carefully review the capabilities requested by a package before installing it.**
    *   **Provide clear and concise documentation on how to report suspicious packages.**

6.  **Least Privilege:**
    *   **Ensure that the Typst compiler and runtime environment operate with the least privilege necessary.**  This limits the potential damage that can be caused by a compromised package.

7.  **Regular Security Audits:**
    *   **Conduct regular security audits of the Typst package management system and related components.** This helps identify and address vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.

8.  **Initialization Code Restrictions:**
     *  **Minimize or eliminate the ability for packages to execute arbitrary code during initialization.** If initialization code is necessary, strictly limit its capabilities and subject it to rigorous review.  Ideally, initialization should only be used for setting up internal package state, not for interacting with the external environment.

By implementing these recommendations, the Typst development team can significantly reduce the risk of malicious packages compromising user systems and build a more secure and trustworthy package ecosystem. The sandboxing recommendation is paramount; without it, the other mitigations are significantly less effective.
