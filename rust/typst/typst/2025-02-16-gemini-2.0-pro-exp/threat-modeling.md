# Threat Model Analysis for typst/typst

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Malicious Font Handling](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_malicious_font_handling.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads a crafted Typst document that references a malicious or extremely large font file. The attacker could embed a font with an excessive number of glyphs, complex outlines, or corrupted data designed to cause the font parsing and rendering routines in Typst to consume excessive CPU, memory, or even crash.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) against the Typst compilation service, potentially affecting the entire web application. Other users may be unable to compile documents.
*   **Typst Component Affected:** `font` module, specifically functions related to font loading, parsing (e.g., `ttf-parser` crate or similar), and rendering. Potentially also the `layout` module if font metrics are involved in layout calculations.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Font Validation:** Before passing a font to Typst, validate it using a separate, robust font validation library (e.g., FontTools in Python). Check for structural integrity, reasonable glyph counts, and other sanity checks.
    *   **Resource Limits:** Enforce strict resource limits (CPU time, memory) on the Typst compilation process, specifically targeting font handling operations if possible.
    *   **Font Sandboxing:** If feasible, isolate font processing in a separate, more restricted sandbox than the main Typst compiler.
    *   **Limit Font Size:** Enforce a maximum file size for uploaded fonts.

## Threat: [Infinite Loop in `eval` Module](./threats/infinite_loop_in__eval__module.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a Typst document containing a malicious `#let` binding or function definition that results in an infinite loop during evaluation. This could involve recursive function calls without a proper base case or other logic errors.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to CPU exhaustion. The Typst compiler hangs indefinitely.
*   **Typst Component Affected:** `eval` module, specifically the evaluation engine and functions related to user-defined functions and bindings.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Recursion Depth Limit:** The Typst compiler *should* have a built-in limit on recursion depth. Verify this and ensure it's set to a reasonable value. This is a primary mitigation within Typst itself.
    *   **Timeouts:** Implement strict timeouts for the entire compilation process, including the evaluation phase.
    *   **Static Analysis (Difficult):** Ideally, perform static analysis of the Typst code *before* evaluation to detect potential infinite loops. This is a complex mitigation and may not be fully feasible.

## Threat: [Code Execution via Deserialization Vulnerability (Hypothetical)](./threats/code_execution_via_deserialization_vulnerability__hypothetical_.md)

*   **Description:** This is a *hypothetical* threat, as no such vulnerability is currently known in Typst. However, if Typst were to use an unsafe deserialization mechanism (e.g., a custom binary format or a vulnerable serialization library) for internal data structures, an attacker might be able to craft a malicious input that triggers arbitrary code execution during deserialization.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE). The attacker could gain complete control of the server.
*   **Typst Component Affected:** Any component that performs deserialization of untrusted data. This would likely be a low-level component related to parsing or internal data representation.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Unsafe Deserialization:** Typst should *avoid* using unsafe deserialization mechanisms. Use safe, well-vetted serialization formats like JSON or a custom format with strong security guarantees.
    *   **Input Validation:** Thoroughly validate any input *before* deserialization.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Run the Typst compiler with the least privilege necessary.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the Typst codebase, paying close attention to any deserialization logic.

## Threat: [Output Size Bomb in PDF Generation](./threats/output_size_bomb_in_pdf_generation.md)

* **Description:** An attacker crafts a Typst document that generates a PDF file with an extremely large number of pages, objects, or embedded resources, even if the Typst source code itself is relatively small. This could be achieved through loops, repeated content, or exploiting features of the PDF format.
* **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to disk space exhaustion or excessive memory consumption during PDF processing (either by Typst or by downstream PDF viewers/processors).
* **Typst Component Affected:** The PDF export functionality, likely within the `export` module or related libraries (e.g., `pdf-writer` or similar).
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Output Size Limit:** Impose a strict limit on the maximum size of the generated PDF file.
    * **Page Limit:** Limit the maximum number of pages that can be generated in a PDF.
    * **Resource Limits (Memory):** Enforce memory limits during PDF generation.
    * **Streaming Output:** Stream the PDF output to a temporary location and check its size before storing it permanently.
