Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Malicious Typst Code (File System Access)" attack surface, formatted as Markdown:

# Deep Analysis: Malicious Typst Code (File System Access)

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the risks associated with Typst's file system access capabilities, identify potential vulnerabilities, and propose robust mitigation strategies to prevent malicious exploitation.  We aim to provide actionable recommendations for developers to securely integrate Typst into their applications.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the attack surface presented by Typst code that attempts to interact with the file system.  This includes:

*   The `#read()` function and any other built-in functions that allow file reading.
*   Functions or methods that allow file writing or deletion.
*   Indirect file system access through external commands or libraries called from Typst.
*   The interaction of Typst's file access with the underlying operating system's security mechanisms.
*   The context in which Typst is executed (e.g., user privileges, sandboxing).

This analysis *excludes* other potential attack surfaces within Typst (e.g., denial-of-service, memory corruption) unless they directly relate to file system access.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Code Review:** Examine the Typst source code (from the provided GitHub repository) related to file I/O operations.  Identify all functions and methods that interact with the file system.
2.  **Vulnerability Research:** Investigate known vulnerabilities or attack patterns related to file system access in similar templating or document processing systems.
3.  **Threat Modeling:**  Develop realistic attack scenarios based on how an attacker might leverage Typst's file I/O capabilities.
4.  **Mitigation Analysis:** Evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation strategies (from the original attack surface description) and identify any gaps or weaknesses.
5.  **Recommendation Synthesis:**  Provide clear, prioritized recommendations for developers, including specific code examples and configuration guidelines.
6. **Testing:** Create set of tests to verify that mitigation strategies are working.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

### 2.1 Code Review Findings (Hypothetical - Requires Access to Typst Source)

Based on the provided description and common practices in similar systems, we can hypothesize the following about Typst's code (this needs verification by examining the actual source):

*   **`#read()` Function:**  This function likely takes a string argument representing the file path.  The core vulnerability lies in how this path is handled.  If the path is directly passed to underlying system calls (e.g., `open()`, `fopen()`) without proper validation or sanitization, it's vulnerable.
*   **File Writing (Hypothetical):**  If Typst allows file writing (e.g., a `#write()` function or similar), it would likely have a similar vulnerability profile to `#read()`.  The ability to write to arbitrary locations is even more dangerous than reading.
*   **Path Handling:**  The code likely contains logic to resolve relative paths, handle different operating system path separators ( `/` vs. `\`), and potentially interact with environment variables.  Each of these areas needs careful scrutiny for potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Error Handling:**  How Typst handles file I/O errors (e.g., file not found, permission denied) is important.  Poor error handling could leak information or create unexpected behavior.
* **External commands:** Typst may allow to execute external commands, that can be used to access file system.

### 2.2 Vulnerability Research

Common file system access vulnerabilities in similar systems include:

*   **Path Traversal (Directory Traversal):**  Using `../` sequences in the file path to escape the intended directory and access files outside the allowed area.  Example: `#read("../../../etc/passwd")`.
*   **Symbolic Link Attacks:**  If Typst follows symbolic links, an attacker could create a symlink pointing to a sensitive file and trick Typst into reading it.
*   **Race Conditions:**  If file access is not handled atomically, there might be race conditions that could be exploited.  For example, checking if a file exists and then reading it might be vulnerable if the file is changed between the check and the read.
*   **File Descriptor Exhaustion:** Repeatedly opening files without closing them could lead to a denial-of-service by exhausting available file descriptors.
*   **Insecure Temporary File Handling:** If Typst creates temporary files, it must do so securely, using unique names and appropriate permissions to prevent attackers from accessing or modifying them.
* **Command Injection:** If external commands are allowed, attacker can inject malicious commands.

### 2.3 Threat Modeling

Here are some realistic attack scenarios:

*   **Scenario 1: Information Disclosure (Web Application):**  A web application uses Typst to generate reports based on user-provided data.  An attacker embeds `#read("/etc/passwd")` in their input, causing the application to render the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file in the generated report, exposing user account information.
*   **Scenario 2: Data Corruption (Automated Document Processing):**  A system automatically processes Typst documents uploaded by users.  An attacker uploads a document containing `#write("/var/www/html/index.html", "Malicious Content")` (assuming a hypothetical `#write()` function).  This overwrites the web server's main page with malicious content.
*   **Scenario 3: System Compromise (Combined Attack):**  An attacker combines path traversal with a hypothetical `#write()` function to upload a malicious script to a location where it will be executed by the system (e.g., a cron job directory).
*   **Scenario 4: Denial of Service (File Descriptor Exhaustion):** An attacker submits a Typst document that contains a loop repeatedly calling `#read()` on a large file or a special file like `/dev/zero`, exhausting file descriptors and preventing the application from processing further requests.
* **Scenario 5: Command Injection:** An attacker uses external command execution to read file `#sh("cat /etc/passwd")`.

### 2.4 Mitigation Analysis

Let's analyze the effectiveness of the proposed mitigations:

*   **Disable File I/O:**  This is the *most secure* option and should be the default choice unless file access is strictly necessary.  It completely eliminates the attack surface.
*   **Strict Whitelisting:**  This is a good approach *if implemented correctly*.  The whitelist must be:
    *   **As restrictive as possible:**  Only allow access to the absolute minimum set of files/directories required.
    *   **Based on absolute paths:**  Avoid relative paths to prevent path traversal.
    *   **Checked *before* any file system interaction:**  The check must be performed before any attempt to open, read, or write the file.
    *   **Resistant to bypasses:**  Consider potential bypass techniques like URL encoding, double encoding, and null byte injection.
    *   **Regularly reviewed and updated:**  As the application evolves, the whitelist needs to be kept up-to-date.
*   **Chroot Jail/Containerization:**  This is an *excellent* defense-in-depth measure.  It limits the impact of a successful exploit by confining the Typst process to a restricted environment.  Even if an attacker manages to bypass the whitelist, they will be limited to the files within the chroot jail/container.
*   **AppArmor/SELinux:**  Another strong defense-in-depth measure.  These mandatory access control systems provide fine-grained control over file system access, even if the application itself has vulnerabilities.  They can be configured to prevent Typst from accessing any files outside a specific directory.

**Gaps and Weaknesses:**

*   The original mitigation strategies don't explicitly address symbolic link attacks.  Typst should be configured to *not* follow symbolic links, or to carefully validate the target of any symbolic link before accessing it.
*   The strategies don't mention race conditions.  File access should be handled atomically to prevent these vulnerabilities.
*   The strategies don't mention temporary file handling.  If Typst creates temporary files, it must do so securely.
*   Input validation is crucial. Even with whitelisting, carefully validate user-provided input to prevent unexpected characters or encodings that might bypass the whitelist.

### 2.5 Recommendation Synthesis

Here are prioritized recommendations for developers:

1.  **Disable File I/O by Default:**  If file access is not absolutely essential, disable it completely. This is the most secure approach.
2.  **If File I/O is Required:**
    *   **Implement Strict Whitelisting:** Use a whitelist of absolute paths, checked before any file system interaction.  Regularly review and update the whitelist.
    *   **Use Chroot Jail/Containerization:** Run the Typst compiler in a chroot jail or container to limit its file system view.
    *   **Use AppArmor/SELinux:** Enforce mandatory access control to further restrict file system access.
    *   **Disable Symbolic Link Following:** Configure Typst to not follow symbolic links, or validate the target of any symbolic link.
    *   **Handle File Access Atomically:**  Avoid race conditions by using appropriate locking mechanisms or atomic file operations.
    *   **Secure Temporary File Handling:**  If temporary files are created, use unique names and appropriate permissions.
    *   **Thorough Input Validation:**  Sanitize and validate all user-provided input, even if it's not directly used as a file path.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of the code and configuration to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Run the Typst process with the lowest possible privileges.  Do not run it as root.
    * **Disable external commands execution:** If it is not required.
3.  **Documentation:** Clearly document the security implications of using Typst's file I/O capabilities and provide guidance to users on how to configure it securely.
4.  **Testing:**
    *   **Positive Tests:** Verify that allowed file paths can be accessed.
    *   **Negative Tests:** Verify that disallowed file paths (including path traversal attempts, symbolic links, etc.) are blocked.
    *   **Fuzzing:** Use fuzzing techniques to test the robustness of the file path handling logic.
    *   **Race Condition Tests:**  Attempt to trigger race conditions by accessing files concurrently.

## 3. Conclusion

The "Malicious Typst Code (File System Access)" attack surface presents a significant risk if not properly mitigated. By following the recommendations outlined in this analysis, developers can significantly reduce the risk of exploitation and ensure the secure integration of Typst into their applications. The most important principle is to minimize the attack surface by disabling file I/O if possible, and if not, to use a combination of strict whitelisting, sandboxing, and mandatory access control to limit the potential damage from a successful attack. Regular security audits and testing are crucial to maintain a strong security posture.
