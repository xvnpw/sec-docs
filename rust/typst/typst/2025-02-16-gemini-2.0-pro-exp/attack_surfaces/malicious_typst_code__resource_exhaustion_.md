Okay, let's dive deep into the "Malicious Typst Code (Resource Exhaustion)" attack surface.

## Deep Analysis: Malicious Typst Code (Resource Exhaustion)

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the mechanisms by which malicious Typst code can lead to resource exhaustion, identify specific vulnerabilities within the Typst compiler and runtime environment, and propose concrete, actionable mitigation strategies beyond the high-level overview provided in the initial attack surface analysis.  We aim to provide developers with practical guidance to harden their Typst-based applications against denial-of-service attacks.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses *exclusively* on resource exhaustion attacks originating from malicious Typst code itself.  We will consider:

*   **Typst Language Features:**  How specific features of the Typst language (loops, recursion, data structures, functions, etc.) can be abused to consume excessive resources.
*   **Typst Compiler/Runtime:**  Vulnerabilities or limitations within the Typst compiler and runtime that could exacerbate resource exhaustion attacks.  This includes how Typst handles memory allocation, loop execution, function calls, and error handling.
*   **Integration Context:** How the way Typst is integrated into a larger application (e.g., a web service) affects the attack surface and mitigation strategies.  We'll assume a common scenario where a server processes user-submitted Typst code.
* **Typst version:** We will focus on the latest stable version of Typst available on GitHub (as of the date of this analysis).  We will also consider any known issues or vulnerabilities reported in the Typst issue tracker.

**We will *not* cover:**

*   Attacks exploiting vulnerabilities in external libraries or dependencies *unless* those vulnerabilities are directly triggered by malicious Typst code.
*   Attacks targeting the network layer or infrastructure (e.g., DDoS attacks at the network level).
*   Attacks exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's code *outside* of the Typst processing component.

**Methodology:**

1.  **Code Review and Experimentation:** We will examine the Typst source code (available on GitHub) to understand how it handles resource-intensive operations.  We will also conduct practical experiments by crafting malicious Typst code samples and observing their impact on a test environment.
2.  **Vulnerability Analysis:** We will systematically analyze Typst language features and compiler/runtime behavior to identify potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited for resource exhaustion.
3.  **Mitigation Strategy Development:** Based on our vulnerability analysis, we will develop and refine mitigation strategies, prioritizing practical and effective solutions.
4.  **Documentation and Reporting:** We will document our findings, including attack vectors, vulnerabilities, and mitigation recommendations, in a clear and concise manner.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

**2.1. Attack Vectors and Exploitation Techniques**

Here's a breakdown of how various Typst features can be abused, along with specific code examples:

*   **Infinite Loops (CPU Exhaustion):**

    *   **`while` loops without proper termination:**
        ```typst
        #let x = 0
        #while true {
          #x = x + 1 // Or even just #{} (an empty block)
        }
        ```
        This is the most straightforward example.  The condition is always `true`, so the loop never terminates.

    *   **`for` loops with manipulated iterators:**
        ```typst
        #for i in range(10) {
          #i = 0 // Resetting the iterator inside the loop
        }
        ```
        While `range(10)` normally iterates 10 times, resetting `i` inside the loop prevents it from terminating.

    *   **Mutually Recursive Functions (Stack Overflow, CPU Exhaustion):**
        ```typst
        #let f(x) = { g(x) }
        #let g(x) = { f(x) }
        #f(0)
        ```
        `f` calls `g`, which calls `f`, and so on, leading to infinite recursion and eventually a stack overflow.  Even before the stack overflow, this consumes CPU.

*   **Excessive Memory Allocation:**

    *   **Large Arrays/Strings:**
        ```typst
        #let huge-array = array(100000000, 0) // An array with 100 million elements
        #let huge-string = "a".repeat(100000000) // A string with 100 million 'a's
        ```
        This directly attempts to allocate a large chunk of memory.

    *   **Repeated String Concatenation (Quadratic Complexity):**
        ```typst
        #let s = ""
        #for i in range(100000) {
          #s = s + "a" // String concatenation can be inefficient
        }
        ```
        In some implementations, string concatenation can be O(n^2), meaning the time and memory used grow quadratically with the number of iterations.  Typst *might* optimize this, but it's worth testing.

    *   **Deeply Nested Data Structures:**
        ```typst
        #let nested = {}
        #for i in range(1000) {
          #nested = {(nested,)} // Create a deeply nested dictionary
        }
        ```
        Creating deeply nested structures can consume significant memory, even if the individual elements are small.

    *   **Uncontrolled Content Generation:**
        ```typst
        #let generate-content(n) = {
          if n > 0 {
            "Large Content " + generate-content(n - 1)
          } else {
            ""
          }
        }
        #generate-content(10000)
        ```
        This recursive function generates exponentially larger output, potentially leading to excessive memory consumption.

*   **Compiler/Runtime Exploits (More Speculative, Requires Deeper Code Analysis):**

    *   **Hash Table Collisions:**  If Typst uses hash tables internally (e.g., for dictionaries or symbol tables), carefully crafted input could potentially cause hash collisions, leading to performance degradation (O(n) instead of O(1) lookup).  This would require analyzing how Typst handles hash tables.
    *   **Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS):** If Typst uses regular expressions internally (e.g., for parsing or string manipulation), a maliciously crafted regular expression could cause catastrophic backtracking, leading to CPU exhaustion.  This is a common vulnerability in many systems that use regular expressions.
    *   **Integer Overflow/Underflow:**  While less likely to cause resource exhaustion directly, integer overflows or underflows could potentially lead to unexpected behavior that *indirectly* causes resource consumption.  This would require careful analysis of how Typst handles integer arithmetic.

**2.2. Typst Compiler/Runtime Vulnerabilities (Hypothetical, Requires Code Review)**

Based on general principles and common vulnerabilities in compilers and runtimes, here are some potential areas of concern within the Typst implementation:

*   **Lack of Resource Limits:** The compiler/runtime might not have built-in limits on:
    *   Maximum execution time.
    *   Maximum memory allocation.
    *   Maximum stack depth (to prevent stack overflows).
    *   Maximum output size.
*   **Inefficient Algorithms:**  The compiler/runtime might use inefficient algorithms for certain operations (e.g., string concatenation, hash table management, regular expression matching), making them vulnerable to DoS attacks.
*   **Unsafe Memory Management:**  If Typst uses manual memory management (less likely, given its Rust foundation), there could be memory leaks or use-after-free vulnerabilities that could be triggered by malicious code.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The compiler might not adequately validate user-provided input, allowing for malformed or excessively large input that could cause crashes or resource exhaustion.
*   **Lack of Sandboxing:**  The Typst runtime might not be properly sandboxed, allowing malicious code to access or modify system resources outside of its intended scope.

**2.3. Integration Context Considerations**

The way Typst is integrated into an application significantly impacts the attack surface:

*   **User Input:** If the application allows users to directly submit Typst code, the risk is much higher than if Typst is only used internally with trusted input.
*   **Asynchronous Processing:** If Typst compilation is performed asynchronously (e.g., in a background queue), it's crucial to have proper resource monitoring and limits to prevent a single malicious request from consuming all available resources.
*   **Error Handling:**  The application must handle errors from the Typst compiler/runtime gracefully.  A crash in the Typst component should not bring down the entire application.
*   **Caching:** If the application caches compiled Typst output, it's important to ensure that the cache is not poisoned by malicious code.  This might involve validating the output before caching it or using a separate cache for user-submitted content.

### 3. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

Building upon the initial mitigation strategies, here's a more detailed and actionable approach:

*   **1. Strict Timeouts (Essential):**

    *   **Implementation:** Use a platform-specific mechanism to enforce timeouts.  For example, in a web server environment, this might involve setting a timeout on the process that executes the Typst compiler.  In Rust, you could use the `tokio::time::timeout` function.
    *   **Timeout Value:**  Start with a very short timeout (e.g., 1-2 seconds) and adjust it based on performance testing with legitimate Typst documents.  Err on the side of being too strict.
    *   **Error Handling:**  When a timeout occurs, the application should:
        *   Terminate the Typst process immediately.
        *   Return an appropriate error message to the user (e.g., "Compilation timed out").
        *   Log the event for monitoring and analysis.

*   **2. Memory Limits (Essential):**

    *   **Implementation:**  Use operating system-level mechanisms to limit the memory a Typst process can allocate.  This might involve:
        *   **`ulimit` (Linux):**  Use the `ulimit -v` command to set the virtual memory limit for the process.
        *   **`setrlimit` (Linux/Unix):**  Use the `setrlimit` system call (e.g., via the `resource` crate in Rust) to set resource limits programmatically.
        *   **Job Objects (Windows):**  Use Job Objects to limit the memory and other resources used by a process group.
        *   **Docker/Containers:**  If running Typst in a containerized environment, use Docker's resource limits (`--memory`, `--memory-swap`).
    *   **Limit Value:**  Determine a reasonable memory limit based on the expected size of legitimate Typst documents.  Start with a relatively low limit (e.g., 64MB or 128MB) and adjust as needed.
    *   **Error Handling:**  When a memory limit is reached, the Typst process should be terminated, and the application should handle the error gracefully (similar to timeouts).

*   **3. Resource Monitoring (Essential):**

    *   **Implementation:**  Use a monitoring system (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, or a custom solution) to track:
        *   CPU usage of Typst processes.
        *   Memory usage of Typst processes.
        *   Number of active Typst processes.
        *   Compilation time.
        *   Error rates.
    *   **Alerting:**  Configure alerts to notify administrators when resource usage exceeds predefined thresholds.
    *   **Automated Actions:**  Consider automatically terminating Typst processes that exceed resource limits for an extended period.

*   **4. WebAssembly (Wasm) Sandboxing (Recommended):**

    *   **Implementation:**  Compile Typst to Wasm and run it in a Wasm runtime (e.g., Wasmer, Wasmtime).  Wasm provides built-in memory safety and resource isolation.
    *   **Benefits:**
        *   **Memory Safety:**  Wasm prevents out-of-bounds memory access, reducing the risk of memory corruption vulnerabilities.
        *   **Resource Limits:**  Wasm runtimes typically allow you to set limits on memory usage and execution time.
        *   **Sandboxing:**  Wasm isolates the Typst code from the host system, preventing it from accessing arbitrary files or system resources.
    *   **Considerations:**
        *   **Performance Overhead:**  Wasm might introduce some performance overhead compared to native execution.
        *   **Integration Complexity:**  Integrating a Wasm runtime into your application might require some additional effort.

*   **5. Static Analysis (Limited but Helpful):**

    *   **Implementation:**  Implement basic static analysis to detect *obvious* patterns of malicious code, such as:
        *   `while true` loops.
        *   Extremely large constant values (e.g., array sizes, string lengths).
        *   Deeply nested data structures (beyond a certain threshold).
        *   Potentially dangerous function calls (if you identify any specific functions as high-risk).
    *   **Limitations:**  Static analysis cannot reliably detect all forms of malicious code, especially those involving complex logic or runtime behavior.  It's a supplementary measure, not a complete solution.
    *   **Tools:**  You could potentially use a custom parser or leverage existing parsing libraries for Typst to perform static analysis.

*   **6. Input Sanitization/Validation (Recommended):**

    *   **Implementation:**  Before passing user-provided input to the Typst compiler, perform some basic sanitization and validation:
        *   **Length Limits:**  Limit the maximum length of the input string.
        *   **Character Restrictions:**  Consider restricting the allowed characters in the input (e.g., disallowing certain Unicode characters that might cause problems).
        *   **Keyword Blacklisting/Whitelisting:**  Potentially blacklist or whitelist specific Typst keywords or functions.  This is a delicate balance, as it could break legitimate use cases.
    *   **Caution:**  Input sanitization is not a foolproof solution, as attackers can often find ways to bypass simple checks.

*   **7. Rate Limiting (Recommended):**

    *   **Implementation:**  Limit the number of Typst compilation requests a user can make within a given time period.  This can help prevent attackers from flooding the server with malicious requests.
    *   **Techniques:**
        *   **IP-based rate limiting:**  Limit requests based on the user's IP address.
        *   **User-based rate limiting:**  Limit requests based on a user identifier (e.g., a session token or API key).
        *   **Token bucket algorithm:**  A common algorithm for implementing rate limiting.

*   **8. Separate Compilation Service (Recommended):**

    *   **Implementation:**  Run the Typst compiler in a separate service or process, isolated from the main application.  This can help contain the impact of a resource exhaustion attack.
    *   **Benefits:**
        *   **Fault Isolation:**  If the Typst compiler crashes or becomes unresponsive, it won't bring down the entire application.
        *   **Resource Isolation:**  The separate service can have its own resource limits, preventing it from consuming resources needed by the main application.
        *   **Scalability:**  The compilation service can be scaled independently of the main application.

*   **9. Regular Expression Auditing (If Applicable):**

    *   **Implementation:** If Typst uses regular expressions internally, carefully audit them for potential ReDoS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Tools:** Use regular expression analysis tools to identify potentially problematic patterns.
    *   **Mitigation:** Rewrite vulnerable regular expressions to avoid catastrophic backtracking.

*   **10. Code Audits and Security Reviews (Essential):**

    *   Regularly review the Typst codebase for potential security vulnerabilities, including resource exhaustion issues.
    *   Consider engaging external security experts to conduct penetration testing and code audits.

### 4. Conclusion

Resource exhaustion attacks against Typst-based applications are a serious threat due to the Turing-completeness of the language.  A multi-layered approach to mitigation is essential, combining strict resource limits, monitoring, sandboxing, and careful code design.  By implementing the strategies outlined in this analysis, developers can significantly reduce the risk of denial-of-service attacks and build more robust and secure applications.  Continuous monitoring and regular security reviews are crucial for maintaining a strong security posture.
