# Deep Analysis: Malicious Typst Code (External Data Fetching / SSRF)

## 1. Objective of Deep Analysis

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand and mitigate the risks associated with Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities that could arise from Typst's ability (or potential future ability) to fetch external data.  We aim to:

*   Identify all potential attack vectors related to external data fetching.
*   Assess the impact of successful exploitation.
*   Develop concrete, actionable mitigation strategies that can be implemented by the development team.
*   Establish a secure-by-design approach to handling external data within Typst.
*   Provide clear guidance to prevent future introduction of similar vulnerabilities.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the attack surface presented by Typst code that could initiate network requests to external resources.  This includes:

*   **Existing Functionality:**  Any current Typst features (even if seemingly benign) that could be abused to trigger network requests.  This includes image loading, font loading, and any form of inclusion of external resources.
*   **Hypothetical Functionality:**  The `fetch()` function example provided in the attack surface description, and any similar functions that might be considered for future development.
*   **Indirect Fetching:**  Mechanisms where Typst might indirectly cause network requests, such as through dependencies or libraries it uses.
*   **Compiler Behavior:** How the Typst compiler itself handles external resources during the compilation process.
* **Typst Packages:** How packages could introduce SSRF vulnerabilities.

This analysis *excludes* vulnerabilities unrelated to network requests initiated by Typst code (e.g., buffer overflows in image parsing, which would be a separate attack surface).

## 3. Methodology

The following methodology will be used for this deep analysis:

1.  **Code Review:**  A thorough review of the Typst compiler's source code (from the provided GitHub repository) will be conducted, focusing on:
    *   Network-related functions (e.g., those using `reqwest`, `hyper`, or similar libraries).
    *   URL parsing and handling.
    *   Input validation and sanitization related to URLs.
    *   Resource loading mechanisms (images, fonts, etc.).
    *   Package management and dependency handling.

2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Sandboxed Testing):**  If feasible, we will create a sandboxed environment to run the Typst compiler with various malicious inputs.  This will involve:
    *   Crafting Typst documents designed to trigger SSRF attempts.
    *   Monitoring network traffic from the sandbox.
    *   Analyzing the compiler's behavior and error handling.
    *   Testing with different compiler configurations.

3.  **Threat Modeling:**  We will use threat modeling techniques (e.g., STRIDE) to systematically identify potential attack scenarios and their impact.

4.  **Mitigation Strategy Development:**  Based on the findings from the code review, dynamic analysis, and threat modeling, we will develop specific, actionable mitigation strategies.

5.  **Documentation and Reporting:**  All findings, analysis, and recommendations will be documented in this report.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface

This section will be populated with the detailed findings from the analysis.  Since I don't have the ability to execute code or directly interact with the Typst compiler, I'll provide a detailed analysis based on best practices and common vulnerabilities, along with specific recommendations tailored to the Typst context.

**4.1. Current State (Based on Hypothetical `fetch` and General Principles)**

Even without a direct `#fetch` function, the potential for SSRF exists in any system that handles external resources.  Here's a breakdown of potential attack vectors:

*   **Image Loading (`image()` function):**  The most likely current vector.  If the `image()` function accepts URLs, it's a prime target for SSRF.  Attackers could provide URLs pointing to internal services, cloud metadata endpoints (like the AWS example), or their own servers.
    *   **Example:**  `image("http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/")`
    *   **Concern:**  Does Typst validate the URL *before* making the request?  Does it restrict protocols (e.g., allow only `https://`)?  Does it follow redirects (which could be abused)?

*   **Font Loading:**  If Typst allows loading fonts from external URLs, this is another potential vector.  The attack would be similar to image loading, but targeting font files.
    *   **Example:** `#show: set text(font: "EvilFont", font-path: "http://attacker.com/evil.ttf")` (Hypothetical, assuming external font loading)
    *   **Concern:**  Similar to image loading â€“ URL validation, protocol restrictions, and redirect handling are crucial.

*   **Include Statements (Hypothetical):**  If Typst has or plans to have a mechanism to include external files (like a `#include` directive), this would be a high-risk area.
    *   **Example:** `#include("http://internal.server/config.yaml")`
    *   **Concern:**  This would allow direct retrieval of arbitrary content, making SSRF and data exfiltration trivial.

*   **Package Management:** If Typst has a package manager that downloads packages from remote repositories, the package manager itself could be a target.  A malicious package could contain Typst code designed to exploit SSRF vulnerabilities.
    * **Example:** A package that includes a seemingly benign image, but the image URL points to an internal service.
    * **Concern:** Package authenticity and integrity are critical. The package manager should verify signatures and checksums.  Sandboxing during package installation is also important.

* **Indirect Dependencies:** Even if Typst code itself doesn't directly make network requests, libraries used by the Typst compiler (e.g., for image processing, font rendering) might have vulnerabilities.
    * **Concern:** Regular dependency audits and updates are essential.

**4.2. Impact Analysis**

The impact of a successful SSRF attack via Typst can range from moderate to critical:

*   **Information Disclosure:**  Accessing internal services, cloud metadata, or configuration files can reveal sensitive information (API keys, credentials, internal network structure).
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The Typst compiler could be used to flood internal or external services with requests, causing them to become unavailable.
*   **Internal Network Reconnaissance:**  Attackers can use SSRF to probe the internal network, identify running services, and map out the network topology.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  In some cases, SSRF can be chained with other vulnerabilities to achieve RCE on the server running the Typst compiler.  This is less likely but possible if the targeted internal service has known vulnerabilities.
*   **Data Exfiltration:**  Attackers can use SSRF to send data from the server to their own controlled infrastructure.

**4.3. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)**

The following mitigation strategies are crucial for preventing SSRF vulnerabilities in Typst:

*   **1.  Principle of Least Privilege (POLP):** The Typst compiler should run with the *absolute minimum* necessary privileges.  It should *never* run as root or with administrative privileges.  This limits the damage an attacker can do even if they find a vulnerability.

*   **2.  Strict Input Validation (URLs):**
    *   **Whitelist, Not Blacklist:**  *Never* use a blacklist of disallowed URLs or protocols.  Blacklists are almost always incomplete and can be bypassed.  Instead, use a strict whitelist of allowed domains and protocols.
    *   **Protocol Restriction:**  For image and font loading, *strongly* prefer `https://` and disallow `http://` unless absolutely necessary (and even then, with extreme caution and justification).  Never allow protocols like `file://`, `ftp://`, or `gopher://`.
    *   **Domain Whitelist:**  Maintain a hardcoded list of *explicitly allowed* domains for external resources.  This list should be as short as possible.  For example, if you only need to load images from a specific CDN, only allow that CDN's domain.
    *   **No User-Provided URLs Directly:**  *Never* allow users to directly provide URLs that are used without going through the whitelist.  If users need to specify images, they should do so through an indirect mechanism (e.g., selecting from a predefined list of images).
    *   **Regular Expression Validation (Careful!):**  If you must use regular expressions to validate URLs, be *extremely* careful.  Regexes for URL validation are notoriously difficult to get right and can often be bypassed.  Use well-tested and widely-used regex libraries, and thoroughly test your regexes against a variety of malicious inputs.  Prefer simpler, more restrictive regexes.
    * **IP Address Restrictions:** Explicitly disallow IP addresses in URLs. Force the use of domain names, which are then subject to DNS resolution control.

*   **3.  Network Isolation (Sandboxing):**
    *   **Containers:**  Run the Typst compiler within a container (e.g., Docker) with a restricted network configuration.  The container should have *no* access to the host network or other containers unless absolutely necessary.
    *   **Network Namespaces:**  Use Linux network namespaces to create an isolated network environment for the compiler.  This allows you to control which network interfaces the compiler can access and which DNS servers it can use.
    *   **Firewall Rules:**  Use firewall rules (e.g., `iptables`, `nftables`) to restrict outbound network connections from the compiler's process or container.  Only allow connections to the whitelisted domains and ports.
    * **Least Privilege User:** Run the compiler as a dedicated, unprivileged user account within the container or sandbox.

*   **4.  DNS Resolution Control:**
    *   **Internal DNS Server:**  Use a custom DNS server within the sandboxed environment that *only* resolves the whitelisted domains.  This prevents the compiler from resolving internal hostnames or accessing internal services via DNS.
    *   **`/etc/hosts` Manipulation (Caution):**  Within the container, you could potentially modify the `/etc/hosts` file to prevent resolution of internal hostnames.  However, this is less reliable than using a dedicated DNS server.

*   **5.  Disable External Fetching (If Possible):**
    *   If external data fetching is not a core requirement for Typst, the safest approach is to *completely disable* it.  This eliminates the SSRF attack surface entirely.

*   **6.  Safe Dependency Management:**
    *   **Regular Audits:**  Regularly audit all dependencies used by the Typst compiler for known vulnerabilities.  Use tools like `cargo audit` (for Rust) or similar tools for other languages.
    *   **Dependency Pinning:**  Pin the versions of all dependencies to prevent unexpected updates that might introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Integrate vulnerability scanning into your CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect and report vulnerabilities in dependencies.

*   **7.  Content Security Policy (CSP) (If Applicable):**
    *   If Typst is used in a web context (e.g., to generate HTML), use a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to limit the resources that can be loaded.  This can help mitigate SSRF attacks even if a vulnerability exists in the Typst code.

*   **8.  Error Handling:**
    *   **Generic Error Messages:**  Never return detailed error messages to the user that might reveal information about the internal network or server configuration.  Use generic error messages like "Invalid URL" or "Failed to load resource."
    *   **Logging:**  Log all failed attempts to access external resources, including the attempted URL and the source of the request.  This can help detect and respond to SSRF attacks.

*   **9.  Regular Security Reviews:**
    *   Conduct regular security reviews of the Typst codebase, focusing on areas related to network requests and external resource handling.
    *   Consider engaging external security experts for penetration testing and code audits.

* **10. Package Management Security:**
    * **Signature Verification:**  Implement cryptographic signature verification for all Typst packages.  This ensures that packages have not been tampered with and come from a trusted source.
    * **Checksum Validation:**  Verify the checksum of downloaded packages to ensure their integrity.
    * **Sandboxed Package Installation:** Install packages in a sandboxed environment to prevent malicious code from executing during the installation process.
    * **Package Reputation System:** Consider implementing a reputation system for package authors and packages to help users identify trustworthy packages.

**4.4 Specific Recommendations for Typst**
Based on analysis above, here are the concrete recommendations:

1.  **`image()` Function:**
    *   **Implement a strict whitelist of allowed domains for image sources.**  This is the *most critical* mitigation for the `image()` function.
    *   **Require `https://` for all image URLs.**
    *   **Do *not* follow redirects by default.** If redirects are necessary, implement a whitelist for redirect targets as well.
    *   **Validate the image content type *after* fetching the image, but *before* processing it.**  This can help prevent attacks that rely on content type sniffing.
    *   **Consider using a dedicated image proxy:**  Instead of fetching images directly, the Typst compiler could send the image URL to a dedicated image proxy service.  The proxy would be responsible for fetching the image, validating it, and returning it to the compiler.  This isolates the image fetching logic and reduces the attack surface of the compiler itself.

2.  **Font Loading:**
    *   **Apply the same mitigations as for the `image()` function.**  Whitelist domains, require `https://`, and validate content types.
    *   **Prefer local font files whenever possible.**

3.  **`#fetch` (Hypothetical):**
    *   **Strongly reconsider the need for a general-purpose `#fetch` function.**  The security risks are extremely high.
    *   **If absolutely necessary, implement *all* of the mitigation strategies described above.**  Whitelist, network isolation, DNS control, etc., are *mandatory*.
    *   **Consider a more restricted alternative:**  Instead of a general `#fetch`, provide specific functions for well-defined use cases (e.g., fetching data from a specific API with a predefined schema).

4.  **Include Statements:**
    *   **Avoid implementing a general-purpose `#include` directive that can fetch content from arbitrary URLs.**  The security risks are too high.
    *   **If inclusion is needed, restrict it to local files only.**

5. **Package Management**
    * Implement all recommendations from section 4.3.

6.  **Compiler Execution:**
    *   **Always run the Typst compiler in a sandboxed environment (container with restricted network access).**
    *   **Run the compiler as a non-root user.**

7. **Dependency Management**
    * Implement all recommendations from section 4.3.
