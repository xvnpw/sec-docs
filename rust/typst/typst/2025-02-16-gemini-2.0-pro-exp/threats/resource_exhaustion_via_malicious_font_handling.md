Okay, let's perform a deep analysis of the "Resource Exhaustion via Malicious Font Handling" threat for the Typst application.

## Deep Analysis: Resource Exhaustion via Malicious Font Handling

### 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Resource Exhaustion via Malicious Font Handling" threat, identify specific vulnerabilities within the Typst ecosystem, and propose concrete, actionable mitigation strategies beyond the high-level suggestions already provided.  We aim to provide the development team with the information needed to prioritize and implement effective defenses.

**Scope:**

This analysis will focus on the following areas:

*   **Typst's Font Handling Pipeline:**  We'll examine how Typst loads, parses, and renders fonts, identifying the specific libraries and code sections involved.  This includes understanding how Typst interacts with external font files and embedded fonts.
*   **Vulnerability Identification:** We'll pinpoint specific attack vectors related to font processing that could lead to resource exhaustion. This includes analyzing potential vulnerabilities in the `ttf-parser` crate (or similar) and how Typst handles font metrics.
*   **Mitigation Strategy Refinement:** We'll expand on the initial mitigation strategies, providing detailed implementation guidance and considering potential trade-offs.
*   **Testing and Validation:** We'll outline a testing strategy to verify the effectiveness of implemented mitigations.

**Methodology:**

1.  **Code Review:**  We will analyze the relevant parts of the Typst source code (primarily the `font` and `layout` modules, and any dependencies related to font parsing like `ttf-parser`) to understand the font handling process.  We'll look for potential areas where resource consumption is not properly bounded.
2.  **Dependency Analysis:** We will examine the dependencies used for font handling (e.g., `ttf-parser`, `font-kit`, etc.) to identify any known vulnerabilities or limitations in those libraries.  We'll check for security advisories and recent bug reports.
3.  **Literature Review:** We will research known font-related vulnerabilities and attack techniques (e.g., "font bomb" attacks, buffer overflows in font parsing libraries) to understand common attack patterns.
4.  **Threat Modeling Refinement:** We will use the information gathered to refine the existing threat model, adding more specific details about attack vectors and potential impacts.
5.  **Mitigation Strategy Development:** We will develop detailed, actionable mitigation strategies, considering the specific context of the Typst application and its dependencies.
6.  **Testing Strategy Design:** We will design a testing strategy to validate the effectiveness of the proposed mitigations.

### 2. Deep Analysis

#### 2.1 Typst's Font Handling Pipeline (Based on Code Review and Dependency Analysis)

Typst, being a relatively new typesetting system, likely relies on existing Rust crates for font handling.  Based on common practices and the mention of `ttf-parser`, the pipeline likely involves these stages:

1.  **Font Loading:** Typst either loads a font from the file system (if a system font is specified) or from embedded data within the Typst document itself.
2.  **Font Parsing:** A library like `ttf-parser` is used to parse the font file (likely TrueType or OpenType format). This involves reading the font's binary data and extracting information about glyphs, tables, and other font features.  This is a *critical* stage for potential vulnerabilities.
3.  **Glyph Processing:**  The parsed glyph data is used to render the characters. This may involve rasterization (converting vector outlines to bitmaps) or using a system font rendering engine.
4.  **Layout and Typesetting:**  Font metrics (character widths, heights, kerning information) are used to determine the layout of text on the page.

**Key Dependencies (Likely):**

*   **`ttf-parser`:**  A Rust crate for parsing TrueType fonts.  This is a likely target for attackers.
*   **`font-kit`:**  A higher-level font loading and management library, potentially used for system font access.
*   **`ab_glyph`:** Another potential font handling library.
*   **`raqote`:** 2D graphics library, potentially used for rasterization.

#### 2.2 Vulnerability Identification

Based on the pipeline and known font attack techniques, here are specific vulnerabilities to consider:

*   **`ttf-parser` Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Integer Overflows/Underflows:**  Font files contain numerous integer values (e.g., glyph counts, table sizes, offsets).  Maliciously crafted values could cause integer overflows or underflows during parsing, leading to memory corruption or out-of-bounds reads/writes.
    *   **Buffer Overflows:**  Incorrectly sized buffers during parsing of font tables (e.g., `glyf`, `loca`, `head`, `hhea`, `maxp`, `name`, `OS/2`, `post`) could lead to buffer overflows.
    *   **Infinite Loops:**  Maliciously crafted font data could cause the parser to enter an infinite loop, consuming CPU resources.
    *   **Out-of-Memory (OOM) Errors:**  Fonts with an extremely large number of glyphs, excessively complex glyph outlines, or large embedded bitmaps could cause the parser to allocate excessive memory, leading to OOM errors.
    *   **Logic Errors:**  Flaws in the parsing logic could be exploited to trigger unexpected behavior or crashes.

*   **`font-kit` and System Font Handling:**
    *   **Path Traversal:** If Typst allows specifying fonts by path, a malicious path could be used to access unauthorized files.
    *   **Vulnerabilities in System Font Libraries:**  If Typst relies on system font rendering libraries (e.g., FreeType), vulnerabilities in those libraries could be exploited.

*   **Typst-Specific Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Inefficient Font Caching:**  If Typst caches font data, a malicious document could trigger excessive caching, consuming memory.
    *   **Unbounded Recursion:**  If font handling involves recursive functions, a malicious font could trigger unbounded recursion, leading to a stack overflow.
    *   **Lack of Resource Limits:**  If Typst doesn't impose limits on CPU time or memory usage during font processing, an attacker can easily cause a denial of service.

#### 2.3 Mitigation Strategy Refinement

Let's refine the initial mitigation strategies with more specific details:

*   **Font Validation (Enhanced):**
    *   **Use FontTools (Python):**  Before passing *any* font data to Typst, validate it using the `fontTools` library in Python.  This is a mature and well-tested library.  This can be done in a separate process (e.g., a pre-processing step before calling the Typst compiler).
        *   **Specific Checks:**
            *   `ttLib.TTFont(font_data)`:  Load the font and check for basic structural integrity.
            *   `font['maxp'].numGlyphs`:  Check for a reasonable number of glyphs (e.g., limit to 10,000).
            *   `font['head'].unitsPerEm`: Check for a reasonable unitsPerEm value.
            *   Iterate through tables and check for reasonable sizes and offsets.
            *   Use `fontTools.subset` to create a subset of the font with a limited number of glyphs, further reducing the attack surface.
    *   **Reject Invalid Fonts:**  If `fontTools` detects any errors or inconsistencies, reject the font *before* it reaches Typst.
    *   **Consider Font Sanitization:** Explore using `fontTools` to *sanitize* the font, removing potentially dangerous features or tables.

*   **Resource Limits (Enhanced):**
    *   **`cgroups` (Linux):**  Use Linux control groups (`cgroups`) to limit the CPU time, memory, and other resources available to the Typst compilation process.  This provides a strong, OS-level mechanism for resource isolation.
    *   **`ulimit` (Linux/macOS):**  Use the `ulimit` command to set resource limits for the user running the Typst process.
    *   **Rust `resource` Crate (Limited):**  The `resource` crate in Rust provides some basic resource limiting capabilities, but it's less robust than `cgroups` or `ulimit`.
    *   **Timeouts:**  Implement strict timeouts for font parsing and rendering operations within Typst itself.  If a font takes too long to process, terminate the operation.

*   **Font Sandboxing (Enhanced):**
    *   **Separate Process:**  Run the font parsing and rendering logic in a separate process from the main Typst compiler.  This provides strong isolation.
    *   **`chroot` (Linux):**  Use `chroot` to restrict the file system access of the font processing process.
    *   **`seccomp` (Linux):**  Use `seccomp` to restrict the system calls that the font processing process can make.  This can prevent the process from accessing sensitive resources or performing dangerous operations.
    *   **WebAssembly (Wasm):**  Consider compiling the font parsing and rendering logic to WebAssembly (Wasm).  Wasm provides a sandboxed execution environment with built-in resource limits. This is a more complex but potentially very secure option.

*   **Limit Font Size (Enhanced):**
    *   **Strict Maximum Size:**  Enforce a strict maximum file size for uploaded fonts (e.g., 1MB).  This is a simple but effective defense against extremely large font files.
    *   **Pre-flight Check:**  Check the font file size *before* attempting to load or validate it.

*   **Dependency Management:**
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep all font-related dependencies (e.g., `ttf-parser`, `font-kit`) up-to-date to patch any known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use a vulnerability scanner (e.g., `cargo-audit`) to automatically detect known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    *   **Forking and Patching:** If a critical vulnerability is found in a dependency and a patch is not available, consider forking the dependency and applying the patch yourself.

#### 2.4 Testing and Validation

A robust testing strategy is crucial to ensure the effectiveness of the mitigations:

*   **Fuzz Testing:**  Use a fuzzing tool (e.g., `cargo-fuzz`) to generate a large number of malformed font files and feed them to Typst.  This can help identify unexpected crashes or vulnerabilities.
*   **Unit Tests:**  Write unit tests for the font parsing and rendering logic to ensure that it handles edge cases and invalid input correctly.
*   **Integration Tests:**  Test the entire font handling pipeline, from loading to rendering, with a variety of valid and invalid font files.
*   **Regression Tests:**  Create a suite of regression tests based on known font vulnerabilities (e.g., "font bomb" test cases) to ensure that they are properly mitigated.
*   **Performance Testing:**  Measure the performance impact of the implemented mitigations to ensure that they don't introduce unacceptable overhead.
*   **Penetration Testing:**  Engage a security professional to perform penetration testing on the Typst application, specifically targeting the font handling functionality.

### 3. Conclusion

The "Resource Exhaustion via Malicious Font Handling" threat is a serious concern for Typst.  By carefully analyzing the font handling pipeline, identifying specific vulnerabilities, and implementing a multi-layered defense strategy, we can significantly reduce the risk of denial-of-service attacks.  The combination of font validation, resource limits, sandboxing, and rigorous testing is essential to protect the Typst application and its users.  Continuous monitoring and updates are also crucial to stay ahead of emerging threats. The most important steps are using FontTools for pre-validation, and cgroups/ulimit for resource limits. These provide the strongest immediate protection.
