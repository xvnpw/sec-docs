## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Typst Feature Whitelisting](./mitigation_strategies/strict_typst_feature_whitelisting.md)

**1. Mitigation Strategy: Strict Typst Feature Whitelisting**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Essential Features:** Analyze your application's requirements and determine the absolute minimum set of Typst features needed.  For example, if you only need basic text formatting, lists, and images, identify the corresponding Typst syntax elements (e.g., `#text`, `#strong`, `#emph`, `#list`, `#image`).
    2.  **Create a Whitelist Configuration:** Create a configuration file or code module that explicitly lists *only* the allowed Typst features. This could be a simple text file, a JSON object, or a custom data structure.
    3.  **Disable Unlisted Features (Compiler Configuration):**  This is the crucial Typst-specific step.  You need to find a way to instruct the Typst compiler to *only* process the whitelisted features and reject anything else.  This might involve:
        *   **Command-Line Flags (If Available):** Check the Typst compiler's documentation for command-line flags that allow you to disable specific features or enable a "safe mode."  For example, there might be flags like `--disable-raw`, `--disable-math`, etc.
        *   **Configuration File (If Supported):**  If Typst supports a configuration file, use it to specify the allowed features or a security profile.
        *   **API Modification (If Using an API):** If you're interacting with Typst through a programming API (e.g., a Rust library), look for API calls that allow you to control the enabled features or set a security context.
        *   **Custom Preprocessor (Last Resort):** If none of the above are available, you might need to create a custom preprocessor that filters the Typst input *before* it reaches the compiler.  This preprocessor would parse the input and remove or reject any non-whitelisted features. This is the most complex and error-prone approach.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Typst Features:** (Severity: Critical) - By strictly limiting the allowed features, you drastically reduce the attack surface and prevent attackers from exploiting vulnerabilities in complex or less-secure Typst features.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Typst Features:** (Severity: High) - Prevents the injection of malicious code through Typst features that might allow for raw HTML or script embedding.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Complex Typst Features:** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents attackers from using computationally expensive Typst features to overload the compiler.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **RCE:** Substantially reduces the risk by minimizing the exploitable code paths within Typst.
    *   **XSS:** Significantly reduces the risk by preventing the use of Typst features that could lead to XSS.
    *   **DoS:** Mitigates DoS attacks that rely on abusing complex Typst features.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Highly unlikely to be implemented without explicit configuration.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   The core mechanism for enforcing the whitelist within the Typst compiler (command-line flags, configuration file, API calls, or a custom preprocessor) is almost certainly missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Typst Compilation Timeouts](./mitigation_strategies/typst_compilation_timeouts.md)

**2. Mitigation Strategy: Typst Compilation Timeouts**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Compilation Invocation:** Determine how your application invokes the Typst compiler (command-line execution, API call, etc.).
    2.  **Implement Timeout Mechanism:** Wrap the Typst compilation process within a timeout mechanism.  The specific implementation depends on how you're invoking Typst:
        *   **Command-Line:** Use a command-line utility like `timeout` (on Linux/macOS) or a similar tool on Windows to set a maximum execution time for the Typst compiler process.  Example (Linux): `timeout 5s typst compile input.typ output.pdf` (sets a 5-second timeout).
        *   **API Call:** If using a programming API, use the language's built-in timeout mechanisms (e.g., `context.WithTimeout` in Go, `Promise.race` with a timeout promise in JavaScript).
    3.  **Handle Timeout:**  If the timeout is reached, the compilation process should be terminated, and your application should handle the timeout gracefully (e.g., return an error message to the user).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Long Compilation Times:** (Severity: High) - Prevents attackers from submitting Typst code that takes an excessively long time to compile, consuming server resources and making the application unavailable.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Effectively mitigates DoS attacks based on long compilation times.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Likely not implemented specifically for Typst compilation.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   The timeout mechanism directly wrapping the Typst compilation process is likely missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Typst Output Size Limits](./mitigation_strategies/typst_output_size_limits.md)

**3. Mitigation Strategy: Typst Output Size Limits**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Post-Compilation Check:** *After* the Typst compiler has finished generating the output (PDF, SVG, etc.), obtain the size of the output file.
    2.  **Enforce Size Limit:** Compare the output file size to a predefined maximum size limit (e.g., 10MB). This limit should be chosen based on the expected size of legitimate output and the available server resources.
    3.  **Handle Exceedance:** If the output file size exceeds the limit, take appropriate action:
        *   Delete the output file.
        *   Return an error message to the user.
        *   Log the event for further investigation.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Large Output Files:** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents attackers from generating excessively large output files that could consume disk space or cause issues in downstream processing.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Effectively mitigates DoS attacks based on large output files.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Likely not implemented specifically for Typst output.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   The post-compilation size check and enforcement mechanism are likely missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Unnecessary Typst Features](./mitigation_strategies/disable_unnecessary_typst_features.md)

**4. Mitigation Strategy: Disable Unnecessary Typst Features**

* **Description:**
    1. **Review Typst Documentation:** Thoroughly examine the official Typst documentation to identify all available features, configuration options, and command-line flags.
    2. **Identify Unnecessary Features:** Determine which features are *not* essential for your application's functionality. This might include:
        * Features that allow interaction with the external environment (e.g., reading files, accessing network resources).
        * Advanced features that are not required (e.g., complex mathematical typesetting, custom scripting).
    3. **Disable Features (Compiler Configuration):** Use the appropriate mechanism to disable the identified features:
        * **Command-Line Flags:** If Typst provides command-line flags to disable specific features, use them when invoking the compiler.
        * **Configuration File:** If Typst supports a configuration file, use it to disable the features.
        * **API Calls:** If using a programming API, use the appropriate API calls to disable features.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** (Severity: Critical) - Reduces the attack surface by disabling features that could potentially be exploited for RCE.
    * **Information Disclosure:** (Severity: Medium) - Reduces the risk of leaking information through features that interact with the external environment.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):** (Severity: Medium) - Reduces the risk of DoS by disabling computationally expensive features.

* **Impact:**
    * **RCE:** Reduces the risk by limiting the available attack surface.
    * **Information Disclosure:** Reduces the risk by disabling features that could leak information.
    * **DoS:** Reduces the risk by disabling potentially resource-intensive features.

* **Currently Implemented:**
    * Likely not implemented. Typst may use default settings that enable all features.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    * Explicit configuration to disable unnecessary features is likely missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure Trusted Font Sources (Typst Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/configure_trusted_font_sources__typst_configuration_.md)

**5. Mitigation Strategy: Configure Trusted Font Sources (Typst Configuration)**

* **Description:**
    1. **Identify Trusted Sources:** Create a list of trusted font sources. This might include:
        * System fonts that are pre-installed on the server.
        * Fonts from reputable font foundries that you have explicitly downloaded and verified.
    2. **Configure Typst (If Possible):** Look for configuration options within Typst that allow you to specify the allowed font sources or paths:
        * **Command-Line Flags:** Check for command-line flags that control font loading.
        * **Configuration File:** If Typst uses a configuration file, see if it allows you to specify font paths or restrict font sources.
        * **API Calls:** If using a programming API, look for API calls related to font management.
    3. **Restrict Font Access (If Necessary):** If Typst doesn't provide direct configuration options, you might need to restrict the compiler's access to the filesystem to only allow it to read fonts from the trusted directories. This could be achieved through containerization or process isolation (as described in previous responses, but those are *not* Typst-specific).

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Font Parsing Vulnerabilities:** (Severity: Medium to High) - Reduces the risk of exploiting vulnerabilities in the font parsing engine by ensuring that only trusted fonts are used.

* **Impact:**
    * **Font Parsing Vulnerabilities:** Significantly reduces the risk if Typst can be configured to use only trusted fonts.

* **Currently Implemented:**
    * Likely not implemented. Typst probably uses default system font paths.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    * Explicit configuration within Typst to restrict font sources is likely missing.
