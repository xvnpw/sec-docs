# Threat Model Analysis for typst/typst

## Threat: [Parser Buffer Overflow](./threats/parser_buffer_overflow.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a Typst document with excessively long strings or deeply nested structures that exceed the parser's buffer capacity within Typst. This can lead to a buffer overflow, potentially allowing the attacker to overwrite memory and gain control of the application process running Typst.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE) if the overflow is exploitable.
*   **Typst Component Affected:** Parser (specifically string and structure handling within the parser).
*   **Risk Severity:** High (if RCE is possible), Medium (if only DoS - but considering potential for RCE, categorized as High for this focused list).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure Typst is implemented in a memory-safe language (Rust, which is used by Typst, helps mitigate this).
    *   Continuously fuzz test the Typst parser with malformed and oversized inputs to identify potential buffer overflows.
    *   Implement internal limits within Typst parser to restrict the size and complexity of processed document elements.
    *   Regularly update Typst to the latest version to benefit from upstream security patches.

## Threat: [Path Traversal via File Inclusion](./threats/path_traversal_via_file_inclusion.md)

*   **Description:** If Typst allows including external files (e.g., images, fonts, or other Typst documents) and does not properly sanitize file paths provided within Typst documents, an attacker could use path traversal techniques (e.g., `../../sensitive_file.txt` in an `import` or similar directive) to access files outside of the intended directory on the server or system running Typst.
*   **Impact:** Information Disclosure, potentially arbitrary file read of sensitive data on the server or system.
*   **Typst Component Affected:** File Inclusion Mechanism (e.g., `import` directive), File System Access within Typst.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly sanitize and validate all file paths provided in Typst documents before using them for file inclusion.
    *   Restrict file inclusion to a specific allowed directory (whitelisting) and enforce this within Typst's file handling logic.
    *   Use absolute paths internally within Typst or resolve relative paths against a secure base directory.
    *   Implement robust access control checks within Typst to ensure file access is limited to intended resources.

## Threat: [Command Injection via External Command Execution (Hypothetical - if implemented in future Typst features)](./threats/command_injection_via_external_command_execution__hypothetical_-_if_implemented_in_future_typst_feat_cf13cc72.md)

*   **Description:** If future versions of Typst were to introduce features that allow executing external system commands (e.g., for calling external image processing tools or through a plugin system), and user-controlled input from Typst documents is used to construct these commands without proper sanitization within Typst, an attacker could inject malicious commands into the system shell.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server or system running Typst, allowing full system compromise.
*   **Typst Component Affected:** External Command Execution (hypothetical feature, not currently present but a risk if added).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strongly avoid implementing external command execution features in Typst if possible.**
    *   If absolutely necessary, implement extremely strict input sanitization and validation for all user-controlled data used in command construction within Typst.
    *   Use parameterized commands or secure APIs instead of directly constructing shell commands from user input within Typst.
    *   Run any external commands with the least possible privileges in a heavily sandboxed environment, isolated from the main system, if such features are ever added to Typst.
