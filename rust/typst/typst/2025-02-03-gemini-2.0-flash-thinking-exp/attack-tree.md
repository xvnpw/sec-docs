## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Typst Input Processing [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_typst_input_processing__critical_node_.md)

Attack Vectors:
        * Maliciously crafted Typst input designed to exploit vulnerabilities during the parsing or processing stage.
        * Input exceeding expected size or complexity to cause resource exhaustion.
        * Input designed to trigger specific error conditions leading to information disclosure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Server-Side Scripting Injection [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/server-side_scripting_injection__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

Attack Vectors:
        * If the application processes Typst output on the server-side (e.g., parsing intermediate formats, using callbacks), malicious Typst input can inject scripts.
        * These injected scripts can be executed by the server, leading to application compromise, data manipulation, or unauthorized access.
        * Vulnerabilities can arise from insecure handling of Typst output, lack of sanitization, or improper use of server-side scripting languages.

## Attack Tree Path: [Path Traversal / File System Access [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/path_traversal__file_system_access__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

Attack Vectors:
        * Exploiting Typst features that allow file inclusion or access (e.g., font loading, image inclusion, external data sources).
        * Crafting Typst input with manipulated file paths (e.g., using `../` sequences) to access files outside the intended directories.
        * Successful path traversal can lead to reading sensitive files, application configuration, or even writing to arbitrary files if write access is also exploitable.

## Attack Tree Path: [Read Arbitrary Files [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/read_arbitrary_files__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

Attack Vectors:
        * A specific outcome of Path Traversal, focusing on the ability to read files.
        * Attackers aim to access sensitive data, source code, configuration files, or other confidential information stored on the server's file system.
        * This can be a stepping stone for further attacks or direct data theft.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos___high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

Attack Vectors:
        * Crafting Typst input that consumes excessive server resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) during processing.
        * Utilizing Typst features that are computationally expensive or lead to inefficient processing.
        * Sending a large volume of resource-intensive Typst input to overwhelm the server and make the application unavailable to legitimate users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Resource Exhaustion [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/resource_exhaustion__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

Attack Vectors:
        * A specific type of DoS attack focusing on exhausting server resources.
        * Attackers exploit Typst processing to consume all available CPU, memory, or disk I/O, causing the application to slow down or crash.
        * This can be achieved through deeply nested structures, infinite loops (if possible in Typst input), or very large documents.

## Attack Tree Path: [Information Disclosure - Reveal Internal Paths/Configurations [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/information_disclosure_-_reveal_internal_pathsconfigurations__high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vectors:
        * Crafting specific Typst input designed to trigger verbose error messages from Typst or the application.
        * Analyzing these error messages to extract sensitive information such as internal file paths, server configurations, or software versions.
        * This information can aid attackers in reconnaissance and planning further, more targeted attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Typst Binary Vulnerabilities - Known Vulnerabilities (CVEs) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_typst_binary_vulnerabilities_-_known_vulnerabilities__cves___high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

Attack Vectors:
        * Exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in the specific version of the Typst binary used by the application.
        * These vulnerabilities could range from memory corruption issues to code execution flaws.
        * Attackers can leverage existing exploits or develop their own to compromise the application if it uses a vulnerable Typst version.
        * Keeping Typst and its dependencies updated is crucial to mitigate this risk.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Application's Typst Integration [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_application's_typst_integration__critical_node_.md)

Attack Vectors:
        * Vulnerabilities arising from how the application integrates with and utilizes Typst.
        * This is a broad category encompassing issues in input handling, output handling, privilege management, and dependency management related to Typst.
        * Integration points are often less rigorously tested than core components and can introduce new attack surfaces.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Input Handling [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_input_handling__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

Attack Vectors:
         * Lack of proper validation, sanitization, or escaping of user-provided Typst input before processing.
         * This can allow malicious Typst input to bypass security checks and trigger vulnerabilities in Typst or the application's processing logic.
         * Input handling flaws are a common source of various injection vulnerabilities, including server-side scripting injection and path traversal.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Output Handling [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_output_handling__high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vectors:
         * Vulnerabilities in how the application handles the output generated by Typst (e.g., PDF, images, intermediate formats).
         * This can include storing output in insecure locations, serving output with incorrect HTTP headers, or vulnerable post-processing of the output.
         * Insecure output handling can lead to information disclosure, cross-site scripting (if output is rendered in a browser), or server-side scripting injection if output is further processed server-side.

## Attack Tree Path: [Dependency Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/dependency_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

Attack Vectors:
         * Exploiting known vulnerabilities in the libraries and dependencies used by Typst.
         * Typst, like most software, relies on external libraries. If these libraries have vulnerabilities, Typst and applications using it can become vulnerable.
         * Attackers can target these dependency vulnerabilities to compromise the application, even if Typst itself is secure.
         * Regularly scanning and updating Typst's dependencies is essential.
