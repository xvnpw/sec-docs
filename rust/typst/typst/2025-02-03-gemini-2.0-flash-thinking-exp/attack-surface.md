# Attack Surface Analysis for typst/typst

## Attack Surface: [Parsing Vulnerabilities in `.typ` Files](./attack_surfaces/parsing_vulnerabilities_in___typ__files.md)

*   **Description:** Flaws in Typst's parser that can be exploited by maliciously crafted `.typ` files. This includes buffer overflows, out-of-bounds reads, denial of service through complex input, or logic errors in the parser.
*   **Typst Contribution:** Typst's parser is the component responsible for interpreting `.typ` markup. Vulnerabilities here are inherent to Typst's core functionality.
*   **Example:** A `.typ` file with deeply nested structures could trigger a buffer overflow in Typst's parser, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or a crash (DoS).
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution (Critical):** In severe cases of exploitable buffer overflows or similar vulnerabilities.
    *   **Denial of Service (High):** Crashing Typst or causing excessive resource consumption during parsing.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Typst Updated:** Regularly update Typst to the latest version to receive parser bug fixes and security patches.
    *   **Resource Limits:** Implement resource limits (CPU time, memory) for Typst processing to mitigate DoS attempts via complex files.
    *   **Sandboxing:** Run Typst processing in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of potential parser exploits.

## Attack Surface: [Typesetting Engine Vulnerabilities (High Severity)](./attack_surfaces/typesetting_engine_vulnerabilities__high_severity_.md)

*   **Description:** Bugs within Typst's typesetting engine (layout algorithms, font handling, etc.) that can be exploited to cause resource exhaustion or denial of service.
*   **Typst Contribution:** The complexity of Typst's typesetting engine introduces potential algorithmic vulnerabilities that are part of Typst's core processing.
*   **Example:** A specific combination of text, images, and layout commands in a `.typ` file could trigger an inefficient algorithm in the layout engine, leading to excessive memory or CPU usage and DoS.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (High):** Resource exhaustion (CPU, memory) during the typesetting process, making the application unresponsive.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Typst Updated:** Regularly update Typst to benefit from bug fixes and performance improvements in the typesetting engine.
    *   **Resource Limits:** Implement resource limits (CPU time, memory) specifically for Typst's typesetting operations.
    *   **Testing with Complex Documents:** Test Typst with a variety of complex `.typ` documents to identify potential performance bottlenecks or resource exhaustion issues.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Font Handling](./attack_surfaces/malicious_font_handling.md)

*   **Description:** If Typst allows loading external fonts, malicious font files could exploit vulnerabilities in font parsing libraries used by Typst, potentially leading to code execution or denial of service.
*   **Typst Contribution:** Typst's font handling functionality, especially if it supports external fonts, relies on font parsing libraries which can have vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** A `.typ` file specifies a custom font. If a malicious font file is loaded and parsed by Typst, a vulnerability in the font parsing library could be triggered, leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution (Critical):** If a font parsing vulnerability is exploitable.
    *   **Denial of Service (High):** Crashing Typst due to errors during malicious font parsing.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Restrict Font Sources:** Limit the sources from which Typst can load fonts. Prefer system fonts or a curated, trusted font set.
    *   **Font Validation (Limited):** Implement basic checks on font files if external fonts are necessary, though robust validation is complex.
    *   **Sandboxing:** Run Typst processing in a sandboxed environment to contain potential exploits from malicious fonts.
    *   **Keep Dependencies Updated:** Ensure font parsing libraries used by Typst (via Rust crates) are updated to patch vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion (Denial of Service)](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion__denial_of_service_.md)

*   **Description:**  Maliciously crafted or excessively complex `.typ` files can cause Typst to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory) during parsing or typesetting, leading to denial of service.
*   **Typst Contribution:** Typst's core processing of `.typ` files inherently consumes resources.  Certain input patterns can lead to disproportionate resource usage within Typst.
*   **Example:** A `.typ` file with extremely large tables or deeply nested elements could cause Typst to consume all available CPU or memory, making the application unresponsive.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (High):**  Application becomes unavailable due to Typst consuming excessive resources.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Resource Limits:** Implement strict resource limits (CPU time, memory, processing time) for Typst operations.
    *   **Input Complexity Limits:** Consider imposing limits on the complexity of `.typ` files processed by Typst (e.g., file size, nesting depth).
    *   **Rate Limiting:** If Typst processing is triggered by user requests, implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and DoS attacks.
    *   **Asynchronous Processing:** Offload Typst processing to background tasks to prevent blocking the main application and improve responsiveness under load.
