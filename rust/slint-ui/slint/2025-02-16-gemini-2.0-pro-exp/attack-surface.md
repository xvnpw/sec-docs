# Attack Surface Analysis for slint-ui/slint

## Attack Surface: [Malicious `.slint` File (Parsing & Processing)](./attack_surfaces/malicious___slint__file__parsing_&_processing_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious `.slint` file to exploit vulnerabilities in Slint's parsing, processing, or rendering logic.
*   **How Slint Contributes:** Slint's core functionality relies on parsing and interpreting `.slint` files, making this a primary attack vector *directly* controlled by Slint's implementation.
*   **Example:**
    *   A `.slint` file containing an extremely large number of nested components, designed to exhaust memory.
    *   A `.slint` file with invalid property values or malformed syntax intended to trigger parser errors or unexpected behavior.
    *   A `.slint` file referencing a huge image file, causing a denial of service.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS)
    *   Application crashes
    *   Potential (though less likely) code execution if combined with *other* vulnerabilities (but the `.slint` file is the initial vector).
    *   Resource exhaustion.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (if `.slint` files can be loaded from untrusted sources).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:**
        *   **Schema Validation:** Define a formal schema for valid `.slint` files and reject any file that doesn't strictly conform.
        *   **Whitelisting:** Only allow known-good elements, attributes, and property types. Reject anything unexpected.
        *   **Resource Limits:** Impose strict limits on file size, number of components, image dimensions, string lengths, and animation counts.
        *   **"Slint Security Policy":**  A conceptual CSP analogue for defining allowed operations and resources within `.slint`.
    *   **Sandboxing (If Feasible):** Render the Slint UI in a separate, sandboxed process.
    *   **Fuzz Testing:** Regularly fuzz test the Slint parser and rendering engine.
    *   **Developer Training:** Educate developers on secure Slint coding practices.

## Attack Surface: [Callback Exploitation (Data Sanitization)](./attack_surfaces/callback_exploitation__data_sanitization_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates data *within the Slint UI* to inject malicious input into backend callbacks.
*   **How Slint Contributes:** Slint provides the *mechanism* (callbacks) for the UI to interact with the backend. While the backend's lack of sanitization is the *root cause*, Slint's callback system is the *direct conduit* for the attack. The attacker interacts *directly* with Slint components to trigger this.
*   **Example:**
    *   A `.slint` file defines a text input and a callback. The attacker enters a SQL injection payload into the Slint text input. The *Slint callback* then passes this unsanitized data to the backend.
    *   A callback passes a string from a Slint component to a backend function that executes a system command. The attacker crafts the string *within Slint* to contain shell metacharacters.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Code Injection (SQL Injection, Command Injection, etc.)
    *   Data Breaches
    *   Privilege Escalation
    *   System Compromise
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if backend code doesn't properly sanitize input from Slint callbacks). The vulnerability is triggered *through* Slint.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Backend Input Validation and Sanitization:** (Primary Defense) The backend *must* treat all data from Slint callbacks as untrusted.
        *   Parameterized Queries (for SQL).
        *   Strict input validation against whitelists.
        *   Output encoding.
        *   Avoid system calls where possible; sanitize thoroughly if unavoidable.
        *   Least privilege for backend code.
    *   **Slint-Side Input Filtering (Secondary Defense):**
        *   Input Masks within Slint components.
        *   Type Validation between Slint and the backend.
    *   **Code Reviews:** Review callback handling code.

## Attack Surface: [IPC Vulnerabilities (If Applicable and Slint-Managed)](./attack_surfaces/ipc_vulnerabilities__if_applicable_and_slint-managed_.md)

* **Description:** If Slint UI runs in separate process *and Slint itself manages or dictates the IPC mechanism*, vulnerabilities in that IPC can be exploited.
* **How Slint Contributes:** If Slint *provides* or *strongly recommends* a *specific* IPC mechanism, then vulnerabilities in *that mechanism* are directly attributable to Slint. If the application uses a completely independent IPC method, this is *not* a direct Slint concern.  This entry is conditional on Slint's involvement in the IPC choice/implementation.
* **Example:**
  * If Slint *provided* a built-in, custom IPC system, and that system had flaws allowing MitM or message spoofing, this would be a direct Slint vulnerability.
* **Impact:**
    * Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks
    * Message Spoofing
    * Denial of Service (DoS)
    * Data Breaches
    * Privilege Escalation
* **Risk Severity:** High (if Slint-managed IPC is used and not properly secured).
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Secure IPC (If Slint-Provided):**
        * If Slint provides an IPC mechanism, it *must* be secure by design (TLS/SSL, authenticated message queues, etc.).
        * Documentation must clearly outline security considerations for the provided IPC.
    * **Message Validation:** Both sides *must* validate all messages.
    * **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting.
    * **Input Sanitization (Always):** Backend *must* still sanitize all data, even with secure IPC.
