# Threat Model Analysis for slint-ui/slint

## Threat: [.slint File Injection (Spoofing)](./threats/_slint_file_injection__spoofing_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads or otherwise provides a malicious `.slint` file, replacing a legitimate one or introducing a new one. The attacker crafts the file to alter UI behavior, display misleading information, or trigger unintended actions when the user interacts with the seemingly normal UI. This could involve changing button labels, redirecting actions, or displaying fake data. The core issue is that `.slint` files are treated as declarative UI definitions, but they can contain logic and are thus susceptible to injection attacks if loaded from untrusted sources.
    *   **Impact:** Users are tricked into performing actions they didn't intend (e.g., submitting data to the attacker, revealing credentials, executing malicious code). Application integrity and user trust are compromised. Complete control over the UI is possible.
    *   **Affected Slint Component:** `.slint` file loading mechanism (potentially `slint::include!`, file loading APIs, or any custom loading logic). The entire UI definition is at risk.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Source Control:** Load `.slint` files *only* from trusted, controlled locations (e.g., embedded resources, application package). *Never* load them directly from user input or untrusted network locations.
        *   **Input Validation:** If `.slint` file paths are *ever* derived from user input (strongly discouraged), rigorously validate and sanitize the input to prevent path traversal or injection attacks.
        *   **Code Signing (If Feasible):** Digitally sign `.slint` files and verify the signature before loading. This adds a layer of trust but may be complex to implement.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP) (WebAssembly):** If running in a browser, use a strict CSP to limit the sources from which resources (including `.slint` files) can be loaded.

## Threat: [Malicious Data Binding Manipulation (Tampering)](./threats/malicious_data_binding_manipulation__tampering_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides crafted input that, when processed by Slint's data binding system, causes unexpected behavior. This could involve injecting code into expressions, overflowing buffers, or manipulating data types to trigger errors or unintended side effects. The attacker aims to alter the application's state or execute arbitrary code *through the data binding mechanism*. This is distinct from general input validation issues; it targets vulnerabilities *within* Slint's data binding implementation.
    *   **Impact:** Application crashes, data corruption, unauthorized code execution, or unexpected UI behavior. The application's integrity and stability are compromised. The potential for code execution makes this high risk.
    *   **Affected Slint Component:** Data binding engine (property expressions, callbacks, two-way bindings). Specific vulnerabilities might exist in how Slint handles different data types or expression parsing.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Sanitization:** Treat *all* data coming from external sources (user input, network data, files) as untrusted. Sanitize and validate data *before* it's used in data bindings. This is a defense-in-depth measure, as the primary mitigation is to fix vulnerabilities in the data binding engine itself.
        *   **Type Safety:** Use strong typing within `.slint` files and in the backend code. This helps prevent type confusion attacks.
        *   **Expression Sandboxing (If Available):** If Slint provides a mechanism to sandbox or restrict the capabilities of expressions, use it.
        *   **Avoid Complex Expressions:** Keep data binding expressions as simple as possible. Avoid complex logic or calculations within the `.slint` file. Move complex logic to the backend.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Slint updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches that address potential vulnerabilities in the data binding engine.

## Threat: [Component Impersonation (Spoofing)](./threats/component_impersonation__spoofing_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker creates a malicious Slint component that has the same name or interface as a legitimate component. If the application loads components dynamically from untrusted sources, the attacker could trick the application into using their malicious component instead of the intended one. This exploits Slint's component model.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker's component could steal data, perform unauthorized actions, or disrupt the application's functionality. User trust and application integrity are compromised.
    *   **Affected Slint Component:** Component loading and resolution mechanism. This is particularly relevant if custom components are used and loaded from external sources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Vetted Component Sources:** Only use Slint components from trusted sources (official repositories, vetted third-party providers).
        *   **Secure Component Registry (If Applicable):** If using a custom component registry, ensure it is secure and only allows trusted components to be registered.
        *   **Code Review:** Carefully review the code of any third-party Slint components before using them.
        *   **Static Component Loading:** Whenever possible, load components statically (at compile time) rather than dynamically.

## Threat: [Slint Runtime Vulnerability Exploitation (Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege)](./threats/slint_runtime_vulnerability_exploitation__denial_of_service__elevation_of_privilege_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Slint *runtime itself* (e.g., a buffer overflow, integer overflow, use-after-free error). This requires the attacker to provide crafted input that triggers the vulnerability. This is a direct attack on the underlying Slint implementation.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash (DoS), arbitrary code execution (potentially with elevated privileges), data corruption. The severity depends on the specific vulnerability, but code execution is a critical risk.
    *   **Affected Slint Component:** The Slint runtime library (C++, Rust, JavaScript, depending on the target platform). The specific vulnerable component would depend on the nature of the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Slint Updated:** This is the *most important* mitigation. Regularly update Slint to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
        *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Subscribe to Slint's security advisories or mailing lists to be notified of any vulnerabilities.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Run the application with the minimum necessary privileges. This limits the damage an attacker can do if they successfully exploit a vulnerability.
        *   **Input Validation (Defense in Depth):** Even though the vulnerability is in the runtime, robust input validation can make it harder for an attacker to trigger the vulnerability.

## Threat: [Logic Flaws in `.slint` Callbacks (Tampering, Elevation of Privilege)](./threats/logic_flaws_in___slint__callbacks__tampering__elevation_of_privilege_.md)

* **Description:** An attacker manipulates the application's input or state to trigger a callback function defined *within a `.slint` file* in an unintended way. The callback might contain flawed logic that allows the attacker to bypass security checks, perform unauthorized actions, or modify data they shouldn't have access to. This leverages the fact that `.slint` files can contain executable logic.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized actions, data modification, privilege escalation, application instability.
    * **Affected Slint Component:** Callback functions defined within `.slint` files (using the `callback` keyword or event handlers).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Input Validation within Callbacks:** Validate all inputs and parameters within the callback function itself, *even if* you think they've been validated elsewhere. This is crucial because the callback is part of the UI definition.
        * **State Validation:** Before performing any sensitive action within a callback, verify that the application is in a valid and expected state.
        * **Avoid Complex Logic in Callbacks:** Keep callback logic as simple as possible. Move complex operations or security-critical logic to the backend.
        * **Backend Validation:** *Always* validate user actions and data on the backend, even if they appear to be authorized by the UI. Don't rely solely on UI-based checks.
