# Threat Model Analysis for slint-ui/slint

## Threat: [Maliciously Crafted `.slint` File Rendering](./threats/maliciously_crafted___slint__file_rendering.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted `.slint` file that, when loaded and rendered by the application, exploits a vulnerability in the Slint rendering engine. This could involve complex or deeply nested elements, excessive use of resources, or triggering parsing errors that lead to unexpected behavior.
*   **Impact:** Application crash, denial-of-service (DoS) by consuming excessive resources, potential for memory corruption if the rendering engine has underlying buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
*   **Affected Component:** `Renderer` (specifically the parsing and rendering logic for `.slint` files).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Sanitize and validate `.slint` files loaded from untrusted sources.
    *   Implement resource limits for rendering complex UI elements.
    *   Keep the Slint library updated to benefit from bug fixes and security patches in the rendering engine.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Native Code Integration](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_native_code_integration.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker leverages vulnerabilities in the native code (e.g., Rust code) that the Slint application interacts with through the foreign function interface (FFI). This could involve sending malformed data across the FFI boundary, triggering buffer overflows or other memory safety issues in the native code.
*   **Impact:** Application crash, memory corruption, potential for remote code execution if vulnerabilities in the native code are severe.
*   **Affected Component:** `FFI` (the interface between Slint and native Rust code).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Apply secure coding practices in the native code components.
    *   Implement robust error handling and boundary checks when passing data between Slint and native code.
    *   Thoroughly test the integration points between Slint and native code for potential vulnerabilities.
