# Threat Model Analysis for slint-ui/slint

## Threat: [Malicious Slint Compiler](./threats/malicious_slint_compiler.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Slint Compiler
*   **Description:** An attacker compromises the Slint compiler or build tools supply chain and injects malicious code. When developers use this compromised compiler, the malicious code is embedded into the compiled application (WebAssembly or native binary). This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on user machines running the application, potentially leading to data theft, malware installation, or denial of service.
*   **Impact:** Critical - Full compromise of user systems running the application. Potential for widespread malware distribution.
*   **Affected Slint Component:** Slint Compiler, Build Toolchain
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use official Slint releases from trusted sources (official GitHub, package registries).
    *   Implement Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) and dependency scanning for the Slint toolchain.
    *   Regularly update Slint compiler and tooling to the latest versions.
    *   Utilize reproducible builds to verify compiler output integrity.
    *   Employ code signing for compiled binaries to ensure authenticity.

## Threat: [Slint Compiler Vulnerability](./threats/slint_compiler_vulnerability.md)

*   **Threat:** Slint Compiler Vulnerability
*   **Description:** A vulnerability exists within the Slint compiler code. An attacker crafts a malicious Slint UI definition file that, when compiled by a vulnerable compiler, triggers unexpected behavior. This could lead to compiler crashes (Denial of Service for developers), or be exploited to inject code or manipulate the compiled output, potentially leading to runtime vulnerabilities in applications built with the compromised compiler.
*   **Impact:** High - Denial of service for developers, potential for runtime vulnerabilities in applications built with the vulnerable compiler.
*   **Affected Slint Component:** Slint Compiler
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Stay updated with Slint security advisories and patch releases.
    *   Report any suspected compiler vulnerabilities to the Slint development team.
    *   Consider using static analysis tools on Slint code to detect potential issues before compilation.
    *   Implement robust error handling in the application to gracefully handle unexpected behavior if triggered by compiler bugs.

## Threat: [Slint Runtime Library Vulnerability](./threats/slint_runtime_library_vulnerability.md)

*   **Threat:** Slint Runtime Library Vulnerability
*   **Description:** Slint depends on external runtime libraries for certain functionalities. If vulnerabilities exist in these libraries, an attacker could exploit them. This could lead to various impacts, potentially including denial of service or arbitrary code execution within the application's runtime environment.
*   **Impact:** High - Potential for denial of service or arbitrary code execution within the application's runtime environment, depending on the specific library and vulnerability.
*   **Affected Slint Component:** Slint Runtime Libraries (Dependencies)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Identify and track all runtime dependencies of Slint.
    *   Monitor security advisories for these dependencies.
    *   Use dependency scanning tools to detect known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    *   Update dependencies to patched versions promptly.
    *   Consider using dependency lock files to ensure consistent and known dependency versions.

## Threat: [Injection via JavaScript Bridge](./threats/injection_via_javascript_bridge.md)

*   **Threat:** Injection via JavaScript Bridge
*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates user input within the Slint UI to inject malicious code or commands through the JavaScript bridge. If JavaScript code naively uses this input to construct dynamic operations, it can lead to injection vulnerabilities. For example, user input from Slint could be used to perform DOM manipulation in JavaScript, leading to DOM-based XSS if not handled carefully.
*   **Impact:** High - Potential for XSS, command injection, or other injection-based attacks, depending on the context and how JavaScript processes the input from Slint.
*   **Affected Slint Component:** Slint - JavaScript Bridge, JavaScript Integration Logic
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid directly using user input from Slint UI to construct dynamic commands or queries in JavaScript.
    *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for database interactions.
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization in JavaScript before processing data from Slint UI.
    *   For DOM manipulation, use safe APIs and avoid directly setting HTML from user input.
    *   Follow secure coding practices in JavaScript to prevent injection vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Dependencies of Slint](./threats/vulnerable_dependencies_of_slint.md)

*   **Threat:** Vulnerable Dependencies of Slint
*   **Description:** Slint and projects built with it rely on external libraries and packages. If these dependencies contain known vulnerabilities, an attacker could exploit them. This could indirectly compromise the Slint application, potentially leading to denial of service, arbitrary code execution, or data breaches.
*   **Impact:** High - Impact depends on the severity of the vulnerability in the dependency, potentially leading to denial of service, arbitrary code execution, or data breaches.
*   **Affected Slint Component:** Slint Dependencies, Project Dependencies
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Maintain a comprehensive inventory of all Slint dependencies (direct and transitive).
    *   Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using vulnerability scanning tools.
    *   Update dependencies to patched versions promptly when vulnerabilities are identified.
    *   Follow secure dependency management practices, such as using dependency lock files and verifying package integrity.
    *   Subscribe to security advisories for Slint and its dependencies to stay informed about new vulnerabilities.
