# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project aims to provide a declarative UI toolkit named Slint for developers to efficiently build modern user interfaces for various platforms, including desktop and embedded systems. The primary business goals are to offer a user-friendly, cross-platform, and performant solution for UI development, thereby increasing developer productivity and enabling the creation of visually appealing and responsive applications.

The key business priorities are:

*   Ease of Use: The toolkit should be easy to learn and use for developers with varying levels of experience.
*   Cross-Platform Compatibility: Applications built with Slint should run seamlessly on different operating systems (e.g., Windows, Linux, macOS, embedded OS).
*   Performance: The toolkit should enable the creation of performant user interfaces, especially crucial for embedded systems and resource-constrained environments.
*   Community Adoption: Growing a strong community around Slint to ensure its long-term sustainability and feature development.

The most important business risks that need to be addressed are:

*   Risk of low adoption: If developers do not find Slint compelling compared to existing UI frameworks, adoption rates may be low, hindering the project's success.
*   Risk of security vulnerabilities: Security flaws in the Slint toolkit itself could lead to vulnerabilities in applications built using it, damaging reputation and trust.
*   Risk of performance issues: If Slint does not deliver on its performance promises, especially on embedded systems, it may not be suitable for its intended use cases.
*   Risk of insufficient community support: Lack of active community could slow down development, bug fixing, and support for developers, impacting user satisfaction and adoption.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls for the Slint project, based on common open-source project practices on GitHub, include:

*   security control: Public repository on GitHub: The source code is publicly accessible, allowing for community review and scrutiny. Implemented on GitHub.
*   security control: Issue tracking on GitHub: GitHub Issues are used for bug reporting, feature requests, and potentially vulnerability reporting. Implemented on GitHub.
*   security control: Contribution guidelines: Project likely has contribution guidelines that may include some basic security considerations for code contributions (needs verification in repository). Described in `CONTRIBUTING.md` or similar file in the repository.
*   security control: Code review process: Contributions are likely reviewed before merging, which can help identify potential security issues. Implemented as part of GitHub pull request workflow.

Accepted risks for the Slint project include:

*   accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security fixes: As an open-source project, security fixes may depend on community contributions, which can vary in timeliness.
*   accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities due to the complexity of UI frameworks: UI frameworks are complex software, and vulnerabilities can be introduced during development.
*   accepted risk: Limited dedicated security team: Open-source projects often lack a dedicated security team, relying on community and maintainers for security efforts.

Recommended security controls to implement for Slint project:

*   security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST): Integrate Static Application Security Testing tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect potential vulnerabilities in the code.
*   security control: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure policy: Create a documented process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities, making it easy for security researchers to report issues responsibly.
*   security control: Conduct regular security audits: Perform periodic security audits, potentially by external security experts, to identify and address security weaknesses proactively.
*   security control: Security training for maintainers: Provide security training to project maintainers to increase their awareness of secure coding practices and common vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Dependency scanning: Implement dependency scanning to identify and manage vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by Slint.

Security requirements for the Slint project and applications built with it:

*   Authentication:
    *   Requirement: Slint toolkit itself does not directly handle authentication. However, applications built with Slint will likely require authentication mechanisms. Slint should not hinder the implementation of secure authentication in applications.
    *   Requirement: Example applications provided by Slint should demonstrate secure authentication practices where applicable.
*   Authorization:
    *   Requirement: Slint toolkit itself does not directly handle authorization. Applications built with Slint will require authorization mechanisms to control access to resources and functionalities. Slint should not hinder the implementation of secure authorization in applications.
    *   Requirement: Example applications provided by Slint should demonstrate secure authorization practices where applicable.
*   Input Validation:
    *   Requirement: Slint toolkit should provide mechanisms and guidance to developers for implementing robust input validation in applications built with Slint. This is crucial to prevent vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and injection attacks in applications using Slint.
    *   Requirement: Slint examples and documentation should emphasize the importance of input validation and demonstrate best practices.
*   Cryptography:
    *   Requirement: Slint toolkit itself may not directly implement cryptographic functionalities. However, if applications built with Slint require cryptography, Slint should not introduce vulnerabilities or limitations that hinder secure cryptographic operations.
    *   Requirement: If Slint provides any utilities related to data handling or storage, it should ensure that these utilities do not compromise the confidentiality or integrity of data, and ideally support or encourage the use of encryption where appropriate.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes we are trying to protect:

*   Development and distribution of the Slint UI toolkit itself.
*   Adoption and use of Slint by developers to build applications.
*   Reputation and trust in the Slint project and toolkit.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:

*   Source code of Slint UI toolkit: Intellectual property, needs to be protected from unauthorized access and modification. Sensitivity: High (Confidentiality, Integrity).
*   Build artifacts (libraries, packages): Integrity is crucial to ensure users download and use untampered software. Sensitivity: High (Integrity).
*   Developer contributions (code commits, pull requests): Integrity is important to maintain the integrity of the codebase. Sensitivity: Medium (Integrity).
*   Issue reports and vulnerability disclosures: Confidentiality of vulnerability reports until fixes are released. Sensitivity: Medium to High (Confidentiality, Integrity).

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   What is the intended scope of security responsibility for the Slint project? Is it primarily focused on the security of the toolkit itself, or also on providing guidance for secure application development using Slint?
*   Are there specific compliance requirements or industry standards that Slint needs to adhere to (e.g., for embedded systems, desktop applications)?
*   What is the process for handling vulnerability reports and releasing security patches? Is there a dedicated security team or point of contact?
*   What are the performance constraints and target environments for Slint applications, as these can influence security design choices?

Assumptions:

*   Slint is intended to be used by a broad range of developers, from hobbyists to professional software engineers, building applications for various platforms.
*   Security of applications built with Slint is a shared responsibility between the Slint project and application developers. Slint should provide secure foundations and guidance, but application-specific security is the developer's responsibility.
*   The Slint project operates with limited resources typical of open-source projects, relying on community contributions and maintainer efforts for security.
*   The primary deployment model for Slint libraries is through public package registries like crates.io and npm.
