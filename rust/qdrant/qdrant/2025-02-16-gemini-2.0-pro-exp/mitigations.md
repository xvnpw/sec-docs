# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for qdrant/qdrant

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Resource Limits (Qdrant Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_resource_limits__qdrant_configuration_.md)

1.  **Analyze Resource Usage:** Monitor Qdrant's CPU, memory, and disk I/O usage under normal and peak load conditions.
2.  **Set Memory Limits:**
    *   Configure `storage.mmap_threshold_kb` in Qdrant's configuration file. This setting determines when Qdrant uses memory-mapped files (mmap) for storage.  Set this appropriately based on available RAM and expected data size.  Too low, and performance suffers; too high, and you risk out-of-memory errors.
    *   Configure `storage.max_segment_number`. This limits the number of segments Qdrant creates.  Too many segments can lead to performance degradation.
3.  **Set Vector Size Limits:**
    *   Within your application logic *before* sending data to Qdrant, enforce a maximum vector dimensionality.  Qdrant doesn't have a built-in limit, so this *must* be done in the application.  Reject any vectors exceeding this limit.  This prevents attackers from sending excessively large vectors to exhaust resources.
4. **Set limits on the maximum number of vectors:**
    * Configure `storage.max_vectors_per_segment` to limit the number of vectors that can be stored in a single segment.
5. **Configure HNSW parameters:**
     * Configure `hnsw_config.m`, `hnsw_config.ef_construct`, and `hnsw_config.full_scan_threshold` to control the memory usage and performance of the HNSW index.
6. **Configure Optimizers:**
    * Configure `optimizers_config` to control the behavior of the optimizers, which can impact memory usage and performance.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion:** (Severity: High) - Prevents attackers from overwhelming Qdrant by consuming excessive memory, disk space, or CPU cycles.

**Impact:**
*   **DoS:** Significantly reduces the risk of DoS attacks caused by resource exhaustion. (Risk Reduction: High)

**Currently Implemented:** *[Placeholder: e.g., "`mmap_threshold_kb` is set to 2048000 (2GB).  `max_segment_number` is set to 10. No vector size limit is enforced in Qdrant (must be done in application logic)."]*

**Missing Implementation:** *[Placeholder: e.g., "Need to fine-tune `mmap_threshold_kb` and `max_segment_number` based on further performance testing.  Vector size limit is enforced in application, not Qdrant configuration."]*

## Mitigation Strategy: [Separate Index for Untrusted Data (Using Qdrant Collections)](./mitigation_strategies/separate_index_for_untrusted_data__using_qdrant_collections_.md)

1.  **Create Separate Collections:**
    *   Within Qdrant, create distinct collections for data from different trust levels.  For example:
        *   `qdrant.create_collection(collection_name="trusted_vectors", ...)`
        *   `qdrant.create_collection(collection_name="untrusted_vectors", ...)`
    *   Use a consistent naming convention to easily identify the trust level of each collection.
2.  **Configure (If using Authentication):**
    *   If Qdrant is configured with authentication (API keys), create separate API keys with access restricted to specific collections.  For example, an API key for the application component handling untrusted data should *only* have access to the `untrusted_vectors` collection. This is done through Qdrant's access control mechanisms.
3. **Application Logic:** Ensure your application uses the correct collection name when interacting with Qdrant, based on the data source.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Data Poisoning / Model Poisoning:** (Severity: High) - Isolates potentially poisoned data within a separate Qdrant collection, preventing it from contaminating trusted data.

    **Impact:**
*   **Data Poisoning:** Significantly reduces the impact of poisoning attacks by limiting their scope. (Risk Reduction: High)

**Currently Implemented:** *[Placeholder: e.g., "All data is currently stored in a single Qdrant collection named 'all_vectors'."]*

**Missing Implementation:** *[Placeholder: e.g., "Need to create separate Qdrant collections ('trusted_vectors', 'untrusted_vectors') and update application code to use the correct collection based on data source. Configure API keys if authentication is enabled."]*

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure Qdrant with Authentication](./mitigation_strategies/configure_qdrant_with_authentication.md)

1.  **Enable Authentication:**
    *   Configure Qdrant to require API keys for all requests. This is typically done through Qdrant's configuration file (e.g., setting `service.api_key` or similar).
2.  **Generate API Keys:**
    *   Create strong, unique API keys.
3.  **Distribute Keys Securely:**
    *   Provide the API keys to the application components that need to access Qdrant, using secure methods (e.g., environment variables, secrets management systems).
4. **Use API Keys in Requests:**
     * Ensure that all requests from your application to the Qdrant API include the appropriate API key in the headers (usually `api-key` header).

**Threats Mitigated:**
*    **Unauthorized Access:** (Severity: High) - Prevents unauthorized clients from accessing the Qdrant API.

**Impact:**
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access. (Risk Reduction: High)

**Currently Implemented:** *[Placeholder: e.g., "Qdrant is currently running without authentication enabled."]*

**Missing Implementation:** *[Placeholder: e.g., "Need to enable authentication in Qdrant's configuration, generate API keys, and update the application to include the API key in all requests."]*
