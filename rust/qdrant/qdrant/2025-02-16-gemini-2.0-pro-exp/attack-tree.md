## Attack Tree Path: [1. Unauthorized Access to Qdrant Instance [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__unauthorized_access_to_qdrant_instance__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the foundational node for most attacks. Gaining unauthorized access allows the attacker to interact directly with the Qdrant API.
*   **Mitigation Focus:** Preventing unauthorized access is paramount. This involves network security, authentication, and secure configuration.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. Network-Level Access](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__network-level_access.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1. Exposed Qdrant API Endpoint (Misconfiguration) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1__exposed_qdrant_api_endpoint__misconfiguration___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** The Qdrant API is directly accessible from the internet or an untrusted network due to misconfigured network settings.
*   **Attack Vector Details:**
    *   An attacker uses port scanning tools (e.g., nmap) to discover open ports on the target system.
    *   If Qdrant's default ports (6333, 6334) or custom ports are open and exposed, the attacker can attempt to connect directly.
    *   No firewall or network ACLs are in place to restrict access to authorized IPs/networks.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.1. Missing Firewall Rules / Incorrect Network ACLs [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_1__missing_firewall_rules__incorrect_network_acls__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** Firewall rules or network access control lists (ACLs) are either missing, misconfigured, or overly permissive, allowing unauthorized network access to the Qdrant instance.
*   **Attack Vector Details:**
    *   The firewall is not configured to block inbound traffic to the Qdrant ports from untrusted sources.
    *   ACLs are set to allow traffic from overly broad IP ranges (e.g., 0.0.0.0/0).
    *   Incorrectly configured rules allow unintended access.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.2. Default Ports Open without Restriction [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_2__default_ports_open_without_restriction__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** Qdrant is running on its default ports (6333, 6334), and these ports are open to the network without any restrictions.
*   **Attack Vector Details:**
    *   The Qdrant instance was deployed without changing the default ports.
    *   No firewall rules or network ACLs are in place to restrict access to these ports.
    *   Attackers can easily discover these open ports using standard port scanning techniques.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2. Authentication Bypass / Weak Authentication [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2__authentication_bypass__weak_authentication__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker bypasses or circumvents the authentication mechanisms protecting the Qdrant API.
*   **Attack Vector Details:**
    *   Exploiting weaknesses in the authentication process, such as weak passwords, leaked credentials, or vulnerabilities in the authentication logic.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High to Very High
*   **Effort:** Varies (Low to Very High)
*   **Skill Level:** Varies (Novice to Expert)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Varies (Easy to Very Hard)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1. No Authentication Configured [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1__no_authentication_configured__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** The Qdrant instance is deployed without any authentication mechanisms enabled.
*   **Attack Vector Details:**
    *   The Qdrant API is accessible without requiring any API keys or credentials.
    *   This is often a result of overlooking security configurations during deployment.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2.3. API Key Leakage [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2_3__api_key_leakage__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** A valid Qdrant API key is accidentally exposed, allowing an attacker to gain unauthorized access.
*   **Attack Vector Details:**
    *   The API key is committed to a public code repository (e.g., GitHub).
    *   The API key is exposed in log files or environment variables that are accessible to unauthorized individuals.
    *   The API key is inadvertently shared through insecure communication channels.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Very Low (once the key is found)
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Data Exfiltration (After Gaining Access)](./attack_tree_paths/2__data_exfiltration__after_gaining_access_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [2.1. Direct Data Retrieval [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1__direct_data_retrieval__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** Once the attacker has gained unauthorized access, they use the Qdrant API to directly retrieve data.
*   **Attack Vector Details:**
        *   The attacker uses the `retrieve`, `scroll`, or `search` API endpoints to fetch vectors and their associated payloads.
        *   They can craft queries to retrieve specific data or use broad queries to exfiltrate large amounts of data.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (if unauthorized access is achieved)
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Service Disruption (Denial of Service)](./attack_tree_paths/3__service_disruption__denial_of_service_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [3.1. Resource Exhaustion (via legitimate API calls) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1__resource_exhaustion__via_legitimate_api_calls___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker overwhelms the Qdrant instance with legitimate API requests, causing it to become unresponsive or crash.
    *   **Attack Vector Details:**
        *   Submitting a large number of computationally expensive search queries.
        *   Uploading a massive number of large vectors.
        *   Creating a large number of collections.
        *   Exploiting any API call that consumes significant resources.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
