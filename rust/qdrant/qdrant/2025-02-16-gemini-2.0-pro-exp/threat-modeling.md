# Threat Model Analysis for qdrant/qdrant

## Threat: [Unauthorized Data Access via API Vulnerability](./threats/unauthorized_data_access_via_api_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a *vulnerability in Qdrant's API handling code* (e.g., a flaw in authentication logic, authorization checks, or input validation within the gRPC or REST API implementation) to bypass security controls and gain unauthorized access to data. This is *not* about stolen API keys, but a flaw *within Qdrant* allowing circumvention of authentication.
*   **Impact:**  Complete or partial data exfiltration (vectors and metadata), data modification, or deletion.  Loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
*   **Affected Qdrant Component:**  `API Endpoints` (specifically, the gRPC and REST API interfaces), `Authentication Module` (the internal code responsible for verifying credentials).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Qdrant to the latest version to receive security patches.
    *   Participate in or monitor Qdrant's bug bounty program (if available).
    *   Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) *specifically configured to detect and block attacks targeting known Qdrant vulnerabilities*.
    *   Thorough code review and security testing of Qdrant's API handling code (if you have access to the source and are contributing).

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion (Search) - *Internal Vulnerability*](./threats/denial_of_service_via_resource_exhaustion__search__-_internal_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a *specific search query that exploits a vulnerability in Qdrant's search algorithm or query processing logic*. This is *not* just a large number of queries, but a query designed to trigger an internal flaw (e.g., an infinite loop, excessive memory allocation, or a crash) within Qdrant's search module.
*   **Impact:**  Denial of service, making Qdrant unavailable.  Potential for Qdrant process crashes.
*   **Affected Qdrant Component:**  `Search Module` (specifically, the query parsing, optimization, and execution logic), `Query Optimizer`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Qdrant to the latest version.
    *   Fuzz testing of Qdrant's search API to identify potential vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement robust error handling and resource limits *within* Qdrant's search module code.
    *   Monitor Qdrant's internal metrics for signs of resource exhaustion or unusual query behavior.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion (Indexing) - *Internal Vulnerability*](./threats/denial_of_service_via_resource_exhaustion__indexing__-_internal_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a *specific indexing request (or sequence of requests) that exploits a vulnerability in Qdrant's indexing logic*. This is *not* just a high volume of requests, but a request crafted to trigger a flaw (e.g., a memory leak, inefficient data structure handling, or a crash) within the indexing module.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, making Qdrant unavailable for indexing and potentially searching.  Potential for data corruption or loss if the indexing process is interrupted abnormally.
*   **Affected Qdrant Component:** `Indexing Module` (specifically, the code responsible for adding, updating, and deleting vectors), `Storage Engine` (interaction with the storage layer during indexing).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Qdrant to the latest version.
    *   Fuzz testing of Qdrant's indexing API.
    *   Implement robust error handling and resource limits *within* Qdrant's indexing module code.
    *   Monitor Qdrant's internal metrics for signs of resource exhaustion or unusual indexing behavior.

## Threat: [Configuration Vulnerability - *Direct Exposure*](./threats/configuration_vulnerability_-_direct_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Qdrant is deployed with *inherently insecure default configurations* that directly expose the service or data without requiring any external misconfiguration.  This is *not* about user error, but about Qdrant shipping with insecure defaults that are not clearly documented as needing immediate change.  (e.g., a default open port with no authentication).
*   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to the Qdrant instance, data exfiltration, data modification, denial of service.
*   **Affected Qdrant Component:** `Configuration Files` (default values), `Network Interface Bindings` (default listening ports), `Authentication Settings` (default authentication state).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Qdrant developers: Ensure secure-by-default configurations.  Clearly document any required configuration changes for security.
    *   Users: Thoroughly review the Qdrant documentation and *immediately* change any insecure default settings upon installation.
    *   Automated deployment scripts should explicitly configure all security-relevant settings.

## Threat: [Zero-Day Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/zero-day_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a previously unknown vulnerability *within Qdrant's codebase* to gain unauthorized access, modify data, or cause a denial of service. This is a fundamental flaw in Qdrant's design or implementation.
*   **Impact:**  Unpredictable, but potentially severe, ranging from data exfiltration to complete system compromise.
*   **Affected Qdrant Component:**  Potentially any component, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Qdrant updated to the latest version.
    *   Monitor security advisories and mailing lists for Qdrant.
    *   Implement a robust intrusion detection and prevention system (IDPS) to detect and block malicious activity *that might be exploiting an unknown vulnerability*.
    *   Have a well-defined incident response plan.
    *   Qdrant developers: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerability - *Directly Exploitable in Qdrant*](./threats/dependency_vulnerability_-_directly_exploitable_in_qdrant.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability in one of Qdrant's dependencies is *directly exploitable through Qdrant's API or functionality*. This means the attacker can interact with Qdrant in a way that triggers the vulnerability in the underlying dependency, without needing direct access to the dependency itself.
*   **Impact:** Similar to a zero-day in Qdrant, the impact can be severe, depending on the vulnerable dependency and how it's used *by Qdrant*.
*   **Affected Qdrant Component:** Indirectly affects any component that relies on the vulnerable dependency, but the attack vector is *through Qdrant's interface*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Qdrant, as updates often include dependency updates.
    *   Use a software composition analysis (SCA) tool to identify and track dependencies and their known vulnerabilities.
    *   Monitor security advisories for Qdrant's dependencies.
    *   Qdrant developers: Carefully vet dependencies and minimize the attack surface exposed through them.
