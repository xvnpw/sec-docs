# Attack Surface Analysis for qdrant/qdrant

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated/Unauthorized API Access](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticatedunauthorized_api_access.md)

*   **Description:** Direct access to Qdrant's gRPC or HTTP API without proper authentication or authorization.
*   **Qdrant Contribution:** Qdrant exposes APIs for all database operations.  If these are accessible without authentication, any attacker can interact with the database.
*   **Example:** An attacker discovers the Qdrant API endpoint (e.g., `qdrant.example.com:6333`) and uses a gRPC client to list collections, retrieve vectors, or delete data.
*   **Impact:** Complete data compromise (read, write, delete), denial of service, system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate Qdrant instances on a private network or VPC, accessible only to authorized services.
    *   **Firewall Rules:** Strictly limit inbound traffic to the Qdrant API ports (6333, 6334) to known, trusted IP addresses or ranges.
    *   **Authentication:** Implement strong authentication mechanisms. Qdrant supports API keys. Use mutual TLS (mTLS) for the strongest client authentication.
    *   **Authorization:** Implement fine-grained access control.  Restrict API keys to specific collections and operations (least privilege).
    *   **VPN/Proxy:** Require access through a VPN or authenticated proxy server.

## Attack Surface: [Data Poisoning/Vector Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/data_poisoningvector_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious actors adding, deleting, or modifying vectors to manipulate search results, bias outcomes, or potentially exploit vulnerabilities.
*   **Qdrant Contribution:** Qdrant stores and searches vectors.  The integrity of these vectors is crucial for the accuracy and reliability of the system.  Qdrant's core functionality is directly impacted by manipulated vector data.
*   **Example:** An attacker adds many vectors similar to a target vector but with slightly altered values, causing the target vector to be ranked lower in search results.  Or, an attacker adds vectors designed to trigger a specific, undesirable outcome in a recommendation system.
*   **Impact:** Incorrect search results, biased recommendations, denial of service (if crafted to exploit vulnerabilities), potential data corruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Write Access Control:** Limit write access to the API to trusted applications and users.  Use separate API keys for read and write operations.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Implement systems to detect unusual vector additions or modifications *within Qdrant*.  This could involve monitoring vector distributions, clustering patterns, or using outlier detection techniques *integrated with Qdrant's data*.
    *   **Auditing:** Log all vector modification operations *within Qdrant*, including the source IP address and user/application identifier (if authentication is implemented).

## Attack Surface: [Query-Based Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_surfaces/query-based_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers crafting malicious queries designed to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory) and make the Qdrant service unavailable.
*   **Qdrant Contribution:** Qdrant's query engine processes complex vector similarity searches and filters.  Poorly optimized or malicious queries can overload the system. This is a direct attack on Qdrant's query processing capabilities.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a query with a very large `limit` value, requesting an excessive number of results.  Or, they use a highly complex filter with many nested conditions. Another example is sending huge number of requests in short period of time.
*   **Impact:** Service unavailability, performance degradation, potential system instability.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Query Rate Limiting:** Limit the number of queries per client/IP address/API key within a given time window *at the Qdrant level*.
    *   **Resource Quotas:** Configure limits on memory and CPU usage for Qdrant instances.
    *   **Query Timeouts:** Set reasonable timeouts for queries *within Qdrant's configuration* to prevent long-running queries from consuming resources indefinitely.
    *   **Query Complexity Limits:**  Consider implementing limits on the complexity of queries (e.g., maximum number of filter conditions, maximum `limit` value) *within Qdrant's configuration or through a custom middleware*.
    *   **Monitoring:** Continuously monitor query performance and resource usage *within Qdrant*.  Set up alerts for slow queries or high resource consumption.

## Attack Surface: [Filter Injection](./attack_surfaces/filter_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers injecting malicious filter conditions to bypass access controls or exfiltrate data.
*   **Qdrant Contribution:** Qdrant's filtering system allows for complex queries based on vector metadata.  If these filters are constructed from untrusted input, they can be manipulated. This directly targets Qdrant's filter parsing and execution.
*   **Example:** If an application constructs a filter string directly from user input like `filter = f"color = '{user_input}'"`, an attacker could provide input like `' OR 1=1'`, effectively bypassing the intended filter and retrieving all vectors.
*   **Impact:** Data leakage, unauthorized access to data, potential denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Parameterized Queries/Query Builder:** Use a query builder or API that automatically handles escaping and sanitization of filter values. This interacts directly with how queries are sent to Qdrant.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Ensure that API keys have only the necessary permissions to access specific fields and values within the metadata *within Qdrant's authorization model*.

## Attack Surface: [Snapshot/Backup Exposure](./attack_surfaces/snapshotbackup_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized access to Qdrant snapshots or backups.
*   **Qdrant Contribution:** Qdrant supports creating snapshots for backups and recovery. If these snapshots are stored insecurely, they become a target. This is a direct risk related to Qdrant's built-in snapshot functionality.
*   **Example:** Snapshots are stored in a publicly accessible cloud storage bucket without proper access controls. An attacker downloads the snapshot and gains access to the entire database.
*   **Impact:** Complete data exfiltration.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Storage:** Store snapshots and backups in a secure location with strict access controls (e.g., encrypted cloud storage buckets with limited access).
    *   **Encryption at Rest:** Encrypt snapshots and backups at rest.
    *   **Encryption in Transit:** Encrypt snapshots and backups during transfer.
    *   **Regular Auditing:** Regularly audit access logs for snapshot and backup storage.
    *   **Retention Policies:** Implement retention policies to automatically delete old snapshots and backups.
