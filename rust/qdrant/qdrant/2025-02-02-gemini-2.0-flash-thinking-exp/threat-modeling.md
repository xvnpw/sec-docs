# Threat Model Analysis for qdrant/qdrant

## Threat: [Unauthorized API Access](./threats/unauthorized_api_access.md)

**Description:** An attacker attempts to access the Qdrant API without proper authentication or authorization. This could involve exploiting weak or missing authentication mechanisms, brute-forcing credentials, or leveraging stolen API keys. They might use tools like `curl`, `Postman`, or custom scripts to send requests to Qdrant API endpoints.
**Impact:** Data breaches (reading sensitive vector data and metadata), data manipulation (modifying or deleting data), denial of service (overloading the API), and potential compromise of the application relying on Qdrant.
**Qdrant component affected:** API Gateway, Authentication/Authorization Module
**Risk severity:** High
**Mitigation strategies:**
*   Implement strong API authentication (API keys, OAuth 2.0).
*   Enforce API authorization based on roles and permissions (RBAC if available).
*   Regularly rotate API keys.
*   Use HTTPS for all API communication to protect credentials in transit.
*   Monitor API access logs for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Underlying Data Storage](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_underlying_data_storage.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the storage layer where Qdrant persists vector data and metadata. This could involve exploiting misconfigurations in file system permissions, cloud storage IAM policies, or vulnerabilities in the underlying infrastructure. Attackers might use OS-level exploits, stolen credentials, or misconfigured access controls to access the storage.
**Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, and potential compromise of sensitive information associated with vector data.
**Qdrant component affected:** Storage Engine, Data Persistence Layer
**Risk severity:** High
**Mitigation strategies:**
*   Secure the underlying storage infrastructure (filesystem, cloud storage).
*   Implement strict access controls (file system permissions, IAM policies) limiting access to authorized processes and users only.
*   Encrypt data at rest within the storage layer.
*   Regularly audit storage access logs.

## Threat: [Insecure Configuration and Defaults](./threats/insecure_configuration_and_defaults.md)

**Description:** Qdrant is deployed with insecure default configurations or misconfigurations, such as weak passwords, open ports, or disabled security features. This can create vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit. Attackers might scan for open ports and services, attempt default credentials, or exploit known misconfigurations.
**Impact:** Unauthorized access, data breaches, and potential compromise of the Qdrant service and the application.
**Qdrant component affected:** Configuration Management, Deployment
**Risk severity:** High
**Mitigation strategies:**
*   Follow Qdrant's security best practices and hardening guidelines.
*   Review and configure all security-related settings.
*   Change default passwords and credentials.
*   Disable unnecessary features and ports.
*   Regularly audit Qdrant configurations.

## Threat: [Inter-Node Communication Security (Clustered Deployments)](./threats/inter-node_communication_security__clustered_deployments_.md)

**Description:** In a clustered Qdrant deployment, communication between nodes is not properly secured, allowing attackers to intercept or manipulate data in transit. Attackers might perform man-in-the-middle attacks on the network connecting Qdrant nodes.
**Impact:** Data breaches, data integrity issues, cluster instability, and denial of service.
**Qdrant component affected:** Cluster Communication Module, Network Communication
**Risk severity:** High
**Mitigation strategies:**
*   Encrypt inter-node communication channels using TLS/SSL.
*   Implement mutual authentication between nodes.
*   Secure the network infrastructure connecting Qdrant nodes (network segmentation, firewalls).
