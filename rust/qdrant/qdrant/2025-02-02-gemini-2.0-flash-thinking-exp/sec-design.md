# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Vector similarity search for user applications.
  - Data ingestion and updates for vector embeddings.
  - Availability and performance of the vector database service.

- Data Sensitivity:
  - Data: Vector embeddings and associated metadata.
  - Sensitivity: Potentially high, depending on the application. Vector embeddings can represent sensitive information like user preferences, financial transactions, or medical data. Metadata can include personally identifiable information (PII) or confidential business data. The sensitivity level depends heavily on the use case and the data represented by the vectors. If vectors represent user facial features or medical records, the sensitivity is very high. If vectors represent product features for recommendation engine, the sensitivity might be lower.

  - What are the performance and scalability requirements for Qdrant?
  - What is the existing security infrastructure and tooling available in the user's environment?
  - Are there any specific security policies or standards that need to be adhered to?

- Assumptions:
  - Qdrant is intended to be used in a production environment.
  - Security is a significant concern for the user.
  - Standard security best practices for web applications and databases are applicable.
  - Kubernetes is a likely deployment environment, but other options are possible.
  - HTTPS/TLS is used for all external API communication.
