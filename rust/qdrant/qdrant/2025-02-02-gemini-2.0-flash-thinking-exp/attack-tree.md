## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Qdrant API Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_qdrant_api_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **1.1. Authentication and Authorization Bypass [HIGH RISK PATH]**
    *   **1.1.1. Exploit Weak Authentication Mechanisms (if any are enabled/misconfigured) [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **Attack Vector:**
            *   Attacker targets weak or misconfigured authentication mechanisms like API keys or mTLS if enabled in Qdrant.
            *   Exploits easily guessable API keys, lack of API key rotation, or misconfigured mTLS setup.
        *   **Insight:** Qdrant supports API keys and mTLS. Weak keys or misconfigured mTLS can be exploited to bypass authentication.
        *   **Action:** Enforce strong API key generation, rotate keys regularly, properly configure and monitor mTLS.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High (Full access to Qdrant data and operations)
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

    *   **1.3. API Abuse and Rate Limiting Issues [HIGH RISK PATH]**
        *   **1.3.1. Denial of Service via API Flooding [CRITICAL NODE]**
            *   **Attack Vector:**
                *   Attacker floods the Qdrant API with a high volume of requests from one or multiple sources.
                *   This overwhelms the Qdrant server, exhausting resources and making it unresponsive to legitimate requests.
            *   **Insight:** Attacker floods Qdrant API with requests, exhausting resources and making the application unavailable.
            *   **Action:** Implement rate limiting on Qdrant API endpoints, monitor API request rates, use a CDN or load balancer to distribute traffic.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
            *   **Impact:** Medium (Availability disruption, application downtime)
            *   **Effort:** Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Low
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Qdrant Configuration and Deployment Weaknesses [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_qdrant_configuration_and_deployment_weaknesses__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **2.1. Insecure Default Configuration [HIGH RISK PATH]**
    *   **2.1.1. Exposed Admin/Debug Ports [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **Attack Vector:**
            *   Attacker scans for open ports and identifies exposed admin or debug ports of Qdrant.
            *   If these ports are accessible without proper authentication or are intended for internal use only but exposed externally, attacker can gain unauthorized access.
        *   **Insight:** If admin or debug ports are left open and accessible, attackers might gain unauthorized control or information.
        *   **Action:** Ensure admin/debug ports are not exposed to public networks, use firewalls to restrict access, disable unnecessary features in production.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
        *   **Impact:** High (Potentially full control of Qdrant instance, information disclosure)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Qdrant Software Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_qdrant_software_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **3.1. Known Vulnerabilities in Qdrant Core [HIGH RISK PATH]**
    *   **3.1.1. Exploiting Publicly Disclosed CVEs [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **Attack Vector:**
            *   Attacker checks for publicly known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) affecting the specific version of Qdrant being used.
            *   If vulnerable versions are deployed, attacker uses readily available exploit code or techniques to exploit these known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Insight:** Qdrant, like any software, might have known vulnerabilities (CVEs). Attackers can exploit these if the application uses outdated versions.
        *   **Action:** Regularly update Qdrant to the latest stable version, subscribe to security advisories from Qdrant and related communities, implement a vulnerability management process.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High to Critical (depends on the CVE, could be RCE, DoS, data breach)
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/4__denial_of_service__dos__attacks__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **5.1. Resource Exhaustion [HIGH RISK PATH]**
    *   **5.1.1. CPU Exhaustion [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **Attack Vector:**
            *   Attacker sends computationally intensive requests to Qdrant, such as complex queries or large data insertion operations.
            *   These operations consume excessive CPU resources on the Qdrant server, leading to performance degradation or complete service disruption.
        *   **Insight:** Overloading Qdrant with computationally intensive operations (e.g., complex queries, large data insertions) can exhaust CPU resources.
        *   **Action:** Implement resource limits for Qdrant, monitor CPU usage, optimize queries and data insertion processes.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium (Availability disruption, performance degradation)
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low

    *   **5.2. Network-Level DoS [HIGH RISK PATH]**
        *   **5.2.1. Network Flooding (e.g., SYN Flood) [CRITICAL NODE]**
            *   **Attack Vector:**
                *   Attacker initiates a network flood attack, such as a SYN flood, targeting the Qdrant server's network infrastructure.
                *   This floods the server with network traffic, overwhelming its network resources and preventing legitimate connections.
            *   **Insight:** Standard network-level DoS attacks can target Qdrant's network infrastructure.
            *   **Action:** Implement network-level DoS protection measures (firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, DDoS mitigation services).
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** Medium (Availability disruption, network outage)
            *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
            *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
