# Attack Surface Analysis for qdrant/qdrant

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated or Weakly Authenticated API Access](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_or_weakly_authenticated_api_access.md)

*   **Description:** API endpoints lack proper authentication or use easily compromised credentials, allowing unauthorized access.
    *   **How Qdrant Contributes:** Qdrant exposes API endpoints for managing collections, inserting data, and performing searches. If these endpoints are not secured with robust authentication mechanisms provided by Qdrant or its configuration, attackers can directly interact with the database.
    *   **Example:** An attacker discovers the Qdrant API is accessible without any authentication and proceeds to delete all collections, causing a complete data loss.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, denial of service, unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication mechanisms offered by Qdrant or through integration (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0).
        *   Secure default credentials if they exist in Qdrant's configuration.
        *   Utilize Qdrant's authorization features to enforce the principle of least privilege for API access.

## Attack Surface: [Injection Vulnerabilities in API Parameters](./attack_surfaces/injection_vulnerabilities_in_api_parameters.md)

*   **Description:**  Qdrant's API might be susceptible to injection attacks if input parameters are not properly sanitized and validated by Qdrant before being used in internal operations or queries.
    *   **How Qdrant Contributes:** Qdrant processes user-provided data in API requests, including vector data, metadata, and query parameters. Vulnerabilities in Qdrant's input processing logic can lead to injection.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious filter query that, when processed by Qdrant, allows them to bypass access controls or retrieve unintended data.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized data access, potential for remote code execution (depending on the nature of the injection and underlying system).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize Qdrant's features for input validation and sanitization on API endpoints.
        *   If Qdrant supports parameterized queries or similar mechanisms, use them to prevent injection.
        *   Run Qdrant processes with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of successful exploitation.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via API Abuse](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_api_abuse.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can overwhelm Qdrant with a large number of requests, consuming resources and making the service unavailable to legitimate users.
    *   **How Qdrant Contributes:** Qdrant's API endpoints, especially those for resource-intensive operations like large batch inserts or complex searches, can be targets for DoS attacks if Qdrant doesn't have sufficient built-in protection or isn't configured properly.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a flood of requests to the `/collections/{collection_name}/points/batch` endpoint with large payloads, exhausting Qdrant's memory and CPU resources.
    *   **Impact:** Service disruption, unavailability, financial loss due to downtime.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure rate limiting features provided by Qdrant or use external mechanisms.
        *   Configure limits on the size of request payloads within Qdrant's settings.
        *   Properly allocate resources to the Qdrant instance and monitor its resource usage.
        *   Configure appropriate timeouts for API requests within Qdrant.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Data Storage and Access](./attack_surfaces/insecure_data_storage_and_access.md)

*   **Description:**  The underlying storage mechanism for Qdrant data might not be adequately secured, allowing unauthorized access to the raw data.
    *   **How Qdrant Contributes:** Qdrant persists vector embeddings and metadata. If Qdrant's data storage configuration doesn't enforce proper security, attackers gaining access to the server could directly access or modify this data.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the server hosting Qdrant and, due to weak file system permissions on Qdrant's data directory, can directly read the files containing the vector data.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data corruption, loss of data integrity and confidentiality.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure Qdrant to utilize secure file system permissions for its data directories.
        *   Enable encryption at rest for Qdrant's data storage if supported.
        *   Implement regular backups of Qdrant data.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Qdrant relies on third-party libraries and dependencies, which might contain known security vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Qdrant Contributes:** Qdrant's functionality depends on these libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies directly impact Qdrant's security.
    *   **Example:** A critical vulnerability is discovered in a library used by Qdrant for handling network communication, allowing for remote code execution on the Qdrant server.
    *   **Impact:**  Wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, including remote code execution, data breaches, and denial of service affecting the Qdrant instance.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update Qdrant to benefit from dependency updates and security patches.
        *   Monitor Qdrant's release notes and security advisories for information on dependency vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider using dependency scanning tools on the Qdrant deployment environment.
