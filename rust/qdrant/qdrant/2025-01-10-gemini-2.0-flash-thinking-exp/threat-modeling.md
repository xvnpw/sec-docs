# Threat Model Analysis for qdrant/qdrant

## Threat: [Unauthorized Data Access due to Insufficient Access Control](./threats/unauthorized_data_access_due_to_insufficient_access_control.md)

**Threat:** Unauthorized Data Access due to Insufficient Access Control

**Description:** An attacker, either internal or external with compromised credentials, could exploit insufficiently granular access controls within Qdrant to access vector data belonging to collections they should not have access to. This could involve directly querying the Qdrant API.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach, potential exposure of sensitive information encoded within the vectors or associated payloads. This could lead to reputational damage, legal repercussions, or competitive disadvantage.

**Affected Component:** Authentication and Authorization Module, potentially affecting all API endpoints related to data retrieval (`/collections/{collection_name}/points`, `/collections/{collection_name}/scroll`, `/collections/{collection_name}/search`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement and enforce robust role-based access control (RBAC) provided by Qdrant.
* Regularly review and audit access control configurations.
* Apply the principle of least privilege when granting access to collections.

## Threat: [Data Tampering/Corruption via Unauthorized Write Access](./threats/data_tamperingcorruption_via_unauthorized_write_access.md)

**Threat:** Data Tampering/Corruption via Unauthorized Write Access

**Description:** An attacker with unauthorized write access to Qdrant could modify or delete vector data, leading to incorrect search results, application malfunctions, or data integrity issues. This could be achieved by exploiting weak authentication or authorization for write operations within Qdrant.

**Impact:** Integrity compromise, availability issues, potential for application malfunction and incorrect decision-making based on corrupted data.

**Affected Component:** Write API endpoints (`/collections/{collection_name}/points`, `/collections/{collection_name}/upsert`, `/collections/{collection_name}/delete`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong authentication and authorization for all write operations to Qdrant.
* Restrict write access to only authorized users or application components.
* Implement mechanisms for data integrity verification (e.g., checksums).

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) Attack on Qdrant](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__attack_on_qdrant.md)

**Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) Attack on Qdrant

**Description:** An attacker could overwhelm the Qdrant instance with a large number of requests specifically targeting Qdrant's API, consuming excessive resources (CPU, memory) and making the service unavailable to legitimate users.

**Impact:** Availability disruption, inability for the application to perform vector searches and related operations, potentially leading to application downtime and user dissatisfaction.

**Affected Component:**  All API endpoints, Query Processing Engine.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement rate limiting and request throttling on the application side or using a reverse proxy in front of Qdrant.
* Configure resource limits for the Qdrant instance.
* Consider deploying Qdrant in a clustered environment for increased resilience and load distribution.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Qdrant's API or Dependencies](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_qdrant's_api_or_dependencies.md)

**Threat:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Qdrant's API or Dependencies

**Description:** Attackers could exploit known or zero-day vulnerabilities in Qdrant's API endpoints or in the underlying libraries and dependencies used by Qdrant. This could allow for various malicious actions, including remote code execution or data breaches.

**Impact:**  Wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, including complete compromise of the Qdrant instance, data breaches, and service disruption.

**Affected Component:**  Potentially any part of the Qdrant codebase, depending on the specific vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** Critical (if remote code execution is possible), High (for other vulnerabilities).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep Qdrant updated to the latest stable version, as updates often include security patches.
* Monitor security advisories for Qdrant and its dependencies.
* Implement a vulnerability scanning process for the Qdrant instance and its environment.

## Threat: [Insecure Configuration Leading to Exposure](./threats/insecure_configuration_leading_to_exposure.md)

**Threat:** Insecure Configuration Leading to Exposure

**Description:** Misconfigurations in Qdrant's settings, such as leaving default ports open or disabling authentication within Qdrant's configuration, could expose the service to unauthorized access and potential attacks.

**Impact:**  Unauthorized access, data breaches, potential for complete compromise of the Qdrant instance.

**Affected Component:** Configuration settings, potentially affecting all aspects of Qdrant.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Follow Qdrant's security best practices for configuration.
* Change all default credentials immediately upon deployment.
* Ensure strong authentication is enabled and properly configured within Qdrant.
* Restrict network access to the Qdrant instance.
* Regularly review and audit Qdrant's configuration settings.

## Threat: [Compromise of the Underlying Storage](./threats/compromise_of_the_underlying_storage.md)

**Threat:** Compromise of the Underlying Storage

**Description:** If the underlying storage mechanism used by Qdrant (e.g., local filesystem, network storage) is compromised, attackers could gain access to the raw vector data managed by Qdrant.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach, potential exposure of all vector data.

**Affected Component:** Storage Layer.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure the storage volumes used by Qdrant are encrypted at rest.
* Implement strong access controls and security measures for the underlying storage infrastructure.
* Regularly monitor the integrity of the storage volumes.

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass](./threats/authentication_bypass.md)

**Threat:**  Authentication Bypass

**Description:** A flaw in Qdrant's authentication mechanism could allow an attacker to bypass the authentication process and gain unauthorized access to the system.

**Impact:** Complete unauthorized access to Qdrant, leading to potential data breaches, data manipulation, and service disruption.

**Affected Component:** Authentication Module.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Utilize strong and well-vetted authentication methods provided by Qdrant.
* Stay updated with security advisories and apply patches promptly.
* Thoroughly test authentication mechanisms during development and deployment.

## Threat: [Authorization Bypass](./threats/authorization_bypass.md)

**Threat:** Authorization Bypass

**Description:** Even with successful authentication, a vulnerability in Qdrant's authorization logic could allow a user to perform actions they are not permitted to within Qdrant, such as accessing or modifying data in collections they shouldn't have access to.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to data and functionality, potentially leading to data breaches or integrity issues.

**Affected Component:** Authorization Module, potentially affecting all API endpoints.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement and enforce robust role-based access control (RBAC) within Qdrant.
* Regularly review and audit authorization configurations.
* Apply the principle of least privilege.
* Thoroughly test authorization logic.
