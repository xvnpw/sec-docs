# Threat Model Analysis for qdrant/qdrant

## Threat: [Data Breach / Information Disclosure](./threats/data_breach__information_disclosure.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in Qdrant's security to gain unauthorized access to stored vector embeddings. They might use SQL injection (if applicable to metadata queries), API vulnerabilities, or exploit misconfigurations to dump data or bypass access controls. Once accessed, they can extract sensitive information represented by the embeddings.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive user data, intellectual property theft if embeddings represent proprietary information, reputational damage, legal and regulatory penalties.
*   **Affected Qdrant Component:** Storage Engine, API endpoints, Access Control Module
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong access control lists (ACLs) and authentication mechanisms provided by Qdrant.
    *   Enable encryption at rest for vector data and metadata if supported by Qdrant.
    *   Regularly update Qdrant to the latest version to patch known security vulnerabilities.
    *   Harden Qdrant deployment environment by limiting network exposure and using firewalls.
    *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of Qdrant deployment.
    *   Minimize storage of sensitive raw data; only store vector representations when possible.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation within Qdrant](./threats/privilege_escalation_within_qdrant.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with limited access to Qdrant (e.g., a read-only user) exploits vulnerabilities in Qdrant's authorization or role-based access control (RBAC) system to gain higher privileges, potentially becoming an administrator. This could be achieved through exploiting bugs in permission checks or configuration flaws.
*   **Impact:** Full control over Qdrant instance, ability to access and modify all data, disrupt service, create new accounts, and potentially pivot to other systems if Qdrant is interconnected.
*   **Affected Qdrant Component:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Module, Authorization Module, User Management
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Adhere to the principle of least privilege when assigning roles and permissions within Qdrant.
    *   Regularly review and audit user roles and permissions to ensure they are appropriate and up-to-date.
    *   Keep Qdrant updated to the latest version to patch any known privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement thorough testing of RBAC configurations and permission boundaries.
    *   Monitor for unusual activity or permission changes that could indicate privilege escalation attempts.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks against Qdrant](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__attacks_against_qdrant.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker floods Qdrant with a high volume of requests (e.g., search queries, API calls) from a single or distributed source. This overwhelms Qdrant's resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth), leading to performance degradation, service unavailability, and preventing legitimate users from accessing the application.
*   **Impact:** Service outage, application downtime, business disruption, loss of revenue, damage to reputation, user dissatisfaction.
*   **Affected Qdrant Component:** Query Engine, API Gateway, Network Interface
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement rate limiting and request throttling at the application level or using a reverse proxy in front of Qdrant.
    *   Configure resource limits within Qdrant (if available) to prevent resource exhaustion.
    *   Deploy Qdrant behind a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to filter malicious traffic.
    *   Utilize a Content Delivery Network (CDN) or load balancer to distribute traffic and mitigate some types of DoS attacks.
    *   Implement monitoring and alerting for high traffic volumes and resource utilization to detect and respond to DoS attacks.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Qdrant Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_qdrant_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Qdrant relies on various third-party libraries and system dependencies. Vulnerabilities discovered in these dependencies (e.g., in networking libraries, serialization libraries, or operating system components) can indirectly affect Qdrant's security. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities through Qdrant's interfaces or by targeting the underlying system.
*   **Impact:**  Security breaches, service disruption, data corruption, denial of service, depending on the nature of the dependency vulnerability.
*   **Affected Qdrant Component:** Dependency Management, Underlying Operating System, Libraries used by Qdrant
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly audit and update Qdrant's dependencies to their latest versions, including security patches.
    *   Use dependency scanning tools to automatically identify known vulnerabilities in Qdrant's dependencies.
    *   Follow security best practices for managing dependencies in your development and deployment pipelines.
    *   Monitor security advisories for Qdrant's dependencies and promptly address any reported vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Qdrant API](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_qdrant_api.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker attempts to access Qdrant's API without proper authentication or authorization. They might try to brute-force credentials, exploit default credentials (if any), or leverage network vulnerabilities to bypass authentication mechanisms. Successful unauthorized access allows them to perform any API operations, including data manipulation and service disruption.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, denial of service, complete compromise of Qdrant instance, unauthorized access to internal application data and functionality.
*   **Affected Qdrant Component:** API Gateway, Authentication Module, Authorization Module
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable and enforce strong authentication mechanisms provided by Qdrant (e.g., API keys, authentication plugins).
    *   Implement robust authorization checks at the application level to control access to specific API endpoints and operations based on user roles.
    *   Restrict network access to Qdrant API using firewalls and network segmentation.
    *   Regularly audit access logs to detect and respond to suspicious or unauthorized access attempts.
    *   Use strong, unique credentials for any Qdrant administrative accounts.

## Threat: [Service Disruption due to Qdrant Vulnerabilities](./threats/service_disruption_due_to_qdrant_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits known or zero-day vulnerabilities in Qdrant software itself. This could involve exploiting memory corruption bugs, logic flaws, or other software vulnerabilities to crash Qdrant processes, cause unexpected behavior, or completely disrupt the service. Exploits could be delivered through network requests, crafted data inputs, or other attack vectors.
*   **Impact:** Service outage, data corruption, potential data loss, application downtime, business disruption, security breach if vulnerabilities allow for code execution or data access.
*   **Affected Qdrant Component:** Core Qdrant Engine, Any Module with Vulnerabilities
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Stay informed about Qdrant security advisories and promptly apply security patches and updates as soon as they are released.
    *   Subscribe to Qdrant security mailing lists or monitoring channels for vulnerability announcements.
    *   Implement a robust monitoring and alerting system to detect service outages, crashes, or unexpected behavior.
    *   Establish a disaster recovery plan to quickly restore Qdrant service in case of a disruption.
    *   Conduct regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing of Qdrant deployment.
