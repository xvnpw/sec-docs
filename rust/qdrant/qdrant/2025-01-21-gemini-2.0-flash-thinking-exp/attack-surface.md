# Attack Surface Analysis for qdrant/qdrant

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured API Endpoints](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_api_endpoints.md)

*   **Description:** Qdrant exposes HTTP and gRPC APIs. If these are not properly secured, they become entry points for unauthorized access and malicious activities.
*   **Qdrant Contribution:** Qdrant inherently provides these APIs for its functionality, making them a core part of its attack surface if not secured.
*   **Example:** A Qdrant instance is deployed with default configurations and exposed to the public internet without firewall rules or authentication enabled. An attacker can directly access the `/collections` endpoint and list all collections, potentially revealing sensitive data schema or collection names.
*   **Impact:** Data exfiltration, data manipulation, denial of service, unauthorized access to sensitive information.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (if data is sensitive and easily accessible) to **High** (if internal network exposure).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Deploy Qdrant within a private network, behind firewalls, and restrict access to only authorized IP addresses or networks.
    *   **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Implement network-level ACLs to limit access to Qdrant ports (default 6333 for HTTP, 6334 for gRPC) from trusted sources only.
    *   **Enable Authentication:** Utilize Qdrant's built-in basic authentication (v1.7.0+) and enforce strong passwords for API access.
    *   **HTTPS/TLS Encryption:** Always use HTTPS for HTTP API and TLS for gRPC API to encrypt communication and protect credentials in transit.

## Attack Surface: [Lack of Strong Authentication and Authorization](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_strong_authentication_and_authorization.md)

*   **Description:** Insufficient or missing authentication and authorization mechanisms allow unauthorized users or applications to interact with Qdrant, potentially leading to data breaches or service disruption.
*   **Qdrant Contribution:**  Older versions lacked built-in authentication. Even with basic authentication in newer versions, the strength and granularity of authorization might be limited if not properly configured and managed.
*   **Example:** Using Qdrant v1.6.x (or earlier) without any external authentication mechanism. Any application or user on the same network can connect to Qdrant and perform any operation, including deleting entire collections.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized data modification or deletion, privilege escalation, data integrity compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (especially for older versions or deployments without authentication) to **High** (if basic authentication is the only security measure and credentials are weak or easily compromised).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Upgrade to Qdrant v1.7.0 or later:** Utilize the built-in basic authentication feature.
    *   **Implement Strong Passwords:** Enforce strong, unique passwords for Qdrant API access and regularly rotate them.
    *   **Consider External Authentication/Authorization:** Integrate Qdrant with external identity providers or authorization services (if supported or through a proxy) for more robust authentication and fine-grained authorization control.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Resource Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__through_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can overwhelm Qdrant with excessive requests or resource-intensive operations, leading to performance degradation or service unavailability.
*   **Qdrant Contribution:** Qdrant, like any service, has resource limits.  Uncontrolled or malicious usage can exhaust these resources.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a large number of concurrent vector search requests with very high dimensionality or complex filters, exceeding Qdrant's processing capacity and causing it to become unresponsive to legitimate requests.
*   **Impact:** Service disruption, performance degradation, application downtime, data unavailability.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Medium** to **High** (depending on the application's reliance on Qdrant and the ease of launching DoS attacks).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to restrict the number of requests from a single source within a given time frame.
    *   **Resource Limits Configuration:** Configure appropriate resource limits for Qdrant (CPU, memory, disk I/O) based on expected workload and available infrastructure.
    *   **Request Size Limits:**  Enforce limits on the size of vector embeddings, payloads, and query parameters to prevent excessively large requests from consuming resources.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Default Configurations](./attack_surfaces/insecure_default_configurations.md)

*   **Description:** Using default configurations of Qdrant without proper hardening can leave it vulnerable to attacks.
*   **Qdrant Contribution:** Qdrant, like many software, ships with default configurations that prioritize ease of setup over security. These defaults may not be suitable for production environments.
*   **Example:** Running Qdrant with default ports exposed, no authentication enabled, and verbose logging that reveals internal system details. An attacker scanning default ports can easily identify and access the unsecured Qdrant instance.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, information disclosure, data breaches, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Medium** to **High** (depending on the sensitivity of data and the exposure of the default configuration).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Review and Harden Configuration:**  Thoroughly review Qdrant's configuration documentation and harden settings before deploying to production.
    *   **Change Default Ports:** Change default HTTP and gRPC ports to non-standard ports (while still using network segmentation for primary security).
    *   **Disable Unnecessary Services:** Disable any unnecessary services or features that are not required for your application's functionality.
