**Key Components:**

*   **Client Applications:** External applications that interact with Qdrant to store, search, and manage vector data. These applications communicate with Qdrant via gRPC or HTTP APIs. Client libraries are available in multiple languages to simplify integration.
*   **API Gateway (gRPC/HTTP):**  The entry point for all client requests. It handles API requests, TLS termination, authentication (if configured), request routing, and response serialization. Qdrant supports both gRPC and HTTP protocols for client communication, providing flexibility for different client types.
*   **Query Coordinator:**  Responsible for processing incoming queries. It parses queries, distributes them to the appropriate Search Engine nodes (in a cluster setup), aggregates results, and returns them to the client. In a single-node setup, it directly interacts with the Search Engine and Storage Layer. The Query Coordinator optimizes query execution and manages the overall query lifecycle.
*   **Search Engine:** The core component responsible for performing vector similarity search. It utilizes advanced indexing techniques, primarily HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World graphs), to efficiently search through vector data. It supports various distance metrics like cosine, Euclidean, and dot product to cater to different similarity search requirements.
*   **Storage Layer:** Manages persistent storage of vector data, indexes, and metadata. It is responsible for data persistence, retrieval, backup, and data integrity. Qdrant uses local disk storage by default and can be configured for distributed storage solutions or cloud-based storage for enhanced scalability and durability.
*   **Cluster (Optional):** For high availability, fault tolerance, and scalability, Qdrant can be deployed as a cluster.
    *   **Raft Consensus:**  Used for cluster management, leader election, and ensuring strong data consistency across nodes. Raft ensures that all nodes in the cluster agree on the state of the data.
    *   **Data Replication:**  Data is replicated across multiple nodes for fault tolerance and data durability. Replication ensures that data is not lost in case of node failures.
    *   **Load Balancer:** Distributes client requests across multiple API Gateway instances in a clustered environment. This improves performance and availability by preventing overload on a single API Gateway.

## 4. Data Flow

This section describes the typical data flow within Qdrant for key operations.

### 4.1. Vector Upsert (Data Ingestion)

1.  **Client Application** sends an "upsert" request to the **API Gateway** (gRPC/HTTP) containing vector data, associated metadata, and collection name. The request is typically serialized using Protocol Buffers (gRPC) or JSON (HTTP).
2.  **API Gateway** receives the request, performs TLS termination, and optionally performs authentication/authorization based on configured policies (e.g., API key validation). The request is then forwarded to the **Query Coordinator**.
3.  **Query Coordinator** validates the request, checking for schema correctness, data type compatibility, and collection existence. It determines the target collection and shard (in a clustered setup) based on sharding strategy.
4.  **Query Coordinator** forwards the upsert request to the appropriate **Search Engine** and **Storage Layer** instances responsible for the target shard. In a single-node setup, these components are local.
5.  **Search Engine** receives the vector data and updates the vector index (e.g., HNSW graph) with the new vector, ensuring efficient searchability of the newly added data.
6.  **Storage Layer** persists the vector data and metadata to disk, ensuring data durability. In a cluster, data replication is initiated by the Storage Layer to replicate data to replica nodes for fault tolerance. Write-ahead logging (WAL) is used to ensure transaction durability.
7.  **Storage Layer** and **Search Engine** send confirmation back to the **Query Coordinator** upon successful completion of their respective operations.
8.  **Query Coordinator** aggregates responses from Search Engine and Storage Layer, and sends a success/failure response back to the **API Gateway**, indicating the outcome of the upsert operation.
9.  **API Gateway** serializes the response (e.g., into Protocol Buffers or JSON) and forwards the response to the **Client Application**.

### 4.2. Vector Search (Query Processing)

1.  **Client Application** sends a "search" request to the **API Gateway** (gRPC/HTTP) containing a query vector, search parameters (e.g., limit, filters, distance metric), and target collection name.
2.  **API Gateway** receives the request, performs TLS termination, and optionally performs authentication/authorization. The request is then forwarded to the **Query Coordinator**.
3.  **Query Coordinator** parses the query, validates search parameters and filters, and determines the target collection and shards. In a cluster, the query is distributed to relevant **Search Engine** instances responsible for the target shards.
4.  **Search Engine** instances receive the search request and perform a similarity search on their local vector index based on the query vector, search parameters, and specified distance metric. Filtering is applied either pre-index search or post-index search depending on filter complexity and index structure.
5.  **Search Engine** instances return a list of nearest neighbor vector IDs and distances/scores to the **Query Coordinator**. Results are typically limited by the requested `limit` parameter.
6.  **Query Coordinator** aggregates the results from all **Search Engine** instances (in a cluster), merges and ranks them based on scores, applies any necessary post-processing (e.g., global ranking, post-filtering), and retrieves metadata from the **Storage Layer** for the top-k results if requested by the client.
7.  **Query Coordinator** sends the final, aggregated, and ranked search results back to the **API Gateway**.
8.  **API Gateway** serializes the response and forwards the response to the **Client Application**.

### 4.3. Data Update and Deletion

Data update and deletion operations follow a similar flow to upsert and search, involving the **API Gateway**, **Query Coordinator**, **Search Engine**, and **Storage Layer**.  These operations will modify the vector index and persistent storage accordingly. Deletion operations will also trigger garbage collection in the Storage Layer over time. Updates might involve re-indexing vectors in the Search Engine.

## 5. Deployment Architecture

        *   Multiple Query Coordinator, Search Engine, and Storage Layer instances, distributed across shards for parallel processing and scalability.
        *   Raft consensus and data replication ensure data consistency, fault tolerance, and automatic failover.
    *   Data is sharded and replicated across nodes for horizontal scalability and resilience to node failures.
*   **Cloud Deployment:**
    *   Qdrant can be deployed on cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP) using virtual machines, containers (Docker), or container orchestration services (Kubernetes).
    *   Managed Qdrant services are also available on some cloud platforms, simplifying deployment, management, scaling, and maintenance, often offering automated backups, monitoring, and upgrades.
    *   Cloud deployments can leverage cloud-native services for storage (e.g., cloud object storage), networking (e.g., VPCs, load balancers), monitoring, and security, providing a scalable and resilient infrastructure.
    *   Containerization with Docker and Kubernetes allows for easy deployment, scaling, and management in cloud environments. Kubernetes enables orchestration, auto-scaling, and self-healing of Qdrant clusters.
*   **On-Premise Deployment:**
    *   Qdrant can be deployed on-premise on physical servers or virtualized environments, providing full control over infrastructure and data.
    *   Suitable for organizations with strict data privacy requirements, compliance needs, or existing on-premise infrastructure.
    *   Requires managing infrastructure, scaling, maintenance, and security aspects in-house.
