# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for qdrant/qdrant

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_role-based_access_control__rbac_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Roles:** Identify different user roles or application components that interact with Qdrant (e.g., admin, read-only user, data ingestion service).
    2.  **Assign Permissions:** For each role, define specific permissions for Qdrant operations (e.g., create collection, read data, update data, delete data). Use Qdrant's RBAC configuration to map roles to these permissions.
    3.  **Apply Roles to Users/Services:**  Assign defined roles to users or application services that interact with Qdrant. This can be done through Qdrant's authentication mechanism (API keys or future identity provider integration).
    4.  **Regularly Review and Update:** Periodically review the defined roles and permissions to ensure they still align with application needs and security requirements. Update roles and permissions as user roles or application functionalities change.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Data (High Severity):** Prevents users or services from accessing or modifying data they are not authorized to.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity):** Limits the potential damage if an attacker compromises an account, as the account will have limited privileges based on its assigned role.
    *   **Data Breaches due to Insider Threats (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of data breaches caused by malicious or negligent insiders by limiting access based on the principle of least privilege.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Data:** High Impact - Significantly reduces the risk.
