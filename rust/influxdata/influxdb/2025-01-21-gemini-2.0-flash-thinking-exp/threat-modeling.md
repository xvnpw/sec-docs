# Threat Model Analysis for influxdata/influxdb

## Threat: [Unauthorized Data Access](./threats/unauthorized_data_access.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to sensitive time-series data stored within InfluxDB. This could be achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in InfluxDB's authentication or authorization mechanisms, or through the misuse of API tokens. The attacker might read, copy, or exfiltrate the data directly from the database.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive business metrics, potential regulatory compliance violations, reputational damage.
*   **Affected Component:** Authentication module, Authorization module, HTTP API.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce strong password policies for InfluxDB users.
    *   Utilize InfluxDB's built-in authorization system to restrict access based on user roles and permissions.
    *   Regularly review and update user permissions within InfluxDB.
    *   Use secure API tokens for programmatic access and store them securely, leveraging InfluxDB's token management features.
    *   Enable HTTPS for all communication with the InfluxDB API.
    *   Restrict network access to the InfluxDB port to trusted sources.

## Threat: [Data Tampering/Modification](./threats/data_tamperingmodification.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker modifies existing data directly within InfluxDB without authorization. This could involve altering sensor readings, performance metrics, or other time-series data by exploiting weaknesses in InfluxDB's write API or authorization controls.
*   **Impact:** Data integrity compromise, inaccurate analytics and dashboards, flawed decision-making based on corrupted data, potential disruption of dependent systems relying on the data.
*   **Affected Component:** Write API, InfluxQL/Flux query processing (for data updates).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce strong authentication and authorization for write operations within InfluxDB.
    *   Use write-only API tokens for applications that only need to write data to InfluxDB.
    *   Consider implementing data integrity checks or checksums within or alongside InfluxDB.
    *   Monitor write operations for anomalies directly within InfluxDB or through external monitoring tools.

## Threat: [Data Deletion/Loss](./threats/data_deletionloss.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intentionally or accidentally deletes data directly within InfluxDB, leading to data loss. This could be achieved through unauthorized access to InfluxDB's delete functionalities or by exploiting vulnerabilities in its data management features.
*   **Impact:** Loss of valuable time-series data, inability to perform historical analysis, disruption of application functionality relying on the data, potential regulatory compliance issues.
*   **Affected Component:** Delete API, Data management functions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement regular backups of InfluxDB data using InfluxDB's backup and restore features or external tools.
    *   Configure appropriate retention policies within InfluxDB to manage data lifecycle.
    *   Restrict delete permissions to authorized personnel only within InfluxDB's authorization system.
    *   Implement mechanisms for data recovery specific to InfluxDB.
    *   Enable audit logging within InfluxDB to track data deletion events.

## Threat: [InfluxQL/Flux Injection](./threats/influxqlflux_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious InfluxQL or Flux code into queries executed directly against InfluxDB. This can occur if user-supplied input is not properly sanitized or parameterized when constructing queries that are then sent to InfluxDB for execution. The attacker could potentially read sensitive data they are not authorized to access, modify data, or in some cases, potentially execute commands on the underlying server (though less common in standard configurations).
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, potential server compromise (depending on configuration and vulnerabilities within InfluxDB).
*   **Affected Component:** InfluxQL/Flux query parser, Query execution engine.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements** when constructing InfluxQL or Flux queries with user-provided input that will be processed by InfluxDB.
    *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all user-provided input used in queries before sending them to InfluxDB.
    *   Adhere to the principle of least privilege when granting query access within InfluxDB.
    *   Regularly update InfluxDB to patch known vulnerabilities in its query processing engine.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Resource Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__through_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious or excessively resource-intensive queries that overwhelm the InfluxDB server itself, leading to performance degradation or service unavailability for legitimate users. This could involve queries with large time ranges, complex aggregations, or unbounded series cardinality that strain InfluxDB's resources.
*   **Impact:** Application downtime due to InfluxDB being unavailable, inability to collect or analyze data, business disruption.
*   **Affected Component:** Query execution engine, Storage engine.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement query timeouts and resource limits within InfluxDB's configuration.
    *   Monitor query performance directly within InfluxDB or using external monitoring tools to identify potentially malicious or inefficient queries.
    *   Consider using rate limiting on query requests at the InfluxDB level or through a reverse proxy.
    *   Optimize database schema and indexing within InfluxDB for efficient query execution.
    *   Ensure sufficient hardware resources are allocated to the InfluxDB server.

## Threat: [Weak or Default Credentials](./threats/weak_or_default_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** InfluxDB users or API tokens are configured with default or easily guessable passwords directly within InfluxDB's user management system. Attackers can exploit these weak credentials to gain unauthorized access to the database.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data manipulation, potential data loss.
*   **Affected Component:** Authentication module.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce strong password policies for InfluxDB users within its configuration.
    *   Require users to change default passwords immediately upon creation within InfluxDB.
    *   Regularly rotate API tokens generated within InfluxDB.
    *   Implement account lockout policies within InfluxDB after multiple failed login attempts.

## Threat: [API Token Compromise](./threats/api_token_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** InfluxDB API tokens, generated and managed within InfluxDB, are compromised due to insecure storage or transmission. Attackers can use these compromised tokens to perform actions authorized for that token directly against the InfluxDB API.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data manipulation, potential data loss, depending on the permissions associated with the compromised token within InfluxDB.
*   **Affected Component:** Authentication module, HTTP API.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Store API tokens securely (e.g., using environment variables, secrets management systems, or secure vaults) and avoid embedding them directly in code.
    *   Use HTTPS for all communication with the InfluxDB API.
    *   Consider using short-lived API tokens generated by InfluxDB.
    *   Implement mechanisms within InfluxDB to revoke compromised tokens.

## Threat: [Exposure of Administrative Interface](./threats/exposure_of_administrative_interface.md)

*   **Description:** The InfluxDB administrative interface (if enabled) is exposed without proper authentication or authorization directly within InfluxDB's configuration, allowing unauthorized access to manage the database.
*   **Impact:** Full control over the InfluxDB instance, including the ability to create/delete users, modify configurations, and access or delete data.
*   **Affected Component:** Administrative interface.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure the InfluxDB administrative interface with strong authentication and authorization configured within InfluxDB.
    *   Restrict network access to the administrative interface to authorized administrators only.
    *   Consider disabling the administrative interface if not actively used within InfluxDB's configuration.
    *   Ensure the administrative interface is not exposed to the public internet through network configuration.
