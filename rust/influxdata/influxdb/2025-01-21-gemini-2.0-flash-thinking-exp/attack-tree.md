## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Exploit InfluxDB Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_influxdb_vulnerabilities.md)

*   This represents the broad category of attacks that target inherent weaknesses in the InfluxDB software itself.
    *   Successful exploitation can grant attackers significant control over InfluxDB and potentially the application.
    *   Mitigation involves regular patching, vulnerability scanning, and potentially using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) with InfluxDB-specific rules.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH: Exploit Known InfluxDB Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_known_influxdb_vulnerability.md)

*   Attackers leverage publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) in specific InfluxDB versions.
    *   Exploits for known vulnerabilities are often readily available, making this a relatively easy path for attackers with moderate skills.
    *   **Leaf: Identify and Exploit Publicly Known Vulnerability (e.g., CVE) CRITICAL NODE:**
        *   This is the specific action of finding and using an exploit for a known vulnerability.
        *   The impact can be high, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, or denial of service.
        *   Mitigation involves a robust patching process and timely application of security updates.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH: Exploit InfluxDB Configuration Weaknesses CRITICAL NODE](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_influxdb_configuration_weaknesses_critical_node.md)

*   This path involves exploiting insecure configurations of the InfluxDB instance.
    *   Misconfigurations are common and often overlooked, making this a high-likelihood attack vector.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH: Leaf: Exploit Default Credentials CRITICAL NODE](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_leaf_exploit_default_credentials_critical_node.md)

*   Attackers use default usernames and passwords that were not changed after installation.
    *   This is a very low-effort attack requiring minimal skill, but can grant full administrative access.
    *   Mitigation is straightforward: change default credentials immediately and enforce strong password policies.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH: Leaf: Exploit Weak Authentication/Authorization](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_leaf_exploit_weak_authenticationauthorization.md)

*   Attackers bypass or subvert weak authentication mechanisms (e.g., easily guessable passwords, lack of multi-factor authentication) or exploit insufficient authorization controls.
    *   This can allow unauthorized users to access or manipulate data and settings.
    *   Mitigation involves implementing strong authentication methods (e.g., secure tokens, OAuth 2.0) and granular role-based access control.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH: Leaf: Exploit Unsecured Network Configuration CRITICAL NODE](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_leaf_exploit_unsecured_network_configuration_critical_node.md)

*   InfluxDB is accessible from unauthorized networks or the internet due to misconfigured firewalls or lack of network segmentation.
    *   This significantly increases the attack surface and allows remote attackers to attempt exploitation.
    *   Mitigation involves restricting network access to only authorized applications and networks using firewalls and network segmentation. Consider using TLS for all communication.
