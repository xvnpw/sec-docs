# Attack Surface Analysis for influxdata/influxdb

## Attack Surface: [I. InfluxDB HTTP API - Write Endpoint](./attack_surfaces/i__influxdb_http_api_-_write_endpoint.md)

*   **Description:**  The `/write` endpoint allows sending data points to InfluxDB.
*   **How InfluxDB Contributes to the Attack Surface:** InfluxDB provides this endpoint as the primary mechanism for data ingestion. Vulnerabilities in its parsing or processing of incoming data can be exploited.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a crafted data point with excessively long field keys or values, potentially causing memory exhaustion or denial of service within InfluxDB.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, data corruption, potential for exploiting underlying vulnerabilities in the parsing logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict input validation on the application side before sending data to InfluxDB.
    *   Configure rate limiting on the InfluxDB `/write` endpoint to prevent resource exhaustion.
    *   Regularly update InfluxDB to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Consider using authentication and authorization for the `/write` endpoint.

## Attack Surface: [II. InfluxDB HTTP API - Query Endpoint (InfluxQL Injection)](./attack_surfaces/ii__influxdb_http_api_-_query_endpoint__influxql_injection_.md)

*   **Description:** The `/query` endpoint allows executing InfluxQL queries against the database.
*   **How InfluxDB Contributes to the Attack Surface:** InfluxDB's query language, InfluxQL, if not handled carefully in the application, can be susceptible to injection attacks.
*   **Example:** An application takes user input and directly embeds it into an InfluxQL query without proper sanitization. An attacker could input malicious InfluxQL code to extract sensitive data or even potentially modify data if write permissions are also compromised.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized data access, potential data manipulation or deletion.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Parameterized Queries:**  Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when constructing InfluxQL queries based on user input. This prevents malicious code from being directly interpreted as part of the query.
    *   **Input Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user inputs before incorporating them into InfluxQL queries.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the InfluxDB user used by the application has only the necessary permissions for querying data, minimizing the impact of a successful injection.

## Attack Surface: [III. InfluxDB Admin API (if exposed)](./attack_surfaces/iii__influxdb_admin_api__if_exposed_.md)

*   **Description:** The InfluxDB Admin API provides administrative functionalities for managing the database.
*   **How InfluxDB Contributes to the Attack Surface:** InfluxDB offers this API for administrative tasks. If not properly secured, it becomes a high-value target for attackers.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the Admin API (e.g., due to weak credentials or lack of authentication) and creates a new administrative user, granting themselves full control over the InfluxDB instance.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the InfluxDB instance, including data manipulation, deletion, and potential service disruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable the Admin API if not strictly necessary.**
    *   **Strong Authentication and Authorization:**  Enforce strong passwords and implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for the Admin API.
    *   **Network Segmentation:**  Restrict access to the Admin API to trusted networks or specific IP addresses.
    *   **Regular Auditing:**  Monitor access logs for any suspicious activity on the Admin API.

## Attack Surface: [IV. Weak or Default Credentials](./attack_surfaces/iv__weak_or_default_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Using default or easily guessable usernames and passwords for InfluxDB users.
*   **How InfluxDB Contributes to the Attack Surface:** InfluxDB relies on user credentials for authentication. Weak credentials make it easy for attackers to gain unauthorized access.
*   **Example:** An InfluxDB instance is deployed with the default username and password. An attacker uses these credentials to log in and access or manipulate data.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data, potential data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enforce Strong Password Policies:**  Require users to create strong, unique passwords.
    *   **Change Default Credentials Immediately:**  Always change default usernames and passwords upon initial setup.
    *   **Implement Account Lockout Policies:**  Limit the number of failed login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.

## Attack Surface: [V. Exposed InfluxDB Ports](./attack_surfaces/v__exposed_influxdb_ports.md)

*   **Description:** Making InfluxDB ports (e.g., 8086 for HTTP API) accessible from the public internet.
*   **How InfluxDB Contributes to the Attack Surface:** InfluxDB listens on specific network ports for communication. Exposing these ports unnecessarily increases the attack surface.
*   **Example:** The default InfluxDB HTTP API port (8086) is open to the internet. Attackers can directly access the API and attempt to exploit vulnerabilities or brute-force credentials.
*   **Impact:** Increased vulnerability to various attacks, including unauthorized access, data breaches, and denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Network Segmentation:**  Place InfluxDB instances behind a firewall and restrict access to only necessary networks or IP addresses.
    *   **Use a Reverse Proxy:**  Implement a reverse proxy in front of InfluxDB to provide an additional layer of security and control access.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Network):** Only allow necessary network traffic to reach the InfluxDB instance.

## Attack Surface: [VI. Lack of HTTPS Encryption](./attack_surfaces/vi__lack_of_https_encryption.md)

*   **Description:** Communication between the application and InfluxDB occurs over unencrypted HTTP.
*   **How InfluxDB Contributes to the Attack Surface:** InfluxDB communicates over the network. Without HTTPS, sensitive data transmitted (including credentials and data points) is vulnerable to interception.
*   **Example:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between the application and InfluxDB and captures authentication credentials or sensitive data being transmitted.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, exposure of sensitive information, potential for man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enable HTTPS:** Configure InfluxDB to use HTTPS for all communication.
    *   **Secure Certificate Management:**  Use valid and properly managed SSL/TLS certificates.
    *   **Force HTTPS:**  Ensure that all communication with InfluxDB is forced to use HTTPS and disable HTTP access.

## Attack Surface: [VII. Insecure Configuration Settings](./attack_surfaces/vii__insecure_configuration_settings.md)

*   **Description:** Using insecure configuration options within InfluxDB.
*   **How InfluxDB Contributes to the Attack Surface:** InfluxDB's configuration allows for various settings. Some insecure configurations can create vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:**  Authentication is disabled in the InfluxDB configuration, allowing anyone with network access to interact with the database without credentials.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, data breaches, data manipulation, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Review and Harden Configuration:**  Regularly review the InfluxDB configuration and ensure all security-related settings are properly configured according to best practices.
    *   **Follow Security Best Practices:**  Adhere to the security recommendations provided in the official InfluxDB documentation.
    *   **Use Configuration Management Tools:**  Employ configuration management tools to ensure consistent and secure configurations across all InfluxDB instances.
