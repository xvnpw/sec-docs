        * ** InfluxQL Injection
            * Inject Malicious Queries via Application Input

            * Modify or Delete Sensitive Data
    * *** Exploit Data Exfiltration Vulnerabilities
        * Unauthorized Data Access
            * ** Exploit InfluxDB Authentication/Authorization Weaknesses
                * ** Default Credentials
        * Exploit Application Logic for Data Leakage
        * Exfiltrate Sensitive Data
    * ** Gain Unauthorized Access or Control over InfluxDB

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**High-Risk Path 1: Exploit Data Manipulation Vulnerabilities -> InfluxQL Injection**

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits the application's failure to properly sanitize user input or vulnerabilities in the application's logic to inject malicious InfluxQL queries.
* **Mechanism:**
    * The application constructs InfluxQL queries dynamically using unsanitized user-provided data.
    * An attacker crafts malicious input that, when incorporated into the query, alters its intended logic.
    * This allows the attacker to perform unauthorized actions such as:
        * Modifying existing data in InfluxDB.
        * Deleting data from InfluxDB.
        * Potentially executing arbitrary InfluxDB functions or commands depending on the level of access and the specific vulnerability.
* **Impact:** Data corruption, data loss, application malfunction due to incorrect data, potential for further exploitation if the attacker can manipulate data used for authentication or authorization.

**High-Risk Path 2: Exploit Data Exfiltration Vulnerabilities -> Exploit InfluxDB Authentication/Authorization Weaknesses -> Default Credentials**

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker leverages default or weak credentials configured for the InfluxDB instance to gain unauthorized access.
* **Mechanism:**
    * The InfluxDB instance is deployed or configured with default usernames and passwords that are publicly known or easily guessable.
    * An attacker attempts to log in using these default credentials.
    * Upon successful authentication, the attacker gains access to InfluxDB with the privileges associated with the default account.
* **Impact:** Full access to InfluxDB data, allowing the attacker to:
    * Read sensitive data stored in InfluxDB.
    * Potentially modify or delete data.
    * Potentially disrupt the service.
    * Use the compromised InfluxDB instance as a pivot point for further attacks.

**High-Risk Path 3: Exploit Data Exfiltration Vulnerabilities -> Exploit Application Logic for Data Leakage**

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits flaws in the application's code or API design to bypass intended access controls and retrieve sensitive data from InfluxDB.
* **Mechanism:**
    * The application exposes APIs or interfaces that inadvertently reveal InfluxDB data without proper authorization checks.
    * Vulnerabilities in the application's logic allow attackers to craft requests that retrieve more data than they are authorized to access.
    * This could involve issues like:
        * Insecure direct object references.
        * Lack of proper authorization checks on API endpoints.
        * Information leakage through error messages or verbose responses.
* **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data stored in InfluxDB, potentially leading to privacy breaches, reputational damage, and regulatory fines.

**Critical Node 1: InfluxQL Injection**

* **Attack Vector:** As described in High-Risk Path 1.
* **Impact:**  Direct manipulation or deletion of data within InfluxDB, severely impacting the application's integrity and functionality.

**Critical Node 2: Exploit InfluxDB Authentication/Authorization Weaknesses**

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker bypasses or circumvents the intended authentication and authorization mechanisms of InfluxDB.
* **Mechanism:** This can involve various techniques, including:
    * Exploiting default credentials (as described in High-Risk Path 2).
    * Exploiting vulnerabilities in the authentication protocol itself.
    * Brute-forcing weak passwords.
    * Potentially leveraging compromised credentials from other systems.
* **Impact:** Gaining unauthorized access to InfluxDB, which can be a stepping stone for data exfiltration, manipulation, or denial of service.

**Critical Node 3: Default Credentials**

* **Attack Vector:** As described in High-Risk Path 2.
* **Impact:**  Immediate and high probability of gaining full access to InfluxDB, leading to significant security breaches.

**Critical Node 4: Gain Unauthorized Access or Control over InfluxDB**

* **Attack Vector:**  This represents the successful culmination of various attacks that grant an attacker significant control over the InfluxDB instance.
* **Mechanism:** This can be achieved through various means, including:
    * Exploiting authentication weaknesses.
    * Exploiting vulnerabilities in the InfluxDB software itself.
    * Leveraging compromised credentials.
    * Potentially through lateral movement after compromising the underlying operating system.
* **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the InfluxDB instance, allowing the attacker to:
    * Access and exfiltrate all data.
    * Modify or delete data.
    * Disrupt the service.
    * Potentially gain control of the server hosting InfluxDB, leading to further compromise of the application and infrastructure.
