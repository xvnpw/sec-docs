- **InfluxQL Injection**
    - **Description:** Attackers inject malicious InfluxQL code into queries, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
    - **InfluxDB Contribution:** InfluxDB's query language, InfluxQL, can be vulnerable if user-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being incorporated into queries.
    - **Example:** An application takes a user-provided tag value and directly inserts it into an InfluxQL `WHERE` clause: `SELECT value FROM measurement WHERE tag='user_input'`. A malicious user could input `' OR '1'='1'` to bypass the intended filter and retrieve all data.
    - **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, potential denial of service if malicious queries consume excessive resources.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Use parameterized queries or prepared statements.
        - Input validation and sanitization.
        - Principle of least privilege.

- **Weak Authentication and Authorization**
    - **Description:** Using default credentials, weak passwords, or improperly configured role-based access control (RBAC) allows unauthorized access to the InfluxDB instance.
    - **InfluxDB Contribution:** InfluxDB's user management and RBAC features, if not properly configured and maintained, can introduce significant security vulnerabilities.
    - **Example:** An InfluxDB instance is deployed with the default administrator credentials. An attacker discovers these credentials and gains full control over the database.
    - **Impact:** Complete database compromise, including data theft, modification, deletion, and potential denial of service.
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Change default credentials immediately.
        - Enforce strong password policies.
        - Implement and configure RBAC.
        - Disable anonymous access if not required.

- **Unsecured API Access**
    - **Description:** The InfluxDB API is accessed over an unencrypted connection (HTTP) or without proper authentication, allowing attackers to intercept or manipulate data.
    - **InfluxDB Contribution:** InfluxDB exposes its functionality through an HTTP API. If not secured, this API becomes a direct attack vector.
    - **Example:** An application communicates with InfluxDB over HTTP. An attacker on the same network intercepts the communication and reads sensitive time-series data or modifies data being written.
    - **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, potential compromise of the application relying on the data.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Enforce HTTPS.
        - Require authentication for API access.
        - Use API tokens securely.

- **Exposed Administrative Interface**
    - **Description:** The InfluxDB administrative interface (if enabled) is accessible without proper authentication or from untrusted networks, allowing attackers to potentially gain full control of the database.
    - **InfluxDB Contribution:** InfluxDB offers an administrative interface for management tasks. If not secured, it presents a high-value target.
    - **Example:** The InfluxDB administrative interface is exposed on a public IP address without strong authentication. An attacker accesses the interface and can perform administrative tasks, including creating users, modifying configurations, and accessing data.
    - **Impact:** Complete database compromise, including data theft, modification, deletion, and potential denial of service.
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Disable the administrative interface if not required.
        - Restrict access to the administrative interface.
        - Enforce strong authentication for the administrative interface.
