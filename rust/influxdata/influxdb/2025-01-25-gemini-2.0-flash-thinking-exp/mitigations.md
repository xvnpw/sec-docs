# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for influxdata/influxdb

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable InfluxDB Authentication](./mitigation_strategies/enable_influxdb_authentication.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enable InfluxDB Authentication
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Modify InfluxDB Configuration:** Open the InfluxDB configuration file (`influxdb.conf`).
    2.  **Enable Authentication Section:** Locate the `[http]` section.
    3.  **Set `auth-enabled = true`:**  Uncomment or add the line `auth-enabled = true` within the `[http]` section.
    4.  **Restart InfluxDB:** Restart the InfluxDB service for the changes to take effect.
    5.  **Create Admin User:** Use the InfluxDB CLI or API to create an administrative user with a strong password. For example, using the CLI: `influx -execute 'CREATE USER admin WITH PASSWORD \'StrongPassword123!\' WITH ALL PRIVILEGES'`
    6.  **Enforce Authentication:** Ensure all application connections to InfluxDB now use the created credentials for authentication.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized users or applications from reading or writing data to InfluxDB. Without authentication, anyone with network access to InfluxDB can manipulate data.
    *   **Data Breaches (High Severity):**  Reduces the risk of sensitive time-series data being exposed to unauthorized parties.
    *   **Data Manipulation (Medium Severity):** Prevents malicious actors from altering or deleting critical time-series data, impacting data integrity and application functionality.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** High reduction. Authentication is the primary control to prevent unauthorized access.
    *   **Data Breaches:** High reduction. Significantly reduces the attack surface for data breaches by requiring credentials.
    *   **Data Manipulation:** Medium reduction.  Reduces the risk from external unauthorized manipulation, but internal compromised accounts could still pose a threat.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, implemented in the production InfluxDB instance. Configuration file located at `/etc/influxdb/influxdb.conf` on the InfluxDB server. Admin user `influx_admin` is created.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Not missing in production. However, authentication is not enforced in the development and staging environments for easier initial setup. This should be addressed for staging to mirror production security.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_role-based_access_control__rbac_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Roles:** Identify different user roles based on their required access levels to InfluxDB. For example: `read_only_metrics`, `write_metrics`, `admin_metrics`.
    2.  **Create Roles in InfluxDB:** Use InfluxDB CLI or API to create these roles with specific permissions. For example:
        *   `influx -execute 'CREATE ROLE read_only_metrics WITH READ ON _internal'` (Read-only access to internal metrics)
        *   `influx -execute 'CREATE ROLE write_metrics WITH WRITE ON application_metrics'` (Write access to `application_metrics` database)
    3.  **Assign Users to Roles:** Assign users to the appropriate roles based on their responsibilities. For example: `influx -execute 'GRANT ROLE read_only_metrics TO user1'`
    4.  **Application User with Limited Role:** Create a dedicated InfluxDB user for the application with the least privilege role necessary (e.g., `write_metrics` if the application only writes data).
    5.  **Regularly Review Roles and Permissions:** Periodically review and adjust roles and permissions as application requirements and user responsibilities change.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity):** Limits the impact of compromised accounts by restricting their permissions. If an account is compromised, the attacker's actions are limited to the assigned role's privileges.
    *   **Accidental Data Modification/Deletion (Low Severity):** Reduces the risk of accidental data corruption or deletion by users with overly broad permissions.
    *   **Internal Unauthorized Access (Medium Severity):** Restricts internal users to only access data and perform actions necessary for their roles.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Medium reduction. Significantly reduces the impact of compromised accounts by limiting their capabilities.
    *   **Accidental Data Modification/Deletion:** Low reduction. Primarily a preventative measure against accidental errors, not malicious intent.
    *   **Internal Unauthorized Access:** Medium reduction. Improves internal security posture by enforcing least privilege.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented.  Basic roles like `admin` and default user exist.  Application currently uses a user with write access to all databases.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Detailed role definitions and implementation are missing. Need to define specific roles (e.g., read-only for monitoring dashboards, write-only for application metrics), create these roles in InfluxDB, and assign the application to a write-only role.  Also, need to review and refine existing user permissions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable TLS Encryption for InfluxDB HTTP API](./mitigation_strategies/enable_tls_encryption_for_influxdb_http_api.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enable TLS Encryption for HTTP API
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Obtain TLS Certificates:** Acquire TLS certificates for your InfluxDB server (e.g., from Let's Encrypt, internal CA, or self-signed for testing).
    2.  **Configure TLS in `influxdb.conf`:**
        *   In the `[http]` section of `influxdb.conf`, set:
            *   `https-enabled = true`
            *   `https-certificate = "/path/to/your/certificate.pem"`
            *   `https-private-key = "/path/to/your/private-key.pem"`
    3.  **Restart InfluxDB:** Restart the InfluxDB service for TLS to be enabled.
    4.  **Update Application Connections:**  Modify your application code to connect to InfluxDB using `https://` instead of `http://`.
    5.  **Enforce HTTPS:** Ensure all communication with the InfluxDB HTTP API now uses HTTPS. Redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS if possible.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (High Severity):** Prevents eavesdropping and interception of data transmitted between the application and InfluxDB. Without TLS, sensitive data (including credentials and time-series data) can be intercepted in transit.
    *   **Data Confidentiality Breach (High Severity):** Protects the confidentiality of data transmitted over the network.
    *   **Credential Theft (Medium Severity):**  Reduces the risk of credentials being stolen during transmission if authentication is also enabled.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** High reduction. TLS is the standard protocol to prevent MitM attacks and ensure secure communication.
    *   **Data Confidentiality Breach:** High reduction. Encrypts data in transit, protecting its confidentiality.
    *   **Credential Theft:** Medium reduction.  While TLS encrypts credentials in transit, it's not a complete solution for credential management. Secure storage and handling of credentials are also crucial.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, TLS is enabled for the InfluxDB HTTP API in production. Certificates are managed by a certificate management system.
*   **Missing Implementation:** TLS is not consistently enforced in development and staging environments.  Self-signed certificates should be used in these environments to enable TLS without requiring full certificate management, improving security posture even in non-production environments.

## Mitigation Strategy: [InfluxDB Resource Limits Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/influxdb_resource_limits_configuration.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** InfluxDB Resource Limits Configuration
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Resource Limit Parameters:** Review InfluxDB configuration options related to resource limits in `influxdb.conf` (e.g., `max-concurrent-queries`, `query-timeout`, `max-select-series`, `max-connection-limit`).
    2.  **Set Appropriate Limits:** Configure these parameters in `influxdb.conf` to set reasonable limits based on your server resources and application requirements.
        *   `max-concurrent-queries`: Limit the number of concurrent queries to prevent resource exhaustion from excessive queries.
        *   `query-timeout`: Set a timeout for queries to prevent long-running queries from consuming resources indefinitely.
        *   `max-select-series`: Limit the number of series a single query can select to prevent overly broad queries.
        *   `max-connection-limit`: Limit the maximum number of concurrent connections to prevent connection exhaustion.
    3.  **Restart InfluxDB:** Restart InfluxDB for the resource limit changes to take effect.
    4.  **Monitor Resource Usage:** Monitor InfluxDB server resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O) to ensure the configured limits are effective and adjust them as needed.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Resource Exhaustion (High Severity):** Prevents DoS attacks that aim to overwhelm the InfluxDB server by consuming excessive resources (CPU, memory, connections).
    *   **Accidental DoS (Medium Severity):** Protects against accidental DoS caused by poorly written or inefficient queries that consume excessive resources.
    *   **Slow Performance (Medium Severity):** Helps maintain InfluxDB performance and responsiveness by preventing resource contention and ensuring fair resource allocation.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Resource Exhaustion:** High reduction. Resource limits are crucial for mitigating DoS attacks targeting resource exhaustion.
    *   **Accidental DoS:** Medium reduction. Prevents accidental DoS from inefficient queries, improving system stability.
    *   **Slow Performance:** Medium reduction. Improves overall system performance and responsiveness under load.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. `max-concurrent-queries` and `query-timeout` are set to default values in the configuration.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Need to review and adjust resource limit parameters based on server capacity and application load.  Specifically, `max-select-series` and `max-connection-limit` should be configured.  Regular monitoring of resource usage is needed to fine-tune these limits.
