# Threat Model Analysis for influxdata/influxdb

## Threat: [Weak or Default Credentials](./threats/weak_or_default_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers attempt to guess or exploit default usernames and passwords (if any) to gain unauthorized access to InfluxDB. They might use brute-force attacks or consult default credential lists.
*   **Impact:** Full unauthorized access to InfluxDB, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service.
*   **Affected InfluxDB Component:** Authentication Module
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce strong password policies.
    *   Change default credentials immediately upon deployment.
    *   Utilize robust authentication mechanisms (e.g., tokens).

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities](./threats/authentication_bypass_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in InfluxDB's authentication mechanisms to bypass login procedures and gain unauthorized access without valid credentials.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of InfluxDB instance, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service.
*   **Affected InfluxDB Component:** Authentication Module, API Endpoints
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep InfluxDB updated to the latest versions.
    *   Subscribe to security advisories.
    *   Promptly apply security patches.

## Threat: [InfluxQL Injection](./threats/influxql_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious InfluxQL code into queries constructed by the application, exploiting insufficient input sanitization or lack of parameterized queries. This can be done through user input fields or manipulated API requests.
*   **Impact:** Data manipulation, unauthorized data access, potential command execution on the InfluxDB server (depending on vulnerability and version).
*   **Affected InfluxDB Component:** Query Engine, InfluxQL Parser
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with InfluxDB.
    *   Sanitize and validate all user inputs before incorporating them into InfluxQL queries.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Data Access via API or UI](./threats/unauthorized_data_access_via_api_or_ui.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to the InfluxDB API or UI (if enabled and exposed) through weak authentication, session hijacking, or vulnerabilities. They then directly query and extract sensitive data.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, exposure of sensitive information.
*   **Affected InfluxDB Component:** API, UI (if enabled), Authentication Module, Authorization Module
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure InfluxDB API and UI access with strong authentication and authorization.
    *   Restrict access to authorized users and applications only.
    *   Disable UI if not needed in production environments.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Query Overload](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__through_query_overload.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers send a large volume of resource-intensive queries to InfluxDB, overwhelming the server's query processing capabilities and causing performance degradation or service outages. They might craft complex queries or automate query submission.
*   **Impact:** Application downtime, inability to access or write data to InfluxDB.
*   **Affected InfluxDB Component:** Query Engine, API
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement query rate limiting and throttling on the application side or using InfluxDB's configuration options if available.
    *   Optimize queries and data schema for performance.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Write Floods](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__through_write_floods.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers flood InfluxDB with a massive number of write requests, overwhelming the write path and causing performance degradation or service outages. They might automate write requests or exploit vulnerabilities in write endpoints.
*   **Impact:** Application downtime, inability to write data to InfluxDB, potential data loss if write queue overflows.
*   **Affected InfluxDB Component:** Write Engine, API
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement write rate limiting and throttling on the application side.
    *   Implement queueing mechanisms to handle bursts of write requests.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Software Vulnerabilities leading to Crashes](./threats/exploitation_of_software_vulnerabilities_leading_to_crashes.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit known or unknown vulnerabilities in InfluxDB itself or its dependencies to cause server crashes and service outages. They might use publicly available exploits or develop custom exploits.
*   **Impact:** Application downtime, data unavailability.
*   **Affected InfluxDB Component:** Core InfluxDB Components, Dependencies
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep InfluxDB updated to the latest versions.
    *   Subscribe to security advisories.
    *   Promptly apply security patches.

## Threat: [Lack of Security Updates and Patching](./threats/lack_of_security_updates_and_patching.md)

*   **Description:** Failure to apply security updates and patches to InfluxDB instances leaves them vulnerable to known exploits. Attackers can leverage publicly available exploit code to compromise outdated systems.
*   **Impact:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, denial of service, or complete system compromise.
*   **Affected InfluxDB Component:** All InfluxDB Components, Dependencies
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Establish a regular patching schedule for InfluxDB and its dependencies.
    *   Subscribe to security advisories and promptly apply security patches.

## Threat: [Known Vulnerabilities in InfluxDB](./threats/known_vulnerabilities_in_influxdb.md)

*   **Description:** Publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in specific versions of InfluxDB are exploited by attackers. They use exploit code or techniques described in vulnerability disclosures to target vulnerable instances.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but could include unauthorized access, data breaches, denial of service, or remote code execution.
*   **Affected InfluxDB Component:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, could affect any component.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Stay informed about known vulnerabilities by subscribing to security advisories and monitoring vulnerability databases.
    *   Upgrade InfluxDB to patched versions as soon as possible.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries or dependencies used by InfluxDB are exploited to compromise InfluxDB. Attackers target vulnerabilities in underlying software components.
*   **Impact:** Similar to vulnerabilities in InfluxDB itself, impacts can range from data breaches to denial of service.
*   **Affected InfluxDB Component:** Dependencies, potentially affecting various InfluxDB components.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly scan InfluxDB dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
    *   Update dependencies to patched versions.
