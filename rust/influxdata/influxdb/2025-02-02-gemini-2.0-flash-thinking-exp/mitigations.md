# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for influxdata/influxdb

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable Authentication](./mitigation_strategies/enable_authentication.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Edit the InfluxDB configuration file (typically `influxdb.conf`).
    2.  Locate the `[http]` section.
    3.  Set the `auth-enabled` parameter to `true`.
    4.  Restart the InfluxDB service for the changes to take effect.
    5.  Create administrative users and other necessary users with appropriate permissions using the `influx` CLI or InfluxDB UI.
    6.  Configure your application to authenticate with InfluxDB using the created user credentials (username and password) when connecting.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Access (High Severity) - Prevents unauthorized individuals or systems from accessing and manipulating InfluxDB data.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Access: High reduction. This strategy is fundamental and drastically reduces the risk of unauthorized access.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, enabled in the production and staging InfluxDB instances. Configuration is managed through infrastructure-as-code (Terraform) in `terraform/influxdb/influxdb.tf`.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Authentication is currently disabled in the local development InfluxDB environment. This should be addressed by providing a secure default configuration for local development as well.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_role-based_access_control__rbac_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  After enabling authentication, define specific roles within InfluxDB that correspond to different levels of access needed by users and applications.
    2.  Utilize InfluxDB's RBAC features (users, roles, permissions) to create roles such as `read-only`, `write-only`, `read-write`, and `admin`.
    3.  Grant each user or application only the minimum necessary permissions required for their function using InfluxDB's permission system.
    4.  Regularly review and audit user roles and permissions within InfluxDB to ensure they remain appropriate.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Privilege Escalation (Medium to High Severity) - Limits the potential damage from compromised accounts by restricting their capabilities within InfluxDB.
    *   Data Breach due to Over-Permissive Access (Medium Severity) - Reduces the risk of data breaches by limiting who can access and modify data within InfluxDB.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Privilege Escalation: Medium to High reduction. Significantly reduces the impact of compromised accounts within InfluxDB.
    *   Data Breach due to Over-Permissive Access: Medium reduction. Limits the scope of potential data breaches within InfluxDB.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. RBAC is configured in production and staging environments, with separate roles for applications and administrators. Roles are defined in `ansible/influxdb/roles.yml`.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Granular permissions are not fully defined for all applications within InfluxDB. A review and refinement of application-specific roles is needed to enforce stricter least privilege within InfluxDB.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use Parameterized Queries](./mitigation_strategies/use_parameterized_queries.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  When constructing InfluxDB queries in your application code, avoid string concatenation to include user-supplied input directly into the query string.
    2.  Utilize the parameterized query features provided by your InfluxDB client library (e.g., for Python, use the `params` argument in the InfluxDB client).
    3.  Pass user inputs as parameters to the query instead of embedding them directly. The client library will handle proper escaping and quoting for InfluxDB queries.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   InfluxDB Query Injection (High Severity) - Prevents attackers from manipulating query structure by injecting malicious code through user inputs, specifically targeting InfluxDB queries.
*   **Impact:**
    *   InfluxDB Query Injection: High reduction. Effectively eliminates the risk of query injection vulnerabilities in InfluxDB queries.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, parameterized queries are used in the primary data ingestion and querying modules of the application when interacting with InfluxDB. Code examples are in `app/data_ingestion.py` and `app/query_module.py`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Legacy parts of the application and some less frequently used scripts might still be using string concatenation for InfluxDB query construction. A code audit is needed to refactor these instances to use parameterized queries consistently for InfluxDB interactions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limits and Quotas](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limits_and_quotas.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Utilize InfluxDB's configuration options to set resource limits and quotas for users, databases, and queries.
    2.  Limit query execution time within InfluxDB to prevent long-running queries from consuming excessive resources.
    3.  Set limits on memory usage per query or per user within InfluxDB to prevent memory exhaustion.
    4.  Implement cardinality limits within InfluxDB to control the number of unique series.
    5.  Monitor InfluxDB resource usage and adjust limits as needed based on performance and security considerations within InfluxDB.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) - Prevents malicious or poorly optimized queries from consuming excessive InfluxDB resources.
    *   Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity) - Protects InfluxDB from resource exhaustion due to runaway queries or excessive data ingestion.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service: High reduction. Significantly reduces the risk of DoS attacks targeting InfluxDB resources.
    *   Resource Exhaustion: Medium reduction. Prevents resource exhaustion within InfluxDB.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Query timeouts are configured in the application. Basic resource limits are set in InfluxDB configuration.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  More comprehensive resource limits and quotas need to be implemented within InfluxDB, including memory limits, cardinality limits, and user-specific quotas. Monitoring of InfluxDB resource usage and automated adjustments of limits are also needed.

    4.  Regularly review and optimize slow or resource-intensive InfluxDB queries. Use InfluxDB's query profiling tools.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (Self-Inflicted) - Prevents accidental DoS caused by poorly optimized InfluxDB queries.
    *   Performance Degradation (Self-Inflicted) - Maintains stable InfluxDB performance by ensuring efficient query execution.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service: Medium reduction of self-inflicted DoS on InfluxDB.
    *   Performance Degradation: High reduction of performance issues caused by inefficient InfluxDB queries.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Developers are generally aware of InfluxDB query optimization best practices. Basic indexing is in place in InfluxDB schema.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Formal InfluxDB query optimization guidelines and training for developers are needed. Regular InfluxDB query performance reviews and optimization efforts are not consistently performed.
