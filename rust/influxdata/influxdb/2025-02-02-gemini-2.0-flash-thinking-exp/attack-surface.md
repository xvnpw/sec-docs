# Attack Surface Analysis for influxdata/influxdb

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected HTTP API](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_http_api.md)

Description: InfluxDB's HTTP API, used for data interaction, is exposed without encryption.
InfluxDB Contribution: InfluxDB's default configuration allows HTTP API access over unencrypted connections.
Example: Credentials sent via Basic Authentication over HTTP are intercepted by a network attacker. Query results containing sensitive data are also exposed in transit.
Impact: Data breaches, credential theft, data manipulation, loss of confidentiality and integrity.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Enable HTTPS: Configure InfluxDB to use TLS/SSL for all HTTP API communication.
    * Disable HTTP if possible: If HTTPS is enabled, disable the HTTP port to force encrypted communication.

## Attack Surface: [Exposed Ports](./attack_surfaces/exposed_ports.md)

Description: InfluxDB ports (e.g., 8086, 8088) are accessible from the internet or untrusted networks.
InfluxDB Contribution: InfluxDB listens on default ports which might be inadvertently exposed during deployment.
Example: An attacker from the internet directly accesses the InfluxDB HTTP API on port 8086 and attempts brute-force authentication or exploits a known vulnerability.
Impact: Unauthorized access, data breaches, data manipulation, denial of service, potential system compromise.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Firewall Configuration: Implement strict firewall rules to restrict access to InfluxDB ports only from trusted sources (e.g., application servers).
    * Network Segmentation: Deploy InfluxDB within a private network, inaccessible from the public internet.

## Attack Surface: [Weak or Default Credentials](./attack_surfaces/weak_or_default_credentials.md)

Description: InfluxDB is configured with default or easily guessable usernames and passwords.
InfluxDB Contribution: InfluxDB allows for user creation and authentication, but relies on users to set strong credentials.
Example: An administrator uses "admin/admin" as credentials for the InfluxDB admin user. An attacker uses these default credentials to gain full administrative access.
Impact: Unauthorized access, data breaches, data manipulation, denial of service, complete system compromise.
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Strong Password Policy: Enforce strong, unique passwords for all InfluxDB users.
    * Credential Management: Use a secure password management system to generate and store credentials.
    * Regular Password Rotation: Implement a policy for regular password changes.
    * Disable Default Accounts: If possible, disable or rename default administrative accounts.

## Attack Surface: [InfluxQL/Flux Injection](./attack_surfaces/influxqlflux_injection.md)

Description: User-provided input is directly embedded into InfluxQL or Flux queries without proper sanitization.
InfluxDB Contribution: InfluxDB uses InfluxQL and Flux as query languages, which can be vulnerable to injection if not handled carefully.
Example: An application takes user input for a tag value and directly inserts it into an InfluxQL query. An attacker crafts a malicious input that modifies the query's intent, potentially extracting unauthorized data.
Impact: Data breaches, data manipulation, unauthorized actions, potential for privilege escalation.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Input Sanitization: Sanitize and validate all user-provided input before incorporating it into queries.
    * Parameterized Queries (if available and applicable):  Use parameterized queries or prepared statements if supported by the InfluxDB client library to separate query structure from user data.
    * Principle of Least Privilege: Grant users only the necessary permissions to access and query data.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfigurations](./attack_surfaces/misconfigurations.md)

Description: InfluxDB is improperly configured, leading to security weaknesses.
InfluxDB Contribution: InfluxDB offers various configuration options, and incorrect settings can create vulnerabilities.
Example: Authentication is disabled, allowing anonymous access to InfluxDB. Authorization is not properly configured, granting users excessive privileges.
Impact: Unauthorized access, data breaches, data manipulation, denial of service, potential system compromise.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Secure Configuration Review: Regularly review InfluxDB configuration settings against security best practices and hardening guides.
    * Principle of Least Privilege: Configure authentication and authorization to grant users only the necessary permissions.
    * Disable Unnecessary Features: Disable any InfluxDB features or functionalities that are not required.
    * Configuration Management: Use configuration management tools to ensure consistent and secure configurations across InfluxDB instances.
