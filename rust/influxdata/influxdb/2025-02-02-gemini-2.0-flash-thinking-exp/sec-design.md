# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- Data Ingestion: The ability to reliably ingest time-series data from various sources is critical for monitoring, analytics, and real-time applications. Disruption of data ingestion can lead to data loss and incomplete insights.
- Data Querying and Analysis: The ability to efficiently query and analyze time-series data is essential for users to gain insights, monitor system health, and make informed decisions. Performance degradation or unavailability of query services can severely impact business operations.
- Data Storage and Retention: Reliable and secure data storage is crucial for preserving historical data and ensuring data availability for future analysis. Data loss or corruption can lead to loss of valuable information and compliance issues.
- Alerting and Notifications: For monitoring use cases, the ability to trigger alerts based on data thresholds is critical for proactive issue detection and resolution. Failure of alerting mechanisms can lead to missed critical events.

Data Sensitivity:
- Time-series data stored in InfluxDB can vary in sensitivity depending on the use case.
    - Low Sensitivity: System performance metrics (CPU utilization, network traffic) might be considered low sensitivity in many contexts.
    - Medium Sensitivity: Application performance metrics, website traffic data, or IoT sensor data might be considered medium sensitivity, as they could reveal business trends or operational details.
    - High Sensitivity: In some cases, InfluxDB might store personally identifiable information (PII) or protected health information (PHI) if used for specific applications (e.g., user behavior tracking, healthcare monitoring). This data would be considered high sensitivity and require strict security and compliance measures.
