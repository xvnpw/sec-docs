## Deep Analysis: Data Deletion via Unauthorized Write Access in InfluxDB

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Data Deletion via Unauthorized Write Access" threat, identify its root causes, explore potential attack vectors, and refine mitigation strategies beyond the initial high-level descriptions.  This includes identifying specific code paths and configurations that could be exploited.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses on the following aspects of InfluxDB:

*   **InfluxDB versions:** Primarily targeting the latest stable releases of InfluxDB 1.x and 2.x, but considering potential vulnerabilities that might exist in older, supported versions.
*   **API Endpoints:**  Specifically, the `/write` and `/query` endpoints (for `DELETE` statements) and any other endpoints that could be used to manipulate data or retention policies.
*   **Authentication and Authorization Mechanisms:**  How InfluxDB handles user authentication and authorization, including built-in mechanisms and potential integrations with external identity providers.
*   **Configuration Files:**  `influxdb.conf` (1.x) and environment variables/CLI flags (2.x) related to security, authentication, and authorization.
*   **Storage Engine:**  The `tsdb` package and how it handles delete operations.
*   **Client Libraries:**  Commonly used client libraries (e.g., Python, Go) and how they interact with the InfluxDB API.  This is important for understanding how applications might be misconfigured or exploited.

**Methodology:**

The analysis will employ the following methods:

1.  **Code Review:**  Examine the InfluxDB source code (available on GitHub) to identify potential vulnerabilities in the handling of write requests, authorization checks, and delete operations.  This will focus on the `httpd` service, API handlers, and the `tsdb` package.
2.  **Configuration Analysis:**  Review the default configuration files and documentation to identify potentially insecure default settings and common misconfigurations.
3.  **Vulnerability Database Research:**  Search for known vulnerabilities (CVEs) related to unauthorized write access or data deletion in InfluxDB.
4.  **Penetration Testing (Conceptual):**  Describe potential penetration testing scenarios that could be used to exploit this vulnerability.  This will not involve actual penetration testing, but rather a theoretical exploration of attack vectors.
5.  **Threat Modeling Refinement:**  Use the findings from the above steps to refine the initial threat model and provide more specific and actionable mitigation recommendations.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

**2.1 Root Causes and Attack Vectors:**

*   **Insufficient Authentication/Authorization:**
    *   **Weak or Default Credentials:**  Using default usernames and passwords (e.g., `admin`/`admin`) or easily guessable credentials.
    *   **Missing Authentication:**  Running InfluxDB without any authentication enabled (a highly insecure configuration).
    *   **Overly Permissive Authorization:**  Granting users or applications write access to databases or measurements they don't need access to.  Specifically, granting permissions that allow `DELETE` operations unnecessarily.
    *   **Token Mismanagement (2.x):**  In InfluxDB 2.x, API tokens are used for authentication.  If these tokens are leaked, compromised, or have overly broad permissions, an attacker can gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Bypassing Authorization Checks:**  Potential vulnerabilities in the code that handles authorization checks could allow an attacker to bypass these checks and execute unauthorized `DELETE` operations.  This would likely be a bug in the InfluxDB code itself.

*   **Injection Attacks:**
    *   **InfluxQL Injection:**  If user-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being used in InfluxQL queries, an attacker might be able to inject malicious `DELETE` statements.  This is less likely with the `write` API endpoint, which uses a line protocol, but more relevant to the `query` endpoint.
    *   **Flux Injection (2.x):**  Similar to InfluxQL injection, but with the Flux query language in InfluxDB 2.x.

*   **Exploiting Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Known CVEs:**  Exploiting previously discovered and unpatched vulnerabilities in InfluxDB that allow for unauthorized write access or data deletion.
    *   **Zero-Day Exploits:**  Exploiting undiscovered vulnerabilities in InfluxDB.

*   **Misconfigured Client Libraries:**
    *   **Hardcoded Credentials:**  Storing InfluxDB credentials directly in application code, making them vulnerable to exposure if the code is compromised.
    *   **Lack of Input Validation:**  Client applications not properly validating user input before sending it to InfluxDB, potentially leading to injection attacks.

*   **Compromised Infrastructure:**
    *   **Server Compromise:**  If the server hosting InfluxDB is compromised, the attacker could gain direct access to the database and delete data.
    *   **Network Sniffing:**  If communication between the client and InfluxDB is not encrypted (using HTTPS), an attacker could intercept credentials or API tokens.

**2.2 Code and Configuration Analysis (Examples):**

*   **`httpd` Service (1.x and 2.x):**  The `httpd` service handles incoming HTTP requests.  The code responsible for parsing the request body (for the `/write` endpoint) and executing the corresponding database operations needs to be carefully reviewed for potential vulnerabilities.  Authorization checks are typically performed within the handlers for these endpoints.
*   **`tsdb` Package:**  This package manages the underlying time-series data storage.  The functions responsible for deleting data (e.g., deleting measurements, series, or points) need to be examined to ensure they are properly protected by authorization checks.
*   **`influxdb.conf` (1.x):**
    *   `[http]` section:  The `auth-enabled` setting controls whether authentication is required.  If set to `false`, anyone can write to the database.
    *   `[admin]` section: Defines the admin user and password.  Default credentials should be changed immediately after installation.
*   **Environment Variables/CLI Flags (2.x):**
    *   `INFLUXD_HTTP_AUTH_ENABLED`:  Controls authentication for the HTTP API.
    *   `INFLUXD_REPORTING_DISABLED`: Disables reporting, which can include security-relevant information.
    *   Token creation and management through the CLI or UI:  Ensuring tokens have the minimum necessary permissions.

**2.3 Penetration Testing Scenarios (Conceptual):**

1.  **Credential Brute-Forcing:**  Attempt to guess usernames and passwords, especially default credentials.
2.  **Token Enumeration (2.x):**  Attempt to guess or brute-force API tokens.
3.  **InfluxQL/Flux Injection:**  If a web application allows users to enter queries, try injecting `DELETE` statements.
4.  **API Endpoint Fuzzing:**  Send malformed requests to the `/write` and `/query` endpoints to see if they can trigger unexpected behavior or bypass authorization checks.
5.  **Retention Policy Manipulation:**  Attempt to modify retention policies to cause data to be deleted prematurely.
6.  **Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities:**  Test against known CVEs to see if the system is vulnerable.

**2.4 Refined Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Enforce Strong Authentication:**
    *   **Mandatory Authentication:**  Always enable authentication (`auth-enabled = true` in 1.x, `INFLUXD_HTTP_AUTH_ENABLED=true` in 2.x).
    *   **Strong Passwords/Tokens:**  Use strong, unique passwords and API tokens.  Enforce password complexity policies.
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Consider implementing MFA for administrative users, if supported by your InfluxDB setup or through an external identity provider.

*   **Implement Granular Authorization:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant users and applications only the minimum necessary permissions.  Create separate users/tokens for different applications and tasks.  Specifically, restrict the use of `DELETE` operations to only those users/applications that absolutely require it.
    *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  Use RBAC (available in InfluxDB Enterprise and potentially through custom implementations) to define roles with specific permissions and assign users to these roles.

*   **Secure Configuration:**
    *   **Disable Unused Features:**  Disable any features or services that are not needed to reduce the attack surface.
    *   **Regularly Review Configuration:**  Periodically review the InfluxDB configuration to ensure it remains secure.

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Parameterized Queries:**  Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent InfluxQL/Flux injection.
    *   **Input Validation:**  Validate all user-supplied input before using it in queries or API calls.

*   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Regularly scan for known vulnerabilities in InfluxDB and its dependencies.
    *   **Penetration Testing:**  Conduct periodic penetration testing to identify and address potential security weaknesses.

*   **Robust Backup and Recovery:**
    *   **Regular Backups:**  Implement a regular backup schedule.
    *   **Offsite Backups:**  Store backups in a separate location from the primary InfluxDB instance.
    *   **Tested Recovery Procedures:**  Regularly test the backup and recovery procedures to ensure they work as expected.

*   **Comprehensive Audit Logging:**
    *   **Enable Detailed Logging:**  Enable detailed audit logging to track all write operations, including deletions, and the associated user/application.
    *   **Log Monitoring:**  Monitor audit logs for suspicious activity.  Use a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system to aggregate and analyze logs.

*   **Network Security:**
    *   **HTTPS:**  Always use HTTPS to encrypt communication between clients and InfluxDB.
    *   **Firewall:**  Use a firewall to restrict access to the InfluxDB ports (default: 8086).
    *   **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate InfluxDB from other systems on the network to limit the impact of a potential compromise.

* **Stay Up-to-Date:**
    * Regularly update InfluxDB to the latest stable version to patch security vulnerabilities.
