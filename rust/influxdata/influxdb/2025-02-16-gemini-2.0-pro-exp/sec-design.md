Okay, let's create a design document for the InfluxDB project, focusing on aspects relevant for threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

InfluxDB is a time series database designed to handle high write and query loads. It is a core component of the InfluxData platform, used for monitoring, application metrics, IoT sensor data, and real-time analytics.

Business Priorities:

*   Reliability: InfluxDB must be highly available and resilient to failures, as it's often used in mission-critical monitoring and alerting systems. Downtime can directly impact business operations.
*   Performance: The database needs to handle massive amounts of time-series data with high ingest and query speeds. Performance bottlenecks can lead to delayed insights and impact decision-making.
*   Scalability: InfluxDB should scale horizontally to accommodate growing data volumes and user demands without significant performance degradation.
*   Usability: Ease of use for developers and operators is crucial for adoption and efficient operation. This includes simple installation, configuration, and query language.
*   Data Integrity: Ensuring the accuracy and consistency of stored data is paramount. Data loss or corruption can lead to incorrect analysis and flawed business decisions.

Business Risks:

*   Data Loss/Corruption: Loss of critical monitoring or operational data due to software bugs, hardware failures, or malicious attacks.
*   System Downtime: Unavailability of the database, preventing access to real-time data and disrupting monitoring/alerting pipelines.
*   Performance Degradation: Slow query responses or ingest rates, hindering real-time analysis and decision-making.
*   Unauthorized Access: Exposure of sensitive time-series data to unauthorized users or external attackers.
*   Data Breaches: Exfiltration of sensitive data due to vulnerabilities in the database or related components.
*   Compliance Violations: Failure to meet regulatory requirements related to data privacy and security (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Authentication: InfluxDB supports user authentication with username/password and JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication. (Described in InfluxDB documentation and API endpoints).
*   security control: Authorization: Role-based access control (RBAC) is implemented to manage user permissions and restrict access to specific resources. (Described in InfluxDB documentation and API endpoints).
*   security control: TLS/SSL Encryption: InfluxDB can be configured to use TLS/SSL for encrypting communication between clients and the server, as well as between nodes in a cluster. (Described in InfluxDB configuration options).
*   security control: API Security: The InfluxDB API uses token-based authentication to secure endpoints. (Described in InfluxDB API documentation).
*   security control: Input Validation: InfluxDB performs input validation on data and queries to prevent injection attacks and other data-related vulnerabilities. (Implemented in the query parser and data ingestion pipeline).
*   security control: Auditing: InfluxDB provides some level of auditing, logging requests and actions performed by users. (Described in InfluxDB documentation).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Limited protection against sophisticated DDoS attacks: While InfluxDB has some basic rate limiting, it may be vulnerable to large-scale distributed denial-of-service attacks. Mitigation may require external solutions like cloud-based DDoS protection services.
*   accepted risk: Complexity of securing a distributed cluster: Properly securing a multi-node InfluxDB cluster requires careful configuration and management of network security, authentication, and authorization across all nodes.
*   accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies: Like any software, InfluxDB relies on third-party libraries, which may contain vulnerabilities that could be exploited.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Enhanced Auditing: Implement more comprehensive audit logging, including detailed information about data modifications, configuration changes, and user login/logout events.
*   security control: Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (IDS/IPS): Deploy an IDS/IPS to monitor network traffic and detect/prevent malicious activity targeting the InfluxDB server.
*   security control: Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing: Conduct periodic security assessments and penetration tests to identify and address vulnerabilities proactively.
*   security control: Web Application Firewall (WAF): If exposing InfluxDB API directly to the internet, use a WAF to protect against common web attacks.
*   security control: Secrets Management: Integrate with a secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) to securely store and manage sensitive credentials, API keys, and TLS certificates.
*   security control: Data at Rest Encryption: Implement encryption for data stored on disk to protect against unauthorized access in case of physical theft or server compromise.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Support for strong password policies (length, complexity, expiration).
    *   Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.
    *   Integration with existing identity providers (e.g., LDAP, Active Directory, OAuth 2.0).
*   Authorization:
    *   Fine-grained access control to restrict user permissions at the database, measurement, and field levels.
    *   Ability to define custom roles with specific privileges.
    *   Regular review and auditing of user permissions.
*   Input Validation:
    *   Strict validation of all user inputs, including queries, data points, and configuration parameters.
    *   Protection against SQL injection, NoSQL injection, and other injection attacks.
    *   Sanitization of data to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in web interfaces.
*   Cryptography:
    *   Use of strong, industry-standard encryption algorithms for TLS/SSL (e.g., AES-256, TLS 1.3).
    *   Proper key management practices, including secure storage and rotation of encryption keys.
    *   Hashing of passwords using strong, salted hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).
    *   Data at rest encryption using industry standard algorithms.

```mermaid
graph LR
    developer[("Developer")] --> github[("GitHub Repository")]
    github --> github_actions[("GitHub Actions")]
    github_actions --> build_server[("Build Server")]
    build_server --> build_artifacts[("Build Artifacts (Binaries, Packages)")]
    build_server --> docker_registry[("Docker Registry")]
    build_artifacts --> deployment[("Deployment")]

    subgraph GitHub Actions
        lint[("Linting")]
        unit_tests[("Unit Tests")]
        integration_tests[("Integration Tests")]
        sast[("SAST (Static Analysis)")]
        build[("Build")]

        lint --> build
        unit_tests --> build
        integration_tests --> build
        sast --> build
    end

    classDef box fill:#fff,stroke:#000,stroke-width:2px;
    class developer,github,github_actions,build_server,build_artifacts,docker_registry,deployment,lint,unit_tests,integration_tests,sast,build box
```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developer commits code to the GitHub repository.
2.  GitHub Actions triggers a workflow on code push or pull request.
3.  The workflow runs on a build server.
4.  Linting (using tools like `golangci-lint`) is performed to check code style and identify potential issues.
5.  Unit tests are executed to verify the correctness of individual components.
6.  Integration tests are run to test the interaction between different parts of the system.
7.  Static analysis security testing (SAST) is performed using tools like `gosec` to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code.
8.  The code is built using Go build tools, creating binaries and packages.
9.  Docker images are built and pushed to a Docker registry.
10. Build artifacts are made available for deployment.

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   security control: Linting: Enforces code style and helps prevent common coding errors.
*   security control: Unit and Integration Tests: Verify the correctness of the code and help prevent regressions.
*   security control: SAST: Identifies potential security vulnerabilities in the code before deployment.
*   security control: Dependency Management: Go modules are used to manage dependencies, and tools like `dependabot` can be used to automatically update dependencies and address known vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Build Automation: GitHub Actions provides a consistent and reproducible build process.
*   security control: Artifact Signing: (Recommended) Build artifacts (binaries and Docker images) should be digitally signed to ensure their integrity and authenticity.
*   security control: Software Composition Analysis (SCA): (Recommended) Use SCA tools to identify and manage vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
