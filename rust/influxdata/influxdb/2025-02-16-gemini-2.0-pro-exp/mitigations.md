# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for influxdata/influxdb

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Strong Authentication (Within InfluxDB)](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_strong_authentication__within_influxdb_.md)

**Description:**
    1.  **Enable Authentication:** In the InfluxDB configuration file (`influxdb.conf` or environment variables), set `auth-enabled = true`. Restart InfluxDB.
    2.  **Create Admin User:** Immediately after enabling, create an admin user with a *strong*, unique password via the `influx` CLI or HTTP API:
        ```bash
        influx
        CREATE USER admin WITH PASSWORD 'your-very-strong-password' WITH ALL PRIVILEGES
        ```
    3.  **Create Non-Admin Users:** Create additional users with specific roles and permissions.
    4.  **Password Management (Limited within InfluxDB):** InfluxDB itself has *limited* built-in password policy features. You can set passwords, but complex policies (length, complexity, rotation, lockout) are typically handled *externally* (at the application or network layer).  Focus on strong, unique passwords within InfluxDB.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access (Severity: Critical):** Prevents access without valid credentials.
    *   **Unauthorized Data Modification (Severity: Critical):** Prevents unauthorized changes.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Severity: High):** Reduces risk of gaining admin privileges.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (Severity: High):** Strong passwords make these harder.
    *   **Credential Stuffing (Severity: High):** Unique passwords prevent reuse of stolen credentials.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access/Modification:** Risk reduced from *Critical* to *Low* (with strong passwords and RBAC).
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduced from *High* to *Low*.
    *   **Brute-Force/Credential Stuffing:** Risk reduced from *High* to *Low*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Authentication enabled in `influxdb.conf`.
    *   Admin user with a strong password created.
    *   Basic user accounts for read/write access created.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No direct InfluxDB configuration for advanced password policies (handled externally).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Fine-Grained Authorization (RBAC within InfluxDB)](./mitigation_strategies/fine-grained_authorization__rbac_within_influxdb_.md)

**Description:**
    1.  **Identify Roles:** Define roles based on needed access (e.g., "read-only-sensor-data").
    2.  **InfluxDB 2.x (Buckets & Tokens):** Create separate buckets for data categories. Generate tokens with specific read/write permissions for those buckets. This is the *primary* authorization mechanism in 2.x.
    3.  **InfluxDB 1.x (GRANT/REVOKE):** Use `CREATE USER` and `GRANT` commands:
        ```sql
        GRANT READ ON "mydb" TO "readonlyuser"
        GRANT WRITE ON "mydb" TO "writeonlyuser"
        ```
    4.  **Assign Roles:** Assign appropriate roles/tokens to users.
    5.  **Regular Review:** Periodically review roles and permissions within InfluxDB.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access (Severity: Critical):** Limits access to authorized data.
    *   **Unauthorized Data Modification (Severity: Critical):** Prevents unauthorized changes.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Severity: High):** Makes escalation harder.
    *   **Data Breaches (Severity: High):** Reduces the scope of potential breaches.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access/Modification:** Risk reduced from *Critical* to *Low*.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduced from *High* to *Medium*.
    *   **Data Breaches:** Breach impact significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic roles (read-only, write-only) implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Granular roles for different data types/measurements are not defined.
    *   Regular, documented review of roles is not performed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Query Timeouts (InfluxDB Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/query_timeouts__influxdb_configuration_.md)

**Description:**
    1.  **Configure Timeouts:** In the `influxdb.conf` file, set appropriate query timeouts.  Relevant settings (may vary slightly by version):
        *   `query-timeout`:  Sets a maximum duration for a query to run.  Example: `query-timeout = "30s"` (30 seconds).
        *   `log-queries-after`: Logs queries that take longer than a specified duration.  Example: `log-queries-after = "10s"`.  This helps identify slow queries.
    2.  **Restart InfluxDB:** Restart the service for changes to take effect.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: Medium):** Prevents long-running queries from consuming excessive resources.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Severity: Medium):**  Limits resource consumption by runaway queries.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS/Resource Exhaustion:** Risk reduced from *Medium* to *Low*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   A default `query-timeout` is set in the configuration.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   The `log-queries-after` setting is not configured, making it harder to identify slow queries proactively.
    *   The timeout value may not be optimal and should be reviewed based on typical query patterns.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limits (InfluxDB Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limits__influxdb_configuration_.md)

**Description:**
    1.  **Configure Limits:** In `influxdb.conf`, set limits on resources InfluxDB can use.  Key settings:
        *   `max-concurrent-queries`: Limits the number of queries running simultaneously.
        *   `max-select-point`: Limits number of points.
        *   `max-select-series`: Limits number of series.
        *   `max-select-buckets`: Limits number of buckets.
    2.  **Restart InfluxDB:** Restart for changes to take effect.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: High):** Prevents resource exhaustion.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Severity: Medium):** Limits overall resource consumption.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS/Resource Exhaustion:** Risk reduced from *High/Medium* to *Low*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Some default limits are set.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Limits are not comprehensively tuned based on the specific hardware and expected workload.  They should be reviewed and adjusted.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Encryption in Transit (HTTPS within InfluxDB)](./mitigation_strategies/encryption_in_transit__https_within_influxdb_.md)

**Description:**
    1.  **Obtain TLS Certificate:** Get a valid certificate (e.g., Let's Encrypt).
    2.  **Configure InfluxDB:** In `influxdb.conf`:
        *   `https-enabled = true`
        *   `https-certificate = "/path/to/certificate.pem"`
        *   `https-private-key = "/path/to/private-key.pem"`
    3.  **Restart InfluxDB.**
    4. **Enforce HTTPS (Ideally done externally, but mentioned for completeness):** While best practice is to enforce this at a reverse proxy, InfluxDB *can* be configured to only listen on the HTTPS port.  This is less robust than a reverse proxy solution.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (Severity: High):** Prevents interception/modification of data.
    *   **Eavesdropping (Severity: High):** Prevents data theft in transit.
    *   **Data Breaches (Severity: High):** Reduces breach risk.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **MitM/Eavesdropping/Data Breaches:** Risk reduced from *High* to *Low*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   InfluxDB configured for HTTPS with a Let's Encrypt certificate.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Strict HTTPS enforcement is handled by the external Nginx proxy, not within InfluxDB's configuration itself.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable Detailed Logging (InfluxDB Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/enable_detailed_logging__influxdb_configuration_.md)

**Description:**
    1.  **Configure Logging:** In `influxdb.conf`, adjust logging settings:
        *   `log-level`: Set to `debug` or `info` for more detailed logs.  `warn` or `error` are less verbose.
        *   Ensure logs are written to a persistent location.
    2.  **Restart InfluxDB.**

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Undetected Intrusions (Severity: High):**  Provides data for investigation.
    *   **Insider Threats (Severity: Medium):**  Can help identify malicious actions.
    *   **Data Breaches (Severity: High):**  Aids in post-breach analysis.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Improves detection and investigation capabilities.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic logging is enabled.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `log-level` is not set to a sufficiently detailed level (`debug` or `info`). Log analysis is handled externally.
