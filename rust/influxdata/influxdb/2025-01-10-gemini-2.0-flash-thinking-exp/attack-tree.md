## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication/Authorization Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authenticationauthorization_weaknesses.md)

**Brute-force InfluxDB Credentials [CRITICAL NODE]:** Trying numerous username/password combinations to gain access.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on password complexity and if default credentials were changed)
    * **Impact:** High (Full access to InfluxDB data)
    * **Effort:** Low (Automated tools available)
    * **Skill Level:** Low
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Multiple failed login attempts can be logged, but might be missed)
* **Exploit Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities (if any exist) [CRITICAL NODE]:** Leveraging flaws in the authentication logic to gain unauthorized access without valid credentials.
    * **Likelihood:** Low (Requires specific vulnerabilities in InfluxDB)
    * **Impact:** High (Full access to InfluxDB data)
    * **Effort:** Medium to High (Requires research and potentially exploit development)
    * **Skill Level:** Medium to High
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Low (Exploits might leave unusual traces)
* **Leverage Stored Credentials within Application [CRITICAL NODE]:** If the application stores InfluxDB credentials insecurely, an attacker compromising the application might gain access to InfluxDB.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium (Common mistake in development)
    * **Impact:** High (Full access to InfluxDB data)
    * **Effort:** Low to Medium (Depends on where and how credentials are stored)
    * **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Low (Difficult to detect without code review or application compromise)

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Data Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_data_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

* **InfluxQL Injection [CRITICAL NODE]:** Injecting malicious InfluxQL code through data points or tags/fields. This could potentially lead to data manipulation, deletion, or even command execution on the InfluxDB server (depending on the application's query patterns and how it handles the data).
    * **Malicious Data Points:**
        * **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on input validation on write paths)
        * **Impact:** Medium to High (Data corruption, potential application logic compromise)
        * **Effort:** Low to Medium (Crafting malicious data points)
        * **Skill Level:** Medium
        * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires monitoring data patterns and anomalies)

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Querying Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_querying_vulnerabilities.md)

* **InfluxQL Injection via Application Input [CRITICAL NODE]:** If the application constructs InfluxQL queries dynamically based on user input without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious code.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium (Common vulnerability if user input is directly used in queries)
    * **Impact:** High (Data exfiltration, manipulation, potential application compromise)
    * **Effort:** Low to Medium (Crafting malicious queries)
    * **Skill Level:** Medium
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires monitoring query patterns and anomalies)

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_weaknesses.md)

* **Insecure Network Configuration [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Exposing InfluxDB Ports Directly to the Internet:**
        * **Likelihood:** Medium (Common misconfiguration)
        * **Impact:** High (Increased attack surface for all other attacks)
        * **Effort:** None (Exploiting an existing misconfiguration)
        * **Skill Level:** Low
        * **Detection Difficulty:** Low (Port scans will reveal open ports)
* **Insecure User Permissions [CRITICAL NODE]:** Granting excessive permissions allows attackers to perform actions beyond their intended scope.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium (Overly permissive configurations are common)
    * **Impact:** Medium to High (Allows attackers with limited access to perform more actions)
    * **Effort:** None (Exploiting an existing misconfiguration if initial access is gained)
    * **Skill Level: Low (Once initial access is gained)
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires auditing user permissions and activity)
* **Default Configuration Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE]:** Using default credentials or settings makes the system easier to compromise.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium (If default settings are not changed)
    * **Impact:** Medium to High (Easier to gain initial access or exploit known default vulnerabilities)
    * **Effort:** Low
    * **Skill Level:** Low
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Low (Common attack vector, tools exist to check for default configurations)
