# Threat Model Analysis for influxdata/influxdb

## Threat: [InfluxQL Injection](./threats/influxql_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** InfluxQL Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious InfluxQL queries by injecting code into user-supplied input that is not properly sanitized before being used in database queries. This allows them to execute arbitrary InfluxQL commands within InfluxDB.
    *   **Impact:** Can lead to data breaches (reading sensitive data stored within InfluxDB), data manipulation (inserting, updating, or deleting data), or even denial of service by executing resource-intensive queries directly on the database.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   InfluxQL query parser
        *   InfluxQL query execution engine
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never** directly concatenate user input into InfluxQL queries.
        *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements if InfluxDB supports them (check current version capabilities).
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all user-provided data that might be used in queries.
        *   Apply the principle of least privilege to database user accounts accessing InfluxDB.

## Threat: [Weak Authentication](./threats/weak_authentication.md)

*   **Threat:** Weak Authentication
    *   **Description:** InfluxDB is configured with default or weak credentials, making it easy for attackers to gain unauthorized access directly to the InfluxDB instance. This could involve brute-forcing passwords or exploiting well-known default credentials.
    *   **Impact:**  Full access to the InfluxDB instance, allowing attackers to read, write, and delete data, potentially disrupting the entire application and compromising sensitive information stored within InfluxDB.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   Authentication module
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Immediately** change default credentials upon installation.
        *   Enforce strong password policies for InfluxDB users.
        *   Consider using more robust authentication methods if supported by your InfluxDB version (e.g., token-based authentication).

## Threat: [Credential Exposure](./threats/credential_exposure.md)

*   **Threat:** Credential Exposure
    *   **Description:** InfluxDB credentials (usernames, passwords, API keys) are stored insecurely, making them vulnerable if the storage location is compromised. This directly impacts the security of the InfluxDB instance itself.
    *   **Impact:**  Allows attackers who gain access to these credentials to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access directly to InfluxDB, leading to data breaches, manipulation, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   InfluxDB configuration files
        *   User management system
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never** hardcode credentials in application code.
        *   Store credentials securely using environment variables, secrets management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager), or encrypted configuration files specifically for InfluxDB.
        *   Restrict access to InfluxDB configuration files and secrets.

## Threat: [Insecure Communication (Man-in-the-Middle)](./threats/insecure_communication__man-in-the-middle_.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Communication (Man-in-the-Middle)
    *   **Description:** Communication between clients (including the application) and the InfluxDB server is not encrypted (e.g., using HTTP instead of HTTPS), allowing attackers to intercept and potentially modify data being exchanged with the InfluxDB instance.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data being transmitted to and from InfluxDB, including credentials used for authentication and the time-series data itself. Attackers could also potentially inject malicious data.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   Network communication layer of the InfluxDB server
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always** configure and enforce TLS/HTTPS for all communication with the InfluxDB server.
        *   Ensure that TLS certificates are valid and properly configured on the InfluxDB server.

## Threat: [Vulnerable InfluxDB Version](./threats/vulnerable_influxdb_version.md)

*   **Threat:** Vulnerable InfluxDB Version
    *   **Description:** Using an outdated version of InfluxDB with known security vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers to directly compromise the InfluxDB instance.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure to various security flaws within InfluxDB that could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code on the server, or cause denial of service of the database.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   All components of InfluxDB
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regularly update** InfluxDB to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Subscribe to InfluxDB security advisories to stay informed about new vulnerabilities and necessary updates.
