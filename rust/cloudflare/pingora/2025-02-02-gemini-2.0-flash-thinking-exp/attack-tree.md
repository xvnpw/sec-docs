## Attack Tree Path: [Attack Goal: Compromise Application via Pingora Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/attack_goal_compromise_application_via_pingora_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the overarching goal of the attacker. Success at any of the sub-paths leads to achieving this goal. It is critical because it represents the ultimate security objective to defend against.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Request Handling Vulnerabilities in Pingora [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_request_handling_vulnerabilities_in_pingora__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:**  This critical node represents attacks targeting how Pingora processes incoming HTTP requests. Vulnerabilities here can bypass security controls and directly impact the application. It's a high-risk path because request handling is a core function and often complex.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP Request Smuggling/Desync [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Description:** Exploits discrepancies in how Pingora and backend servers parse HTTP requests, allowing an attacker to "smuggle" requests past Pingora's security checks or desynchronize the request/response flow.
        *   **Impact:** Bypassing security controls, request routing manipulation, cache poisoning, potentially leading to unauthorized access or data manipulation on the backend.
        *   **Mitigation:** Rigorous testing of HTTP parsing logic, ensuring consistent parsing between Pingora and backends, strict HTTP validation, careful connection management.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Request Flooding through Pingora [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Description:** Overwhelming Pingora with a flood of requests to exhaust its resources (CPU, memory, connections), making the application unavailable to legitimate users.
        *   **Impact:** Service disruption, application unavailability.
        *   **Mitigation:** Rate limiting, connection limits, resource monitoring, robust error handling, potentially implementing request prioritization or queueing.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Backend Communication Vulnerabilities via Pingora [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_backend_communication_vulnerabilities_via_pingora__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** This critical node focuses on vulnerabilities in how Pingora communicates with backend servers. Compromising this communication can lead to backend system access and data breaches. It's a high-risk path because backend communication is often a trusted zone, and breaches here can be severe.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Backend Authentication/Authorization Bypass [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Description:** Exploiting weak or misconfigured authentication mechanisms between Pingora and backend servers, or flaws in Pingora's authorization logic, allowing unauthorized access to backend resources.
        *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to backend systems and data, data breaches, potential for further compromise of backend infrastructure.
        *   **Mitigation:** Strong authentication mechanisms (mutual TLS, API keys), robust authorization policies in Pingora, principle of least privilege, regular credential rotation, security audits of authentication and authorization configurations.
    *   **Intercept or manipulate backend traffic [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Description:** If backend communication is not properly secured (e.g., using HTTP instead of HTTPS), attackers can intercept and potentially manipulate traffic between Pingora and backend servers.
        *   **Impact:** Data interception, data manipulation, potential for injecting malicious content into backend responses, compromising data integrity and confidentiality.
        *   **Mitigation:** Enforce HTTPS for all communication between Pingora and backend servers, consider mutual TLS for enhanced security, network segmentation to limit exposure of backend traffic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Pingora Configuration/Management Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_pingora_configurationmanagement_vulnerabilities__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** This critical node highlights the risks associated with misconfiguring Pingora itself. Incorrect configurations can directly introduce vulnerabilities. It's a high-risk path because configuration errors are common and can have wide-ranging security implications.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Misconfiguration of Pingora [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Description:** Incorrectly configured Pingora settings, such as overly permissive access controls, insecure defaults, or improper routing rules, leading to security weaknesses.
        *   **Impact:** Unintended exposure of backend resources, bypassing security controls, potential for unauthorized access or DoS.
        *   **Mitigation:** Follow security best practices for Pingora configuration, use secure defaults, implement configuration validation and auditing, version control configurations, regular security reviews of Pingora configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies of Pingora [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies_of_pingora__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** This critical node addresses the risk of vulnerabilities in third-party libraries that Pingora depends on. Exploiting these dependencies can compromise Pingora itself and the application. It's a high-risk path because dependency vulnerabilities are common and can be exploited indirectly.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Identify vulnerable dependencies used by Pingora [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Description:** Attackers identify known vulnerabilities in the third-party libraries used by Pingora.
        *   **Impact:** Exploiting dependency vulnerabilities can lead to various impacts, including code execution, DoS, or information disclosure, potentially compromising Pingora and the application.
        *   **Mitigation:** Maintain an up-to-date Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for Pingora's dependencies, regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using vulnerability scanners, promptly patch or update vulnerable dependencies, implement automated dependency update processes.
