# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, Pingora, is a library for building fast, reliable and programmable proxies. For Cloudflare, the business priority is to maintain and improve its global network performance, reliability, and security. Pingora directly contributes to this by providing a foundation for building high-performance proxy services that are critical to Cloudflare's CDN, security, and other network services.

The primary business goal is to enhance Cloudflare's infrastructure capabilities, enabling them to handle increasing network traffic, offer new features, and maintain a competitive edge in performance and service delivery.

Most important business risks that need to be addressed:
- Performance degradation of Cloudflare services due to inefficient proxy implementation.
- Reliability issues in proxy infrastructure leading to service disruptions and outages.
- Security vulnerabilities in the proxy code that could be exploited to compromise Cloudflare's network or customer data.
- Operational complexity in managing and deploying proxies at scale across Cloudflare's global network.
- Slow development and feature delivery due to limitations of existing proxy solutions.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Cloudflare employs a Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) that is likely applied to Pingora's development. This includes code reviews, static and dynamic analysis, and security testing. (Location: Cloudflare's general security practices, assumed to be in place for core infrastructure projects)
- security control: Cloudflare has a dedicated security team that reviews and approves significant architectural and code changes. (Location: Cloudflare's internal security processes, assumed to be in place for core infrastructure projects)
- security control: Cloudflare uses automated testing and CI/CD pipelines, which likely include security checks. (Location: Cloudflare's general engineering practices, assumed to be in place for core infrastructure projects)
- security control: Cloudflare has incident response procedures in place to handle security incidents. (Location: Cloudflare's general security practices, assumed to be in place for core infrastructure projects)

Accepted risks:
- accepted risk: Potential for zero-day vulnerabilities in dependencies used by Pingora. Mitigation is through timely patching and vulnerability monitoring.
- accepted risk: Risk of misconfiguration during deployment of Pingora-based proxies. Mitigation is through automation, configuration management, and testing.
- accepted risk: Performance overhead of certain security features might need to be balanced against overall proxy performance.

Recommended security controls:
- security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) as part of the CI/CD pipeline specifically for Pingora.
- security control: Conduct regular penetration testing and security audits of Pingora-based proxy deployments.
- security control: Implement robust logging and monitoring of security-relevant events within Pingora proxies.
- security control: Establish a clear process for security vulnerability reporting and remediation for Pingora.
- security control: Provide security training for developers working on Pingora and related proxy services, focusing on secure coding practices for high-performance network applications.

Security requirements:
- Authentication:
  - Requirement: Authentication is required for administrative access to manage and configure Pingora-based proxies.
  - Requirement: Authentication mechanisms should be strong and multi-factor authentication should be considered for privileged access.
- Authorization:
  - Requirement: Authorization mechanisms must be in place to control access to administrative functions and resources within Pingora-based proxies.
  - Requirement: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) should be implemented to manage permissions based on user roles.
- Input Validation:
  - Requirement: All external inputs to Pingora-based proxies, including network traffic and configuration data, must be thoroughly validated to prevent injection attacks and other input-related vulnerabilities.
  - Requirement: Input validation should be performed at multiple layers, including protocol parsing, data deserialization, and application logic.
- Cryptography:
  - Requirement: Cryptography must be used to protect sensitive data in transit and at rest.
  - Requirement: Pingora-based proxies should support TLS for secure communication with clients and upstream servers.
  - Requirement: Secure key management practices must be implemented for cryptographic keys used by Pingora-based proxies.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes we are trying to protect:
- Core Cloudflare services that rely on proxies, including CDN, DDoS mitigation, WAF, and other network services.
- Availability and performance of Cloudflare's global network.
- Reputation and customer trust in Cloudflare's services.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- Proxied network traffic: Sensitivity varies depending on the type of traffic. Could include sensitive user data, API keys, authentication tokens, etc. Requires confidentiality and integrity.
- Configuration data: Contains sensitive information about proxy behavior, routing rules, security policies, and potentially credentials. Requires confidentiality and integrity.
- Logs and metrics: May contain information about user activity, system performance, and security events. Sensitivity depends on the level of detail and potential for re-identification. Requires integrity and potentially confidentiality.
