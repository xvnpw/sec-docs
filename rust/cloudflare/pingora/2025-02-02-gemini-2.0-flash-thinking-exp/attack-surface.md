# Attack Surface Analysis for cloudflare/pingora

## Attack Surface: [1. HTTP Header Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/1__http_header_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Weaknesses in how Pingora parses HTTP headers, potentially leading to buffer overflows, DoS, or unexpected behavior.
*   **Pingora Contribution:** Pingora is responsible for parsing all incoming HTTP headers to route requests and apply security policies. Any flaw in its parsing logic becomes a direct attack surface.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a request with an extremely long header name exceeding buffer limits in Pingora's header parsing code, causing a buffer overflow and potentially crashing the proxy.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service, potential memory corruption, bypassing security checks.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Pingora updated to the latest version, ensuring bug fixes and security patches are applied.
    *   Configure request size limits to prevent excessively large headers from being processed.
    *   Utilize Web Application Firewall (WAF) in front of Pingora to filter out malicious requests before they reach the proxy.

## Attack Surface: [2. TLS Configuration Weaknesses](./attack_surfaces/2__tls_configuration_weaknesses.md)

*   **Description:** Misconfigurations in Pingora's TLS settings, such as weak ciphers, outdated TLS versions, or incorrect certificate validation, weakening connection security.
*   **Pingora Contribution:** Pingora handles TLS termination, making its TLS configuration critical for secure communication.  Incorrect configuration directly exposes vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** Pingora is configured to allow outdated TLS 1.0 and weak ciphers. An attacker performs a downgrade attack, forcing the connection to use TLS 1.0 and a weak cipher, then intercepts and decrypts the traffic.
*   **Impact:** Compromised confidentiality and integrity of communication, man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce strong TLS versions (TLS 1.2 or higher).
    *   Use strong cipher suites and disable weak or insecure ciphers.
    *   Implement proper certificate validation, ensuring certificates are correctly verified against trusted Certificate Authorities.
    *   Regularly review and update TLS configurations based on security best practices.

## Attack Surface: [3. Routing Misconfigurations](./attack_surfaces/3__routing_misconfigurations.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrectly configured routing rules in Pingora leading to unintended exposure of backend services, routing loops, or access to restricted resources.
*   **Pingora Contribution:** Pingora's core function is routing requests based on configuration. Misconfiguration in Pingora's routing rules directly creates vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** A routing rule is accidentally configured to forward requests for `/admin` path to a public-facing backend instead of an internal admin panel, exposing sensitive administrative functionalities.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive backend services, unauthorized access to resources, Denial of Service through routing loops.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement thorough testing of routing configurations before deployment.
    *   Use a version control system for routing configurations to track changes and enable rollback.
    *   Employ the principle of least privilege when defining routing rules, only allowing necessary access.
    *   Regularly audit routing configurations to identify and correct any misconfigurations.

## Attack Surface: [4. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) Potential in Routing Logic](./attack_surfaces/4__server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__potential_in_routing_logic.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerability where Pingora can be manipulated to make requests to internal or external resources on behalf of the attacker due to unsanitized user-controlled input in routing decisions.
*   **Pingora Contribution:** If Pingora's routing logic uses user-provided data (e.g., from headers or parameters) to determine backend destinations without proper validation, it becomes vulnerable to SSRF attacks.
*   **Example:** A routing rule uses a header value to dynamically determine the backend server. An attacker injects a malicious internal IP address or hostname into this header, causing Pingora to make a request to an internal service that should not be publicly accessible.
*   **Impact:** Server-Side Request Forgery, allowing attackers to scan internal networks, access internal services, or potentially perform actions on behalf of the Pingora server.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid using user-controlled input directly in routing decisions if possible.
    *   If user input is necessary for routing, strictly validate and sanitize it to prevent injection of malicious URLs or hostnames.
    *   Implement network segmentation to limit the impact of SSRF by restricting Pingora's access to internal networks.

## Attack Surface: [5. Vulnerabilities in TLS Libraries](./attack_surfaces/5__vulnerabilities_in_tls_libraries.md)

*   **Description:** Pingora relies on underlying TLS libraries (like OpenSSL or BoringSSL). Critical vulnerabilities in these libraries directly and severely impact Pingora's security.
*   **Pingora Contribution:** Pingora uses TLS libraries for secure communication. Any critical vulnerability in these libraries directly translates to a critical vulnerability in Pingora's TLS functionality.
*   **Example:** A critical vulnerability is discovered in OpenSSL, the TLS library used by Pingora, allowing for remote code execution. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to gain full control of Pingora servers.
*   **Impact:** Wide range of severe impacts depending on the specific TLS library vulnerability, including information disclosure, remote code execution, or complete system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Immediately** keep Pingora and its underlying TLS libraries updated to the latest versions, applying security patches with the highest priority.
    *   Proactively monitor security advisories for the TLS library used by Pingora and have a rapid patching process in place.
    *   Consider using automated vulnerability scanning tools to continuously monitor for outdated libraries.
