# Attack Surface Analysis for cloudflare/pingora

## Attack Surface: [1. Upstream Misconfiguration](./attack_surfaces/1__upstream_misconfiguration.md)

*   *Description:* Incorrect configuration of upstream servers (the servers Pingora proxies to) can lead to various vulnerabilities.  This is *the* primary attack surface specific to a reverse proxy.
    *   *How Pingora Contributes:* Pingora's core function is to route traffic to upstreams based on configuration.  This configuration is the direct attack point.  Pingora's flexibility in defining upstreams *increases* the potential for misconfiguration.
    *   *Example:* An administrator configures a `proxy_pass` rule that uses a user-supplied query parameter (`?host=`) to determine the upstream host, without any validation. An attacker provides `?host=internal.database.server`, gaining access to an internal database.
    *   *Impact:*        *   Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) - **Critical**        *   Open Redirects - **Critical**        *   Denial of Service (DoS) - **High**        *   Information Disclosure - **High**    *   *Risk Severity:* **Critical** (SSRF, Open Redirects), **High** (DoS, Information Disclosure)
    *   *Mitigation Strategies:*        *   **Strict Input Validation:**  *Never* trust user input to determine upstream targets.  Use allow-lists (whitelists) of permitted upstream hosts and paths.  Validate *all* inputs that influence routing.        *   **Hardcoded Upstreams (where feasible):** If the set of upstreams is static, hardcode them in the configuration.  Avoid dynamic upstream selection based on user input.        *   **Configuration Management & Validation:** Use a robust configuration management system with strict validation checks *before* deployment.  Version control and audit configurations.        *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate Pingora and upstream servers in separate network segments to limit the blast radius of a successful attack.  Use a DMZ for Pingora.

## Attack Surface: [2. Custom Filter Vulnerabilities (Rust Code)](./attack_surfaces/2__custom_filter_vulnerabilities__rust_code_.md)

*   *Description:* Bugs or security flaws in custom Rust code implemented as Pingora filters, particularly involving `unsafe` blocks or external crate dependencies.
    *   *How Pingora Contributes:* Pingora's extensibility through custom Rust filters *directly* introduces a code execution attack surface.  The filter runs within the Pingora process.
    *   *Example:* A filter designed to add a custom header contains a buffer overflow in its `unsafe` Rust code when handling a very long header value.  An attacker sends a crafted request with an extremely long header to trigger the overflow and execute arbitrary code.
    *   *Impact:*        *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) - **Critical**        *   Authentication/Authorization Bypass - **High**        *   Data Modification/Corruption - **High**    *   *Risk Severity:* **Critical** (RCE), **High** (Auth Bypass, Data Modification)
    *   *Mitigation Strategies:*        *   **Minimize `unsafe` Rust:**  Avoid `unsafe` code whenever possible.  If `unsafe` is *absolutely necessary*, heavily scrutinize and justify it.  Use safe abstractions where available.        *   **Rigorous Code Review:**  Mandatory, thorough code reviews of *all* custom filter code, with a specific focus on security vulnerabilities.        *   **Static Analysis:**  Use static analysis tools (Clippy, `cargo audit`, etc.) to automatically detect potential vulnerabilities.        *   **Fuzzing:**  Employ fuzzing techniques to test filters with a wide range of inputs, including malformed and unexpected data, to uncover edge cases and vulnerabilities.        *   **Dependency Auditing:** Regularly audit dependencies (crates) used by filters for known vulnerabilities.  Use `cargo audit` or similar tools.        *   **Resource Limits:** Enforce resource limits (CPU, memory) on filters to mitigate DoS risks from buggy or malicious filters.

## Attack Surface: [3. Dependency Vulnerabilities (Pingora's Crates)](./attack_surfaces/3__dependency_vulnerabilities__pingora's_crates_.md)

*   *Description:* Vulnerabilities in third-party Rust crates used *directly* by the Pingora library itself.
    *   *How Pingora Contributes:* Pingora, as a software project, has its own dependencies. Vulnerabilities in *these* dependencies directly impact Pingora's security. This is distinct from vulnerabilities in crates used by *custom filters*.
    *   *Example:* A crate used by Pingora for TLS handling has a known vulnerability that allows for remote code execution. An attacker exploits this vulnerability to gain control of the Pingora process, *regardless* of any custom filters.
    *   *Impact:*        *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) - **Critical**        *   Denial of Service (DoS) - **High**        *   Information Disclosure - **High**    *   *Risk Severity:* **Critical** (RCE), **High** (DoS, Information Disclosure)
    *   *Mitigation Strategies:*        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Pingora itself updated to the latest released version.  The Pingora maintainers will address vulnerabilities in its dependencies.        *   **Dependency Scanning (of Pingora):** While primarily the responsibility of the Pingora maintainers, users *can* use tools like `cargo audit` on the Pingora source code (if available) to identify potential issues *before* they are officially patched. This is a proactive, but less common, approach.        *   **Monitor Pingora Releases:** Pay close attention to Pingora's release notes and security advisories for information about patched vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [4. HTTP Request Handling Issues (Within Pingora's Core)](./attack_surfaces/4__http_request_handling_issues__within_pingora's_core_.md)

*   *Description:*  Improper handling of malformed or malicious HTTP requests *within Pingora's core HTTP parsing and processing logic*.
    *   *How Pingora Contributes:* Pingora's core functionality includes parsing and processing HTTP requests.  Bugs in *this* core logic are directly attributable to Pingora.
    *   *Example:* Pingora's HTTP/2 implementation has a vulnerability that allows for header smuggling. An attacker crafts a malicious HTTP/2 request to bypass security checks or access unauthorized resources.
    *   *Impact:*        *   HTTP Request Smuggling - **High**        *   Header Injection - **High**    *   *Risk Severity:* **High**
    *   *Mitigation Strategies:*        *   **Rely on Pingora Updates:** The primary mitigation is to keep Pingora updated to the latest version. The Pingora developers are responsible for fixing bugs in the core HTTP handling.        *   **Report Issues:** If you discover a potential vulnerability in Pingora's HTTP handling, report it responsibly to the Pingora maintainers.        *   **WAF (as a secondary defense):** A Web Application Firewall (WAF) *in front of* Pingora can provide an additional layer of defense against some HTTP-level attacks, but it should not be relied upon as the *primary* defense. The core issue lies within Pingora.
