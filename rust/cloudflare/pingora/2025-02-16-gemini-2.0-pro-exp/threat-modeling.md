# Threat Model Analysis for cloudflare/pingora

## Threat: [Upstream TLS Verification Bypass](./threats/upstream_tls_verification_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends crafted requests to `pingora`, exploiting a misconfiguration or vulnerability in `pingora`'s TLS verification logic for *upstream* connections. The attacker might present an invalid certificate, and `pingora` might incorrectly accept it, allowing impersonation of a legitimate upstream server.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of data confidentiality and integrity between `pingora` and the upstream. Attacker can intercept, modify, or inject data, leading to data breaches or system compromise.
    *   **Affected Pingora Component:** `pingora::proxy::http::connect_to_upstream`, specifically the TLS handshake and certificate validation logic within the `tls` module (and related configuration options like `tls_connector` and `verify_hostname`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict TLS Configuration:** Enforce `verify_hostname = true` (or equivalent) for *all* upstream connections. *Never* disable certificate verification.
        *   **Certificate Pinning:** Use certificate pinning (`ca_cert` or similar) for critical upstreams.
        *   **Code Review:** Regularly review `pingora`'s TLS handling code (especially `tls` and `proxy` modules).
        *   **Dependency Updates:** Keep `pingora` and its TLS library up-to-date.
        *   **Testing:** Automated tests to check for proper TLS verification with *invalid* certificates.

## Threat: [Configuration Injection via Unvalidated Input](./threats/configuration_injection_via_unvalidated_input.md)

*   **Description:** If `pingora`'s configuration is dynamically generated from user input *without* proper validation, an attacker could inject malicious configuration directives. This is a vulnerability *within* how `pingora` handles its configuration.
    *   **Impact:** Highly variable, potentially ranging from denial of service to complete system compromise, depending on the injected configuration.
    *   **Affected Pingora Component:** The configuration loading and parsing mechanism (likely within `pingora::config`). The vulnerability depends on *how* user input influences the configuration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement *extremely* strict input validation and sanitization for *any* data influencing the `pingora` configuration. Use a whitelist approach.
        *   **Configuration Templates:** Use a secure templating engine (if dynamic configuration is needed) that prevents arbitrary code execution.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** The process generating the configuration should have minimal privileges.
        *   **Configuration Auditing:** Log and audit all configuration changes.
        *   **Separate Configuration Source:** Avoid directly exposing configuration endpoints to untrusted users.

## Threat: [Header Manipulation Leading to Request Smuggling](./threats/header_manipulation_leading_to_request_smuggling.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends crafted HTTP requests with malformed or ambiguous headers that are misinterpreted by `pingora`'s *own* HTTP parsing logic. This is a vulnerability in how `pingora` handles HTTP requests *before* forwarding them.
    *   **Impact:** Bypass of security filters, access to unauthorized resources, potential for cache poisoning, and server-side request forgery (SSRF).
    *   **Affected Pingora Component:** `pingora::proxy::http::v1::request_header` and `pingora::proxy::http::v1::response_header` (and related functions for parsing and forwarding HTTP headers).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Header Parsing:** Ensure `pingora` uses a strict and secure HTTP parser that rejects ambiguous or malformed headers.
        *   **Header Normalization:** Normalize headers *within pingora* before forwarding (remove duplicates, choose consistent interpretations).
        *   **Testing:** Fuzzing tests targeting `pingora`'s header parsing with malformed requests.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Connection Flooding (Specifically targeting `pingora`)](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_connection_flooding__specifically_targeting__pingora__.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker opens many connections to `pingora`, exceeding configured limits or exhausting `pingora`'s internal resources (file descriptors, memory *used by the pingora process*). This focuses on `pingora`'s ability to handle connections.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service. Legitimate users cannot connect to `pingora`.
    *   **Affected Pingora Component:** `pingora::server` and related components for managing connections (event loop, socket handling). Configuration options like `max_connections` are directly relevant.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Connection Limits:** Configure appropriate `max_connections` limits in `pingora`'s configuration.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting *within pingora* (if supported) or externally.
        *   **Connection Timeouts:** Configure appropriate timeouts for idle connections *within pingora*.
        *   **Monitoring:** Monitor `pingora`'s resource usage (connections, memory, CPU).

## Threat: [Cache Poisoning (if caching is enabled *within pingora*)](./threats/cache_poisoning__if_caching_is_enabled_within_pingora_.md)

*   **Description:** If `pingora` is configured to cache responses, an attacker could craft requests to cause `pingora` to cache a malicious response, which is then served to other users. This is a vulnerability in `pingora`'s caching logic.
    *   **Impact:** Distribution of malicious content, potential for XSS or client-side attacks, data breaches.
    *   **Affected Pingora Component:** `pingora::cache` (and related components if a custom caching implementation is used). Cache key generation and cache control header handling are critical.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Cache Key Validation:** Ensure the cache key is generated based on *all* relevant request attributes and cannot be manipulated.
        *   **Cache Control Headers:** Respect cache control headers and configure appropriate defaults *within pingora*.
        *   **No Caching of Sensitive Data:** Avoid caching responses with sensitive information.
        *   **Regular Cache Purging:** Implement a mechanism to regularly purge the cache.
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate any user input that influences the cache key or cached response.
