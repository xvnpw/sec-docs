# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for cloudflare/pingora

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Upstream Configuration and Validation](./mitigation_strategies/strict_upstream_configuration_and_validation.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Strict Upstream Configuration and Validation

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Inventory:** Create a comprehensive list of all legitimate upstream servers (applications, databases, etc.) that `pingora` *must* access. Include IP addresses, hostnames, and ports.
    2.  **Whitelist (Pingora Configuration):** Within `pingora`'s configuration (e.g., its TOML file or equivalent), explicitly define the allowed upstream servers using the inventory from step 1.  `pingora` should be configured to *reject* any connection attempts to servers *not* on this whitelist. This is a core `pingora` configuration task.
    3.  **IP Address Preference (Pingora Configuration):**  In `pingora`'s configuration, use IP addresses instead of hostnames for upstream servers whenever possible. This avoids reliance on DNS resolution, which can be a point of vulnerability.
    4.  **Port Specificity (Pingora Configuration):**  Within `pingora`'s configuration, explicitly specify the allowed ports for *each* upstream server.  Do not use wildcard port ranges or leave ports undefined.  This is a direct setting within `pingora`.
    5.  **Input Validation (for Upstream Selection, if applicable):** If `pingora`'s configuration allows *any* form of dynamic upstream selection based on user input (this is generally *not* recommended), implement strict validation *within a `pingora` filter or callback* to prevent SSRF. This validation logic should be part of the `pingora` deployment.  The validation should:
        *   Check against a predefined, *hardcoded* whitelist (separate from the main upstream configuration, if necessary).
        *   Reject any input that doesn't match the expected format.
    6.  **Configuration Review (Pingora Configuration):** Regularly review the `pingora` configuration file(s) to ensure the upstream whitelist remains accurate and up-to-date.
    7.  **Automated Testing (Targeting Pingora):** Create automated tests that specifically target `pingora`. These tests should attempt to connect to unauthorized upstream servers *through* `pingora` and verify that `pingora` correctly rejects the connections according to its configuration.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** (Severity: Critical) - Prevents attackers from using `pingora` to make requests to internal or unintended services.
    *   **Unintended Service Exposure:** (Severity: High) - Prevents accidental exposure of internal services via `pingora`.
    *   **Bypass of Security Controls:** (Severity: High) - Prevents attackers from bypassing network security by routing through `pingora`.
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** (Severity: High) - Reduces the risk of data exfiltration through `pingora`.

*   **Impact:**
    *   SSRF: Risk significantly reduced (almost eliminated with correct `pingora` configuration).
    *   Unintended Service Exposure: Risk significantly reduced (directly controlled by `pingora`'s configuration).
    *   Bypass of Security Controls: Risk significantly reduced (dependent on `pingora`'s configuration).
    *   Data Exfiltration: Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Example - Needs to be filled in by the development team)
    *   Upstream whitelist: Partially implemented in `config/pingora.toml`.
    *   SSRF validation (within a `pingora` filter): Not implemented.
    *   Automated tests: Basic tests for valid upstreams, but no tests for unauthorized access *through pingora*.

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Example - Needs to be filled in by the development team)
    *   SSRF validation filter needs to be implemented *within pingora*.
    *   Automated tests need to specifically target `pingora`'s rejection of unauthorized upstream access.
    *   Regular `pingora` configuration review process needs to be formalized.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Header Handling (within Pingora)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_header_handling__within_pingora_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Header Handling (within Pingora)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Header Inventory:** List all HTTP headers processed by `pingora`.
    2.  **Whitelist/Blacklist (Pingora Configuration/Filters):** Within `pingora`'s configuration or using `pingora`'s filter/callback system:
        *   **Whitelist:** Define which headers `pingora` should *allow*. This is the preferred approach.
        *   **Blacklist:** Define which headers `pingora` should *block*. Less secure, but sometimes necessary.
    3.  **Sanitization (Pingora Filters):**  For allowed headers that might contain untrusted data, implement sanitization *within `pingora` filters*. This is crucial for preventing header injection.
    4.  **Removal (Pingora Configuration/Filters):**  Configure `pingora` (via configuration or filters) to remove unnecessary or sensitive headers (e.g., `Server`, `X-Powered-By`).
    5.  **`X-Forwarded-For` Handling (Pingora Configuration/Filters):**  Configure `pingora` *specifically* to handle `X-Forwarded-For`:
        *   Validate the format if trusting the client's header.
        *   Append the client's IP (obtained by `pingora`) instead of replacing.
        *   Remove and replace if not trusting the client.
    6.  **`X-Real-IP` Handling (Pingora Configuration/Filters):**  Similar to `X-Forwarded-For`, configure `pingora`'s handling of `X-Real-IP`.
    7.  **Custom Headers (Pingora Configuration/Filters):**  Review and securely configure `pingora`'s handling of any custom headers.
    8.  **Automated Tests (Targeting Pingora):** Create tests that send requests *to pingora* with malicious headers. Verify that `pingora` (via its configuration and filters) handles them correctly.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Header Injection Attacks:** (Severity: High) - Prevents attackers from injecting malicious headers via `pingora`.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents leakage of sensitive information through headers processed by `pingora`.
    *   **IP Spoofing:** (Severity: Medium) - Reduces IP spoofing risk through `pingora`.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Indirectly):** (Severity: High) - Sanitizing headers within `pingora` can help prevent XSS.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Header Injection: Risk significantly reduced (directly controlled by `pingora`'s configuration and filters).
    *   Information Disclosure: Risk significantly reduced.
    *   IP Spoofing: Risk reduced.
    *   XSS (Indirectly): Risk reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Example)
    *   Basic header removal in `pingora`'s configuration.
    *   No sanitization or whitelisting within `pingora`.
    *   `X-Forwarded-For` is appended by `pingora`, but without validation.

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Example)
    *   Header whitelisting/blacklisting needs to be implemented in `pingora`'s configuration or filters.
    *   Sanitization functions need to be implemented as `pingora` filters.
    *   `X-Forwarded-For` validation needs to be added to `pingora`.
    *   Automated tests targeting `pingora`'s header handling are missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Strong TLS Configuration (within Pingora)](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_strong_tls_configuration__within_pingora_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce Strong TLS Configuration (within Pingora)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **TLS Version (Pingora Configuration):** Configure `pingora` (in its configuration file) to use TLS 1.3 *only*, if possible.  If necessary, allow TLS 1.2 as a fallback, but disable older versions. This is a direct `pingora` setting.
    2.  **Cipher Suites (Pingora Configuration):**  Specify a list of strong cipher suites within `pingora`'s configuration. Prioritize forward secrecy (ECDHE, DHE). Disable weak ciphers. This is a direct `pingora` setting.
    3.  **Certificate Validation (Upstream - Pingora Configuration):** Configure `pingora` to perform strict certificate validation for *upstream* connections:
        *   Verify validity period.
        *   Verify the chain of trust.
        *   Verify the hostname matches.
        *   Consider certificate pinning (within `pingora`'s configuration, if supported).
    4.  **Certificate Pinning (Optional - Pingora Configuration):** If supported by `pingora`, configure certificate pinning for critical upstreams.
    5.  **HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security - Pingora Configuration):** Configure `pingora` to send the HSTS header. This is a `pingora` configuration setting.
    6.  **OCSP Stapling (Pingora Configuration):** Enable OCSP stapling within `pingora`'s configuration, if supported.
    7.  **Regular Key/Certificate Rotation:** Implement a process for rotating TLS keys and certificates used *by pingora*.
    8.  **Automated Testing (Targeting Pingora):** Use tools like `testssl.sh` to test `pingora`'s *own* TLS configuration.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** (Severity: Critical) - Strong TLS configuration in `pingora` prevents MitM attacks.
    *   **Downgrade Attacks:** (Severity: High) - Disabling weak TLS versions/ciphers in `pingora` prevents downgrade attacks.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** (Severity: High) - Encrypting traffic with `pingora` prevents eavesdropping.

*   **Impact:**
    *   MitM Attacks: Risk significantly reduced (almost eliminated with proper `pingora` configuration).
    *   Downgrade Attacks: Risk significantly reduced (controlled by `pingora`'s settings).
    *   Information Disclosure: Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Example)
    *   TLS 1.2 and 1.3 are enabled in `pingora`'s configuration.
    *   Default cipher suites are used by `pingora`, but not reviewed.
    *   Basic certificate validation by `pingora`, but not hostname verification.
    *   HSTS is not enabled in `pingora`.

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Example)
    *   Cipher suite list needs review and updating within `pingora`'s configuration.
    *   Hostname verification needs to be added to `pingora`'s certificate validation.
    *   HSTS needs to be enabled in `pingora`'s configuration.
    *   OCSP stapling should be considered (if supported by `pingora`).
    *   Automated TLS testing targeting `pingora` is needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate and Connection Limiting (within Pingora)](./mitigation_strategies/rate_and_connection_limiting__within_pingora_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Rate and Connection Limiting (within Pingora)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Resources:** Determine which resources (upstream servers, endpoints) `pingora` should protect.
    2.  **Define Limits (Pingora Configuration):** Configure `pingora` (using its configuration mechanisms) to set limits:
        *   Requests per Second (RPS) per client/IP/etc.
        *   Connections per Second (CPS).
        *   Total Concurrent Connections.
    3.  **Granularity (Pingora Configuration):** Configure the granularity of limits within `pingora` (per client IP, globally, etc.).
    4.  **Error Handling (Pingora Configuration):** Configure `pingora` to return appropriate error responses (e.g., 429) when limits are exceeded.
    5.  **Monitoring:** Monitor `pingora`'s metrics to track the effectiveness of rate limiting.
    6.  **Testing (Targeting Pingora):** Simulate high traffic loads *to pingora* to test its rate limiting configuration.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks:** (Severity: High) - `pingora` protects upstreams from overload.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** (Severity: Medium) - `pingora` can slow down brute-force attempts.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** (Severity: High) - `pingora` prevents resource exhaustion.
    *   **Web Scraping:** (Severity: Low) - `pingora` can hinder web scraping.

*   **Impact:**

    *   Brute-Force Attacks: Risk reduced.
    *   Resource Exhaustion: Risk significantly reduced.
    *   Web Scraping: Risk reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Example)

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Example)
    *   Rate limiting and connection limiting need to be configured *within pingora*.
    *   Monitoring of `pingora`'s rate limiting metrics is needed.
    *   Testing `pingora` under high load is required.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Stay Up-to-Date and Monitor for Vulnerabilities (of Pingora)](./mitigation_strategies/stay_up-to-date_and_monitor_for_vulnerabilities__of_pingora_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Stay Up-to-Date and Monitor for Vulnerabilities (of Pingora)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Subscribe to Updates:** Subscribe to the `pingora` project's release notifications and security advisories.
    2.  **Regular Updates:** Establish a schedule for updating the `pingora` library itself to the latest stable version.
    3.  **Dependency Management:** Use Cargo (or equivalent) to manage and update `pingora`'s dependencies.
    4.  **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use SAST/DAST tools to scan the `pingora` library and its dependencies for vulnerabilities. This is about finding vulnerabilities *in pingora*, not in your application logic.
    5.  **Security Audits:** Conduct audits focusing on the `pingora` deployment and configuration.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (in Pingora):** (Severity: Variable, up to Critical) - Reduces the risk of exploiting vulnerabilities *in the pingora library itself*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities: Risk significantly reduced (by keeping `pingora` updated).

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Example)
    *   No formal process for monitoring `pingora` updates.
    *   `pingora`'s dependencies are updated sporadically.

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Example)
    *   Formal process for monitoring `pingora` updates is needed.
    *   `pingora`'s dependency management needs improvement.
    *   Vulnerability scanning of `pingora` itself needs to be integrated.
