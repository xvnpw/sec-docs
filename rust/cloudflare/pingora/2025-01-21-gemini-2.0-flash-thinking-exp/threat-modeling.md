# Threat Model Analysis for cloudflare/pingora

## Threat: [HTTP Parsing Vulnerability](./threats/http_parsing_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a specially crafted or malformed HTTP request that exploits a vulnerability in Pingora's HTTP parsing logic. This could cause Pingora to crash, behave unexpectedly, or potentially lead to memory corruption that could be exploited for remote code execution *within the Pingora process*.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service of the proxy, potential remote code execution on the server running Pingora, information disclosure if memory corruption is exploitable.
    *   **Affected Component:** `HTTP Parser` module, specifically the functions responsible for parsing request headers and body.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Pingora updated to the latest version, as updates often include fixes for parsing vulnerabilities.
        *   Monitor Pingora logs for unusual parsing errors or crashes.

## Threat: [HTTP Header Injection](./threats/http_header_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates HTTP headers in a request that is then forwarded by Pingora to an upstream server. This is a threat *directly involving Pingora's forwarding mechanism*, allowing the attacker to inject arbitrary headers, potentially bypassing security checks on the upstream server, manipulating caching behavior *managed by Pingora or influenced by headers it forwards*, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the upstream application's header processing *due to Pingora's forwarding*.
    *   **Impact:** Security bypass on upstream servers due to headers forwarded by Pingora, cache poisoning if Pingora's caching is involved, potential for further exploitation depending on the upstream application's vulnerabilities exposed by forwarded headers.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Request Forwarding` module, specifically the functions responsible for copying and forwarding headers to upstream servers.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure Pingora to sanitize or remove potentially dangerous headers before forwarding requests.
        *   Use Pingora's configuration options to control which headers are passed to upstream servers.

## Threat: [Large Header/Body Denial of Service](./threats/large_headerbody_denial_of_service.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends requests with excessively large HTTP headers or bodies, overwhelming Pingora's resources (memory, CPU) and causing *Pingora itself* to become unresponsive or crash, leading to a denial of service for legitimate users.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, impacting application availability due to Pingora's failure.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Request Handling` module, specifically the functions responsible for reading and processing request headers and bodies *within Pingora*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure Pingora with appropriate limits for maximum header size and request body size.
        *   Implement rate limiting *at the Pingora level* to restrict the number of requests from a single source.
        *   Monitor Pingora's resource usage and set up alerts for abnormal consumption.

## Threat: [TLS/SSL Vulnerabilities in Upstream Communication](./threats/tlsssl_vulnerabilities_in_upstream_communication.md)

*   **Description:** Pingora's TLS/SSL implementation for communicating with upstream servers might be vulnerable to known TLS attacks (e.g., downgrade attacks, renegotiation attacks) or might be configured with weak ciphers, allowing an attacker to eavesdrop on or manipulate traffic *between Pingora and the backend*. This directly involves Pingora's TLS stack.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach of data transmitted to upstream servers via Pingora, potential data manipulation in transit through Pingora.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Upstream Connection Management` module, specifically the functions responsible for establishing and maintaining TLS connections to upstream servers *within Pingora*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure Pingora is configured to use strong TLS versions (TLS 1.2 or higher) and secure cipher suites.
        *   Keep Pingora and its underlying TLS libraries updated to the latest versions.
        *   Enforce mutual TLS (mTLS) for upstream connections where appropriate *within Pingora's configuration*.

## Threat: [Improper Upstream Certificate Validation](./threats/improper_upstream_certificate_validation.md)

*   **Description:** Pingora might not be configured to properly validate the TLS certificates presented by upstream servers. An attacker could exploit this by performing a man-in-the-middle attack *between Pingora and the backend*, presenting a fraudulent certificate, and potentially intercepting or modifying traffic intended for the legitimate backend. This is a direct failure of Pingora's validation process.
    *   **Impact:** Man-in-the-middle attacks on connections proxied by Pingora, interception of sensitive data passing through Pingora, potential data manipulation.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Upstream Connection Management` module, specifically the functions responsible for verifying upstream server certificates *within Pingora*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure Pingora to strictly validate upstream server certificates, including hostname verification.
        *   Use a trusted certificate authority (CA) for upstream server certificates.
        *   Consider pinning upstream server certificates for added security *within Pingora's configuration*.

## Threat: [Request Smuggling/Desynchronization](./threats/request_smugglingdesynchronization.md)

*   **Description:** Discrepancies in how Pingora and upstream servers parse HTTP requests (e.g., handling of Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding headers) can be exploited to "smuggle" additional requests to the backend *through Pingora*, potentially bypassing security controls or leading to unauthorized actions. This directly involves Pingora's request processing and forwarding logic.
    *   **Impact:** Security bypass on upstream servers due to Pingora's handling, unauthorized access to resources via smuggled requests, potential for data manipulation.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Request Forwarding` module, specifically the functions responsible for rewriting and forwarding requests to upstream servers *within Pingora*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure Pingora to normalize requests before forwarding them to upstream servers, ensuring consistent interpretation of headers.
        *   Monitor logs for signs of request smuggling attempts *at the Pingora level*.

## Threat: [Configuration File Vulnerabilities](./threats/configuration_file_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** If Pingora's configuration files are not properly secured (e.g., incorrect file permissions), an attacker could gain access to them and modify settings, potentially compromising *Pingora's* behavior, gaining access to sensitive information (like upstream credentials *used by Pingora*), or disabling security features *within Pingora*.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of Pingora's functionality, potential access to backend systems *via compromised Pingora*, information disclosure of credentials used by Pingora.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Configuration Loading` module, the system's file system where configuration files are stored *for Pingora*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure Pingora's configuration files have appropriate file permissions, restricting access to only authorized users and processes.
        *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in configuration files; use secure secrets management solutions *integrated with Pingora*.
        *   Regularly audit configuration files for unauthorized changes.

## Threat: [Insufficient Access Controls for Management Interfaces](./threats/insufficient_access_controls_for_management_interfaces.md)

*   **Description:** If Pingora exposes management interfaces (e.g., for monitoring or configuration), weak or default credentials or insufficient access controls could allow unauthorized users to access and potentially compromise *the Pingora proxy itself*.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized modification of Pingora's configuration, monitoring of sensitive traffic passing through Pingora, potential denial of service by misconfiguring Pingora.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Management Interface` module (if present and enabled in Pingora).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong authentication and authorization for any management interfaces provided by Pingora.
        *   Disable management interfaces if they are not required.
