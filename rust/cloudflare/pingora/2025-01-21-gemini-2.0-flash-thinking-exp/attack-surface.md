# Attack Surface Analysis for cloudflare/pingora

## Attack Surface: [HTTP Header Injection/Smuggling](./attack_surfaces/http_header_injectionsmuggling.md)

- **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious HTTP requests with manipulated headers that are interpreted differently by Pingora and the backend server. This can lead to bypassing security checks, request routing manipulation, or even execution of unintended actions on the backend.
- **How Pingora Contributes:** Pingora, as a reverse proxy, forwards headers from the client to the backend. If Pingora doesn't properly sanitize or validate these headers, it can inadvertently pass on malicious payloads. Vulnerabilities in Pingora's header parsing logic can also be exploited.
- **Example:** An attacker injects a `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` header along with a `Content-Length` header. Pingora might process one, while the backend processes the other, leading to request smuggling.
- **Impact:**  Bypassing authentication/authorization, gaining unauthorized access to resources, cache poisoning, executing arbitrary commands on the backend (in severe cases).
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Implement strict header validation and sanitization within Pingora configurations.
    - Configure Pingora to normalize headers before forwarding them.
    - Regularly update Pingora to benefit from security patches addressing header handling vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf_.md)

- **Description:** An attacker manipulates Pingora to make requests to unintended internal or external resources. This can be achieved by controlling parts of the request that Pingora uses to determine the backend server or the target of a sub-request.
- **How Pingora Contributes:** If Pingora's backend selection logic or request modification features rely on user-controlled input without proper validation, an attacker can craft requests that force Pingora to interact with arbitrary URLs.
- **Example:**  A configuration where the backend URL is partially derived from a client-provided header. An attacker could manipulate this header to make Pingora send requests to internal services not meant to be publicly accessible.
- **Impact:** Accessing internal services, reading sensitive data, performing actions on internal systems, port scanning, denial of service against internal or external targets.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Implement strict whitelisting of allowed backend destinations within Pingora configuration.
    - Avoid using user-controlled input directly in backend selection or request modification logic.
    - Sanitize and validate any user-provided data used in backend routing.
    - Disable or restrict features that allow dynamic backend resolution based on external input.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Underlying TLS Libraries](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_underlying_tls_libraries.md)

- **Description:** Pingora relies on underlying TLS libraries (like Rustls or OpenSSL) for secure communication. Vulnerabilities in these libraries can directly impact Pingora's security.
- **How Pingora Contributes:** Pingora's security is inherently tied to the security of its dependencies. If the TLS library has a vulnerability, Pingora deployments are also vulnerable.
- **Example:** A known vulnerability in Rustls allows for a specific type of denial-of-service attack during the TLS handshake. Pingora instances using this vulnerable version would be susceptible.
- **Impact:**  Man-in-the-middle attacks, decryption of traffic, denial of service, potential remote code execution (depending on the vulnerability).
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Regularly update Pingora and its underlying TLS libraries to patch known vulnerabilities.
    - Monitor security advisories for the TLS library used by Pingora.
    - Consider using automated dependency scanning tools to identify vulnerable libraries.

## Attack Surface: [Plugin Vulnerabilities (If Applicable)](./attack_surfaces/plugin_vulnerabilities__if_applicable_.md)

- **Description:** If Pingora's architecture allows for plugins or extensions, vulnerabilities in these custom components can introduce new attack vectors.
- **How Pingora Contributes:** Pingora's plugin system provides a way to extend its functionality. If these plugins are not developed securely, they can be exploited.
- **Example:** A poorly written plugin might have a SQL injection vulnerability or allow arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact:**  Remote code execution, data breaches, denial of service, privilege escalation.
- **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Implement secure coding practices for plugin development.
    - Conduct thorough security reviews and testing of all plugins.
    - Enforce strict input validation and sanitization within plugins.
    - Implement a secure plugin loading and management mechanism within Pingora.
    - Follow the principle of least privilege for plugin permissions.
