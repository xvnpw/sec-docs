## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Request Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_request_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

* HTTP Request Smuggling (CRITICAL NODE):
    * Description: Manipulate how Pingora parses and forwards HTTP requests, leading to misinterpretation by the backend server.
    * Mechanism: Craft malicious requests with ambiguous boundaries (e.g., conflicting Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding headers) that Pingora interprets differently than the backend.
    * Impact: Bypass security controls, gain unauthorized access to resources, potentially execute arbitrary code on the backend.
    * Mitigation: Strict adherence to HTTP specifications, robust request parsing logic, input validation, and potentially implementing request normalization.
* Header Injection:
    * Description: Inject malicious headers into requests forwarded by Pingora.
    * Mechanism: Exploit vulnerabilities in Pingora's header processing or sanitization to inject arbitrary headers.
    * Impact: Modify backend behavior, bypass authentication/authorization, potentially achieve XSS or other injection attacks on the backend.
    * Mitigation: Strict header sanitization, input validation, and ensuring proper handling of special characters in headers.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Backend Connection Handling](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_backend_connection_handling.md)

* Backend Server Impersonation (CRITICAL NODE):
    * Description: Trick Pingora into connecting to a malicious server instead of the legitimate backend.
    * Mechanism: Exploit vulnerabilities in Pingora's backend discovery or configuration to redirect connections to an attacker-controlled server.
    * Impact: Data exfiltration, manipulation of responses, potential compromise of user data.
    * Mitigation: Secure configuration management, mutual TLS authentication between Pingora and backends, and strict validation of backend addresses.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities.md)

* Insecure Default Configuration (CRITICAL NODE):
    * Description: Pingora's default configuration settings are insecure and can be exploited.
    * Mechanism: Leverage default settings that expose sensitive information, allow insecure connections, or have weak security controls.
    * Impact: Information disclosure, unauthorized access, or other security breaches.
    * Mitigation: Review and harden default configurations, provide clear guidance on secure configuration practices.
* Misconfiguration Leading to Vulnerabilities:
    * Description: Incorrect configuration of Pingora introduces security vulnerabilities.
    * Mechanism: Developers or operators misconfigure settings related to TLS, timeouts, access control, or other security-sensitive parameters.
    * Impact: Various security breaches depending on the misconfiguration.
    * Mitigation: Provide clear and comprehensive documentation, implement configuration validation, and offer secure configuration templates.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_dependencies.md)

* Vulnerable Dependencies (CRITICAL NODE):
    * Description: Pingora relies on third-party libraries that contain known vulnerabilities.
    * Mechanism: Exploit vulnerabilities in the dependencies used by Pingora.
    * Impact: Various security breaches depending on the vulnerability in the dependency.
    * Mitigation: Regularly update dependencies, use vulnerability scanning tools, and carefully evaluate the security of dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Nodes](./attack_tree_paths/critical_nodes.md)

* Compromise Application via Pingora:
    * Description: The attacker's ultimate goal.
    * Impact: Full control over the application and its data.
* HTTP Request Smuggling: (See details above in "Exploit Request Handling Vulnerabilities")
* Backend Server Impersonation: (See details above in "Exploit Backend Connection Handling")
* Insecure Default Configuration: (See details above in "Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities")
* Vulnerable Dependencies: (See details above in "Exploit Dependencies")
* Weak TLS Configuration:
    * Description: Pingora is configured to use weak or outdated TLS protocols or ciphers.
    * Mechanism: Exploit weaknesses in the TLS configuration to eavesdrop on communication or perform man-in-the-middle attacks.
    * Impact: Confidentiality and integrity breaches.
    * Mitigation: Enforce strong TLS protocols and cipher suites, disable outdated versions.
