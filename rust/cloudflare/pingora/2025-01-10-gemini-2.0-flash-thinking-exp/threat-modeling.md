# Threat Model Analysis for cloudflare/pingora

## Threat: [Misconfigured Upstream Routing](./threats/misconfigured_upstream_routing.md)

**Description:** Attackers can exploit incorrectly defined routing rules within Pingora to access unintended backend services. By manipulating request paths or headers, they can bypass intended routing logic and potentially reach sensitive resources or functionalities on internal servers.

**Impact:** Access to sensitive data on unintended backends, ability to execute unauthorized actions on other services, potential for lateral movement within the infrastructure.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Weak TLS Configuration](./threats/weak_tls_configuration.md)

**Description:** If Pingora is configured with weak or outdated TLS settings (e.g., vulnerable ciphers or older protocols), attackers can eavesdrop on or manipulate encrypted traffic between clients and Pingora, or between Pingora and backend servers. This compromises the confidentiality and integrity of the communication.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data transmitted over HTTPS, potential for man-in-the-middle attacks, compromise of session integrity.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [HTTP/2 Request Smuggling](./threats/http2_request_smuggling.md)

**Description:** Attackers can craft malicious HTTP/2 requests that are interpreted differently by Pingora and the backend server. This discrepancy allows them to "smuggle" a second, potentially harmful request within the first, effectively bypassing Pingora's security controls and directly targeting the backend.

**Impact:** Bypassing security controls, gaining unauthorized access to resources on the backend, potential for executing arbitrary commands on the backend.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [HTTP/3 (QUIC) Vulnerabilities](./threats/http3__quic__vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities within Pingora's implementation of the HTTP/3 protocol (using QUIC) can lead to various attacks. This could involve sending malformed packets or exploiting protocol-level weaknesses to cause denial of service, information disclosure, or other security breaches within Pingora itself.

**Impact:** Service disruption due to crashes or resource exhaustion within Pingora, potential for data leakage if vulnerabilities allow access to internal memory or state.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Connection Exhaustion](./threats/connection_exhaustion.md)

**Description:** Attackers can flood Pingora with a large number of connection requests, rapidly exhausting its connection handling resources. This prevents legitimate clients from establishing new connections, leading to a denial-of-service condition specifically affecting Pingora's ability to serve traffic.

**Impact:** Service unavailability as Pingora becomes unable to accept new connections, impacting users' ability to access the application.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Header Manipulation Exploits](./threats/header_manipulation_exploits.md)

**Description:** Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in how Pingora processes or modifies HTTP headers. By crafting requests with specific header combinations or oversized headers, they might be able to trigger unexpected behavior within Pingora, potentially leading to cache poisoning, session hijacking if Pingora incorrectly handles session-related headers, or bypassing authentication if Pingora makes decisions based on manipulated header values.

**Impact:** Cache poisoning leading to serving malicious content, session hijacking allowing unauthorized access to user accounts, bypassing authentication or authorization controls.

**Risk Severity:** High
