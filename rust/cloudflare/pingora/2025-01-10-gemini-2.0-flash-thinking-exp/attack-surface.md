# Attack Surface Analysis for cloudflare/pingora

## Attack Surface: [HTTP Request Smuggling/Desynchronization](./attack_surfaces/http_request_smugglingdesynchronization.md)

*   **Description:** Discrepancies in how Pingora and backend servers parse HTTP request boundaries can allow an attacker to inject malicious requests into the backend context of legitimate requests.
    *   **How Pingora Contributes:** As a reverse proxy, Pingora sits between the client and backend. If its HTTP parsing logic differs from the backend, attackers can craft requests that are interpreted differently by each, leading to smuggling.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a specially crafted request to Pingora. Pingora interprets it as one request, but the backend interprets it as two, with the second being a malicious request injected by the attacker.
    *   **Impact:** Bypassing security controls, gaining unauthorized access to resources, cache poisoning, and potentially executing arbitrary commands on backend servers.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict HTTP Parsing:** Configure Pingora to strictly adhere to HTTP specifications and reject ambiguous or malformed requests.
        *   **Backend Synchronization:** Ensure backend servers have consistent HTTP parsing behavior with Pingora.
        *   **Connection Draining:** Implement connection draining mechanisms to avoid issues with persistent connections when backend behavior is uncertain.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Pingora updated to benefit from bug fixes and security patches related to HTTP handling.

## Attack Surface: [TLS Termination Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/tls_termination_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Weaknesses in Pingora's TLS configuration or the underlying TLS libraries can expose the application to various TLS-related attacks.
    *   **How Pingora Contributes:** Pingora often handles TLS termination, making it responsible for the security of the TLS connection. Vulnerabilities here directly impact the confidentiality and integrity of communication.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could exploit a vulnerability in Pingora's TLS implementation to downgrade the connection to an older, less secure protocol (like SSLv3) and then perform a man-in-the-middle attack.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, man-in-the-middle attacks, eavesdropping on sensitive information.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong TLS Configuration:** Configure Pingora to use strong TLS protocols (TLS 1.3 or higher) and secure cipher suites, disabling older and vulnerable protocols and ciphers.
        *   **Certificate Management:** Ensure proper management and validation of TLS certificates. Use trusted Certificate Authorities and implement certificate pinning where appropriate.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Pingora and its underlying TLS libraries updated to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   **HSTS Implementation:** Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to force clients to use HTTPS.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks Targeting Pingora](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__and_distributed_denial_of_service__ddos__attacks_targeting_pingora.md)

*   **Description:** As a public-facing entry point, Pingora is a direct target for DoS/DDoS attacks aimed at overwhelming its resources and making the application unavailable.
    *   **How Pingora Contributes:** Pingora's role as the entry point for external traffic makes it the primary target for attackers attempting to disrupt service availability.
    *   **Example:** An attacker launches a large-scale HTTP flood attack against Pingora, sending a massive number of requests to overwhelm its processing capacity and prevent legitimate users from accessing the application.
    *   **Impact:** Application unavailability, service disruption, financial losses.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Configure Pingora to limit the number of requests from a single IP address or client within a specific timeframe.
        *   **Connection Limits:** Set limits on the number of concurrent connections Pingora will accept.
        *   **DDoS Mitigation Services:** Utilize external DDoS mitigation services to filter malicious traffic before it reaches Pingora.
        *   **Resource Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement monitoring to detect unusual traffic patterns and trigger alerts for potential DoS attacks.
