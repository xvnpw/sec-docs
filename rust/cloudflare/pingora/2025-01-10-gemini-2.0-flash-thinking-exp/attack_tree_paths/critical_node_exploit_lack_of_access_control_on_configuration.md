    * **Hindered Incident Response:**  Lack of logs makes it challenging to understand the scope and impact of an attack.

**3. Inject malicious code or configurations:**

* **Technical Details:**  Pingora's configuration might allow for the inclusion of custom scripts, modules, or configurations that extend its functionality.
* **Attack Mechanism:** An attacker could inject malicious code or configurations into these files, leading to:
    * **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  Executing arbitrary commands on the server running Pingora.
    * **Backdoor Creation:**  Establishing persistent access to the system.
    * **Data Exfiltration:**  Stealing sensitive data from the server.
    * **Further Exploitation:**  Using the compromised Pingora instance as a stepping stone to attack other systems within the network.
* **Impact:**
    * **Complete System Compromise:**  Gaining full control over the server running Pingora.
    * **Lateral Movement:**  Using the compromised server to attack other systems in the network.
    * **Data Breach:**  Stealing sensitive data stored on or accessible through the compromised server.
    * **Service Disruption:**  Causing outages or instability by injecting faulty code.

**4. Expose sensitive information stored in configuration files:**

* **Technical Details:** Configuration files might contain sensitive information such as:
    * **API keys and secrets:**  Credentials for accessing external services.
    * **Database connection strings:**  Credentials for accessing backend databases.
    * **Internal network configurations:**  Information about the application's infrastructure.
* **Attack Mechanism:**  If access controls are weak, an attacker gaining access to the configuration files can directly read and exfiltrate this sensitive information.
* **Impact:**
    * **Compromised External Services:**  Attackers can use stolen API keys to access and potentially abuse external services.
    * **Database Breach:**  Stolen database credentials can lead to unauthorized access and data theft from the backend database.
    * **Exposure of Internal Infrastructure:**  Information about the internal network can be used for further attacks.

**Likelihood and Attack Complexity:**

The likelihood of this attack path being exploited depends on several factors:
