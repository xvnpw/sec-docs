## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Request Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_request_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

This category represents vulnerabilities in how Pingora processes incoming client requests. Attackers aim to exploit weaknesses in parsing HTTP protocols, handling headers, or managing request bodies. Successful exploitation can lead to various issues, including denial of service, information disclosure, or even the ability to manipulate backend requests.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path & Critical Node: Exploit Request Smuggling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_&_critical_node_exploit_request_smuggling_vulnerabilities.md)

Request smuggling occurs when Pingora and backend servers interpret the boundaries of HTTP requests differently. This discrepancy allows an attacker to "smuggle" a second, malicious request within the body of the first legitimate request. This smuggled request is then processed by the backend server as if it were a separate, valid request, potentially bypassing security controls or leading to unintended actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Utilize CL.TE or TE.CL Discrepancies](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_utilize_cl_te_or_te_cl_discrepancies.md)

This is a common technique for request smuggling. It exploits the ambiguity that arises when both `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers are present in a request. Pingora and the backend might prioritize different headers, leading to a mismatch in how much data is considered part of the request body.

        *   **Attack Vector: Send Ambiguous Requests with Conflicting Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding Headers:** An attacker crafts a request with conflicting values in the `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers. Pingora might interpret the request one way, while the backend interprets it differently, allowing the attacker to append a second, malicious request that the backend will process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Header Injection via Smuggling](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_header_injection_via_smuggling.md)

Once request smuggling is successfully achieved, attackers can inject arbitrary HTTP headers into the smuggled request. These injected headers are then processed by the backend server as if they were part of a legitimate request.

        *   **Attack Vector: Inject Malicious Headers into Backend Requests:** By injecting malicious headers, attackers can manipulate the backend's behavior. This could involve:
            *   Bypassing authentication or authorization checks by injecting valid credentials or session identifiers.
            *   Modifying the requested resource or action.
            *   Injecting malicious cookies.
            *   Potentially exploiting vulnerabilities in the backend application that rely on specific header values.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Backend Interaction Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_backend_interaction_vulnerabilities.md)

This category encompasses vulnerabilities related to how Pingora interacts with the backend servers. Attackers might try to exploit weaknesses in connection management, request forwarding, or response handling. Successful exploitation can lead to denial of service on backend servers, data corruption, or the ability to manipulate backend responses.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Configuration or Management Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_configuration_or_management_vulnerabilities.md)

This category focuses on vulnerabilities in Pingora's configuration and management mechanisms. If an attacker can gain unauthorized access to or manipulate Pingora's configuration, they can potentially take complete control over its behavior, redirect traffic, or disable security features.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Lack of Access Control on Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_lack_of_access_control_on_configuration.md)

If access to Pingora's configuration files is not properly restricted, attackers with sufficient system privileges can directly modify these files.

        *   **Attack Vector: Modify Pingora Configuration Files Directly:** By directly modifying configuration files, an attacker can:
            *   Change routing rules to redirect traffic to malicious servers.
            *   Disable security features or logging.
            *   Inject malicious code or configurations.
            *   Expose sensitive information stored in configuration files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Management API Vulnerabilities (if exposed)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_management_api_vulnerabilities__if_exposed_.md)

If Pingora exposes a management API for administrative tasks, vulnerabilities in this API can be exploited to gain unauthorized control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Authentication or Authorization Flaws](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_authentication_or_authorization_flaws.md)

Weaknesses in the authentication or authorization mechanisms of the management API can allow attackers to bypass security checks and gain unauthorized access.

        *   **Attack Vector: Bypass Authentication or Authorization Mechanisms:** Attackers might exploit flaws like:
            *   Default or weak credentials.
            *   Insecure session management.
            *   Missing or improperly implemented authorization checks.
            *   Vulnerabilities in the authentication protocol itself.
