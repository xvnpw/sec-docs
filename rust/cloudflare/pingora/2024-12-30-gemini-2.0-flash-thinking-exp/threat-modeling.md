### High and Critical Pingora Threats

Here's an updated list of high and critical threats directly involving Cloudflare Pingora:

*   **Threat:** Malformed HTTP Request Processing Vulnerability
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a specially crafted HTTP request with malformed headers, methods, or URIs that exploits a vulnerability in Pingora's HTTP parsing logic. This could lead to crashes, unexpected behavior, or potentially even remote code execution if a critical flaw exists in the parsing implementation.
    *   **Impact:** Service disruption due to crashes, potential for arbitrary code execution on the Pingora instance, potentially compromising the underlying system or network.
    *   **Affected Pingora Component:** `HTTP Parser` (likely within the core request handling logic).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Pingora updated to the latest stable version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        *   Consider using robust HTTP parsing libraries within Pingora (if configurable) and ensure they are regularly updated.

*   **Threat:** HTTP Header Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker manipulates HTTP headers in a request that is then forwarded by Pingora to backend servers. This could allow the attacker to inject arbitrary headers, potentially bypassing security checks on the backend, manipulating caching behavior, or exploiting vulnerabilities in backend applications that rely on specific header values.
    *   **Impact:** Backend application compromise, cache poisoning, unauthorized access to resources, information disclosure.
    *   **Affected Pingora Component:** `Request Forwarding` (specifically the header processing and forwarding logic).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize and validate all incoming headers before forwarding them to backend servers.
        *   Implement strict header filtering rules within Pingora's configuration to remove or modify potentially dangerous headers.

*   **Threat:** Large Request/Header Denial of Service
    *   **Description:** An attacker sends excessively large HTTP requests or headers to Pingora, overwhelming its resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth). This can lead to a denial of service, making the application unavailable to legitimate users.
    *   **Impact:** Service disruption, application unavailability.
    *   **Affected Pingora Component:** `Request Handling`, `Connection Management`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure limits for maximum request size and header size within Pingora.
        *   Implement rate limiting to restrict the number of requests from a single IP address or client.
        *   Utilize connection limiting to prevent a single attacker from opening too many connections.

*   **Threat:** Routing Misconfiguration Leading to Unauthorized Access
    *   **Description:** Incorrectly configured routing rules within Pingora can lead to requests being routed to unintended backend services or resources. This could expose internal APIs or sensitive data that should not be publicly accessible.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to internal resources, data breaches, potential for further exploitation of internal systems.
    *   **Affected Pingora Component:** `Routing Module`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement a rigorous review process for all routing configurations.
        *   Use the principle of least privilege when defining routing rules, only allowing access to necessary resources.
        *   Regularly audit routing configurations for potential errors or misconfigurations.
        *   Utilize Pingora's testing or validation features for routing configurations before deployment.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Configuration Loading/Parsing
    *   **Description:** Flaws in how Pingora loads or parses its configuration files (e.g., YAML, JSON) could be exploited to inject malicious configurations or cause unexpected behavior.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for arbitrary code execution if malicious configurations can be injected, service disruption due to parsing errors.
    *   **Affected Pingora Component:** `Configuration Loader`, `Configuration Parser`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure configuration files are stored securely and access is restricted.
        *   Regularly update Pingora to benefit from any fixes to configuration parsing logic.
        *   Use secure configuration file formats and avoid including executable code within configuration files.

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data
    *   **Description:** If Pingora's configuration files contain sensitive information (e.g., API keys, database credentials), unauthorized access to these files could lead to significant security breaches.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, compromise of backend systems, unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
    *   **Affected Pingora Component:** `Configuration Storage`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store sensitive configuration data securely, ideally using secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
        *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in plain text configuration files.
        *   Restrict access to configuration files to authorized personnel and processes only.
