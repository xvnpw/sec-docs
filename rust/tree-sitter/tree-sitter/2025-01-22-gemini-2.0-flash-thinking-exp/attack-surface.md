# Attack Surface Analysis for tree-sitter/tree-sitter

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Malicious Input Code](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_malicious_input_code.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides specially crafted code input to the application that, when parsed by tree-sitter, causes excessive consumption of computational resources (CPU, memory), leading to application slowdown or complete unavailability.

*   **How tree-sitter contributes:** Tree-sitter's parsing process, especially when dealing with complex grammars or unoptimized parsing logic, can be vulnerable to inputs that trigger exponential time or space complexity. Maliciously crafted code can exploit these inefficiencies within the parser itself.

*   **Example:**  Submitting code with extremely deeply nested structures (e.g., deeply nested parentheses, brackets, or control flow statements) that triggers a pathological worst-case scenario in the parsing algorithm, causing the parser to become unresponsive and consume excessive resources.

*   **Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive or crashes, leading to service disruption and denial of service for legitimate users. Server resources may be exhausted, potentially affecting other services on the same infrastructure.

*   **Risk Severity:** Critical

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Parsing Timeouts:** Implement strict timeouts for the tree-sitter parsing process. If parsing exceeds the timeout, terminate the process and return an error, preventing resource exhaustion.
    *   **Resource Limits:**  Utilize operating system-level resource limits (e.g., cgroups, process limits) to restrict the CPU and memory consumption of the parsing process initiated by tree-sitter.
    *   **Grammar Performance Optimization:**  Carefully review and optimize the grammar used by tree-sitter, focusing on identifying and mitigating potential sources of exponential parsing complexity. Employ grammar analysis tools and performance testing.
    *   **Input Complexity Analysis:**  Implement mechanisms to analyze the complexity of the input code *before* parsing. Reject inputs that exceed predefined complexity thresholds to prevent potentially malicious inputs from reaching the parser.
    *   **Fuzzing and Performance Testing:**  Employ fuzzing techniques and performance benchmarks specifically targeting tree-sitter parsing with a wide range of inputs, including those designed to trigger DoS conditions, to identify and address performance vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Parser Crashes due to Malicious Input Code](./attack_surfaces/parser_crashes_due_to_malicious_input_code.md)

*   **Description:**  Specifically crafted input code triggers a bug, memory corruption, or unexpected state within the tree-sitter parser implementation itself, leading to a crash or fatal error in the application.

*   **How tree-sitter contributes:**  Tree-sitter, being implemented in C and Rust, can be susceptible to implementation bugs in its core parsing logic or in the generated parser code from grammars. Malicious input can be designed to exploit these vulnerabilities in the parser engine.

*   **Example:** Input code that triggers a buffer overflow in the C portion of tree-sitter's core, or input that causes a null pointer dereference or use-after-free vulnerability within the parser's memory management logic. This could also be triggered by grammar bugs leading to unexpected parser states.

*   **Impact:** Application crashes, potentially leading to data loss, service disruption, and requiring restarts. Repeated crashes can be exploited for DoS. In severe cases, memory corruption vulnerabilities could potentially be leveraged for more serious attacks.

*   **Risk Severity:** Critical

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Tree-sitter Updates:**  Maintain tree-sitter library at the latest stable version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches released by the tree-sitter project. Regularly monitor security advisories related to tree-sitter.
    *   **Fuzzing and Vulnerability Scanning:**  Conduct rigorous fuzzing of tree-sitter integration with diverse and potentially malformed inputs to proactively uncover crash-inducing inputs and underlying parser vulnerabilities. Utilize static and dynamic analysis tools to scan for potential vulnerabilities in tree-sitter's code.
    *   **Robust Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling in the application to gracefully catch parser errors and prevent application-level crashes. Avoid exposing sensitive error details to users that could aid attackers.
    *   **Memory Safety Practices:**  If developing custom tree-sitter integrations or grammars, adhere to strict memory safety practices to minimize the risk of introducing memory corruption vulnerabilities. Leverage memory-safe languages and tools where possible.

## Attack Surface: [ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) Vulnerabilities in Grammars](./attack_surfaces/redos__regular_expression_denial_of_service__vulnerabilities_in_grammars.md)

*   **Description:** Tree-sitter grammars frequently utilize regular expressions for defining tokens.  Poorly constructed regular expressions can be vulnerable to ReDoS attacks, where specific input strings cause excessive backtracking and exponential CPU consumption during tokenization by tree-sitter's lexer.

*   **How tree-sitter contributes:** Grammars are the definition of how tree-sitter parses code, and vulnerable regular expressions within these grammars directly expose the application to ReDoS attacks through tree-sitter's tokenization process.

*   **Example:** A grammar includes a regular expression like `(a+)+c` which is known to be susceptible to ReDoS.  Providing an input string like "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaab" will trigger exponential backtracking in the regex engine used by tree-sitter, leading to high CPU usage and potential DoS.

*   **Impact:**  Denial of Service due to excessive CPU consumption during the tokenization phase of parsing. Application slowdown or unresponsiveness.

*   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Grammar and Regex Auditing:**  Thoroughly audit all regular expressions within tree-sitter grammars for ReDoS vulnerabilities. Utilize static analysis tools specifically designed to detect ReDoS patterns in regular expressions.
    *   **Regex Optimization and Simplification:**  Rewrite vulnerable regular expressions to be more efficient and less prone to backtracking. Consider using atomic groups, possessive quantifiers, or alternative regex patterns to avoid exponential complexity.
    *   **Regex Testing with ReDoS Payloads:**  Specifically test regular expressions in grammars with known ReDoS-inducing input patterns to verify their resilience and identify potential vulnerabilities before deployment.
    *   **Alternative Tokenization Approaches:**  Explore alternative tokenization methods that minimize reliance on complex regular expressions, or consider using regex engines with built-in ReDoS protection mechanisms or timeouts. If possible, simplify grammar token definitions to reduce regex complexity.

## Attack Surface: [Unexpected Parsing Behavior Leading to Security-Critical Logical Flaws](./attack_surfaces/unexpected_parsing_behavior_leading_to_security-critical_logical_flaws.md)

*   **Description:**  Malicious input code is parsed by tree-sitter, but due to grammar ambiguities, bugs in the grammar, or unexpected parser behavior, the resulting parse tree deviates from the intended or expected structure. If the application relies on the *correctness* of this parse tree for security-sensitive logic, it can lead to bypasses or vulnerabilities.

*   **How tree-sitter contributes:**  Tree-sitter's grammar defines the structure of the parsed code. Ambiguities or errors in the grammar, or unexpected behavior in the parser itself, can result in incorrect or misleading parse trees. If security decisions are based on these flawed parse trees, vulnerabilities can arise.

*   **Example:** An application uses tree-sitter to enforce security policies by identifying and blocking specific code patterns based on the parse tree. However, due to a grammar ambiguity or parser bug, an attacker crafts code that is parsed in a way that bypasses the intended pattern detection, even though semantically the code should have been blocked according to the security policy. This could allow malicious code to be processed.

*   **Impact:**  Bypass of security controls, potential for code injection, privilege escalation, or other logical vulnerabilities depending on the application's security logic and reliance on the parse tree. This can lead to critical security breaches if security policies are circumvented.

*   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rigorous Grammar Testing and Validation:**  Extensively test grammars with a wide range of valid and invalid inputs, including edge cases and potentially malicious code constructs, to ensure they parse code accurately and without ambiguities that could be exploited for security bypasses.
    *   **Parse Tree Schema Validation:**  Implement validation logic in the application to verify that the generated parse tree conforms to expected structures and constraints *before* using it for security-critical operations. Detect and handle unexpected parse tree structures as potential security violations.
    *   **Security Reviews of Parse Tree Usage:**  Conduct thorough security reviews of the application code that utilizes the parse tree for security decisions. Ensure that the code robustly handles unexpected parse tree structures and data, and does not make assumptions about parse tree correctness without validation.
    *   **Defense in Depth:**  Avoid relying solely on parse tree analysis for critical security decisions. Implement a defense-in-depth approach by combining parse tree analysis with other security measures, input validation techniques, and runtime security monitoring to reduce the impact of potential parsing vulnerabilities.
