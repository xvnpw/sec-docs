# Threat Model Analysis for tree-sitter/tree-sitter

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Crafted Input](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_crafted_input.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input code specifically designed to exploit parsing inefficiencies or algorithmic complexity within tree-sitter. This input, when parsed, causes excessive CPU and/or memory consumption, leading to the application becoming unresponsive or crashing, effectively denying service to legitimate users.
*   **Impact:** Application unavailability, service disruption, potential financial loss due to downtime, negative user experience.
*   **Affected Component:** Tree-sitter core parsing engine (C code).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement input size limits for code parsing.
    *   Set resource limits (CPU time, memory) for parsing processes.
    *   Employ rate limiting on parsing requests if applicable.
    *   Regularly update tree-sitter library to benefit from performance improvements and bug fixes.
    *   Consider using a separate process or sandbox for parsing untrusted input.

## Threat: [Memory Corruption/Buffer Overflow](./threats/memory_corruptionbuffer_overflow.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides specially crafted input code that triggers a bug in tree-sitter's C code, leading to memory corruption or a buffer overflow. This can potentially cause the application to crash, or in a worst-case scenario, allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server or client machine running the application.
*   **Impact:** Application crash, potential arbitrary code execution, data breach, system compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** Tree-sitter core parsing engine (C code), memory management within tree-sitter.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update tree-sitter library to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Monitor for crashes or unexpected behavior during parsing, especially with untrusted input.
    *   Consider using memory sanitizers during development and testing of applications using tree-sitter.
    *   Isolate parsing processes with sandboxing or containerization to limit the impact of potential exploits.

## Threat: [Malicious Grammar Injection/Substitution](./threats/malicious_grammar_injectionsubstitution.md)

*   **Description:** If the application allows users to provide or modify grammar files, an attacker could inject a malicious grammar. This grammar could be crafted to cause incorrect parsing, DoS, or other unexpected behaviors when parsing code. In a high severity scenario, a malicious grammar could be designed to trigger vulnerabilities in the tree-sitter parsing engine itself, or to subtly alter parsing in a way that bypasses application security logic.
*   **Impact:** Application malfunction, DoS, potential for application logic manipulation, security bypasses, potentially arbitrary code execution if grammar exploits parser bugs.
*   **Affected Component:** Grammar loading mechanism, grammar file handling, application's grammar management.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid allowing users to provide or modify grammar files if possible.
    *   If user-provided grammars are necessary, implement strict input validation and sanitization for grammar files.
    *   Use a secure and isolated environment for loading and using user-provided grammars.
    *   Implement integrity checks (e.g., checksums, signatures) for grammar files to detect unauthorized modifications.
    *   Limit the privileges of processes that load and use grammars.
