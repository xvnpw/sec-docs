## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Application Using Tree-sitter [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_application_using_tree-sitter__critical_node_.md)

*   This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at any of the sub-nodes contributes to achieving this critical objective.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Parser Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_parser_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Why Critical:** Vulnerabilities within the core Tree-sitter parser can have widespread and severe consequences. Exploiting these can lead to Denial of Service (DoS), and potentially more severe issues like Remote Code Execution (RCE) if memory corruption vulnerabilities are present (though less directly modeled in this tree, DoS can be a stepping stone).
*   **High-Risk Paths under this node:**
    *   Trigger Parser Crash / Denial of Service (DoS)
    *   Exploit Grammar to Bypass Security Checks (Application Logic)

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Trigger Parser Crash / Denial of Service (DoS) [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/3__trigger_parser_crash__denial_of_service__dos___high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Why High-Risk:**
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Parser vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, infinite loops, and memory exhaustion are possible in complex C code like Tree-sitter, and grammar complexities can contribute to DoS conditions.
    *   **Impact:** High - Denial of Service directly disrupts application availability and can be used as part of a larger attack strategy.
    *   **Effort:** Medium to Low - Crafting malformed inputs can be automated through fuzzing, reducing attacker effort.
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium to Low - Basic understanding of parser weaknesses and fuzzing techniques is sufficient.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - While crashes and resource exhaustion are detectable, pinpointing the exact malicious input and preventing future attacks requires deeper analysis.
*   **Attack Vectors within this path:**
    *   **Craft Input to Trigger Buffer Overflow [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Vector:**  Supply extremely long lines, deeply nested structures, or unusual character combinations in the input code to exceed parser buffer limits.
        *   **Impact:** Parser crash, potential memory corruption.
    *   **Craft Input to Trigger Infinite Loop/Recursion [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Vector:**  Provide input code that exploits grammar rules leading to infinite recursion or loops within the parser.
        *   **Impact:** Parser hang, resource exhaustion, DoS.
    *   **Craft Input to Exhaust Memory [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Vector:**  Generate input code that results in the creation of excessively large parse trees or intermediate data structures, consuming all available memory.
        *   **Impact:** Memory exhaustion, application crash, DoS.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Grammar to Bypass Security Checks (Application Logic) [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_grammar_to_bypass_security_checks__application_logic___high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Why High-Risk:**
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Grammars are complex, and subtle flaws or ambiguities that lead to incorrect parse tree generation are possible, especially in less mature or complex language grammars.
    *   **Impact:** High - If application security logic relies on the *correctness* of the parse tree, bypassing these checks can lead to significant security breaches, including code injection or data manipulation.
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High - Requires deep understanding of the grammar, targeted input crafting, and knowledge of the application's security logic.
    *   **Skill Level:** High - Requires expertise in grammar, parsing, and application security.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard - Incorrect parse trees might be subtle and difficult to detect without deep understanding of the language, grammar, and application logic.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   **Craft Input to Cause Incorrect Parse Tree Generation, then Exploit Application Logic:**
        *   **Vector:**  Identify grammar flaws and craft input code that, when parsed, produces a manipulated or incorrect parse tree. This manipulated tree is then designed to bypass security checks or trigger vulnerabilities in the application logic that processes the parse tree.
        *   **Impact:** Security bypass, potential for code injection, data manipulation, or other application-specific vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Exploit API Integration Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/5__exploit_api_integration_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Why Critical:** Even if Tree-sitter itself is robust, vulnerabilities in how the application integrates with and uses the Tree-sitter API are common and often easier to exploit. Incorrect API usage can introduce significant security weaknesses.
*   **High-Risk Paths under this node:**
    *   Incorrect API Usage in Application
    *   Outdated Tree-sitter Library

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Incorrect API Usage in Application [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/6__incorrect_api_usage_in_application__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Why High-Risk:**
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Common programming errors, especially in rapid development or when developers are not fully aware of security implications of API usage.
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High - Impacts range from application crashes and information disclosure to more severe vulnerabilities depending on the specific misuse.
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium - Exploiting API misuse can be relatively easy if vulnerabilities are present in error handling or data processing.
    *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium - Basic understanding of programming errors and API usage is often sufficient.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard -  Depends on the type of misuse. Some issues like unhandled exceptions are easier to detect, while vulnerabilities in application logic processing parse trees can be harder to find.
*   **Attack Vectors within this path:**
    *   **Mishandle Parser Errors [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Fail to Catch Parser Exceptions [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Vector:** Trigger parsing errors (e.g., with malformed input) and exploit the application's failure to handle exceptions thrown by the Tree-sitter API.
            *   **Impact:** Application crash, DoS, potential information leakage in error messages.
    *   **Improper Handling of Parse Tree Data [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Expose Sensitive Information from Parse Tree [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Vector:**  Inject sensitive data (API keys, credentials, etc.) into the input code (e.g., in comments or string literals) and exploit the application's failure to sanitize or filter the parse tree before exposing it.
            *   **Impact:** Information disclosure of sensitive data.
        *   **Vulnerabilities in Application Logic Processing Parse Tree [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Vector:** Craft malicious input code that, when parsed, results in a parse tree that triggers bugs or vulnerabilities in the application's code that processes the parse tree.
            *   **Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability in application logic (RCE, data manipulation, etc.).

## Attack Tree Path: [7. Outdated Tree-sitter Library [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/7__outdated_tree-sitter_library__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Why High-Risk:**
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium -  A common issue in software projects, especially those with poor dependency management or infrequent updates.
    *   **Impact:** High - Using outdated libraries exposes the application to all known vulnerabilities present in that version, which can range from DoS to RCE.
    *   **Effort:** Very Low - Exploiting known vulnerabilities in outdated libraries is often trivial, with readily available exploits.
    *   **Skill Level:** Low - Requires minimal skill to exploit known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy - Vulnerability scanners can easily detect outdated libraries with known vulnerabilities.
*   **Attack Vectors within this path:**
    *   **Use Vulnerable Tree-sitter Version [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Fail to Update Tree-sitter Library [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Vector:**  Application uses an outdated version of Tree-sitter containing known security vulnerabilities.
            *   **Impact:**  Inherits all vulnerabilities of the outdated Tree-sitter version (DoS, RCE, etc.).
        *   **Lack of Vulnerability Scanning [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Vector:**  Application development process lacks vulnerability scanning, leading to unknowingly using vulnerable outdated versions of Tree-sitter.
            *   **Impact:** Indirectly leads to using vulnerable libraries and inheriting their impacts.
