# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for tree-sitter/tree-sitter

## Mitigation Strategy: [Grammar Vetting and Sandboxing (Tree-Sitter Focused)](./mitigation_strategies/grammar_vetting_and_sandboxing__tree-sitter_focused_.md)

Description: This strategy focuses on ensuring the safety and reliability of the `tree-sitter` grammars *themselves*.

1.  **Source Control and Review:** All grammars are stored in a dedicated Git repository. Changes require a pull request and review by at least two developers. The review focuses on correctness, performance (especially recursion), and potential security issues *within the grammar definition*.
2.  **Static Analysis (Grammar-Specific):** A custom script analyzes the grammar for:
    *   **Deep Recursion:** Checks for rules that could lead to excessive recursion, setting a maximum depth.
    *   **Ambiguous Rules:** Uses heuristics to identify potentially ambiguous rules (overlapping patterns).
    *   **External Code Calls:** Flags any grammar rules attempting to call external functions (if the grammar language/binding allows this â€“ this is a high-risk area).
3.  **Runtime Resource Limits (Tree-Sitter API):** The application uses a wrapper around `tree-sitter`'s parsing functions to:
    *   Set a CPU time limit (e.g., 1 second) using the appropriate API for the language binding (e.g., `resource.setrlimit` in Python for C bindings, Node.js process limits).
    *   Set a memory limit (e.g., 100MB) similarly.
    *   Catch `tree-sitter` exceptions and resource limit exceptions, logging details and returning a safe error.
4.  **WebAssembly Compilation (Tree-Sitter Feature):** Grammars are compiled to WebAssembly (Wasm) using `tree-sitter compile --wasm`.  The Wasm module is loaded and executed within a Wasm runtime (e.g., `wasmtime`), configured with strict memory limits and *no* host system access. This leverages `tree-sitter`'s Wasm support for sandboxing.
5. **Grammar Provenance:** Each grammar file includes metadata (header comment) with its source, author, version, and a SHA-256 hash. This hash is checked *before* loading the grammar into `tree-sitter`.

Threats Mitigated:

*   **Malicious Grammars:** (Severity: High) - Prevents execution of intentionally malicious grammars that could cause DoS, crashes, or (potentially, depending on the binding) code execution *through the grammar itself*.
*   **Erroneous Grammars:** (Severity: Medium) - Reduces the risk of grammars with unintentional errors leading to incorrect parsing or performance issues *within tree-sitter*.
*   **Untrusted Grammar Sources:** (Severity: High) - Ensures only grammars from known and trusted sources are used *by tree-sitter*.

Impact:

*   **Malicious Grammars:** Risk significantly reduced. Static analysis, resource limits, and Wasm sandboxing (using `tree-sitter`'s features) make it very difficult for a malicious grammar to cause harm *through tree-sitter*.
*   **Erroneous Grammars:** Risk reduced. Static analysis catches common errors, and resource limits prevent runaway parsing *within tree-sitter*.
*   **Untrusted Grammar Sources:** Risk eliminated if only grammars from the curated repository are allowed and their hashes are verified.

Currently Implemented:

*   Source Control and Review: Implemented in the project's Git repository.
*   Runtime Resource Limits: Implemented in `parser_wrapper.py` (example module).
*   Grammar Provenance: Implemented; grammar files include metadata.

Missing Implementation:

*   Static Analysis: The static analysis script (`grammar_analyzer.py`) is partially implemented (missing ambiguous rule detection).
*   WebAssembly Compilation: The Wasm compilation step (using `tree-sitter compile --wasm`) is not yet integrated into the build process.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Parser Update and Fuzzing (Tree-Sitter Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/parser_update_and_fuzzing__tree-sitter_specific_.md)

Description: This strategy focuses on mitigating vulnerabilities *within the `tree-sitter` parser library itself*.

1.  **Automated Updates:** A dependency management system (e.g., `npm`, `pip`) tracks the `tree-sitter` library and checks for updates automatically.
2.  **Manual Review:** Before updating `tree-sitter`, developers review release notes and the changelog for security fixes or potential breaking changes *related to the parser*.
3.  **Fuzz Testing (Tree-Sitter Input):** A fuzzing harness is integrated into the CI/CD pipeline. This harness uses a grammar-aware fuzzer (or a custom mutator with `libFuzzer`) to generate a large number of input files *specifically for testing the tree-sitter parser*. These files are passed to `tree-sitter` to test for crashes, memory errors, and unexpected behavior *within the parser*.
4.  **Crash Reporting (Tree-Sitter Crashes):** If the fuzzer detects a crash *in tree-sitter*, it generates a report with the crashing input, stack trace, and other relevant information, sending it to the development team.
5. **Regular Fuzzing Runs:** Beyond CI/CD, dedicated fuzzing runs are performed periodically (e.g., weekly) with a larger corpus and longer run times, *specifically targeting tree-sitter*.

Threats Mitigated:

*   **Parser Bugs (Crashes):** (Severity: Medium) - Reduces crashes caused by bugs *in the `tree-sitter` parser*.
*   **Parser Bugs (Memory Corruption):** (Severity: High) - Reduces memory corruption vulnerabilities *within `tree-sitter`*.
*   **Parser Bugs (Logic Errors):** (Severity: Medium) - Reduces incorrect parsing due to bugs *in the `tree-sitter` parser*.

Impact:

*   **Parser Bugs (All Types):** Risk significantly reduced. Fuzzing is highly effective for finding parser bugs. Updates patch known vulnerabilities.

Currently Implemented:

*   Automated Updates: Implemented using the project's dependency manager.
*   Manual Review: Implemented as part of the development workflow.

Missing Implementation:

*   Fuzz Testing Integration: The fuzzing harness is not yet integrated into the CI/CD pipeline. Fuzzing is manual and infrequent.
*   Crash Reporting: Automated crash reporting (for `tree-sitter` crashes) is not implemented.
*   Regular Fuzzing Runs: Scheduled, long-duration fuzzing runs are not in place.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Limits and Timeouts (Applied to Tree-Sitter)](./mitigation_strategies/input_limits_and_timeouts__applied_to_tree-sitter_.md)

Description: This strategy limits the impact of malicious or large inputs *on the `tree-sitter` parsing process*.

1.  **Input Size Limit:** The application enforces a maximum input file size (e.g., 1MB) *before* passing input to `tree-sitter`.
2.  **Timeout Mechanism (Tree-Sitter API):** A timeout (e.g., 5 seconds) is set for the *entire `tree-sitter` parsing operation*. If parsing exceeds the timeout, it's aborted, and an error is returned. This uses the timeout mechanisms provided by the language binding or OS (e.g., signals, thread termination).
3. **Asynchronous Parsing (Tree-sitter in Background):** `Tree-sitter` parsing is performed in a separate thread (or process, depending on the application and language) to prevent blocking the main application thread.

Threats Mitigated:

*   **Denial of Service (DoS) on Tree-Sitter:** (Severity: High) - Limits the impact of large or complex inputs that could cause `tree-sitter` to consume excessive resources.
*   **Slow Parsing (within Tree-Sitter):** (Severity: Low) - Improves user experience by preventing long `tree-sitter` parsing times from blocking the application.

Impact:

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Risk significantly reduced. The size limit and timeout (specifically applied to `tree-sitter`) prevent common DoS attacks targeting the parser.
*   **Slow Parsing:** User experience improved. The application remains responsive.

Currently Implemented:

*   Input Size Limit: Implemented in the `input_handler.py` module (example).
*   Timeout Mechanism: Implemented in the `parser_wrapper.py` module (example).
*   Asynchronous Parsing: Implemented using the language's threading or process management capabilities.

Missing Implementation:

*   None. All components of this strategy are considered implemented in this example, although continuous monitoring and adjustment of the limits may be needed.
