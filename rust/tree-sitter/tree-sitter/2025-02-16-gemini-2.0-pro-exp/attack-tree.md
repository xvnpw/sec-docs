## Attack Tree Path: [1. Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./attack_tree_paths/1__remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

*   **1.1 Exploit Parser Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]**

    *   **1.1.1 Craft Malicious Input to Trigger Buffer Overflow in Parser [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker crafts a malicious input that exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in the generated parser code (C/C++/Rust). This typically involves providing input that exceeds the allocated size of a buffer, allowing the attacker to overwrite adjacent memory regions.
        *   **Steps:**
            1.  **1.1.1.1 Identify Vulnerable Grammar (Specific Language):** The attacker analyzes the Tree-sitter grammar for the target language to identify rules that might be susceptible to buffer overflows. This often involves looking for rules that handle strings or other data structures without proper length checks.
            2.  **1.1.1.2 Analyze Parser Generation Code (C/C++/Rust) for Weaknesses:** The attacker examines the generated parser code (which is typically C, C++, or Rust) to confirm the presence of a buffer overflow vulnerability and understand how it can be triggered. This may involve reverse engineering or static analysis.
            3.  **1.1.1.3 Craft Input Exceeding Buffer Limits:** The attacker creates a specially crafted input string that exceeds the size of the vulnerable buffer. The input is designed to overwrite specific memory locations.
            4.  **1.1.1.4 Overwrite Return Address / Function Pointers:** The attacker carefully crafts the overflowing data to overwrite the return address on the stack or a function pointer. This allows them to redirect program execution to a location of their choosing, typically shellcode that they have injected into the process's memory.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** Medium to High
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

    *   **1.2 Exploit Bindings Vulnerabilities (Language Specific)**
        *   **1.2.1.2 Injection into Native Code Calls (FFI) [CRITICAL] (JavaScript Bindings Example)**
            *   **Description:** The attacker exploits a vulnerability in the language bindings (e.g., Node.js bindings) that allows them to inject malicious code into the calls made to the native Tree-sitter library (via Foreign Function Interface - FFI). This bypasses the security mechanisms of the higher-level language.
            *   **Steps:**
                1.  Identify a vulnerability in how the JavaScript bindings handle input passed to the native Tree-sitter library. This might involve improper sanitization or validation of data before it's passed to the C/C++ code.
                2.  Craft a malicious input that, when processed by the bindings, injects code or manipulates arguments passed to the native functions.
                3.  Trigger the vulnerable code path in the bindings by providing the crafted input to the application.
                4.  The injected code executes within the context of the native Tree-sitter library, potentially giving the attacker full control over the process.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low
            *   **Impact:** Very High
            *   **Effort:** High
            *   **Skill Level:** Expert
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

        *   **1.2.3.1 Exploit unsafe code blocks in the binding. [CRITICAL] (Rust Bindings Example)**
            *   **Description:** The attacker exploits a vulnerability within the `unsafe` code blocks of the Rust bindings for Tree-sitter. `unsafe` code in Rust bypasses the compiler's safety checks, making it a potential source of memory safety vulnerabilities.
            *   **Steps:**
                1.  Identify `unsafe` code blocks within the Rust bindings that interact with the Tree-sitter C API or handle user-provided input.
                2.  Analyze the `unsafe` code for potential memory safety issues, such as buffer overflows, use-after-frees, or type confusions.
                3.  Craft a malicious input that triggers the vulnerability within the `unsafe` code.
                4.  Exploit the vulnerability to achieve arbitrary code execution, similar to a traditional buffer overflow or use-after-free exploit.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low
            *   **Impact:** Very High
            *   **Effort:** High
            *   **Skill Level:** Expert
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/2__denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **2.1 Craft Malicious Input to Cause Excessive Resource Consumption [HIGH RISK]**

    *   **2.1.1 Deeply Nested Structures (Stack Overflow) [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker provides input with excessively nested structures (e.g., deeply nested parentheses, brackets, or other recursive grammar elements) to cause a stack overflow in the parser. This crashes the application or makes it unresponsive.
        *   **Steps:**
            1.  **2.1.1.1 Identify Grammar Allowing Deep Nesting:** The attacker examines the Tree-sitter grammar to find rules that allow for recursive nesting.
            2.  **2.1.1.2 Craft Input with Excessive Nesting Depth:** The attacker creates input with a very large number of nested elements, exceeding the stack size limit of the parser.
        *   **Likelihood:** High
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High
        *   **Effort:** Very Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy

    *   **2.1.3 Highly Ambiguous Grammars [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker exploits ambiguities in the grammar to cause the parser to explore a very large number of possible parse trees, leading to excessive CPU consumption and potentially a denial of service.
        *   **Steps:**
            1.  **2.1.3.1 Identify Ambiguous Grammar Rules:** The attacker analyzes the Tree-sitter grammar to find rules that are ambiguous, meaning that a single input string can be parsed in multiple ways.
            2.  **2.1.3.2 Craft Input Triggering Exponential Parsing Time:** The attacker crafts input that triggers the ambiguous rules in a way that causes the parser to explore an exponentially large number of possible parse trees. This can lead to very long parsing times and potentially exhaust system resources.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
