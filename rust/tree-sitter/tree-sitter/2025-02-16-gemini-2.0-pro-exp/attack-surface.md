# Attack Surface Analysis for tree-sitter/tree-sitter

## Attack Surface: [1. Resource Exhaustion (DoS) via Tree-Sitter Parsing](./attack_surfaces/1__resource_exhaustion__dos__via_tree-sitter_parsing.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides crafted input designed to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory) *during the Tree-sitter parsing process*, leading to denial of service.
    *   **Tree-Sitter Contribution:** `tree-sitter`'s parsing algorithm, especially with complex or poorly designed grammars, is directly responsible for resource consumption.  The incremental parsing feature, while efficient, adds complexity and potential state-related vulnerabilities that can be exploited for DoS.
    *   **Example:**  Input with deeply nested structures causing excessive memory allocation, or ambiguous grammar rules leading to extensive backtracking and high CPU usage.  A series of small, crafted edits in incremental parsing could corrupt the parser's state, leading to a crash or hang.
    *   **Impact:** Application unavailability, potential system instability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Resource Limits:** Enforce strict limits on memory and CPU time for the parsing process (using OS features or language-specific mechanisms).
        *   **Timeouts:** Implement timeouts on parsing operations.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Run the parsing process in an isolated environment.
        *   **Fuzz Testing:** Extensively fuzz test the grammar and (ideally) the `tree-sitter` runtime with resource-intensive inputs.
        *   **Grammar Optimization:** Review and optimize the grammar to minimize ambiguity and reduce potential for exponential behavior.
        *   **Incremental Parsing Safeguards:** For incremental parsing, consider periodic full re-parses and implement checks for inconsistent parser states.

## Attack Surface: [2. Tree-Sitter Core Vulnerabilities (Exploitable Bugs)](./attack_surfaces/2__tree-sitter_core_vulnerabilities__exploitable_bugs_.md)

*   **Description:** Bugs in the `tree-sitter` library itself (parser generator or runtime) are directly exploited by an attacker.
    *   **Tree-Sitter Contribution:** This is a direct vulnerability in the `tree-sitter` codebase.
    *   **Example:** A buffer overflow in the `tree-sitter` runtime library triggered by a specially crafted input, leading to potential code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for code execution, denial of service, or other undefined behavior.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Updated:** Regularly update `tree-sitter` to the latest stable version.
        *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Monitor the `tree-sitter` project for security advisories.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use vulnerability scanners to identify known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Fuzzing the Runtime (Advanced):** Fuzz the `tree-sitter` runtime library itself.

## Attack Surface: [3. Untrusted Grammar Loading](./attack_surfaces/3__untrusted_grammar_loading.md)

    * **Description:** The application loads Tree-sitter grammars from untrusted sources, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code into the parser generation or runtime.
    * **Tree-sitter Contribution:** Tree-sitter compiles grammars into parsers. A malicious grammar can contain code that exploits vulnerabilities in the Tree-sitter compiler or runtime *directly*.
    * **Example:** An attacker uploads a crafted grammar file that, when compiled by Tree-sitter, triggers a buffer overflow or executes arbitrary code.
    * **Impact:** Code execution, system compromise, denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Avoid Untrusted Grammars:** Do not load grammars from untrusted sources.
        * **Sandboxing:** Compile and load grammars in a strictly sandboxed environment.
        * **Grammar Validation:** Perform static analysis on grammars before compiling.
        * **Digital Signatures:** Use digital signatures to verify grammar integrity and authenticity.
        * **Input Sanitization (of Grammar):** Treat the grammar itself as untrusted input; sanitize and validate it.
