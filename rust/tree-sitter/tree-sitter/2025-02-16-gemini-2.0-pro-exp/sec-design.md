# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Maintainability: Tree-sitter aims to be a core library used in many different applications, so maintainability and stability are crucial.
*   Performance: As a parser generator used in text editors and IDEs, parsing speed and efficiency are paramount.
*   Accuracy: The generated parsers must correctly parse code according to the defined grammars, minimizing errors and inconsistencies.
*   Extensibility: The ability to easily create and maintain grammars for new languages and update existing ones is a key goal.
*   Community Adoption: Wide adoption by developers and integration into popular tools increases the project's impact and sustainability.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Inaccurate Parsing: Incorrectly parsed code can lead to security vulnerabilities in tools that rely on Tree-sitter, such as code analysis tools, linters, and syntax highlighters.
*   Performance Bottlenecks: Slow parsing can negatively impact the user experience of applications using Tree-sitter, making them feel sluggish.
*   Lack of Adoption: If Tree-sitter fails to gain traction within the developer community, its long-term viability and maintenance could be at risk.
*   Security Vulnerabilities in Parsers: Flaws in generated parsers could be exploited, potentially leading to vulnerabilities in applications that use them.
*   Supply Chain Attacks: Compromise of the Tree-sitter library or its dependencies could introduce vulnerabilities into numerous downstream projects.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Fuzzing: The project uses fuzzing (OSS-Fuzz) to test the robustness of the parser against unexpected inputs. (Mentioned in the README and repository structure).
*   security control: Code Reviews: Pull requests are used for code changes, implying a code review process. (Standard GitHub practice).
*   security control: Static Analysis: Some C code analysis is likely performed, although not explicitly stated.
*   security control: Tests: Unit tests are present to verify the functionality of the parser.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Complexity of Parsing: Parsing is inherently complex, and while fuzzing helps, there's an accepted risk of undiscovered edge cases that could lead to crashes or incorrect parsing.
*   accepted risk: Reliance on Third-Party Libraries: Tree-sitter has dependencies, and vulnerabilities in those dependencies could affect Tree-sitter.
*   accepted risk: Grammar Errors: The correctness of the parsing heavily relies on the accuracy of the language grammars, which are often community-contributed. Errors in grammars can lead to parsing issues.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Regular Security Audits: Conduct periodic security audits of the codebase and generated parsers.
*   security control: Dependency Management: Implement a robust dependency management system to track and update dependencies, mitigating supply chain risks. Use tools like Dependabot.
*   security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Integrate SAST tools into the build process to automatically identify potential vulnerabilities in the C and JavaScript code.
*   security control: Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST): While fuzzing is a form of DAST, consider additional DAST tools that can analyze the behavior of the parser at runtime.
*   security control: Signed Releases: Digitally sign releases to ensure the integrity of distributed binaries.
*   security control: Security.md: Create a SECURITY.md file in the repository to provide clear instructions on how to report security vulnerabilities.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication: Not directly applicable to the core Tree-sitter library, as it's a parser generator. However, any web-based components or tools built around Tree-sitter (e.g., online grammar playgrounds) should implement secure authentication mechanisms.
*   Authorization: Not directly applicable to the core library. However, if Tree-sitter is integrated into systems with authorization requirements, the integration should respect those requirements.
*   Input Validation: Crucial for security. The parser must handle invalid or malicious input gracefully, without crashing or leading to vulnerabilities. Fuzzing is a key component of this. Grammars should be designed to be as restrictive as possible, minimizing the attack surface.
*   Cryptography: Not directly used in the core parsing functionality. However, if Tree-sitter is used to parse or generate code that includes cryptographic operations, it should not interfere with the correct implementation of those operations. Any web components should use HTTPS.
*   Error Handling: The parser should handle errors gracefully, providing informative error messages without revealing sensitive information.

    GitHub[("GitHub Repository")]
    GitHubActions[("GitHub Actions\n(CI/CD)")]
    Tests[("Tests\n(Unit, Fuzzing)")]

    GitHub -- Triggers --> GitHubActions
    GitHubActions -- Runs --> Tests
    GitHubActions -- Runs --> Linters
    GitHubActions -- Runs --> SAST
    GitHubActions -- Produces --> BuildArtifacts

```

Build Process Description:

1.  **Code Commit:** A developer commits code changes to the GitHub repository.
2.  **GitHub Actions Trigger:** The commit triggers a GitHub Actions workflow.
3.  **Linting:** Linters (e.g., for C and JavaScript) are run to check for code style and potential errors.
4.  **Static Analysis (SAST):** SAST tools are run to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code.
5.  **Testing:** Unit tests and fuzzing tests are executed to verify the functionality and robustness of the parser.
6.  **Build:** If all tests and checks pass, the build process compiles the C code and generates the WebAssembly module.
7.  **Artifact Creation:** The build process produces build artifacts, including the compiled C library and the WebAssembly module.
8.  **Release (Optional):** If the workflow is configured for a release, the build artifacts are packaged and published (e.g., to GitHub Releases or npm).

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   security control: GitHub Actions: Provides a secure and automated build environment.
*   security control: Linters: Enforce coding standards and help prevent common errors.
*   security control: SAST Tools: Automatically identify potential security vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Tests (Unit and Fuzzing): Verify the correctness and robustness of the code.
*   security control: Dependency Management (not shown in diagram, but crucial): Regularly scan and update dependencies to mitigate supply chain risks.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes to Protect:

*   **Code Parsing:** The core functionality of Tree-sitter must be reliable and secure.
*   **Grammar Management:** The process of creating, updating, and distributing language grammars needs to be protected from malicious modifications.
*   **Software Distribution:** The build and release process must be secure to prevent the distribution of compromised binaries.

Data to Protect and Sensitivity:

*   **Source Code (Indirectly):** Tree-sitter itself doesn't store source code, but it processes it. The sensitivity of the source code depends on the application using Tree-sitter. If Tree-sitter is used in a security-sensitive context (e.g., a code analysis tool analyzing proprietary code), then the confidentiality of that code is indirectly a concern.
*   **Language Grammars:** These are generally public, but their integrity is crucial. Malicious modifications to grammars could lead to vulnerabilities. Sensitivity: Medium.
*   **Build Artifacts (Binaries):** The integrity of the distributed binaries is paramount. Compromised binaries could lead to widespread vulnerabilities. Sensitivity: High.
