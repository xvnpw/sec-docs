# Threat Model Analysis for tree-sitter/tree-sitter

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Infinite Loop in Parser](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_infinite_loop_in_parser.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious input that triggers an infinite loop within the Tree-sitter parser's `tree_sitter_parse` function (or a similar language-specific parsing function). This is due to a bug in the grammar's recursive rules or a flaw in the parser's handling of certain input sequences. The attacker sends this input, causing parsing to hang indefinitely.
    *   **Impact:** Application unresponsiveness, CPU resource exhaustion, and potential service outage for all users.
    *   **Affected Component:** Tree-sitter core parser (`tree_sitter_parse` or equivalent), specific grammar rules (especially recursive rules).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Timeout Mechanism:** Implement a strict timeout for the `tree_sitter_parse` function (or the overall parsing operation). Terminate parsing if the timeout is exceeded.
        *   **Resource Limits (CPU):** Run parsing in a sandboxed environment (separate process, container) with limited CPU time.
        *   **Fuzz Testing:** Extensively fuzz test the grammar and parser, focusing on inputs that might cause long parsing times or hangs.
        *   **Grammar Review:** Carefully review the grammar, especially recursive rules, for potential infinite loop vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Excessive Memory Allocation](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_excessive_memory_allocation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides input that causes the Tree-sitter parser to allocate an excessive amount of memory. This could be due to deeply nested structures, large repetitions, or a bug in the grammar leading to an unnecessarily large AST. The attacker sends this input, causing the application to run out of memory and crash.
    *   **Impact:** Application crashes due to an out-of-memory error, leading to service unavailability.
    *   **Affected Component:** Tree-sitter core parser (memory allocation routines), specific grammar rules (those handling repetition or nesting).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Size Limits:** Enforce strict limits on the size of the input processed by Tree-sitter.
        *   **Memory Limits:** Run parsing in a sandboxed environment with a strict memory limit. Terminate the process if the limit is exceeded.
        *   **Fuzz Testing:** Use fuzz testing to identify inputs that cause excessive memory consumption.
        *   **AST Size Limits:** Implement checks within the application to limit the size/complexity of the generated AST. Reject input if limits are exceeded.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Stack Overflow](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_stack_overflow.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts deeply nested input that exploits a vulnerability in the Tree-sitter parser or grammar, leading to a stack overflow. This is particularly relevant if the parser uses a recursive descent parsing strategy. The attacker sends this input, causing the application to crash.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash due to stack overflow, resulting in service unavailability.
    *   **Affected Component:** Tree-sitter core parser (stack management), specific grammar rules (deeply nested structures).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Increase Stack Size (Limited Effectiveness):** Increasing the stack size offers only limited protection; attackers can often craft input to exceed even a large stack.
        *   **Iterative Parsing (If Possible):** If feasible, refactor the grammar or use a parsing technique less reliant on recursion (e.g., iterative). This is often difficult.
        *   **Fuzz Testing:** Use fuzz testing to identify inputs that cause stack overflows.
        *   **Grammar Review:** Carefully review the grammar for deeply nested structures and potential stack overflow vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attack (Compromised Grammar)](./threats/supply_chain_attack__compromised_grammar_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises a publicly available Tree-sitter grammar (e.g., on a package repository). The compromised grammar contains malicious code executed when the grammar is loaded or used for parsing.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the application, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** The entire Tree-sitter grammar file.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Pin Grammar Version:** Pin the grammar to a specific, known-good version. Do *not* automatically update.
        *   **Code Signing (If Available):** Verify the digital signature of the grammar package.
        *   **Manual Review (If Feasible):** If the grammar is small, manually review the code for suspicious patterns.
        *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Use SCA tools to identify known vulnerabilities in the grammar and its dependencies.
