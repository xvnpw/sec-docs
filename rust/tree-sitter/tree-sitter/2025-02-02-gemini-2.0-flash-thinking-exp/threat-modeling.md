# Threat Model Analysis for tree-sitter/tree-sitter

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Parser Resource Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_parser_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input code to exploit inefficiencies in tree-sitter's parser or grammar. This input causes excessive CPU and memory consumption during parsing, leading to application slowdown or unresponsiveness. Repeated malicious inputs can amplify the DoS effect.
*   **Impact:** Application becomes unavailable or severely degraded for legitimate users, causing service disruption and potential financial loss.
*   **Affected Tree-sitter Component:** Parser Engine, Language Grammar
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement input size limits for code parsing.
    *   Set timeouts for parsing operations to prevent indefinite processing.
    *   Employ resource monitoring and rate limiting to detect and mitigate excessive parsing requests.
    *   Regularly update tree-sitter and language grammars for performance improvements and bug fixes.
    *   Consider sandboxing parsing of untrusted code.

## Threat: [Parser Crash due to Malformed Input](./threats/parser_crash_due_to_malformed_input.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides intentionally malformed or unexpected input code that triggers a bug or unhandled exception within the tree-sitter parser or grammar. This leads to parsing process crashes, potentially terminating the application or causing instability.
*   **Impact:** Application crashes, resulting in service disruption and potential data loss or corruption if crashes occur during critical operations.
*   **Affected Tree-sitter Component:** Parser Engine, Language Grammar, Error Handling mechanisms
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust error handling around parsing operations to gracefully recover from failures.
    *   Conduct thorough fuzz testing with diverse inputs to identify and fix parser crashes.
    *   Regularly update tree-sitter and language grammars to incorporate bug fixes.
    *   Implement application restart mechanisms to recover from unexpected crashes.

## Threat: [Injection Vulnerability via Parse Tree Manipulation](./threats/injection_vulnerability_via_parse_tree_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts input code that, when parsed, generates a parse tree misused by the application. If the application uses the parse tree to construct further operations (e.g., code generation, queries) without sanitization, attackers can inject malicious code or commands through crafted input.
*   **Impact:** Code injection, command injection, or other injection vulnerabilities leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, or system compromise.
*   **Affected Tree-sitter Component:** Parse Tree output, Application logic processing the parse tree
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Treat the parse tree as untrusted data.
    *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization on data extracted from the parse tree before further use.
    *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases or external systems based on parse tree data.
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege when processing parse tree data.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerability in Tree-sitter Library](./threats/dependency_vulnerability_in_tree-sitter_library.md)

*   **Description:** A security vulnerability is discovered within the `tree-sitter` library itself (e.g., memory corruption, logic flaw). Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by providing crafted input or triggering specific API calls to compromise the application.
*   **Impact:** Application compromise, potential remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service, depending on the vulnerability.
*   **Affected Tree-sitter Component:** Tree-sitter core library (various modules)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update to the latest stable version of `tree-sitter` for security patches.
    *   Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases related to `tree-sitter`.
    *   Implement dependency scanning and vulnerability management to proactively address known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attack on Tree-sitter or Grammars](./threats/supply_chain_attack_on_tree-sitter_or_grammars.md)

*   **Description:** The `tree-sitter` library or language grammars are compromised through a supply chain attack. Attackers gain access to distribution channels or repositories and inject malicious code. Users unknowingly download and use compromised components, leading to application compromise.
*   **Impact:** Application compromise, potential remote code execution, data breaches, or backdoors introduced into the application.
*   **Affected Tree-sitter Component:** Distribution channels, Repositories, Build process
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use official and trusted sources for downloading `tree-sitter` and language grammars.
    *   Implement dependency verification mechanisms (e.g., checksums, signatures) to ensure integrity.
    *   Regularly audit dependencies for unexpected changes or signs of compromise.
    *   Employ software composition analysis (SCA) tools to monitor dependencies and detect supply chain risks.

## Threat: [Misuse - Incorrect API Usage leading to Memory Corruption](./threats/misuse_-_incorrect_api_usage_leading_to_memory_corruption.md)

*   **Description:** Developers incorrectly use the tree-sitter API, particularly regarding memory management of parse trees. This can lead to memory corruption vulnerabilities like use-after-free, which can be exploited by attackers for code execution or cause application instability.
*   **Impact:** Memory corruption, application crashes, potential for remote code execution vulnerabilities.
*   **Affected Tree-sitter Component:** Tree-sitter API, Memory Management
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly understand tree-sitter API documentation and memory management best practices.
    *   Conduct code reviews to identify potential API misuse and memory management errors.
    *   Use memory safety tools and techniques (e.g., static analysis, memory sanitizers) to detect memory-related vulnerabilities.
    *   Follow secure coding practices when working with the tree-sitter API.
