# BUSINESS POSTURE

The tree-sitter project aims to provide a fast, reliable, and language-agnostic parsing library. It enables developers to create tools that can efficiently parse source code, facilitating tasks such as syntax highlighting, code completion, refactoring, and static analysis. The project's primary goal is to improve the performance and accuracy of parsing compared to traditional regular expression-based or hand-written parsers.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Provide a high-performance parsing solution.
- Support a wide range of programming languages through grammar definitions.
- Offer a stable and reliable API for integration into various tools.
- Foster a community around grammar development and parser usage.
- Enable advanced code analysis and manipulation capabilities.

Most Important Business Risks:
- Performance bottlenecks in the parsing engine impacting user experience in integrated tools.
- Inaccuracies in parsing due to grammar errors or engine limitations leading to incorrect tool behavior.
- Security vulnerabilities in the parsing engine that could be exploited by malicious code input.
- Lack of community adoption and grammar contributions hindering language support and project growth.
- Compatibility issues with different programming languages or tool environments.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Public code repository on GitHub, enabling community review and scrutiny. (Implemented: GitHub Repository)
- security control: Issue tracking system on GitHub for reporting and addressing bugs and potential vulnerabilities. (Implemented: GitHub Issues)
- security control: Standard GitHub access controls for repository contributors. (Implemented: GitHub Permissions)

Accepted Risks:
- accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for grammar quality and security.
- accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities to be discovered in the core parsing engine due to its complexity.
- accepted risk: Open source nature implies public disclosure of vulnerabilities once identified.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Implement automated static analysis security testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential code vulnerabilities.
- security control: Integrate dependency scanning to detect and manage vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by tree-sitter.
- security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing, especially focusing on parser robustness against malicious inputs.
- security control: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure and response process to handle security issues effectively.
- security control: Implement fuzz testing to automatically discover parsing errors and potential security vulnerabilities caused by unexpected or malformed inputs.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication: Not directly applicable as tree-sitter is a library and CLI tool, not a user-facing application requiring authentication.
- Authorization: Not directly applicable as tree-sitter does not manage user access or permissions.
- Input Validation: Critical. The parser must robustly handle potentially malicious or malformed input code without crashing or exhibiting unexpected behavior. Grammars should be designed to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
- Cryptography: Not directly applicable to the core parsing functionality. However, if tree-sitter is used in tools that handle sensitive data, those tools will need to implement appropriate cryptography.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- Reliable and accurate parsing of source code across supported languages.
- Stable and performant API for integration into developer tools.
- Secure and timely delivery of updates and bug fixes.
- Community contribution and maintenance of language grammars.

Data to Protect:
- Source code of tree-sitter library and CLI: Sensitivity - Publicly available, but integrity and availability are crucial.
- Language grammar definitions: Sensitivity - Publicly available, but integrity and correctness are important.
- Build artifacts and release packages: Sensitivity - Publicly available, but integrity and authenticity are critical to prevent supply chain attacks.

Data Sensitivity:
- Publicly available code and grammars, but integrity is paramount.
- Build artifacts require high integrity and authenticity to ensure users are not downloading compromised versions.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What are the specific performance requirements for parsing in different use cases (e.g., real-time syntax highlighting vs. batch static analysis)?
- Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., for handling user data in tools that integrate tree-sitter)?
- What is the expected level of security assurance required by users of tree-sitter in different contexts (e.g., open-source tools vs. commercial products)?
- What are the plans for long-term maintenance and security updates for tree-sitter?
- Are there any specific languages or grammar features that are considered high priority for security hardening?

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to provide a widely adopted, high-quality parsing library for the open-source community and commercial tool developers. Performance and accuracy are key drivers for adoption.
- SECURITY POSTURE: Security is considered important, but the project is likely operating with standard open-source security practices. There is room for improvement in proactive security measures like automated security testing and formal vulnerability management.
- DESIGN: The architecture is centered around a core C/C++ library with a CLI tool and language grammars as key components. Deployment is primarily through package registries for library distribution. The build process is assumed to be using GitHub Actions for CI.
