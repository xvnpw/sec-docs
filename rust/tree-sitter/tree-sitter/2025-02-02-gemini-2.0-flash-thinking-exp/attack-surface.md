# Attack Surface Analysis for tree-sitter/tree-sitter

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Input Code Exploiting Parser Bugs (Memory Corruption)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_input_code_exploiting_parser_bugs__memory_corruption_.md)

*   **Description:**  Crafted input code designed to trigger memory safety vulnerabilities (buffer overflows, use-after-free, etc.) within the tree-sitter generated parser.
*   **Tree-sitter Contribution:** Tree-sitter generates parsers in C/C++, languages known for memory management complexities. Bugs in the generated parser code, or in the core tree-sitter library, can lead to memory corruption when processing specific input code patterns.
*   **Example:**  An attacker provides a specially crafted JavaScript file to an application using tree-sitter for JavaScript parsing. This file contains deeply nested expressions or excessively long identifiers that trigger a buffer overflow in the JavaScript parser, overwriting adjacent memory regions.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Arbitrary Code Execution:  If the memory corruption is exploitable, an attacker could potentially inject and execute arbitrary code on the system running the application.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): Memory corruption can lead to crashes and application termination.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** to **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Tree-sitter Updates:** Keep tree-sitter library and grammar versions updated to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
    *   **Fuzzing and Security Testing:**  Employ fuzzing techniques on the parsers with diverse and potentially malicious input code to identify memory safety issues.
    *   **Memory Safety Tools:** Utilize memory safety analysis tools (e.g., AddressSanitizer, MemorySanitizer) during development and testing of tree-sitter integrations and custom grammars.
    *   **Resource Limits:** Implement resource limits (memory, parsing time) to mitigate DoS if a vulnerability leads to excessive resource consumption.
    *   **Sandboxing/Isolation:** Run the parsing process in a sandboxed environment or with reduced privileges to limit the impact of a successful exploit.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Grammar Files](./attack_surfaces/malicious_grammar_files.md)

*   **Description:** Loading and using grammar files from untrusted sources that are intentionally crafted to exploit vulnerabilities during parser generation or parsing.
*   **Tree-sitter Contribution:** Tree-sitter relies on grammar files to generate parsers. If an application loads grammars dynamically or from external sources without proper validation, it becomes vulnerable to malicious grammars.
*   **Example:** An application allows users to upload custom language grammars. An attacker uploads a malicious grammar designed to cause a buffer overflow during parser generation, leading to code execution when the application attempts to compile and use this grammar.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Arbitrary Code Execution (during parser generation or parsing).
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) (during parser generation or parsing).
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Trusted Grammar Sources Only:**  Load grammar files only from trusted and verified sources. Package grammars with the application or use official, well-maintained grammar repositories.
    *   **Grammar Validation and Sanitization:**  If dynamic grammar loading is necessary, implement rigorous validation and sanitization of grammar files before using them. This is complex and may not be fully effective.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Run the parser generation and parsing processes with minimal privileges to limit the impact of a compromise.
    *   **Static Grammar Embedding:**  Prefer embedding grammars directly into the application binary instead of loading them dynamically from external files whenever feasible.
