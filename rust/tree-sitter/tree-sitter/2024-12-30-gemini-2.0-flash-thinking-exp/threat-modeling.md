### High and Critical Tree-sitter Threats

Here's a list of high and critical threats directly involving the Tree-sitter library:

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) via Malicious Input
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a specific input string designed to exploit weaknesses in the grammar or parsing algorithm. This input causes the parser to enter an infinite loop or consume excessive resources (CPU, memory).
    *   **Impact:** The application becomes unresponsive or crashes, impacting availability for legitimate users.
    *   **Affected Component:** Parser (specifically the parsing logic and potentially grammar-specific rules).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization before passing data to Tree-sitter.
        *   Set resource limits (e.g., CPU time, memory usage) for parsing operations.
        *   Implement timeouts for parsing operations to prevent indefinite hangs.
        *   Thoroughly test with a wide range of inputs, including potentially malformed or very large inputs.

*   **Threat:** Stack Overflow due to Deeply Nested Input
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides input that leads to excessively deep recursion during the parsing process, exceeding the stack size and causing a crash.
    *   **Impact:** The application crashes.
    *   **Affected Component:** Parser (specifically the recursive descent parsing mechanism).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Review the grammar for potential sources of unbounded recursion.
        *   Consider using iterative parsing techniques where possible (though Tree-sitter is primarily recursive).
        *   Increase the stack size for the parsing thread (though this is a workaround, not a fundamental fix).
        *   Implement checks for recursion depth during parsing (if feasible within the Tree-sitter API or through custom modifications).

*   **Threat:** Exploitation of Grammar Vulnerabilities leading to Incorrect Parsing
    *   **Description:** An attacker leverages a flaw or ambiguity in the grammar definition to craft input that is parsed incorrectly, leading to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities in the application logic that relies on the parsed tree.
    *   **Impact:**  The application may misinterpret the input, leading to logical errors, security bypasses, or data corruption.
    *   **Affected Component:** Grammar definition and Parser.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully review and test the grammar definition for correctness and potential ambiguities.
        *   Use well-vetted and maintained grammars from trusted sources.
        *   Employ static analysis tools on the grammar to identify potential issues.
        *   Implement robust validation of the parsed tree before using it in application logic.

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service via Complex or Malicious Queries
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts highly complex or inefficient queries that cause Tree-sitter's query engine to consume excessive CPU resources or memory while traversing the syntax tree.
    *   **Impact:** The application becomes slow or unresponsive.
    *   **Affected Component:** Query Engine.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Limit the complexity of user-defined queries.
        *   Set timeouts for query execution.
        *   Optimize query patterns for efficiency.
        *   If allowing user-defined queries, sanitize or validate them to prevent overly complex or malicious patterns.

*   **Threat:** Supply Chain Attack on Grammar or Tree-sitter Library
    *   **Description:** The grammar files or the Tree-sitter library itself could be compromised, introducing malicious code that is then executed by the application.
    *   **Impact:** Wide range of potential impacts, including remote code execution, data theft, and denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Entire Tree-sitter library and loaded grammars.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Obtain grammars and the Tree-sitter library from trusted sources.
        *   Verify the integrity of downloaded files using checksums or digital signatures.
        *   Use dependency management tools with security scanning capabilities to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
        *   Regularly update Tree-sitter and its dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
