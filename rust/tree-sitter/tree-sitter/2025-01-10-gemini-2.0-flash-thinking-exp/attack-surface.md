# Attack Surface Analysis for tree-sitter/tree-sitter

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Input Exploiting Parser Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/malicious_input_exploiting_parser_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Crafting input code that triggers bugs or vulnerabilities within the generated parser code for a specific language grammar. This can lead to crashes, unexpected behavior, or potentially memory corruption.
*   **How Tree-sitter Contributes:** `tree-sitter` generates parsers from grammar definitions. If the generated parser has vulnerabilities (due to bugs in `tree-sitter`'s code generation logic or inherent complexities in the grammar), malicious input can trigger them.
*   **Example:**  Providing a deeply nested or malformed code structure that causes a stack overflow or buffer overflow in the generated C parser code.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) through application crashes, potential for remote code execution if memory corruption vulnerabilities are exploitable.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the exploitability of the vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep `tree-sitter` library updated to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
    *   Thoroughly test the application with a wide range of valid and invalid inputs, including fuzzing techniques.
    *   Consider using address space layout randomization (ASLR) and other memory protection mechanisms at the operating system level.
    *   Implement error handling to gracefully recover from parsing errors instead of crashing.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Grammar Definitions](./attack_surfaces/malicious_grammar_definitions.md)

*   **Description:** Using a crafted or compromised grammar definition that introduces vulnerabilities during the parser generation or parsing process.
*   **How Tree-sitter Contributes:** `tree-sitter` relies on external grammar definitions to generate parsers. If a malicious actor can influence or provide the grammar, they can introduce flaws that lead to exploitable parsers.
*   **Example:** A malicious grammar could be designed to generate a parser with inherent buffer overflows or other memory safety issues, which are then triggered by specific input.
*   **Impact:** Potential for arbitrary code execution during grammar compilation or when parsing input with the compromised grammar.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Only use trusted and well-vetted grammar sources.
    *   Implement integrity checks for grammar files to ensure they haven't been tampered with.
    *   Restrict access to grammar files and the grammar compilation process.
    *   Consider static analysis of grammar definitions for potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Language Bindings](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_language_bindings.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities within the language bindings used to interact with the `tree-sitter` library (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Rust bindings).
*   **How Tree-sitter Contributes:**  `tree-sitter` provides bindings for various languages. Bugs or vulnerabilities in these bindings can expose the underlying `tree-sitter` core to exploitation.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability in a binding might allow an attacker to pass incorrect data types or sizes to `tree-sitter` functions, leading to crashes or memory corruption.
*   **Impact:**  Potential for crashes, memory corruption, or even arbitrary code execution depending on the nature of the binding vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the `tree-sitter` library and its language bindings updated.
    *   Follow secure coding practices when using the bindings, paying close attention to data types and memory management.
    *   Review the source code of the bindings for potential vulnerabilities if possible.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Incremental Parsing Logic](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_incremental_parsing_logic.md)

*   **Description:** Crafting specific code changes that exploit vulnerabilities in the incremental parsing algorithm, leading to incorrect syntax tree updates or allowing for the injection of malicious code segments.
*   **How Tree-sitter Contributes:** `tree-sitter`'s incremental parsing feature aims for efficiency by only re-parsing changed parts of the code. Vulnerabilities in this logic could be exploited to bypass security checks that rely on a correct syntax tree.
*   **Example:**  Submitting a sequence of code edits that cause the incremental parser to incorrectly merge or ignore changes, potentially introducing malicious code that isn't properly analyzed.
*   **Impact:**  Bypassing security checks, potential for introducing vulnerabilities in the processed code.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the application's reliance on the accuracy of the syntax tree).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly test the application's behavior with incremental parsing enabled, focusing on edge cases and potential inconsistencies.
    *   Consider performing full re-parses periodically as a safeguard against potential incremental parsing errors.
    *   Keep the `tree-sitter` library updated, as improvements to the incremental parsing algorithm are made.
