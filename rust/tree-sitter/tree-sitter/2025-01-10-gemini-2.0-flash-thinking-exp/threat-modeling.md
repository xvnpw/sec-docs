# Threat Model Analysis for tree-sitter/tree-sitter

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Complex Input](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_complex_input.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted code snippet with deeply nested structures or recursive patterns. This input exploits inefficiencies in the **Tree-sitter core parser** or the **specific grammar** being used, causing excessive CPU consumption and potentially leading to a denial of service.

**Impact:** The application becomes unresponsive, impacting availability for legitimate users. Server resources may be exhausted.

**Affected Component:** Core parser (`libtree-sitter.so` or equivalent), specific grammar in use.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement input size limits for code snippets being parsed.
* Set timeouts for parsing operations to prevent indefinite processing.
* Regularly review and optimize grammars for performance and potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Infinite Loop in Parsing](./threats/infinite_loop_in_parsing.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts input that triggers a bug or edge case in the **Tree-sitter parser**, causing it to enter an infinite loop. This loop consumes CPU resources indefinitely, leading to application unresponsiveness.

**Impact:** The application becomes unresponsive, leading to a denial of service. The affected process may need to be manually terminated.

**Affected Component:** Core parser (`libtree-sitter.so` or equivalent), potentially specific grammar rules.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Update Tree-sitter to the latest version, as bug fixes are regularly released.
* Implement timeouts for parsing operations.
* Thoroughly test the application with various inputs, including potentially malicious ones, to identify such loops.

## Threat: [Stack Overflow during Parsing](./threats/stack_overflow_during_parsing.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides deeply nested code structures that exceed the **Tree-sitter parser's** stack limit. This can cause a stack overflow, leading to a crash of the parsing process.

**Impact:** Application crashes, leading to service disruption.

**Affected Component:** Core parser (`libtree-sitter.so` or equivalent), potentially related to recursive grammar rules.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement limits on the depth of nesting allowed in the input code.
* Review grammar definitions for excessive recursion that could contribute to stack overflow.

## Threat: [Exploiting Grammar Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploiting_grammar_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker identifies and exploits vulnerabilities within the **specific grammar** used by Tree-sitter. This could lead to incorrect parsing, allowing malicious code to be misinterpreted or bypass security checks that rely on the parsed output.

**Impact:** Security bypasses, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or other malicious activities depending on how the parsed output is used by the application.

**Affected Component:** Specific grammar file (`.grammar` or equivalent), parser generated from the grammar.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly review and test grammar definitions for correctness and potential vulnerabilities.
* Keep grammar definitions up-to-date with any community-identified issues.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attack on Tree-sitter Dependency](./threats/supply_chain_attack_on_tree-sitter_dependency.md)

**Description:** An attacker compromises the **Tree-sitter library itself**. This could involve injecting malicious code into the library, which is then used by the application.

**Impact:**  Complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying system, depending on the nature of the injected malicious code.

**Affected Component:** The specific Tree-sitter library files.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use trusted sources for obtaining the Tree-sitter library.
* Implement dependency scanning and vulnerability analysis tools to detect known vulnerabilities in the library.
* Verify the integrity of the downloaded library using checksums or digital signatures.
* Regularly update the Tree-sitter library to benefit from security patches.

## Threat: [Incorrect Parsing Leading to Security Bypass](./threats/incorrect_parsing_leading_to_security_bypass.md)

**Description:** Due to bugs in the **Tree-sitter library** or the **grammar**, malicious code is parsed incorrectly. This can lead to security checks or sanitization routines based on the parsed output failing to identify or neutralize the malicious code.

**Impact:** Security vulnerabilities, potentially allowing execution of malicious code, data breaches, or other unauthorized actions.

**Affected Component:** Core parser (`libtree-sitter.so` or equivalent), specific grammar in use.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly test the application's security mechanisms that rely on Tree-sitter parsing.
* Regularly update Tree-sitter and grammar definitions.
