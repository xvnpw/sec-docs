## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Parsing Logic Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_parsing_logic_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

* **Goal:** Cause the Tree-Sitter parser to behave in an unintended way due to flaws in the grammar or parsing logic.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **Cause Infinite Loop / Resource Exhaustion [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            * **Provide Malicious Input with Deeply Nested Structures:**  Craft input that exploits recursive rules or deeply nested structures in the grammar, causing the parser to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory) and potentially hang.
            * **Provide Input Triggering Exponential Parsing Time:**  Design input that leads to a combinatorial explosion in the number of parsing steps, resulting in very slow parsing and potential denial of service.
        * **Trigger Assertion Failures / Crashes [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            * **Provide Input Violating Grammar Assumptions:** Supply input that violates the expected syntax or structure defined by the grammar, causing the parser to enter an error state and potentially crash due to unhandled exceptions or assertions.
            * **Provide Input Leading to Unexpected Internal State:**  Craft input that pushes the parser into an unforeseen internal state, leading to unpredictable behavior or crashes.
        * **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Bypass Security Checks Relying on Parsing [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            * **Craft Input Misinterpreted by Tree-Sitter:**  Develop input that Tree-Sitter parses in a way that differs from the application's intended interpretation, allowing malicious input to bypass security checks that rely on the parsing output.
            * **Exploit Differences Between Tree-Sitter's Interpretation and Application's Expectation:** Identify subtle differences in how Tree-Sitter interprets certain input constructs compared to how the application expects them to be interpreted, and leverage these differences to bypass security measures.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Generated Parser Vulnerabilities (C Code) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_generated_parser_vulnerabilities__c_code___critical_node_.md)

* **Goal:** Exploit memory safety or other vulnerabilities in the C code generated by Tree-Sitter.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **Trigger Memory Corruption [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            * **Overflow Buffers in Generated Parser:** Provide input that exceeds the allocated buffer size in the generated C code, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially allowing the attacker to overwrite adjacent memory regions for code execution.
            * **Use-After-Free in Generated Parser:** Craft input that causes the generated parser to access memory that has already been freed, leading to unpredictable behavior or crashes, and potentially enabling code execution.
            * **Double-Free in Generated Parser:** Provide input that triggers the deallocation of the same memory region multiple times, leading to memory corruption and potential code execution.
        * **Code Injection (Less Likely, but Possible) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            * **Provide Input Interpreted as Executable Code by Vulnerable Grammar (Highly Context-Dependent):** In very specific and likely flawed grammar designs, it might be possible to craft input that is interpreted as executable code by the generated parser, leading to direct code injection.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Tree-Sitter Library Itself [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_tree-sitter_library_itself__critical_node_.md)

* **Goal:** Exploit inherent vulnerabilities within the core Tree-Sitter library code.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **Discover and Exploit Bugs in Core Tree-Sitter Algorithms [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            * **Analyze Tree-Sitter Source Code for Vulnerabilities:**  Manually examine the Tree-Sitter source code to identify potential bugs, logic errors, or security flaws in its core algorithms.
            * **Fuzz Tree-Sitter Library with Various Inputs:**  Use automated fuzzing tools to feed a large volume of various inputs to the Tree-Sitter library to identify crashes, memory errors, or other unexpected behaviors that could indicate vulnerabilities.
        * **Exploit Dependencies of Tree-Sitter [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            * **Identify and Exploit Vulnerabilities in Libraries Used by Tree-Sitter (e.g., memory allocators):** Identify and exploit known vulnerabilities in the external libraries that Tree-Sitter depends on (e.g., memory allocators), which could indirectly compromise the application using Tree-Sitter.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Abuse Application's Integration with Tree-Sitter](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__abuse_application's_integration_with_tree-sitter.md)

* **Goal:** Exploit vulnerabilities arising from how the application integrates and uses the Tree-Sitter library.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Leak Sensitive Information [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            * **Application Exposes Raw Parse Tree Containing Sensitive Data:** The application might inadvertently expose the raw parse tree generated by Tree-Sitter, which could contain sensitive information present in the parsed input.
            * **Application Logs Debug Information Including Parsed Input:**  The application might log debug information that includes the raw or partially processed input parsed by Tree-Sitter, potentially exposing sensitive data.
        * **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Denial of Service through Resource Exhaustion [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            * **Send Extremely Large or Complex Input to Overload Parser:**  Send exceptionally large or deeply nested input to the application, causing Tree-Sitter to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory) and potentially leading to a denial of service.
            * **Trigger Repeated Parsing Operations with Malicious Input:**  Repeatedly send malicious input to the application that triggers resource-intensive parsing operations, leading to resource exhaustion and denial of service.
        * **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Introduce Unexpected Application Behavior [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            * **Craft Input Leading to Incorrect Program Logic Based on Parsed Output:**  Design input that, when parsed by Tree-Sitter, results in an output that causes the application's subsequent logic to execute in an unintended or harmful way.
            * **Manipulate Application State through Side Effects of Parsing:** Exploit side effects of the parsing process or the parsed output to manipulate the application's internal state in a way that leads to unauthorized actions or unexpected behavior.
