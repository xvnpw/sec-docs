# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for tree-sitter/tree-sitter

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation.md)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Identify all points in the application where user-provided code or code snippets are passed to `tree-sitter` for parsing.
*   Step 2: Define strict input format requirements for each identified input point, focusing on aspects relevant to `tree-sitter` parsing (e.g., allowed character sets, maximum input size, basic syntax expectations).
*   Step 3: Implement validation logic *before* passing the input to `tree-sitter`. This validation should check if the input conforms to the defined format requirements.
*   Step 4: If the input fails validation, reject it and handle the error appropriately.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Injection Attacks (e.g., Code Injection) - Severity: High
    *   Malicious code injected into the input could be parsed by `tree-sitter` and potentially exploited if the application processes the parsed tree unsafely. Strict input validation reduces the likelihood of malicious code being accepted for parsing.
*   Denial of Service (DoS) via Malformed Input - Severity: Medium
    *   Extremely large or deeply nested inputs designed to overwhelm the parser can cause excessive resource consumption. Input size limits and format validation can prevent such inputs from reaching `tree-sitter`.
*   Exploitation of Parser Bugs via Crafted Input - Severity: High
    *   Specifically crafted inputs designed to trigger vulnerabilities in the `tree-sitter` parser itself can be prevented by limiting the allowed input format and rejecting unexpected or suspicious patterns.

**Impact:**
*   Injection Attacks: High risk reduction.
*   Denial of Service (DoS) via Malformed Input: Medium risk reduction.
*   Exploitation of Parser Bugs via Crafted Input: Medium risk reduction.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   In our web application's code editor feature, we currently implement basic input size limits and character set validation before sending code to the backend for parsing with `tree-sitter`. This is implemented in the frontend and backend API input validation.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   More granular format validation based on expected code structure and syntax is missing. We do not currently deeply validate the input code's syntax before parsing with `tree-sitter`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limits for Parsing](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limits_for_parsing.md)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Identify the resources consumed by the `tree-sitter` parsing process (CPU time, memory).
*   Step 2: Implement timeouts for `tree-sitter` parsing operations. Set a maximum allowed parsing time.
*   Step 3: Monitor memory usage during `tree-sitter` parsing. If memory consumption exceeds a threshold, terminate the parsing process.
*   Step 4: Consider using process isolation or resource control mechanisms to further limit resources available to the `tree-sitter` parsing process.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion - Severity: High
    *   Malicious or extremely complex code can be designed to cause `tree-sitter` to consume excessive CPU or memory, leading to DoS. Resource limits directly prevent this.
*   Catastrophic Backtracking in Grammars (DoS) - Severity: Medium
    *   Certain grammar ambiguities or complex input patterns can trigger exponential backtracking in `tree-sitter` parsing, leading to extreme CPU consumption. Timeouts can mitigate this.

**Impact:**
*   Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion: High risk reduction.
*   Catastrophic Backtracking in Grammars (DoS): Medium risk reduction.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   We have implemented a timeout for `tree-sitter` parsing operations in our backend code analysis service.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Memory usage monitoring and limits for the `tree-sitter` parsing process are not currently implemented.
*   Process isolation or resource control mechanisms specifically for the `tree-sitter` parsing process are not yet in place beyond containerization.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sandboxing the Parsing Process](./mitigation_strategies/sandboxing_the_parsing_process.md)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Choose a sandboxing technology suitable for isolating processes (e.g., Docker containers, virtual machines, seccomp-bpf).
*   Step 2: Configure the sandbox environment to restrict the capabilities of the `tree-sitter` parsing process, limiting access to filesystem, network, and system calls.
*   Step 3: Deploy the `tree-sitter` parsing engine within the sandboxed environment.
*   Step 4: Ensure application interaction with the sandboxed `tree-sitter` parser is through a secure interface.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Exploitation of Parser Bugs leading to System Compromise - Severity: High
    *   If a vulnerability in `tree-sitter` allows for arbitrary code execution, sandboxing can contain the impact by limiting the attacker's access to the underlying system.
*   Information Disclosure via Parser Vulnerabilities - Severity: Medium
    *   Sandboxing can restrict the parser's access to sensitive data, reducing the potential for information disclosure if a `tree-sitter` vulnerability is exploited.

**Impact:**
*   Exploitation of Parser Bugs leading to System Compromise: High risk reduction.
*   Information Disclosure via Parser Vulnerabilities: Medium risk reduction.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   We are currently using Docker containers to deploy our backend services, providing a basic level of containerization-based sandboxing for the service that uses `tree-sitter`.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Fine-grained sandboxing using technologies like seccomp-bpf within the Docker containers to further restrict `tree-sitter`'s capabilities is not yet implemented.
*   Minimal filesystem and network access configuration for the `tree-sitter` parsing process within containers is not explicitly defined.

*   Denial of Service (DoS) via Grammar Complexity - Severity: Medium
    *   Ambiguous or complex grammar rules in `tree-sitter` can lead to inefficient parsing and DoS. Grammar auditing can identify these rules.
*   Exploitation of Grammar Bugs via Crafted Input - Severity: High
    *   Vulnerabilities can exist within `tree-sitter` grammars, allowing crafted inputs to trigger parser crashes or incorrect parsing. Grammar review and testing can uncover these.

*   Step 2: Generate a large corpus of test inputs for fuzzing `tree-sitter` grammars, including valid, malformed, and potentially malicious inputs.
*   Step 3: Run the fuzzer against the `tree-sitter` parser with the target grammar. Monitor for crashes, hangs, or errors during fuzzing of `tree-sitter`.
*   Step 4: Analyze crashes or issues identified by the fuzzer in `tree-sitter`.
*   Step 5: Fix identified vulnerabilities or bugs in the grammar or `tree-sitter` parser.
*   Step 6: Continuously run fuzzing as part of development and maintenance for `tree-sitter` grammars.
