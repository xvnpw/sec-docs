# Threat Model Analysis for tokio-rs/axum

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Complex Routes](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_complex_routes.md)

**Description:** An attacker might send requests with extremely long or deeply nested paths. Axum's router needs to process these paths to find a match. The attacker aims to consume excessive CPU time and memory on the server *within Axum's routing logic*, potentially leading to a denial of service.

**Impact:** Availability - The application becomes slow or unresponsive to legitimate user requests due to Axum's router being overloaded.

**Affected Axum Component:** `axum::Router` (specifically the route matching logic).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement limits on the maximum length and depth of URL paths accepted by the application, potentially using middleware *before* Axum's routing or a reverse proxy.
* Carefully design routes within the `axum::Router` to avoid unnecessary complexity and deep nesting.
* Monitor server resource usage and set up alerts for unusual activity related to request processing times.

## Threat: [Payload Bomb via Extractors](./threats/payload_bomb_via_extractors.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends a request with an excessively large or deeply nested JSON or form payload. Axum's extractors (like `axum::extract::Json` or `axum::extract::Form`) attempt to deserialize this payload into Rust data structures. This can lead to excessive memory allocation and CPU usage *during Axum's extraction process*, potentially causing a denial of service.

**Impact:** Availability - The application becomes slow or unresponsive due to resource exhaustion during Axum's data extraction.

**Affected Axum Component:** `axum::extract::Json`, `axum::extract::Form`, and potentially other extractors that deserialize request bodies.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement limits on the maximum size of request bodies accepted by the application, either globally or per endpoint, *before* the request reaches Axum's extractors.
* Configure extractors with size limits if the underlying deserialization library supports it (e.g., `serde_json::from_slice` with size limits) and ensure Axum leverages these limits.
* Consider using streaming or manual deserialization *outside* of Axum's built-in extractors for endpoints that handle large payloads.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via `Bytes` Extractor without Limits](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via__bytes__extractor_without_limits.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends a request with an extremely large body when using the `axum::extract::Bytes` extractor without imposing size restrictions. This forces Axum to allocate a large buffer in memory to store the entire request body, potentially leading to memory exhaustion and denial of service.

**Impact:** Availability - The application crashes or becomes unresponsive due to memory exhaustion caused by Axum's `Bytes` extractor.

**Affected Axum Component:** `axum::extract::Bytes`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Always implement limits on the maximum size of request bodies when using the `Bytes` extractor, either using middleware *before* the extractor is called or by checking the `Content-Length` header and returning an error early.

## Threat: [Type Confusion or Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Extractors](./threats/type_confusion_or_deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_extractors.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious JSON or form payload that exploits vulnerabilities in the underlying deserialization library (e.g., `serde`) *as used by Axum's extractors*. This could lead to unexpected behavior, memory corruption, or even arbitrary code execution in rare cases *within the context of the Axum application*.

**Impact:** Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability - Potential for data breaches, data corruption, or complete compromise of the application due to vulnerabilities exposed through Axum's extractors.

**Affected Axum Component:** `axum::extract::Json`, `axum::extract::Form`, and the underlying deserialization libraries used by these extractors within Axum.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep dependencies, especially deserialization libraries like `serde`, updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities that Axum's extractors rely on.
* Implement robust validation of deserialized data *after* it has been extracted by Axum but before using it in the application logic.
* Consider using more restrictive data types or schemas for deserialization to limit the attack surface exposed through Axum's extractors.

## Threat: [Middleware Bypass due to Incorrect Ordering or Logic](./threats/middleware_bypass_due_to_incorrect_ordering_or_logic.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a request that, due to the order in which middleware is applied within Axum's routing or flaws in the middleware logic itself, bypasses intended security checks (e.g., authentication, authorization, input validation) implemented as Axum middleware.

**Impact:** Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability - Unauthorized access to resources, manipulation of data, or disruption of service due to the failure of Axum middleware to enforce security policies.

**Affected Axum Component:** `axum::middleware::from_fn`, `axum::Router::route`, and the specific middleware functions themselves.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully design and test the order of middleware application within the `axum::Router` to ensure that security checks are performed before accessing sensitive resources.
* Thoroughly review the logic of custom middleware functions created for Axum to identify potential bypass vulnerabilities.
* Use well-established and tested middleware patterns and libraries where possible within the Axum framework.
