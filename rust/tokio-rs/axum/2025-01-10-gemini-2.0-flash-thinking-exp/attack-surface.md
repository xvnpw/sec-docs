# Attack Surface Analysis for tokio-rs/axum

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Extractors](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_extractors.md)

**Description:** Exploiting weaknesses in how Axum's extractors (like `Json`, `Form`) deserialize request data into Rust types.

**How Axum Contributes:** Axum provides these extractors as a convenient way to handle incoming data. If the underlying deserialization logic is vulnerable or not used securely, it creates an attack surface.

**Example:** Sending a deeply nested JSON payload to an endpoint using the `Json` extractor, potentially causing a denial of service by consuming excessive memory or CPU during deserialization.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), potentially Arbitrary Code Execution (though less common in Rust).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement Input Validation on the deserialized data.
* Configure Deserialization Limits (depth, size).
* Use secure deserialization practices and keep dependencies updated.
* Consider manually parsing the request body for stricter control.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal via Path Extractors](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_via_path_extractors.md)

**Description:** Manipulating path parameters extracted using `axum::extract::Path` to access files or directories outside the intended scope on the server's filesystem.

**How Axum Contributes:** Axum's `Path` extractor directly exposes path segments to the handler. If not sanitized, these segments can be manipulated.

**Example:** A route like `/files/{filename}` where a malicious user sends a request to `/files/../../etc/passwd`.

**Impact:** Information Disclosure, potentially leading to further compromise.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Strictly validate and sanitize path parameters.
* Use canonicalization to resolve symbolic links.
* Apply the principle of least privilege to file system access.
* Consider using internal file IDs instead of direct filenames.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Middleware](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_middleware.md)

**Description:** Security flaws introduced within custom middleware functions that process requests and responses.

**How Axum Contributes:** Axum's middleware system allows developers to extend request processing. Vulnerabilities in this custom code directly impact the application's security.

**Example:** A custom authentication middleware that incorrectly validates JWT tokens, allowing unauthorized access.

**Impact:** Authentication Bypass, Authorization Bypass, Information Disclosure, Introduction of New Attack Vectors.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the middleware's function)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Follow secure coding practices when developing middleware.
* Thoroughly test middleware functions.
* Conduct code reviews of middleware.
* Apply the principle of least privilege to middleware functionality.

## Attack Surface: [Lack of Input Validation on WebSocket Messages (if using WebSockets)](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_input_validation_on_websocket_messages__if_using_websockets_.md)

**Description:** Failing to properly validate data received through WebSocket connections, leading to vulnerabilities similar to those in HTTP request handling.

**How Axum Contributes:** Axum provides support for WebSockets, and developers are responsible for validating the content of WebSocket messages.

**Example:** Receiving a WebSocket message containing a command that is directly executed on the server without proper sanitization, leading to Command Injection.

**Impact:** Command Injection, Denial of Service.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the processing of WebSocket messages)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Validate all data received through WebSocket connections.
* Use secure serialization/deserialization for WebSocket messages.
* Apply the principle of least privilege to actions performed based on WebSocket messages.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Shared State](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_shared_state.md)

**Description:** Storing sensitive information in the application's shared state (`axum::extract::State`) and potentially exposing it due to vulnerabilities elsewhere in the application.

**How Axum Contributes:** Axum's state management provides a way to share data across handlers. If not used carefully, it can become a source of information disclosure.

**Example:** Storing API keys in the shared state and a bug in another handler inadvertently logging or returning this state information.

**Impact:** Information Disclosure, Potential Account Takeover, Data Breach.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the sensitivity of the data)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid storing sensitive data in shared state if possible.
* Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
* Restrict access to state to only necessary handlers.
* Regularly audit state usage.
