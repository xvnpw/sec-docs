## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Extractor Weaknesses [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_extractor_weaknesses__critical_.md)

*   ***Send malformed JSON/other formats that cause panics or unexpected behavior in deserialization.***
*   ***Send excessively large request bodies to cause memory exhaustion (DoS).***
*   ***Exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying deserialization library (e.g., serde).***
*   ***Inject malicious headers that are not properly sanitized and used in application logic.***

**High-Risk Path:** Send malformed JSON/other formats that cause panics or unexpected behavior in deserialization.
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts a request with a body that violates the expected format (e.g., invalid JSON syntax, missing required fields, incorrect data types).
    *   **Consequence:** This can lead to the application crashing (panic), entering an unexpected state, or revealing error information.

*   **High-Risk Path:** Send excessively large request bodies to cause memory exhaustion (DoS).
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker sends a request with an extremely large body, exceeding the application's ability to allocate memory.
    *   **Consequence:** This can lead to a denial of service as the application becomes unresponsive or crashes due to memory exhaustion.

*   **High-Risk Path:** Exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying deserialization library (e.g., serde).
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker leverages known security flaws in the deserialization library used by Axum (typically `serde`). This might involve crafting specific input that triggers remote code execution or other severe vulnerabilities within the library.
    *   **Consequence:** This can lead to complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying server.

*   **High-Risk Path:** Inject malicious headers that are not properly sanitized and used in application logic.
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker adds or modifies HTTP headers in a request to inject malicious content. This content might be interpreted as commands, scripts, or data that can compromise the application. Examples include injecting XSS payloads or manipulating authorization headers.
    *   **Consequence:** This can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, session hijacking, or bypassing security controls.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Middleware Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_middleware_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

*   ***Middleware Bypass***
*   ***Middleware Logic Errors***
*   ***Denial of Service via Middleware***

*   **High-Risk Path:** Middleware Bypass
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker finds a way to circumvent the execution of one or more middleware layers. This could be due to flaws in routing logic, incorrect middleware ordering, or specific request crafting that bypasses middleware conditions.
    *   **Consequence:** This can disable security measures implemented in the bypassed middleware, such as authentication, authorization, or input sanitization.

*   **High-Risk Path:** Middleware Logic Errors
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits flaws in the logic of custom middleware. This could involve incorrect authorization checks, flawed authentication mechanisms, or mishandling of sensitive data within the middleware.
    *   **Consequence:** This can lead to unauthorized access, privilege escalation, or data breaches.

*   **High-Risk Path:** Denial of Service via Middleware
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts requests that cause the middleware to perform resource-intensive operations or enter infinite loops, consuming excessive CPU, memory, or network resources.
    *   **Consequence:** This can lead to a denial of service as the application becomes unresponsive to legitimate requests.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Underlying Tokio/Async Context Issues](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_underlying_tokioasync_context_issues.md)

*   ***Task Starvation***
*   ***Resource Exhaustion (Tokio Runtime)***

*   **High-Risk Path:** Task Starvation
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker sends requests that trigger long-running or blocking operations within asynchronous tasks, preventing other tasks from being processed in a timely manner. This can effectively stall the application.
    *   **Consequence:** This can lead to a denial of service as the application becomes unresponsive or very slow.

*   **High-Risk Path:** Resource Exhaustion (Tokio Runtime)
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker sends a large number of concurrent requests, overwhelming the Tokio runtime's capacity to manage tasks, connections, or other resources.
    *   **Consequence:** This can lead to a denial of service as the runtime becomes overloaded and unable to handle new requests.
