# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, represented by the GitHub repository [https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum), is focused on providing a web application framework built with Rust and Tokio.

- Business Priorities:
  - Provide a high-performance and efficient web framework.
  - Enable developers to build robust and scalable web applications and APIs.
  - Leverage the benefits of Rust's memory safety and performance characteristics for web development.
  - Foster a strong community around Rust web development.

- Business Goals:
  - Become a leading web framework in the Rust ecosystem.
  - Offer a developer-friendly and productive environment for building web services.
  - Ensure stability, reliability, and security of the framework.
  - Promote adoption of Rust for backend web development.

- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in the framework could lead to exploitation in applications built with Axum, causing data breaches, service disruption, or reputational damage.
  - Performance bottlenecks or inefficiencies in the framework could limit the scalability and responsiveness of applications.
  - Lack of adoption or community support could hinder the framework's long-term viability and ecosystem growth.
  - Bugs or instability in the framework could lead to application failures and developer frustration.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security Control: Memory safety provided by Rust language, reducing vulnerabilities like buffer overflows and use-after-free. Implemented by Rust compiler.
- Security Control: Dependency management using Cargo, allowing for controlled inclusion of external libraries. Implemented by Cargo build system.
- Accepted Risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies used by Axum or applications built with Axum. Mitigation relies on dependency scanning and updates.
- Accepted Risk: Security misconfigurations by developers using Axum, leading to insecure applications. Mitigation through documentation, examples, and security best practices guidance.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - Security Control: Implement automated static application security testing (SAST) on the Axum framework codebase to identify potential vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle.
  - Security Control: Integrate dependency vulnerability scanning into the development and release process to detect and address known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
  - Security Control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the Axum framework to identify and remediate security weaknesses.
  - Security Control: Provide comprehensive security documentation and best practices for developers using Axum to build secure applications.
  - Security Control: Establish a clear process for reporting and responding to security vulnerabilities in the Axum framework.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Applications built with Axum will likely need to implement authentication mechanisms to verify user identities. Axum should provide flexibility and tools to integrate with various authentication strategies (e.g., session-based, token-based, OAuth 2.0).
  - Authorization: Applications will require authorization to control access to resources based on user roles and permissions. Axum should facilitate the implementation of fine-grained authorization policies.
  - Input Validation: Robust input validation is crucial to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting). Axum should encourage and provide mechanisms for validating all user inputs.
  - Cryptography: Applications may need to use cryptography for protecting sensitive data in transit and at rest. Axum should support or integrate well with cryptographic libraries for secure communication (TLS/SSL) and data encryption.
