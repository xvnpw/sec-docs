# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for tokio-rs/axum

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Error Handling in Handlers and Middleware (Axum Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_error_handling_in_handlers_and_middleware__axum_specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize Axum's Error Handling:** Leverage Axum's `Result` type and `From` trait implementations to create a structured error handling system. Define custom error types that represent different error conditions in your application.
    2.  **Implement Custom Error Extractors:** Create Axum error extractors to catch errors at the middleware or handler level. This allows you to intercept errors and transform them into consistent HTTP responses.
    3.  **Centralized Error Response Logic:**  Within your error extractors or a dedicated error handling middleware, implement logic to generate generic, user-friendly error responses for clients. Use Axum's `IntoResponse` trait to convert your custom error types into HTTP responses.
    4.  **Detailed Server-Side Logging (Axum Context):** In your error handling logic, use Axum's request extensions or state to access request-specific information (like request ID, path, method) and include it in your server-side logs. This provides valuable context for debugging and security analysis.
    5.  **Avoid Direct Error Propagation to Clients:** Ensure that errors originating from within Axum handlers or middleware are properly caught and transformed before being sent to the client. Prevent raw error messages or stack traces from being directly exposed in HTTP responses.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Exposing detailed error messages or stack traces in HTTP responses can reveal internal application details to attackers.
    *   **Security Misconfiguration (Low Severity):** Verbose error pages can sometimes expose configuration paths or internal workings.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Significantly reduces risk by preventing the leakage of sensitive internal information through error responses.
    *   **Security Misconfiguration:** Reduces risk by ensuring consistent and controlled error responses.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Axum's `Result` type is used throughout handlers.
    *   A basic custom error type exists, but error handling logic is scattered across handlers.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Dedicated Axum error extractors or middleware for centralized error handling are not implemented.
    *   Error responses are not consistently generic and user-friendly across all endpoints.
    *   Server-side logging of errors lacks Axum request context for better debugging.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Middleware for Security Headers (Axum Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/middleware_for_security_headers__axum_specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Create Axum Middleware Function:** Define asynchronous functions in Rust that implement the `axum::middleware::Next` trait. These functions will act as your security header middleware.
    2.  **Set Security Headers in Middleware:** Within your middleware function, access the `http::response::Builder` from the `Request` extension provided by Axum. Use this builder to set the desired security headers (e.g., `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, etc.) on the response.
    3.  **Apply Middleware Globally or Selectively:** Use Axum's `Router::route_layer` or `Router::layer` to apply your security header middleware. You can apply it globally to all routes or selectively to specific route groups or individual routes as needed.
    4.  **Configure Header Values (Axum Context):**  If header values need to be dynamic based on the request or application state, access Axum's request extensions or state within your middleware to retrieve the necessary information and construct header values accordingly.
    5.  **Test with Axum Application:** Run your Axum application and use browser developer tools or online header checkers to verify that the security headers are being correctly set in the HTTP responses generated by Axum.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):** `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP) via headers.
    *   **Clickjacking (Medium Severity):** `X-Frame-Options` and CSP `frame-ancestors` via headers.
    *   **MIME-Sniffing Attacks (Medium Severity):** `X-Content-Type-Options` via headers.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (Medium Severity):** `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS) via headers.
    *   **Referer Leakage (Low to Medium Severity):** `Referrer-Policy` via headers.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Significantly reduces risk with effective CSP.
    *   **Clickjacking:** Significantly reduces risk.
    *   **MIME-Sniffing Attacks:** Reduces risk.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Reduces risk by enforcing HTTPS.
    *   **Referer Leakage:** Reduces risk of information leakage.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic middleware sets `X-Content-Type-Options` and `X-Frame-Options`.
    *   HSTS is configured externally.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Axum middleware for `Content-Security-Policy`, `Referrer-Policy`, and `Permissions-Policy` is missing.
    *   HSTS middleware within Axum application is not implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting Middleware (Axum Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_middleware__axum_specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose Rate Limiting Library:** Select a suitable rate limiting library for Rust that integrates well with asynchronous environments like Tokio and Axum (e.g., `governor`, `tokio-rate-limit`).
    2.  **Implement Axum Middleware:** Create Axum middleware using the chosen rate limiting library. The middleware should intercept incoming requests and check if the request rate for a given client (identified by IP address, user ID, etc.) exceeds the defined limits.
    3.  **Configure Rate Limits:** Define appropriate rate limits for different endpoints or user roles. Consider factors like request frequency, resource consumption of endpoints, and expected user behavior. Configuration should be externalized for easy adjustment.
    4.  **Handle Rate Limit Exceeded:** In your middleware, if a request exceeds the rate limit, return an appropriate HTTP response (e.g., 429 Too Many Requests) to the client. Include informative headers like `Retry-After` to indicate when the client can retry.
    5.  **Apply Middleware Selectively (Axum Routes):** Use Axum's routing capabilities to apply rate limiting middleware selectively to specific routes or route groups that are more vulnerable to abuse or resource exhaustion.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks (Medium to High Severity):** Prevents attackers from overwhelming the application with excessive requests.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (Medium Severity):** Limits the rate of login attempts or other actions that attackers might try to brute-force.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Protects application resources (CPU, memory, database connections) from being exhausted by excessive requests.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks:** Significantly reduces risk by limiting request rates.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Reduces risk by slowing down brute-force attempts.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Reduces risk by preventing resource overload.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   No rate limiting middleware is currently implemented in the Axum application.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Rate limiting middleware needs to be implemented and configured for critical endpoints like login, registration, and resource-intensive APIs.

## Mitigation Strategy: [CORS Configuration Middleware (Axum Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/cors_configuration_middleware__axum_specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Understand CORS Requirements:** Determine if your Axum application needs to handle cross-origin requests. If your frontend and backend are served from different origins, CORS configuration is necessary.
    2.  **Use Axum CORS Middleware:** Utilize the `axum_ Cors` middleware crate (or similar) designed for Axum. Add this crate as a dependency to your `Cargo.toml`.
    3.  **Configure CORS Policy:** Configure the CORS middleware with appropriate settings. This includes specifying allowed origins, allowed methods (GET, POST, etc.), allowed headers, and whether to allow credentials (cookies, authorization headers).
    4.  **Restrict Allowed Origins:**  Be as restrictive as possible with allowed origins. Only allow origins that you explicitly trust and need to access your API. Avoid using wildcard origins (`*`) in production unless absolutely necessary and understand the security implications.
    5.  **Apply CORS Middleware (Axum Router):** Apply the configured CORS middleware to your Axum router using `Router::layer`. You can apply it globally or selectively to specific routes.
    6.  **Test CORS Configuration:** Use browser developer tools or online CORS checkers to verify that your CORS configuration is working as expected and that cross-origin requests are handled correctly.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (Medium to High Severity):** Improperly configured CORS can sometimes weaken CSRF defenses or create new CSRF vulnerabilities.
    *   **Data Breaches (Medium Severity):**  Overly permissive CORS configurations can potentially allow malicious websites to access sensitive data from your API if combined with other vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Reduces risk when CORS is configured correctly and restrictively.
    *   **Data Breaches:** Reduces risk by controlling cross-origin access to your API.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic CORS middleware is implemented, allowing requests from a specific frontend origin in staging and production.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   CORS configuration could be more granular, potentially allowing different origins for different API endpoints if needed.
    *   Review and audit of the current CORS configuration is needed to ensure it's as restrictive as possible while still meeting application requirements.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Custom Authentication and Authorization Middleware (Axum Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/custom_authentication_and_authorization_middleware__axum_specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose Authentication/Authorization Strategy:** Select an appropriate authentication and authorization method for your application (e.g., JWT, session-based authentication, OAuth 2.0).
    2.  **Implement Axum Middleware for Authentication:** Create Axum middleware to handle authentication. This middleware should:
        *   Extract authentication credentials from the request (e.g., from headers, cookies).
        *   Validate the credentials (e.g., verify JWT signature, check session validity).
        *   If authentication is successful, store user information (e.g., user ID, roles) in Axum request extensions or state for use in handlers.
        *   If authentication fails, return an appropriate HTTP error response (e.g., 401 Unauthorized).
    3.  **Implement Axum Middleware for Authorization:** Create Axum middleware for authorization. This middleware should:
        *   Retrieve user information from request extensions or state (populated by the authentication middleware).
        *   Check if the user has the necessary permissions to access the requested resource or perform the requested action.
        *   If authorized, allow the request to proceed to the handler.
        *   If unauthorized, return an appropriate HTTP error response (e.g., 403 Forbidden).
    4.  **Apply Middleware to Protected Routes (Axum Router):** Use Axum's routing to apply authentication and authorization middleware to routes that require protection. Apply authentication middleware first, followed by authorization middleware.
    5.  **Use Axum Extractors in Handlers:** In your Axum handlers, use extractors to access the user information stored in request extensions or state by the authentication middleware. Use this information to personalize responses or perform user-specific actions.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized users from accessing protected resources or performing privileged actions.
    *   **Data Breaches (High Severity):**  Proper authorization is crucial to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Medium to High Severity):**  Authorization middleware helps prevent users from gaining access to resources or actions beyond their intended privileges.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Significantly reduces risk by enforcing access control.
    *   **Data Breaches:** Significantly reduces risk by limiting access to sensitive data.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Reduces risk by enforcing role-based or permission-based access control.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic JWT-based authentication middleware is implemented for API endpoints.
    *   Authorization checks are performed directly within handlers, not using dedicated middleware.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Dedicated authorization middleware is needed to centralize and enforce authorization logic consistently across the application.
    *   Role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC) is not fully implemented. Authorization is currently based on simple user roles.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure State Management (Axum Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_state_management__axum_specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Minimize State Usage:**  Carefully consider whether application state (using Axum extensions) is truly necessary. Minimize the amount of sensitive data stored in application state.
    2.  **Encrypt Sensitive Data in State (If Necessary):** If you must store sensitive data in Axum state, consider encrypting it at rest within the state. Use a secure encryption library and manage encryption keys securely (using a secret management system).
    3.  **Principle of Least Privilege for State Access:** Ensure that only handlers and middleware that absolutely need access to specific parts of the application state are granted access. Avoid making sensitive state data globally accessible if possible.
    4.  **Audit State Access:**  Implement logging or monitoring of access to sensitive data stored in Axum state. This helps track who is accessing what data and can aid in detecting potential security breaches or misuse.
    5.  **Regularly Review State Management:** Periodically review your application's state management practices to ensure they are still secure and necessary. Remove any state data that is no longer needed or can be managed in a more secure way.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium to High Severity):** If sensitive data is stored insecurely in application state, it could be exposed if the application is compromised or if there are vulnerabilities in state management logic.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity):**  Improper state management could potentially lead to privilege escalation if attackers can manipulate or access state data they shouldn't.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Reduces risk by securing sensitive data stored in state.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Reduces risk by controlling access to state data.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Application state is used to share database connection pools and configuration data across handlers.
    *   No sensitive data is currently stored directly in application state in plain text.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Encryption of sensitive data in state is not implemented, although currently no highly sensitive data is stored there.
    *   Formal access control or auditing of state access is not in place.
    *   Review of state management practices is not regularly performed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limits and Timeouts (Axum Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limits_and_timeouts__axum_specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Request Body Size Limits (Axum Extractors):** Use Axum's extractor configuration options to set limits on the maximum size of request bodies that your application will accept. This prevents processing excessively large requests that could lead to resource exhaustion.
    2.  **Set Connection Timeouts (Tokio/Hyper Configuration):** Configure connection timeouts at the Tokio or Hyper level (underlying Axum) to prevent long-lived, idle connections from consuming resources indefinitely.
    3.  **Implement Handler Execution Timeouts (Tokio Select):**  Use Tokio's `tokio::select!` or similar mechanisms to set timeouts for handler execution. If a handler takes too long to respond, it should be terminated to prevent resource starvation and improve responsiveness.
    4.  **Database Connection Limits (Connection Pools):** If your Axum application uses a database, configure connection pool limits to prevent the application from opening too many database connections and overwhelming the database server.
    5.  **Monitor Resource Usage (System Metrics):** Monitor system-level resource usage (CPU, memory, network) of your Axum application. Set up alerts for unusual resource consumption patterns that could indicate DoS attacks or resource leaks.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks (Medium to High Severity):** Resource limits and timeouts help prevent attackers from exhausting application resources and causing service disruption.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Protects against unintentional resource leaks or inefficient code that could lead to resource exhaustion over time.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks:** Reduces risk by limiting resource consumption.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Reduces risk by preventing resource overload and improving application stability.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Request body size limits are configured in Axum.
    *   Database connection pool limits are configured.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Connection timeouts at the Tokio/Hyper level are not explicitly configured.
    *   Handler execution timeouts are not implemented.
    *   System-level resource monitoring and alerting are not fully integrated for the Axum application specifically.
