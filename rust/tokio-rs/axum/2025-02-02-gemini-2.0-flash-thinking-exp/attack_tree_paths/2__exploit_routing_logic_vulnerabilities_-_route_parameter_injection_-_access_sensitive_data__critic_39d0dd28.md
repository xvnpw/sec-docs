### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Route Parameter Injection -> Access Sensitive Data

#### 4.1. Understanding Route Parameter Injection in Axum

Axum, like many web frameworks, allows defining routes with parameters. These parameters are extracted from the URL path and can be used within the handler function to process requests. For example, in Axum, a route might be defined like this:

```rust
use axum::{routing::get, Router, extract::Path};
use std::net::SocketAddr;

async fn get_file(Path(file_path): Path<String>) -> String {
    // Potentially vulnerable code: Directly using file_path
    format!("You requested file: {}", file_path)
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let app = Router::new().route("/files/:file_path", get(get_file));

    let addr = SocketAddr::from(([127, 0, 0, 1], 3000));
    axum::Server::bind(&addr)
        .serve(app.into_make_service())
        .await
        .unwrap();
}
```

In this example, `:file_path` is a route parameter. Axum extracts the value from the URL path and makes it available as the `file_path` variable in the `get_file` handler.

**The Vulnerability:**

Route parameter injection occurs when an attacker can manipulate the value of a route parameter in a way that was not intended by the application developer, leading to unintended actions. In the context of "Access Sensitive Data," the primary concern is when these parameters are used to:

*   **Construct file paths:**  As shown in the example above, if `file_path` is directly used to access files on the server's file system without proper validation, an attacker can inject path traversal sequences like `../` to access files outside the intended directory.
*   **Construct database queries:**  If route parameters are used to build database queries (e.g., in dynamic SQL), an attacker could inject SQL fragments to access or modify data they are not authorized to access (SQL Injection). While this analysis focuses on file access, the principle is similar.
*   **Access other resources:**  Route parameters might be used to identify resources in other systems or services. Injection could lead to accessing unintended resources in those systems.

#### 4.2. Attack Scenario: Path Traversal to Access Sensitive Files

Let's focus on the path traversal scenario. Imagine the `get_file` handler is intended to serve files from a specific directory, say `/app/files/`. However, if the `file_path` parameter is not validated, an attacker can craft a request like:

`GET /files/../../../../etc/passwd`

In a vulnerable implementation, the server might interpret this literally and attempt to access the file `/etc/passwd` on the server's file system, potentially exposing sensitive system information.

**Vulnerable Axum Code Example (Illustrative - Do NOT use in production):**

```rust
use axum::{routing::get, Router, extract::Path, response::Result, response::IntoResponse, http::StatusCode};
use std::{net::SocketAddr, fs};

async fn get_file_content(Path(file_path): Path<String>) -> Result<String, impl IntoResponse> {
    let base_path = "/app/files/"; // Intended base directory
    let full_path = format!("{}{}", base_path, file_path); // Vulnerable path construction

    match fs::read_to_string(&full_path) {
        Ok(content) => Ok(content),
        Err(_) => Err((StatusCode::NOT_FOUND, "File not found".to_string())),
    }
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // Create a dummy file directory for testing
    std::fs::create_dir_all("/app/files/public").unwrap();
    std::fs::write("/app/files/public/hello.txt", "Hello, world!").unwrap();
    std::fs::write("/app/files/private.txt", "This is a private file.").unwrap(); // Sensitive file outside public dir

    let app = Router::new().route("/files/:file_path", get(get_file_content));

    let addr = SocketAddr::from(([127, 0, 0, 1], 3000));
    axum::Server::bind(&addr)
        .serve(app.into_make_service())
        .await
        .unwrap();
}
```

In this vulnerable example:

1.  The `get_file_content` function takes the `file_path` parameter from the URL.
2.  It constructs the full file path by simply concatenating a base path `/app/files/` with the user-provided `file_path`.
3.  It attempts to read the file at the constructed path using `fs::read_to_string`.

If an attacker requests `/files/../private.txt`, the `full_path` becomes `/app/files/../private.txt`, which resolves to `/app/private.txt` (or potentially just `private.txt` depending on the OS and file system). If `private.txt` exists outside the intended `/app/files/public/` directory (as set up in the `main` function), the attacker can access it.

#### 4.3. Potential Impact

Successful exploitation of route parameter injection leading to sensitive data access can have severe consequences:

*   **Data Breach:**  Exposure of sensitive files like configuration files (containing database credentials, API keys), application source code, user data, or internal documents. This can lead to significant financial losses, reputational damage, and legal repercussions.
*   **Exposure of Configuration Files:** Access to configuration files can reveal critical information about the application's infrastructure, dependencies, and security settings, making further attacks easier.
*   **Access to Internal Application Data:** Attackers might gain access to internal application data that should not be publicly accessible, potentially revealing business logic, algorithms, or proprietary information.
*   **Potential Code Execution (in some scenarios):** If the application mishandles uploaded files based on route parameters (e.g., saving them to a location derived from the parameter), path traversal could be combined with file upload vulnerabilities to place malicious files in executable locations and potentially achieve code execution.
*   **Compliance Violations:** Data breaches resulting from such vulnerabilities can lead to violations of data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.).

#### 4.4. Mitigation Strategies for Axum Applications

To effectively mitigate route parameter injection vulnerabilities in Axum applications, consider the following strategies:

**1. Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:**

*   **Validate Parameter Format:**  Define strict rules for the format of route parameters. For file paths, this means:
    *   **Allowlist Valid Characters:**  Only allow alphanumeric characters, hyphens, underscores, and forward slashes (if necessary for directory structure within the allowed path).  Reject any characters like `.` (dot), `..`, backslashes, or special characters that could be used for path traversal or other injection attacks.
    *   **Regular Expressions:** Use regular expressions to enforce the allowed format.
*   **Sanitize Input (with caution):** While sanitization can be attempted, it's often better to validate and reject invalid input. If sanitization is used, be extremely careful to avoid bypasses. For path traversal, simply removing `../` is often insufficient as attackers can use encodings or other techniques.
*   **Axum Extractors for Validation:** Leverage Axum's extractors to perform validation directly when extracting route parameters. You can create custom extractors or use existing ones with validation logic.

**Example: Input Validation using a custom extractor and `Path`:**

```rust
use axum::{
    routing::get,
    Router,
    extract::{Path, FromRequestParts, rejection::PathRejection},
    http::{request::Parts, StatusCode},
    response::{IntoResponse, Result},
};
use std::net::SocketAddr;
use regex::Regex;

#[derive(Debug)]
struct ValidFilePath(String);

#[axum::async_trait]
impl<S: Send + Sync> FromRequestParts<S> for ValidFilePath {
    type Rejection = (StatusCode, String);

    async fn from_request_parts(parts: &mut Parts, state: &S) -> Result<Self, Self::Rejection> {
        let Path(file_path): Path<String> = Path::from_request_parts(parts, state).await.map_err(|e: PathRejection| {
            (StatusCode::BAD_REQUEST, format!("Invalid path parameter: {}", e))
        })?;

        let valid_path_regex = Regex::new(r"^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+(/?[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+)*\.?[a-zA-Z0-9]*$").unwrap(); // Allow alphanumeric, _, -, /, and file extensions
        if valid_path_regex.is_match(&file_path) {
            Ok(ValidFilePath(file_path))
        } else {
            Err((StatusCode::BAD_REQUEST, "Invalid file path format".to_string()))
        }
    }
}


async fn get_file_content_validated(ValidFilePath(file_path): ValidFilePath) -> Result<String, impl IntoResponse> {
    let base_path = "/app/files/public/"; // Secure base directory
    let full_path = format!("{}{}", base_path, file_path);

    match std::fs::read_to_string(&full_path) {
        Ok(content) => Ok(content),
        Err(_) => Err((StatusCode::NOT_FOUND, "File not found".to_string())),
    }
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // ... (setup dummy files as before) ...

    let app = Router::new().route("/files/:file_path", get(get_file_content_validated));

    let addr = SocketAddr::from(([127, 0, 0, 1], 3000));
    axum::Server::bind(&addr)
        .serve(app.into_make_service())
        .await
        .unwrap();
}
```

In this improved example:

*   We define a custom extractor `ValidFilePath`.
*   The `FromRequestParts` implementation for `ValidFilePath` extracts the `Path<String>` as before.
*   It then uses a regular expression (`valid_path_regex`) to validate the `file_path`. This regex allows alphanumeric characters, underscores, hyphens, forward slashes (for directory structure), and file extensions, but restricts other potentially dangerous characters.
*   If the validation fails, it returns a `BadRequest` error.
*   The `get_file_content_validated` handler now uses `ValidFilePath` instead of `Path<String>`.

**2. Principle of Least Privilege (File System):**

*   **Restrict File System Access:**  The application should only have access to the specific directories and files it absolutely needs to function. Avoid running the application with overly broad file system permissions.
*   **Chroot Environments/Containers:** Consider using chroot environments or containerization to further isolate the application's file system and limit the impact of path traversal vulnerabilities.

**3. Secure File Handling Libraries and Techniques:**

*   **`std::path::Path` for Path Manipulation:**  Use Rust's `std::path::Path` and related functions for path manipulation instead of string concatenation. `Path` provides methods like `join`, `canonicalize`, and `starts_with` that can help prevent path traversal.
*   **`canonicalize()` for Path Resolution:**  Use `Path::canonicalize()` to resolve symbolic links and `..` components in paths. After canonicalization, you can check if the resulting path is within the allowed base directory using `starts_with()`.

**Example: Secure Path Handling with `Path` and `canonicalize()`:**

```rust
use axum::{
    routing::get,
    Router,
    extract::Path,
    response::{Result, IntoResponse},
    http::StatusCode,
};
use std::{net::SocketAddr, fs, path::PathBuf};

async fn get_file_content_secure(Path(file_path): Path<String>) -> Result<String, impl IntoResponse> {
    let base_dir = PathBuf::from("/app/files/public"); // Secure base directory

    // Construct the full path using Path::join
    let requested_path = base_dir.join(&file_path);

    // Canonicalize both paths to resolve symlinks and ".."
    let canonical_base_dir = base_dir.canonicalize().map_err(|_| (StatusCode::INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR, "Base directory error"))?;
    let canonical_requested_path = requested_path.canonicalize().map_err(|_| (StatusCode::NOT_FOUND, "File not found"))?;

    // Check if the requested path is still within the base directory after canonicalization
    if canonical_requested_path.starts_with(&canonical_base_dir) {
        match fs::read_to_string(&canonical_requested_path) {
            Ok(content) => Ok(content),
            Err(_) => Err((StatusCode::NOT_FOUND, "File not found".to_string())),
        }
    } else {
        Err((StatusCode::FORBIDDEN, "Access denied".to_string())) // Path traversal attempt detected
    }
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // ... (setup dummy files as before) ...

    let app = Router::new().route("/files/:file_path", get(get_file_content_secure));

    let addr = SocketAddr::from(([127, 0, 0, 1], 3000));
    axum::Server::bind(&addr)
        .serve(app.into_make_service())
        .await
        .unwrap();
}
```

In this secure example:

*   We use `PathBuf` to represent file paths.
*   `base_dir.join(&file_path)` is used to construct the full path, which is safer than string concatenation.
*   `canonicalize()` is used on both the `base_dir` and `requested_path` to resolve symbolic links and `..` components.
*   `canonical_requested_path.starts_with(&canonical_base_dir)` checks if the resolved requested path is still within the allowed base directory. If not, it indicates a path traversal attempt, and access is denied with a `Forbidden` status.

**4. Avoid Direct File Path Construction (Indirect References):**

*   **Use IDs or Indirect References:** Instead of directly using user-provided parameters to construct file paths, consider using indirect references. For example, assign unique IDs to files and store a mapping between IDs and actual file paths server-side.  The route parameter would then be the file ID, and the application would look up the corresponding safe file path internally.
*   **Database Lookups:** Store file metadata (including safe paths) in a database. Use route parameters to query the database and retrieve the safe path instead of constructing it directly from user input.

**Example: Using IDs for Indirect File Access (Conceptual):**

```rust
// Conceptual example - simplified for illustration
use axum::{
    routing::get,
    Router,
    extract::Path,
    response::{Result, IntoResponse},
    http::StatusCode,
};
use std::{net::SocketAddr, collections::HashMap};

// In a real application, this would likely be a database or persistent storage
lazy_static::lazy_static! {
    static ref FILE_PATHS: HashMap<String, String> = {
        let mut m = HashMap::new();
        m.insert("file1".to_string(), "/app/files/public/hello.txt".to_string());
        m
    };
}

async fn get_file_by_id(Path(file_id): Path<String>) -> Result<String, impl IntoResponse> {
    if let Some(safe_path) = FILE_PATHS.get(&file_id) {
        match std::fs::read_to_string(safe_path) {
            Ok(content) => Ok(content),
            Err(_) => Err((StatusCode::NOT_FOUND, "File not found".to_string())),
        }
    } else {
        Err((StatusCode::NOT_FOUND, "File ID not found".to_string()))
    }
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // ... (setup dummy files as before) ...

    let app = Router::new().route("/files/id/:file_id", get(get_file_by_id));

    let addr = SocketAddr::from(([127, 0, 0, 1], 3000));
    axum::Server::bind(&addr)
        .serve(app.into_make_service())
        .await
        .unwrap();
}
```

In this conceptual example:

*   We use a `HashMap` (in a real application, a database) to store a mapping between file IDs and safe file paths.
*   The route is `/files/id/:file_id`.
*   The `get_file_by_id` handler retrieves the `file_id` from the path.
*   It looks up the `safe_path` in the `FILE_PATHS` map based on the `file_id`.
*   It then reads the file from the `safe_path`.

This approach avoids directly using user input to construct file paths, significantly reducing the risk of path traversal.

### 5. Conclusion

Route parameter injection leading to sensitive data access, particularly through path traversal, is a critical vulnerability in web applications.  By understanding how Axum handles routing and parameters, and by implementing robust mitigation strategies like strict input validation, secure file handling with `std::path::Path`, and employing the principle of least privilege, developers can significantly reduce the risk of this attack.  Prioritizing secure coding practices and regularly reviewing routing logic are essential for building secure Axum applications. Remember to always validate and sanitize user inputs, especially when they are used to interact with the file system or other sensitive resources.
