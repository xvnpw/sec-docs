*   Threat: Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Extractors
    *   Description: An attacker crafts malicious input data (e.g., within JSON or form data) that, when deserialized by Axum's extractors (like `Json` or `Form`), exploits vulnerabilities in the underlying deserialization library (often `serde`). This could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server, allowing the attacker to gain full control.
    *   Impact: Critical. Full compromise of the server, including data breaches, service disruption, and potential for further attacks on internal networks.
    *   Affected Axum Component: `axum::extract::Json`, `axum::extract::Form`, potentially custom extractors.
    *   Risk Severity: Critical
    *   Mitigation Strategies:
        *   Keep `serde` and all related deserialization dependencies updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement strict input validation *before* deserialization where possible.
        *   Consider using more secure deserialization configurations or libraries if available and suitable.
        *   Be mindful of the data types being deserialized and potential for type confusion attacks.

*   Threat: Resource Exhaustion through Large Request Bodies
    *   Description: An attacker sends excessively large request bodies to the server without proper authorization or legitimate need. Axum, by default, might not have strict limits, causing the server to consume excessive memory or processing power, leading to denial of service.
    *   Impact: High. Server becomes unresponsive, impacting availability for legitimate users.
    *   Affected Axum Component: `axum::extract::Bytes`, `axum::extract::String`, potentially all extractors if the underlying data stream is not limited.
    *   Risk Severity: High
    *   Mitigation Strategies:
        *   Implement request body size limits using middleware or within specific route handlers.
        *   Consider using streaming request body processing for large uploads to avoid loading the entire body into memory at once.
        *   Implement rate limiting to prevent a single attacker from overwhelming the server with large requests.

*   Threat: Path Traversal via Path Extractors
    *   Description: When using `axum::extract::Path` to extract path parameters that are then used to access files or resources on the server's file system, an attacker can manipulate the path parameters (e.g., using `../`) to access files or directories outside of the intended scope.
    *   Impact: High. Unauthorized access to sensitive files or directories on the server, potentially leading to data breaches or system compromise.
    *   Affected Axum Component: `axum::extract::Path`.
    *   Risk Severity: High
    *   Mitigation Strategies:
        *   Thoroughly sanitize and validate user-provided path segments.
        *   Avoid directly using user input to construct file paths. Use whitelisting or canonicalization techniques.
        *   Implement proper access controls on the file system.

*   Threat: Malicious or Vulnerable Middleware
    *   Description: If custom middleware is developed with vulnerabilities or if a compromised or malicious third-party middleware is used, it can introduce various security risks. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to bypass authentication, log sensitive information, modify requests or responses, or even gain control over the request processing pipeline.
    *   Impact: High to Critical, depending on the vulnerability. Potential for complete application compromise, data breaches, or service disruption.
    *   Affected Axum Component: `axum::middleware::from_fn`, `axum::middleware::Next`, and any custom or third-party middleware.
    *   Risk Severity: High
    *   Mitigation Strategies:
        *   Thoroughly review and test custom middleware for security vulnerabilities.
        *   Use reputable and well-maintained third-party middleware.
        *   Keep middleware dependencies up-to-date.
        *   Implement a principle of least privilege for middleware, ensuring it only has access to the necessary request and response data.
