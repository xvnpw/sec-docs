# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for tokio-rs/axum

## Mitigation Strategy: [Explicit Route Authorization using Axum Middleware](./mitigation_strategies/explicit_route_authorization_using_axum_middleware.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Define authorization logic within Axum middleware. This middleware will intercept requests *before* they reach route handlers.
    2.  Utilize Axum's request extractors (like `State`, `Request`, `HeaderMap`) within the middleware to access authentication tokens or session information.
    3.  Implement authorization checks based on extracted information. This could involve verifying JWTs, checking session cookies, or querying an authorization service.
    4.  Use Axum's `http::StatusCode` and `IntoResponse` to return appropriate HTTP error responses (e.g., 401 Unauthorized, 403 Forbidden) directly from the middleware if authorization fails, preventing the request from reaching the handler.
    5.  Apply this middleware selectively to specific routes or route groups using Axum's routing API (e.g., `.route().route_layer()`).
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Access (High Severity): Prevents access to Axum routes without proper authorization enforced by Axum's middleware.
    *   Data Breach (High Severity): Reduces risk of data exposure by controlling access at the Axum route level.
    *   Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity): Limits ability to access privileged Axum routes without proper credentials.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Access: High Reduction
    *   Data Breach: High Reduction
    *   Privilege Escalation: Medium Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   JWT-based authorization middleware using Axum's `Request` extractor and `State` is implemented in `src/middleware/auth.rs`.
    *   Applied to `/api/admin/*` and `/api/protected/*` routes in `src/main.rs` using `.route_layer(middleware::auth_middleware())`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Authorization middleware not yet applied to less critical routes under `/api/user/profile` in `src/main.rs`.
    *   More granular, data-level authorization *within* Axum handlers is missing; current middleware is route-level only.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation in Axum Handlers with Extractors](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation_in_axum_handlers_with_extractors.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Leverage Axum's extractors (`Json`, `Form`, `Query`, `Path`) to parse and extract user input within route handlers.
    2.  Immediately after extraction in the handler function, perform explicit validation on the extracted data.
    3.  Utilize Rust validation libraries or manual checks *within the Axum handler* to enforce data type, format, range, and required field constraints.
    4.  If validation fails within the Axum handler, use Axum's error handling mechanisms (e.g., returning a `Result` with a custom error type that implements `IntoResponse`) to return a `400 Bad Request` or similar error response.
    5.  Customize error responses using Axum's `IntoResponse` to provide informative but safe error messages to clients, avoiding internal server details.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Injection Vulnerabilities (High Severity): Prevents injection attacks by validating input extracted by Axum before processing.
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Medium Severity): Reduces XSS risk by validating input handled by Axum handlers.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity): Prevents DoS by rejecting malformed input early in Axum handlers.
    *   Business Logic Errors (Medium Severity): Improves application robustness by validating input processed by Axum handlers.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Injection Vulnerabilities: High Reduction
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Medium Reduction
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): Medium Reduction
    *   Business Logic Errors: Medium Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Input validation using `validator` crate on DTOs extracted by Axum's `Json` and `Form` extractors in handlers like `src/handlers/user.rs`.
    *   Axum extractors provide basic type coercion, implicitly validating data types.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Consistent validation for `Query` parameters across all Axum handlers is missing.
    *   More complex validation rules within Axum handlers are needed.
    *   Axum error responses for validation failures could be more user-friendly and consistent.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting Middleware in Axum](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_middleware_in_axum.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Implement rate limiting using Axum middleware. Choose a suitable rate limiting crate compatible with Axum/Tower ecosystem.
    2.  Configure the rate limiting middleware to apply to specific Axum routes or globally to the entire application.
    3.  Use Axum's routing system to apply the rate limiting middleware to sensitive routes (e.g., using `.route_layer()`).
    4.  Customize the rate limiting middleware's behavior, such as rate limits per IP address, user ID (if available via Axum extractors in middleware), or API key.
    5.  Ensure the middleware returns `429 Too Many Requests` responses using Axum's `http::StatusCode` and `IntoResponse` when rate limits are exceeded.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Brute-Force Attacks (High Severity): Axum middleware limits request frequency to sensitive routes.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) (High Severity): Axum middleware prevents request floods from overwhelming the application.
    *   API Abuse (Medium Severity): Axum middleware controls API usage rates.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Brute-Force Attacks: High Reduction
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): High Reduction
    *   API Abuse: Medium Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Rate limiting middleware (`tower-governor`) is implemented in `src/middleware/rate_limit.rs` and integrated with Axum.
    *   Applied to `/auth/login` route in `src/main.rs` using `.route_layer(middleware::rate_limit_middleware())`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Rate limiting middleware not applied to password reset routes in `src/main.rs`.
    *   Rate limits not configured for API endpoints under `/api/*` in `src/main.rs`.
    *   User-based rate limiting (beyond IP-based) within Axum middleware is not implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Custom Error Handling with Axum's `IntoResponse`](./mitigation_strategies/custom_error_handling_with_axum's__intoresponse_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Define custom error types in Rust and implement the `axum::response::IntoResponse` trait for these types.
    2.  Within your Axum handlers, use `Result` to propagate errors and return your custom error types when errors occur.
    3.  In the `IntoResponse` implementation for your error types, control how errors are converted into HTTP responses.
    4.  Specifically, within `IntoResponse`, avoid including sensitive information in the response body or headers. Return generic error messages and appropriate HTTP status codes using Axum's `http::StatusCode` and `Json` or `PlainText` response types.
    5.  Log detailed error information server-side (not in the response) for debugging and monitoring.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Information Disclosure (Medium Severity): Axum's `IntoResponse` is used to prevent leaking sensitive details in error responses.
    *   Security Misconfiguration (Low Severity): Reduces risk of revealing configuration via Axum error responses.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information Disclosure: Medium Reduction
    *   Security Misconfiguration: Low Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Custom error types in `src/errors.rs` implement `IntoResponse` for Axum error handling.
    *   Generic error messages are returned in Axum responses for most error scenarios using `IntoResponse`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Stack traces might still be logged to console in production, not fully controlled by Axum's `IntoResponse`.
    *   Database error sanitization in `IntoResponse` might be incomplete.
    *   Consistent error logging across all Axum handlers needs improvement.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure CORS Configuration using Axum Middleware](./mitigation_strategies/secure_cors_configuration_using_axum_middleware.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Utilize the `tower-http::cors::CorsLayer` middleware within your Axum application for CORS configuration.
    2.  Configure `CorsLayer` with specific allowed origins, methods, and headers using Axum's middleware setup. Avoid overly permissive wildcard configurations.
    3.  Apply the `CorsLayer` middleware to your Axum router using `.layer()` or `.route_layer()` to enforce CORS policies for your API endpoints.
    4.  Carefully manage `allow_credentials` setting in `CorsLayer` based on your application's needs and security requirements.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (Medium Severity): Axum's CORS middleware helps mitigate CSRF in specific scenarios.
    *   Unauthorized Data Access (Medium Severity): Axum's CORS middleware restricts cross-origin API access.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Medium Reduction
    *   Unauthorized Data Access: Medium Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   CORS middleware (`tower-http::cors::CorsLayer`) is implemented in `src/middleware/cors.rs` and used in Axum.
    *   Applied to the API router in `src/main.rs` using `.layer(middleware::cors_middleware())`.
    *   `allow_origins` configured for specific domains in `src/middleware/cors.rs`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `allow_methods` and `allow_headers` in `CorsLayer` are overly permissive (`AllowAll`) and need to be restricted in `src/middleware/cors.rs`.
    *   `allow_credentials(true)` in `CorsLayer` needs review and potential disabling in `src/middleware/cors.rs`.
    *   Dynamic CORS configuration based on environment is missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Custom Axum Middleware Implementation](./mitigation_strategies/secure_custom_axum_middleware_implementation.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  When developing custom Axum middleware, adhere to secure coding practices.
    2.  Thoroughly validate and sanitize any input processed within the middleware, even if it's intended for internal use.
    3.  Avoid introducing vulnerabilities like injection flaws, path traversal, or logic errors in your custom Axum middleware.
    4.  Test custom middleware rigorously, including security testing, to ensure it functions as intended and doesn't introduce new vulnerabilities.
    5.  Review and audit custom Axum middleware code regularly for potential security issues.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Various vulnerabilities (Severity depends on vulnerability): Custom Axum middleware can introduce any type of vulnerability if not implemented securely.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Impact depends on the specific vulnerability introduced by insecure middleware. Can range from Low to High.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Custom middleware for authorization and rate limiting are implemented in `src/middleware/auth.rs` and `src/middleware/rate_limit.rs`.
    *   Basic testing is performed for middleware functionality.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Dedicated security audits and penetration testing specifically targeting custom Axum middleware are missing.
    *   Formal code review process for custom middleware changes is not consistently enforced.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Careful Middleware Ordering in Axum](./mitigation_strategies/careful_middleware_ordering_in_axum.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Define the order of Axum middleware layers carefully, as the order in which middleware is applied is significant.
    2.  Generally, place security-related middleware (e.g., CORS, rate limiting, authentication, authorization, security headers) *early* in the middleware chain, before application-specific middleware or route handlers.
    3.  Ensure that authorization middleware comes *after* authentication middleware if authentication is a prerequisite for authorization.
    4.  Test different middleware orderings to verify the intended security behavior and prevent unintended bypasses or conflicts.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Authorization Bypass (High Severity): Incorrect middleware order can lead to authorization checks being bypassed.
    *   Security Feature Bypass (Medium Severity): Improper order can cause security features implemented in middleware to be ineffective.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Authorization Bypass: High Reduction (if ordering is correct) or High Risk (if ordering is incorrect)
    *   Security Feature Bypass: Medium Reduction (if ordering is correct) or Medium Risk (if ordering is incorrect)
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Middleware order is defined in `src/main.rs` when applying layers to the router.
    *   CORS middleware is applied before authorization middleware.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal documentation or justification for the current middleware ordering is missing.
    *   Testing specifically focused on validating the security implications of middleware order is lacking.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Request Body Size in Axum](./mitigation_strategies/limit_request_body_size_in_axum.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Use Axum's configuration options or middleware (e.g., `tower-http::limit::RequestBodyLimitLayer`) to enforce limits on the maximum allowed request body size.
    2.  Configure appropriate limits based on your application's needs and resource constraints. Consider different limits for different route types if necessary.
    3.  When request body size exceeds the limit, Axum or the middleware should automatically reject the request and return a `413 Payload Too Large` HTTP error response.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity): Prevents resource exhaustion from excessively large request bodies.
    *   Buffer Overflow (Low Severity): Reduces risk of buffer overflows related to processing large request bodies (though Rust's memory safety already mitigates this significantly).
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): Medium Reduction
    *   Buffer Overflow: Low Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Request body size limit is NOT currently implemented.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Request body size limit middleware (`tower-http::limit::RequestBodyLimitLayer`) needs to be added to `src/middleware/limit.rs` and applied to the router in `src/main.rs`.
    *   Appropriate request body size limits need to be determined and configured.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure File Upload Handling in Axum (if applicable)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_file_upload_handling_in_axum__if_applicable_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  If your Axum application handles file uploads (even indirectly through other crates integrated with Axum), implement secure file upload handling practices within your Axum handlers.
    2.  Use Axum extractors to handle multipart form data or other file upload mechanisms.
    3.  Within Axum handlers, implement validation for uploaded files:
        *   Limit file size.
        *   Validate file types based on content (using libraries like `infer` in Rust), not just extensions.
        *   Sanitize file names to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.
    4.  Store uploaded files securely, ideally outside the web server's document root and with appropriate access controls.
    5.  Consider using libraries specifically designed for secure file upload handling in Rust within your Axum application.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Arbitrary File Upload (High Severity): Prevents attackers from uploading malicious files to the server.
    *   Remote Code Execution (High Severity): Reduces risk of RCE through malicious file uploads.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity): Prevents DoS by limiting file sizes and rejecting malicious file types.
    *   Path Traversal (Medium Severity): Mitigates path traversal vulnerabilities through file name sanitization.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Arbitrary File Upload: High Reduction
    *   Remote Code Execution: High Reduction
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): Medium Reduction
    *   Path Traversal: Medium Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   File upload handling is NOT currently implemented in the Axum application.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Secure file upload handling logic needs to be implemented in Axum handlers if file upload functionality is required.
    *   Validation, sanitization, and secure storage mechanisms for uploaded files need to be implemented within Axum handlers.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Logging within Axum Handlers and Middleware](./mitigation_strategies/secure_logging_within_axum_handlers_and_middleware.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Implement comprehensive logging within your Axum handlers and middleware to record security-relevant events.
    2.  Use a logging library compatible with Rust and Axum (e.g., `tracing`, `log`).
    3.  Log events such as:
        *   Authentication successes and failures.
        *   Authorization violations.
        *   Input validation failures.
        *   Rate limiting events.
        *   Errors and exceptions in handlers and middleware.
        *   Suspicious activity or anomalies.
    4.  Ensure logs are stored securely and access is restricted to authorized personnel.
    5.  Regularly review logs for security monitoring and incident response.
    6.  Be careful *not* to log sensitive data directly in logs (e.g., passwords, API keys, PII). Log relevant context but redact sensitive information.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Insufficient Logging and Monitoring (Medium Severity): Improves detection and response to security incidents by providing audit trails.
    *   Delayed Incident Response (Medium Severity): Enables faster incident response through log analysis.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Insufficient Logging and Monitoring: Medium Reduction
    *   Delayed Incident Response: Medium Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic logging using `tracing` is implemented in `src/main.rs` for request/response information.
    *   Error logging is partially implemented in custom error handling in `src/errors.rs`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive logging of security-relevant events (authentication, authorization, validation failures, etc.) is missing in Axum handlers and middleware.
    *   Log storage and secure access controls are not fully implemented.
    *   Regular log review and security monitoring processes are not established.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege for Axum Routes](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_for_axum_routes.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Design Axum routes with the principle of least privilege in mind.
    2.  Define route paths and access permissions as narrowly as possible.
    3.  Avoid creating overly broad route patterns that might unintentionally expose sensitive endpoints or functionalities.
    4.  Implement specific routes for different functionalities and user roles, rather than relying on a few generic, broadly accessible routes.
    5.  Combine this with explicit route authorization (middleware) to enforce access control based on the defined route structure.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Access (High Severity): Reduces the attack surface by limiting route accessibility.
    *   Data Breach (High Severity): Minimizes potential data exposure by controlling route access.
    *   Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity): Makes privilege escalation harder by restricting route access based on privilege level.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Access: Medium Reduction
    *   Data Breach: Medium Reduction
    *   Privilege Escalation: Medium Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Route structure in `src/main.rs` is somewhat organized by functionality (auth, user, product, admin API).
    *   Admin and protected routes are separated under `/api/admin/*` and `/api/protected/*`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Route structure could be further refined to better reflect the principle of least privilege. Some routes might be more broadly accessible than necessary.
    *   Formal review of route definitions from a least privilege perspective is missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Route Parameter Handling in Axum](./mitigation_strategies/secure_route_parameter_handling_in_axum.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  When using Axum's `Path` extractor to capture route parameters, always validate and sanitize these parameters *within your Axum handlers*.
    2.  Do not directly use route parameters in database queries, file system operations, or other backend logic without proper validation and sanitization.
    3.  Validate data type, format, and range of route parameters.
    4.  Sanitize route parameters to prevent injection vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, path traversal). Use appropriate escaping or encoding techniques.
    5.  Handle invalid or malicious route parameters gracefully and return informative error responses using Axum's error handling.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Injection Vulnerabilities (High Severity): Prevents injection attacks through malicious route parameters.
    *   Path Traversal (Medium Severity): Mitigates path traversal vulnerabilities via route parameter sanitization.
    *   Business Logic Errors (Medium Severity): Reduces errors caused by invalid route parameters.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Injection Vulnerabilities: High Reduction
    *   Path Traversal: Medium Reduction
    *   Business Logic Errors: Medium Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic type validation might be implicitly done by Axum's `Path` extractor.
    *   Some handlers might perform manual validation of route parameters.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Consistent and thorough validation and sanitization of route parameters are missing across all Axum handlers using `Path` extractor.
    *   Specific sanitization functions or libraries are not consistently used for route parameters.
    *   Error handling for invalid route parameters could be more robust and consistent.
