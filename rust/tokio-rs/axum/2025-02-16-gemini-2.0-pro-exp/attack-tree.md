# Attack Tree Analysis for tokio-rs/axum

Objective: To achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) or Denial of Service (DoS) on the Axum-based application by exploiting vulnerabilities specific to the Axum framework or its dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: [!]C3: Dependency Vulnerabilities (in Middleware/Layers)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node__!_c3_dependency_vulnerabilities__in_middlewarelayers_.md)

*   **Likelihood:** High.  Dependencies are frequently updated, and new vulnerabilities are regularly discovered in popular libraries.  Axum, being built on top of other crates (like `hyper` and `tokio`), inherits their potential vulnerabilities.  The more dependencies an application has, the higher the likelihood that at least one will have a known or zero-day vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** High to Critical.  A vulnerability in a dependency can range from information disclosure to complete system compromise (RCE).  The impact depends entirely on the specific vulnerability.  A vulnerability in a core component like `hyper` could be catastrophic.
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium.  Exploiting a known vulnerability often requires minimal effort, as proof-of-concept code or even automated exploit tools may be publicly available.  Exploiting a zero-day requires significantly more effort and skill.
*   **Skill Level:** Variable.  Exploiting a known vulnerability can be done by script kiddies using publicly available tools.  Discovering and exploiting a zero-day requires advanced skills.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High.  While vulnerability scanners can detect known vulnerabilities, zero-days are by definition unknown.  Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) might detect exploit attempts, but sophisticated attackers can often bypass these.  Log analysis can reveal suspicious activity, but requires careful configuration and monitoring.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Axum Middleware/Layers -> Vulnerable Dependency (C3a)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_axum_middlewarelayers_-_vulnerable_dependency__c3a_.md)

*   **Description:** This path represents the attacker exploiting a known vulnerability in a dependency used by the Axum application, either directly or indirectly (through middleware or a library).  This is the most likely path to a successful attack.
*   **Detailed Steps (Example - Hypothetical Vulnerability in `hyper`):**
    1.  **Reconnaissance:** The attacker identifies the target application and, through various techniques (e.g., HTTP headers, error messages, fingerprinting), determines that it's built using Axum.
    2.  **Vulnerability Research:** The attacker researches known vulnerabilities in Axum and its common dependencies (e.g., `hyper`, `tokio`, `serde`). They find a hypothetical vulnerability in `hyper` that allows for a buffer overflow when handling a specially crafted HTTP request.
    3.  **Exploit Development/Acquisition:** The attacker either develops an exploit for the vulnerability or finds a publicly available one (e.g., on Exploit-DB, GitHub, or security forums).
    4.  **Exploit Delivery:** The attacker sends the crafted HTTP request to the Axum application.
    5.  **Exploitation:** The vulnerable `hyper` code within Axum's request handling process is triggered, leading to a buffer overflow.
    6.  **Payload Execution:** Depending on the vulnerability, the attacker might achieve:
        *   **RCE:** The attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise.
        *   **DoS:** The attacker crashes the application or makes it unresponsive, denying service to legitimate users.
    7.  **Post-Exploitation:** If RCE is achieved, the attacker might install backdoors, steal data, pivot to other systems, or use the compromised server for further attacks.

*   **Mitigation (Specific to this path):**
    *   **Regular Dependency Updates:**  This is the *most crucial* mitigation.  Use `cargo update` frequently and consider automated dependency update tools.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Employ tools like `cargo audit`, Snyk, or OWASP Dependency-Check to automatically identify known vulnerabilities in your dependencies.
    *   **Dependency Pinning (with caution):**  While pinning dependencies can provide stability, it also means you won't automatically get security updates.  Use with caution and have a robust process for updating pinned dependencies.
    *   **Runtime Monitoring:**  Use tools that can detect and potentially block exploit attempts at runtime (e.g., Web Application Firewalls (WAFs), Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP)).
    *   **Least Privilege:** Run the application with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of a successful exploit.
    *   **Security Hardening:**  Follow general security best practices for the operating system and any other software running on the server.
