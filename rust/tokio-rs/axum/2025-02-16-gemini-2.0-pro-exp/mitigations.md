# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for tokio-rs/axum

## Mitigation Strategy: [Middleware Ordering and Logic Review](./mitigation_strategies/middleware_ordering_and_logic_review.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Document the Pipeline:** Create documentation outlining the order of Axum middleware execution using `.layer()`. Describe each middleware's purpose, inputs, outputs, and dependencies.
2.  **Code Comments:** Add comments *before* each `.layer()` call in your router definition, explaining the middleware's role.
3.  **Unit Tests (Order-Specific):** Create unit tests that verify the *order* of middleware execution. Use a test framework and potentially test-specific middleware to inspect the request/response flow.
4.  **Integration Tests (End-to-End):** Write integration tests simulating user requests to verify the entire middleware chain's behavior, including security checks.
5.  **Code Review:** During code reviews, explicitly check the middleware order and logic for potential bypasses.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Bypassing Authentication/Authorization:** (Severity: Critical) - Incorrect order can allow unauthorized access.
*   **Data Leakage:** (Severity: High) - Middleware logging sensitive data *before* authentication could expose it.
*   **Logic Errors in Custom Middleware:** (Severity: Variable, up to Critical) - Flaws in custom Axum middleware.

**Impact:**
*   **Bypassing Authentication/Authorization:** Risk reduced significantly (Critical to Low).
*   **Data Leakage:** Risk reduced significantly (High to Low).
*   **Logic Errors:** Risk reduced moderately (severity depends on the error).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Basic middleware order is correct (authentication before authorization).
*   Some unit tests for individual middleware, but not order-specific.
*   Inconsistent code comments.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Dedicated documentation of the middleware pipeline.
*   Order-specific unit tests.
*   Comprehensive integration tests.
*   Formal code review checklist item.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Extractor Usage and Validation](./mitigation_strategies/strict_extractor_usage_and_validation.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Define Precise Types:** Use specific types (e.g., `u32`, custom enums) in structs representing expected input, rather than generic types like `String`, for use with Axum extractors.
2.  **Use a Validation Library:** Integrate a library like `validator` or `garde`. Add validation attributes (e.g., `#[validate(length(min = 1))]`) to struct fields used with Axum extractors like `Json`, `Query`, `Path`.
3.  **Handle Validation Errors:** After using an extractor (e.g., `Json(payload)`), call the validation method (e.g., `payload.validate()?`). Return a structured error response (e.g., JSON with error details) if validation fails. Log the error.
4.  **Custom Extractors (if needed):** If creating custom Axum extractors, implement `FromRequest` or `FromRequestParts` carefully, including thorough input validation.
5.  **Unit Tests (Extractor-Specific):** Write unit tests targeting Axum extractors, providing valid and invalid input to test extraction and error handling.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Injection Attacks (various types):** (Severity: Critical) - Validation prevents malicious data injection.
*   **Type Confusion:** (Severity: High) - Precise types and validation prevent unexpected data types.
*   **Business Logic Errors:** (Severity: Variable) - Validation enforces business rules.
*   **Panic-Induced Denial of Service:** (Severity: Medium) - Validation prevents input that could cause panics.

**Impact:**
*   **Injection Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced (Critical to Low).
*   **Type Confusion:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low).
*   **Business Logic Errors:** Risk reduced moderately to significantly.
*   **Panic-Induced DoS:** Risk significantly reduced (Medium to Low).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Basic type definitions used for request payloads.
*   `validator` crate is a dependency.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   `validator` attributes not consistently applied.
*   Inconsistent error handling for validation failures.
*   No unit tests specifically targeting extractor validation.
*   Custom extractors (if any) lack thorough validation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure State Management (using Axum's `State`)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_state_management__using_axum's__state__.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Shared State:** Identify all data stored in the Axum application state (accessed via `State`).
2.  **Choose Concurrency Primitives:** For each piece of shared state, use `Mutex`, `RwLock`, or `tokio::sync::Mutex` for appropriate concurrency control.
3.  **Implement Locking:** Wrap access to the shared state with the chosen lock (e.g., `state.lock().await`). Minimize lock duration.
4.  **Minimize State:** Avoid storing unnecessary data in the Axum `State`. Consider external storage for data not needing to be in memory.
5.  **Bound State Size:** If the state includes collections, implement limits (LRU caching, time-based eviction).
6.  **Unit Tests (Concurrency):** Simulate concurrent access to the shared state to verify locking.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Race Conditions:** (Severity: High) - Concurrent access without locking can corrupt data.
*   **Data Leakage:** (Severity: High) - Improper access control to state.
*   **Denial of Service (State Exhaustion):** (Severity: Medium) - Unbounded state growth.

**Impact:**
*   **Race Conditions:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low).
*   **Data Leakage:** Risk reduced based on data sensitivity and access controls.
*   **Denial of Service:** Risk significantly reduced (Medium to Low).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Application state stores a database connection pool (`sqlx::PgPool`).
*   `tokio::sync::Mutex` protects the connection pool.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   No other shared state currently used.
*   No specific unit tests for concurrent access to the pool (covered implicitly by integration tests).
*   No explicit bounds on collection sizes within the state (not applicable currently).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Robust `FromRequest` Implementation (if applicable)](./mitigation_strategies/robust__fromrequest__implementation__if_applicable_.md)

**Description:** (Only applies if you have *custom* `FromRequest` or `FromRequestParts` implementations in Axum.)
1.  **Code Review:** Thoroughly review custom `FromRequest` implementations, focusing on input validation, error handling, and vulnerabilities.
2.  **Unit Tests (Comprehensive):** Extensive unit tests covering all input scenarios: valid, invalid, missing data, edge cases, error conditions.
3.  **Security Audit (if critical):** If the extractor handles sensitive data or performs security-critical operations, consider a formal audit.
4.  **Follow Secure Coding Practices:** Avoid unsafe code unless justified. Use appropriate error handling (don't panic). Validate all input.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Injection Attacks:** (Severity: Critical) - Flaws could allow malicious data injection.
*   **Authentication/Authorization Bypass:** (Severity: Critical) - If involved in auth, flaws could allow bypass.
*   **Denial of Service:** (Severity: Medium) - Poorly written extractors could be vulnerable.
*   **Logic Errors:** (Severity: Variable) - Any logic errors could lead to vulnerabilities.

**Impact:**
*   Depends on the extractor's function. For security-critical extractors, risk reduction is significant (Critical to Low).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   No custom `FromRequest` implementations are used.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   N/A (no custom extractors).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Denial of Service (DoS) Mitigation (Axum-Specific Aspects)](./mitigation_strategies/denial_of_service__dos__mitigation__axum-specific_aspects_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Request Body Size Limits:** Use Axum's `ContentLengthLimit` extractor or custom middleware to limit request body sizes. Return a 413 Payload Too Large error if exceeded.  This is directly integrated with Axum's request handling.
2. **Rate Limiting (using Axum compatible middleware):** Implement rate limiting using middleware like `tower-governor` *within your Axum application*. Configure limits based on IP, user ID, etc. Return 429 Too Many Requests.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Large Request Body Attacks:** (Severity: Medium) - Limits prevent excessively large requests.
*   **Brute-Force Attacks:** (Severity: Medium) - Rate limiting mitigates brute-force (e.g., on login).
*   **General DoS:** (Severity: Medium to High) - Contributes to overall DoS resilience.

**Impact:**
*   Significantly reduces DoS attack risk. Impact depends on attack type and configuration.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   `ContentLengthLimit` is used on endpoints with file uploads.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   No rate limiting is implemented.
