# Attack Surface Analysis for tokio-rs/axum

## Attack Surface: [Overly Permissive Route Definitions](./attack_surfaces/overly_permissive_route_definitions.md)

*   **Description:** Routes that are too broad or lack sufficient validation can expose unintended handlers or resources to unauthorized access.
    *   **How Axum Contributes:** Axum's flexible routing system, while powerful, requires careful configuration to avoid unintended exposure. Features like wildcards (`*`), path parameters, and nested routers can easily be misused, directly leading to this vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** A route defined as `/users/{user_id}` without validating `user_id` could allow an attacker to access any user's data. `/admin/*` without authentication.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, execution of privileged operations, potential for complete system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Use the most specific route definitions possible. Avoid broad wildcards. Implement robust input validation *within* handlers for *all* data extracted from the path. Use authentication and authorization middleware *before* sensitive handlers. Regularly audit route definitions.

## Attack Surface: [Extractor-Based Input Validation Bypass](./attack_surfaces/extractor-based_input_validation_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Relying solely on Axum's extractors for type safety without performing subsequent input validation can allow malicious data to be processed.
    *   **How Axum Contributes:** Axum's extractors are a core feature for handling request data.  The vulnerability arises from the *misunderstanding* that extractors perform validation beyond basic deserialization. This is a direct consequence of how Axum's extractors are designed and used.
    *   **Example:** An extractor deserializes a JSON payload, but a string field contains an XSS payload. A `Path` extractor retrieves a user ID, but the ID is not checked for validity or authorization.
    *   **Impact:** XSS, SQL injection, command injection, other application-specific vulnerabilities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Always perform thorough input validation *after* using an extractor. Use validation libraries. Sanitize data before use. Implement size limits on extracted data.

## Attack Surface: [Middleware Misconfiguration (Ordering)](./attack_surfaces/middleware_misconfiguration__ordering_.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrect middleware ordering can create security vulnerabilities, bypassing security checks.
    *   **How Axum Contributes:** Axum's middleware system and its execution order are fundamental to its request handling pipeline.  Incorrect ordering is a direct misconfiguration of Axum's features.
    *   **Example:** Placing authentication middleware *after* logging middleware, leading to sensitive data being logged before authentication.
    *   **Impact:** Bypass of security controls (authentication, authorization), information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Carefully plan the order of middleware. Place security-related middleware (authentication, authorization, input validation) *before* other middleware. Thoroughly test the middleware stack.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Request Handling (Extractor Limits)](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_request_handling__extractor_limits_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can exploit Axum's request handling, specifically through extractors, to exhaust server resources.
    *   **How Axum Contributes:** While Axum uses asynchronous processing, the *lack of limits within Axum's extractors* directly contributes to this vulnerability.  Axum provides the *mechanism* (extractors) that, without proper configuration, enables the attack.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sending a very large JSON payload to an endpoint using `axum::Json` without any size limits (e.g., `ContentLengthLimit`) configured.
    *   **Impact:** Service unavailability, degraded performance.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Use `ContentLengthLimit` (or similar extractors with built-in limits) to restrict the size of request bodies *within Axum*. This is a mitigation *directly* within Axum's control.
