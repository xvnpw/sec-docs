# Threat Model Analysis for tokio-rs/axum

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Unbounded Request Body Size](./threats/denial_of_service_via_unbounded_request_body_size.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can send extremely large requests to the Axum application. If request body size limits are not configured, processing these large requests can exhaust server resources (CPU, memory, bandwidth), leading to service disruption or application crash. Axum extractors like `Json`, `Form`, and `Bytes` are affected as they handle request bodies.
*   **Impact:** Service disruption, performance degradation, resource exhaustion, potential application crash.
*   **Affected Axum Component:** Extractors (`axum::extract::{Json, Form, Bytes}`)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Configure request body size limits using middleware like `tower_http::limit::RequestBodyLimitLayer`.
    *   Implement timeouts for request processing to prevent indefinite resource consumption.
    *   Consider streaming extractors for very large bodies if full buffering is not necessary.

## Threat: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Extractors](./threats/deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_extractors.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can craft malicious input within request bodies (e.g., JSON, form data) to exploit vulnerabilities in deserialization libraries used by Axum extractors (like `serde_json` for `Json` or `serde_urlencoded` for `Form`). This can lead to application crashes, information disclosure, or potentially remote code execution. Axum extractors `Json` and `Form` are directly involved as they use these libraries for deserialization.
*   **Impact:** Application crash, information disclosure, potential remote code execution, data corruption.
*   **Affected Axum Component:** Extractors (`axum::extract::{Json, Form}`) and underlying deserialization libraries.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep dependencies, especially deserialization libraries (`serde_json`, `serde_urlencoded`), up-to-date.
    *   Implement input validation *after* deserialization to ensure data conforms to expected schemas.
    *   Consider using more robust and security-focused deserialization libraries if applicable.

## Threat: [Middleware Bypass due to Configuration Errors](./threats/middleware_bypass_due_to_configuration_errors.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrect configuration of Axum middleware can lead to security middleware (e.g., authentication, authorization) not being applied to certain routes or request types. An attacker can exploit this to bypass security controls and access protected resources or functionality. Axum's middleware system (`axum::middleware`) and routing configuration are directly involved.
*   **Impact:** Bypass of security controls, unauthorized access to protected resources, exposure of vulnerabilities.
*   **Affected Axum Component:** Middleware (`axum::middleware`) and application routing configuration.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully review middleware application logic and ensure it's applied to all intended routes.
    *   Use Axum's testing features to verify middleware is correctly applied.
    *   Structure middleware application clearly to minimize configuration errors.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion due to Unbounded Asynchronous Tasks](./threats/resource_exhaustion_due_to_unbounded_asynchronous_tasks.md)

*   **Description:** Axum handlers or middleware might spawn unbounded asynchronous tasks using `tokio::spawn`. An attacker can trigger the creation of many such tasks, leading to resource exhaustion (memory, CPU, file descriptors) and denial of service. While `tokio::spawn` is from Tokio, the context of unbounded tasks within Axum handlers/middleware makes it a direct Axum threat.
*   **Impact:** Service disruption, resource exhaustion, application instability, potential denial of service.
*   **Affected Axum Component:** Asynchronous task spawning within handlers and middleware (using `tokio::spawn` in Axum context).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully manage asynchronous tasks and ensure they are bounded or limited.
    *   Implement task cancellation and timeouts to prevent runaway tasks.
    *   Monitor resource usage to detect and address potential unbounded task issues.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Tokio Ecosystem Crates](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_tokio_ecosystem_crates.md)

*   **Description:** Axum relies on crates from the Tokio ecosystem (e.g., `tokio`, `hyper`, `tower`, `http`). Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can indirectly affect Axum applications. An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities if present in the application's dependencies. While not Axum code itself, the dependency on these crates is fundamental to Axum.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, could range from information disclosure to remote code execution.
*   **Affected Axum Component:** Dependencies (`tokio`, `hyper`, `tower`, `http`, etc.)
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update dependencies, including Tokio ecosystem crates.
    *   Monitor security advisories for Tokio and related crates.
    *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify and manage vulnerabilities.
