## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Compromise Axum Application](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_compromise_axum_application.md)

This is the overarching goal and inherently a high-risk path as it represents the attacker successfully compromising the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Routing Logic Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_routing_logic_vulnerabilities.md)

Attack Description: Exploiting weaknesses in how Axum application routes are defined and processed. This can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Route Parameter Injection](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_route_parameter_injection.md)

Attack Description: Manipulating route parameters to cause unexpected behavior, often due to insufficient validation and sanitization of these parameters.

*   **Critical Node: Bypass Authorization Checks (e.g., `/users/{user_id}` where `user_id` is not properly validated)**
    *   Attack Vector: Attacker modifies the `user_id` parameter in the URL to access resources belonging to other users or administrators, bypassing intended authorization mechanisms.
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: High (Unauthorized Access)
    *   Actionable Insight: Strictly validate and sanitize all route parameters. Use strong typing and validation libraries. Avoid directly using route parameters in security-sensitive logic without proper checks.

*   **Critical Node: Access Sensitive Data (e.g., `/files/{file_path}` where `file_path` allows traversal)**
    *   Attack Vector: Attacker manipulates the `file_path` parameter to access files outside of the intended directory, potentially reading sensitive configuration files or application data.
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: High (Data Breach)
    *   Actionable Insight: Never directly construct file paths from user-provided input (including route parameters) without rigorous sanitization and validation. Use secure file serving mechanisms.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Handler Logic Vulnerabilities (Indirectly Axum-related, but triggered via Axum)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_handler_logic_vulnerabilities__indirectly_axum-related__but_triggered_via_axu_187f4c46.md)

Attack Description: Exploiting vulnerabilities within the application's business logic implemented in Axum handlers. While not Axum-specific, Axum routes are the entry points for these attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Vulnerabilities in Handler Functions (Business Logic Flaws)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_vulnerabilities_in_handler_functions__business_logic_flaws_.md)

Attack Description: Exploiting application-specific logic flaws within handler functions to achieve unauthorized actions or data manipulation.
Actionable Insight: Apply secure coding practices in handler functions. Conduct thorough code reviews and security testing of application logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Resource Exhaustion in Handlers](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_resource_exhaustion_in_handlers.md)

Attack Description: Sending requests that trigger computationally expensive operations within handlers, leading to denial of service.

*   **Critical Node: Cause Denial of Service by overloading server resources**
    *   Attack Vector: Attacker sends requests designed to trigger resource-intensive handler functions, overwhelming the server and causing a denial of service.
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: Medium (DoS)
    *   Actionable Insight: Optimize handler performance. Avoid unnecessary computations or blocking operations. Implement timeouts for long-running handlers.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Dependency Vulnerabilities within Handlers](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_dependency_vulnerabilities_within_handlers.md)

Attack Description: Exploiting known vulnerabilities in third-party crates used within handler functions.

*   **Critical Node: Gain code execution or data access (Beyond Axum scope, but context is Axum handler)**
    *   Attack Vector: Exploiting a known vulnerability in a dependency used by a handler function to gain code execution on the server or access sensitive data.
    *   Likelihood: Low (Depends on dependency management)
    *   Impact: Critical (Code Execution, Data Breach)
    *   Actionable Insight: Regularly audit and update dependencies. Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Extractor Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_extractor_vulnerabilities.md)

Attack Description: Exploiting vulnerabilities related to Axum's extractors, which parse user input from requests.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Injection Attacks via Extractors](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_injection_attacks_via_extractors.md)

Attack Description: Injecting malicious code or commands through data extracted by Axum extractors, especially when this data is used in backend operations without sanitization.

*   **Critical Node: SQL Injection via `Query` or `Form` extractors (if directly used in queries without sanitization)**
    *   Attack Vector: Attacker injects malicious SQL code through `Query` or `Form` parameters, which are then directly used in database queries, leading to unauthorized database access and data manipulation.
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: Critical (Database Compromise, Data Breach)
    *   Actionable Insight: Sanitize and validate all data extracted using Axum extractors. Use parameterized queries or ORMs to prevent SQL injection.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Denial of Service via Extractor Processing](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_denial_of_service_via_extractor_processing.md)

Attack Description: Causing denial of service by sending requests with payloads that are resource-intensive to process by Axum extractors.

*   **Critical Node: Overload server resources parsing and processing data**
    *   Attack Vector: Attacker sends excessively large payloads to `Json`, `Form`, or `Bytes` extractors, overloading server resources during parsing and processing, leading to denial of service.
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: Medium (DoS)
    *   Actionable Insight: Implement request size limits. Configure limits on the size of request bodies accepted by extractors.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Error Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_error_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

Attack Description: Exploiting weaknesses in error handling mechanisms to gain information or cause denial of service.

*   **Critical Node: Information Disclosure via Error Messages**
    *   Attack Vector: Triggering errors that reveal sensitive information in error responses, such as internal paths, configuration details, or database schema, aiding in further attacks.
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: Medium (Information Leakage, Reconnaissance)
    *   Actionable Insight: Implement custom error handling. Avoid exposing detailed error messages to clients in production.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Dependencies Vulnerabilities (Indirectly Axum-related, but crucial)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_dependencies_vulnerabilities__indirectly_axum-related__but_crucial_.md)

Attack Description: Exploiting known vulnerabilities in the underlying crates that Axum depends on, such as Tokio, Hyper, and Serde.

*   **Critical Node: Exploit known vulnerabilities in underlying crates used by Axum**
    *   Attack Vector: Exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities in dependencies like Tokio, Hyper, or Serde to gain code execution, cause denial of service, or access data within the Axum application.
    *   Likelihood: Low (but vulnerabilities do occur)
    *   Impact: Critical (Code Execution, DoS, Data Breach)
    *   Actionable Insight: Stay updated with security advisories for Axum's dependencies. Regularly update dependencies to the latest versions with security patches.
