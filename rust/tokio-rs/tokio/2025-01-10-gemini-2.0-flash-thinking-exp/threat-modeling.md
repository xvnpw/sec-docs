# Threat Model Analysis for tokio-rs/tokio

## Threat: [Asynchronous Race Condition leading to Data Corruption](./threats/asynchronous_race_condition_leading_to_data_corruption.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might exploit a race condition in asynchronous tasks managed by Tokio accessing shared mutable data. By carefully timing concurrent operations orchestrated by the Tokio runtime, they could manipulate the order of execution to cause data corruption or inconsistent state. For example, two tasks spawned by `tokio::spawn` might try to update a shared counter, and due to the race facilitated by Tokio's concurrency, the final value is incorrect.
    *   **Impact:** Data integrity is compromised, leading to incorrect application behavior, potential financial loss, or security vulnerabilities if the corrupted data is used for authorization or access control.
    *   **Affected Tokio Component:** `tokio::spawn`, `async` blocks, Tokio's task scheduler.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use appropriate synchronization primitives provided by Tokio like `tokio::sync::Mutex`, `tokio::sync::RwLock`, or atomic operations.
        *   Minimize shared mutable state within tasks spawned by Tokio. Prefer immutable data structures and message passing using Tokio's channels.
        *   Carefully design asynchronous workflows managed by Tokio to avoid overlapping access to critical data.
        *   Thoroughly test concurrent code executed by the Tokio runtime with tools like `loom` to detect potential race conditions.

## Threat: [Deadlock in Asynchronous Tasks](./threats/deadlock_in_asynchronous_tasks.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could trigger a scenario where two or more asynchronous tasks managed by the Tokio runtime become blocked indefinitely, waiting for each other to release resources (e.g., acquiring locks provided by `tokio::sync` in a circular dependency). This could be achieved by sending specific sequences of requests or inputs that exploit the task scheduling and resource management of Tokio.
    *   **Impact:** The application becomes unresponsive, leading to denial of service. Critical operations managed by the Tokio runtime are stalled, impacting availability.
    *   **Affected Tokio Component:** `tokio::sync::Mutex`, `tokio::sync::RwLock`, `tokio::sync::mpsc` channels, `tokio::sync::oneshot` channels, Tokio's task scheduler.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid circular dependencies in resource acquisition within Tokio tasks. Establish a clear order for acquiring locks provided by `tokio::sync`.
        *   Implement timeouts for acquiring locks provided by `tokio::sync` to prevent indefinite blocking within the Tokio runtime.
        *   Carefully design communication patterns between asynchronous tasks managed by Tokio to avoid situations where tasks are waiting on each other indefinitely.
        *   Use tools and techniques for deadlock detection during development, specifically considering the asynchronous nature of Tokio.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Unbounded Task Spawning](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_unbounded_task_spawning.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit a vulnerability that allows them to trigger the creation of an excessive number of asynchronous tasks using `tokio::spawn` or `tokio::task::spawn_local`. This could be done by sending a large number of requests that overwhelm Tokio's task scheduler or exploiting a logic flaw that spawns new Tokio tasks uncontrollably.
    *   **Impact:** The application consumes excessive system resources (CPU, memory) managed by the Tokio runtime, leading to performance degradation, crashes, and denial of service.
    *   **Affected Tokio Component:** `tokio::spawn`, `tokio::task::spawn_local`, Tokio's task scheduler.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement limits on the number of concurrent tasks that can be spawned using Tokio's spawning functions.
        *   Implement proper input validation and sanitization to prevent malicious inputs from triggering excessive Tokio task creation.
        *   Use techniques like task queues with bounded capacity to manage the execution of tasks within the Tokio runtime.
        *   Monitor resource usage of the Tokio runtime and implement alerts for unusual task creation patterns.

## Threat: [Denial of Service through Asynchronous Backpressure Exploitation](./threats/denial_of_service_through_asynchronous_backpressure_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could overwhelm the application by sending data or requests to Tokio network listeners (`tokio::net`) at a rate faster than the application can process them asynchronously. This could exploit a lack of proper backpressure handling within the Tokio application, causing the application to buffer excessive amounts of data in Tokio's buffers, leading to memory exhaustion and denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** The application becomes unresponsive or crashes due to memory exhaustion within the Tokio runtime. Legitimate requests handled by Tokio are not processed.
    *   **Affected Tokio Component:** `tokio::net` (TCP, UDP listeners/streams), `tokio::sync::mpsc` channels, `futures::stream::Stream` trait, `futures::sink::Sink` trait (as used with Tokio).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement backpressure mechanisms using bounded Tokio channels or signaling to slow down data producers interacting with Tokio streams.
        *   Use Tokio's `Sink` and `Stream` abstractions with appropriate buffering strategies when handling network I/O with Tokio.
        *   Set limits on the amount of data buffered in memory by Tokio components.
        *   Implement rate limiting for incoming requests or data streams handled by Tokio.

## Threat: [Security Vulnerabilities in Asynchronous Network Protocol Implementations Relying on Tokio](./threats/security_vulnerabilities_in_asynchronous_network_protocol_implementations_relying_on_tokio.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in the implementation of asynchronous network protocols (e.g., HTTP/2, WebSocket) that are built using Tokio's networking primitives. This could involve sending malformed packets or exploiting protocol-specific weaknesses within libraries that utilize `tokio::net`.
    *   **Impact:** Various impacts depending on the vulnerability, including information disclosure, remote code execution, or denial of service within the Tokio-based application.
    *   **Affected Tokio Component:** `tokio::net` (TCP listeners/streams), crates built on top of Tokio for specific protocols (e.g., `tokio-tungstenite`, `hyper` when used with its Tokio runtime).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use well-vetted and up-to-date crates for implementing network protocols that are compatible with Tokio.
        *   Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities in libraries relying on Tokio.
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for data received over the network through Tokio's networking facilities.
        *   Follow security best practices for the specific network protocols being used in conjunction with Tokio.
