## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Abuse Asynchronous I/O -> Connection Exhaustion](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_abuse_asynchronous_io_-_connection_exhaustion.md)

* Attack Vector: Connection Exhaustion
    * Description: An attacker opens a large number of connections to the application server without properly closing them. This can be done by repeatedly sending connection requests or by manipulating the connection lifecycle.
    * Goal: To exhaust the server's resources, specifically file descriptors or network connection limits, preventing it from accepting new legitimate connections.
    * Steps:
        1. Send numerous connection requests to the application.
        2. Avoid closing the established connections or close them very slowly.
        3. The server's resources for handling connections become depleted.
        4. Legitimate users are unable to connect, resulting in a denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Abuse Asynchronous Task Management -> Resource Exhaustion via Task Spawning](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_abuse_asynchronous_task_management_-_resource_exhaustion_via_task_spawning.md)

* Attack Vector: Resource Exhaustion via Task Spawning
    * Description: An attacker triggers the creation of an excessive number of asynchronous tasks within the Tokio runtime. This can be achieved by sending requests or events that the application processes by spawning new tasks.
    * Goal: To overwhelm the Tokio scheduler and/or available memory, leading to performance degradation or application crashes.
    * Steps:
        1. Identify application endpoints or events that trigger the creation of new Tokio tasks.
        2. Send a large volume of requests or events to these endpoints.
        3. The application spawns an uncontrolled number of tasks.
        4. The Tokio scheduler becomes overloaded, or the application runs out of memory.
        5. The application slows down significantly or crashes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Abuse Asynchronous I/O -> Denial of Service via Large Data Streams](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_abuse_asynchronous_io_-_denial_of_service_via_large_data_streams.md)

* Attack Vector: Denial of Service via Large Data Streams
    * Description: An attacker sends extremely large data streams to the application through its network interfaces.
    * Goal: To overwhelm the application's memory or processing capacity, leading to slowdowns or crashes.
    * Steps:
        1. Identify application endpoints that accept data input.
        2. Send requests with excessively large payloads.
        3. The application attempts to allocate memory or process the large data stream.
        4. The application's resources are exhausted.
        5. The application slows down or crashes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Unsafe Code or FFI Interactions](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_unsafe_code_or_ffi_interactions.md)

* Attack Vector: Exploiting Unsafe Code or FFI Interactions
    * Description: The application utilizes `unsafe` blocks in Rust or interacts with external libraries through Foreign Function Interfaces (FFI). These areas bypass Rust's safety guarantees and can introduce vulnerabilities.
    * Goal: To exploit memory safety issues or vulnerabilities in external libraries to achieve arbitrary code execution or cause crashes.
    * Steps:
        1. Identify `unsafe` blocks or FFI calls within the application's codebase, particularly those related to Tokio or asynchronous operations.
        2. Analyze these sections for potential vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, use-after-free errors, or incorrect handling of external library interfaces.
        3. Craft specific inputs or trigger specific conditions that exploit these vulnerabilities.
        4. This can lead to memory corruption, allowing the attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code or cause the application to crash.
