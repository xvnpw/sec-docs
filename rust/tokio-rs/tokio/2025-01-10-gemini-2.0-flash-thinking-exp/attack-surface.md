# Attack Surface Analysis for tokio-rs/tokio

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion through Event Loop Overload](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_through_event_loop_overload.md)

**Description:** An attacker overwhelms the Tokio event loop with a large number of tasks or events, causing the application to become unresponsive.

**How Tokio Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Tokio's single-threaded event loop is the central processing unit for all asynchronous operations. If this loop is blocked or overloaded, the entire application stalls.

**Example:** A malicious client repeatedly sends connection requests without completing handshakes, or floods the server with small, rapid requests that generate numerous tasks.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), application unresponsiveness, inability to process legitimate requests.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* Implement connection rate limiting and request throttling.
* Set timeouts for connections and operations.
* Use appropriate backpressure mechanisms to handle incoming data.
* Monitor event loop performance and resource usage.
* Employ load balancing to distribute traffic across multiple instances.

## Attack Surface: [Unbounded Task Spawning](./attack_surfaces/unbounded_task_spawning.md)

**Description:** An attacker triggers the creation of an excessive number of Tokio tasks, leading to memory exhaustion and potential crashes.

**How Tokio Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Tokio's `spawn` function allows for easy creation of new asynchronous tasks. If the number of spawned tasks is not controlled, it can be abused.

**Example:** User input directly controls the number of tasks spawned for processing without any limits or validation. A malicious user could provide a very large number, causing the application to allocate excessive memory.

**Impact:** Memory exhaustion, application crash, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* Implement limits on the number of concurrent tasks.
* Use task queues with bounded capacity.
* Validate and sanitize any input that influences task creation.
* Implement backpressure to regulate the rate of task creation.

## Attack Surface: [Abuse of Tokio's Networking Primitives](./attack_surfaces/abuse_of_tokio's_networking_primitives.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in how the application uses Tokio's networking features (TCP, UDP, Unix sockets).

**How Tokio Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Tokio provides the building blocks for asynchronous networking. Misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in their usage can be exploited.

**Example:**

* **TCP SYN Flooding:** An attacker sends a large number of SYN packets without completing the handshake, exhausting server resources.
* **UDP Amplification Attacks:** An attacker sends small UDP requests to vulnerable servers with a spoofed source address, causing the servers to send large responses to the target.
* **Unbounded Connection Handling:** The application doesn't limit the number of concurrent connections, allowing an attacker to exhaust resources.

**Impact:** Denial of Service, resource exhaustion, network congestion.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* Implement SYN cookies or other SYN flood protection mechanisms.
* Properly configure network interfaces and firewalls.
* Limit the number of concurrent connections.
* Implement backpressure mechanisms for network streams.
* Validate and sanitize data received over the network.
