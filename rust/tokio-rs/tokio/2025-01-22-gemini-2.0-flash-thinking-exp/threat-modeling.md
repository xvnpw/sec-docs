# Threat Model Analysis for tokio-rs/tokio

## Threat: [Task Starvation](./threats/task_starvation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might intentionally or unintentionally trigger a long-running, CPU-bound task within the application. This task monopolizes the Tokio runtime's thread pool, preventing other tasks, including those handling legitimate requests, from progressing. The attacker might achieve this by sending specific input that triggers a computationally expensive operation or exploiting a vulnerability that leads to uncontrolled CPU usage within an async task.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service, Application Unresponsiveness. Legitimate users are unable to access or use the application due to its unresponsiveness.
*   **Affected Tokio Component:** Tokio Runtime (specifically the thread pool and scheduler).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Offload CPU-bound operations to separate threads using `tokio::task::spawn_blocking`.
    *   Implement timeouts for asynchronous operations to prevent indefinite blocking.
    *   Employ resource limits on task execution time.
    *   Monitor task execution times and identify potential long-running tasks.
    *   Design application logic to avoid inherently long-running synchronous operations in the main async context.

## Threat: [Async Context Blocking](./threats/async_context_blocking.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might exploit code paths where developers have inadvertently introduced blocking synchronous operations within an asynchronous Tokio task. This could be through direct use of synchronous I/O, CPU-intensive synchronous computations, or misuse of `block_on` in inappropriate async contexts.  The attacker might trigger these code paths through specific input or by exploiting application logic flaws. This blocking operation will halt the Tokio runtime's thread, preventing other tasks from running.
*   **Impact:** Deadlocks, Performance Degradation, Application Unresponsiveness. The application becomes slow or completely unresponsive, potentially leading to denial of service.
*   **Affected Tokio Component:** Tokio Runtime (thread pool, `block_on` function).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly use asynchronous I/O operations provided by Tokio or compatible libraries.
    *   Avoid `block_on` in async contexts unless absolutely necessary and fully understand its implications.
    *   Utilize `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` exclusively for inherently blocking operations, ensuring they are offloaded to a separate thread pool.
    *   Employ code reviews and static analysis to identify potential blocking operations in async contexts.
    *   Educate developers on the principles of asynchronous programming and the dangers of blocking in async contexts.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Unbounded Asynchronous Operations](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_unbounded_asynchronous_operations.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might flood the application with requests or data that trigger the creation of a large number of asynchronous tasks or futures without proper limits. This could be achieved by sending a high volume of requests, uploading large files, or exploiting application logic that spawns tasks based on external input without rate limiting. This can lead to memory exhaustion, thread pool saturation, and ultimately a denial of service.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service, Application Crashes, Memory Exhaustion. The application becomes unresponsive or crashes due to resource exhaustion.
*   **Affected Tokio Component:** Tokio Tasks, Channels, Runtime Resource Management.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement resource limits on task creation and concurrent operations.
    *   Employ backpressure techniques to control the rate of incoming requests or data processing.
    *   Use bounded channels to limit the number of queued messages or tasks.
    *   Limit the number of spawned tasks based on available resources and application capacity.
    *   Implement rate limiting on incoming requests to prevent overwhelming the application.

## Threat: [File Descriptor Exhaustion (Networking Focus)](./threats/file_descriptor_exhaustion__networking_focus_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might flood the application with connection requests or file operations, causing it to open a large number of file descriptors. If the application fails to properly close these descriptors after use (due to bugs or resource leaks), the attacker can exhaust the available file descriptors, preventing the application from accepting new connections or opening files. This is particularly relevant for networking applications handling many concurrent connections.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service, Application Crashes, Inability to Handle New Connections. The application becomes unable to accept new connections or perform file operations, leading to denial of service or crashes.
*   **Affected Tokio Component:** Tokio Networking (e.g., `TcpListener`, `TcpStream`), File I/O operations.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure proper closure of network connections (`TcpStream`) and file handles (`File`) after use, ideally using RAII patterns.
    *   Implement connection pooling to reuse existing connections and reduce the number of open descriptors.
    *   Implement resource limits on the number of open connections and file descriptors.
    *   Monitor file descriptor usage and configure system limits (ulimit) appropriately.
    *   Employ techniques like connection keep-alive to reduce the frequency of connection establishment and closure.

## Threat: [TLS Vulnerabilities (Tokio TLS Features)](./threats/tls_vulnerabilities__tokio_tls_features_.md)

*   **Description:** If the application uses Tokio's TLS features (via crates like `tokio-rustls` or `tokio-openssl`), an attacker might exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying TLS library or its configuration. This could include known vulnerabilities in the TLS protocol itself, implementation flaws in the TLS library, or misconfigurations that weaken TLS security. An attacker could then perform man-in-the-middle attacks, decrypt encrypted traffic, or compromise the confidentiality and integrity of data transmitted over TLS.
*   **Impact:** Data Breaches, Man-in-the-Middle Attacks, Confidentiality and Integrity Violations. Sensitive data transmitted over TLS could be exposed or manipulated by an attacker.
*   **Affected Tokio Component:** Tokio TLS features (via crates like `tokio-rustls`, `tokio-openssl`), `tokio::net::TcpStream` with TLS integration.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep TLS libraries (e.g., `rustls`, `openssl`) updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Follow TLS best practices for configuration, including using strong cipher suites, enabling certificate validation, and disabling insecure protocol versions.
    *   Regularly audit TLS configurations and dependencies for potential vulnerabilities.
    *   Use tools to scan for known TLS vulnerabilities in dependencies.

## Threat: [Connection Flooding Denial of Service](./threats/connection_flooding_denial_of_service.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker floods the application with a massive number of connection requests, overwhelming the Tokio runtime and its networking components. This can saturate network resources, exhaust server resources (CPU, memory, file descriptors), and prevent legitimate requests from being processed. The attacker's goal is to make the application unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service. Legitimate users are unable to access the application due to resource exhaustion caused by the flood of connections.
*   **Affected Tokio Component:** Tokio Networking (e.g., `TcpListener`), Tokio Runtime.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement rate limiting on incoming connection requests.
    *   Implement connection limiting mechanisms to restrict the number of concurrent connections from a single source or in total.
    *   Employ techniques like SYN cookies or connection queues to mitigate SYN flood attacks.
    *   Consider using load balancers or reverse proxies to distribute traffic and provide DDoS protection.
    *   Configure operating system level limits on connection rates and resource usage.
