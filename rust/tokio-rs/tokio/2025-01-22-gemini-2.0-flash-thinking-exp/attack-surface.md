# Attack Surface Analysis for tokio-rs/tokio

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion via Task Spawning](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_via_task_spawning.md)

* **Description:** An attacker overwhelms the application by causing it to spawn an excessive number of tasks, leading to resource depletion (CPU, memory). This directly exploits Tokio's task spawning mechanism.

    * **How Tokio Contributes:** Tokio's ease of task spawning (`tokio::spawn`) and asynchronous nature make it straightforward to create a large number of tasks quickly.  Lack of built-in task limits in core Tokio runtime directly contributes to this vulnerability if not addressed by the application.

    * **Example:** A web server using Tokio receives a flood of requests designed to trigger task creation for each request. Without application-level task limits, the server spawns thousands of tasks via `tokio::spawn`, consuming all available memory and CPU, causing a denial of service.

    * **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), application unresponsiveness, system instability.

    * **Risk Severity:** High

    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Implement Task Limits:** Use external crates or custom logic to limit the number of concurrently running or queued tasks. Consider using rate limiting or circuit breaker patterns *within the application logic*.
        * **Backpressure:** Implement backpressure mechanisms to control the rate of incoming requests or events that trigger task spawning *before* they reach `tokio::spawn`.
        * **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, task queues) to detect and respond to resource exhaustion attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Event Loop Overload](./attack_surfaces/event_loop_overload.md)

* **Description:** An attacker floods the Tokio event loop with events (e.g., network connections, I/O operations) exceeding its capacity, causing performance degradation or denial of service. This directly targets Tokio's core event processing mechanism.

    * **How Tokio Contributes:** Tokio's event loop is the central component for handling asynchronous I/O.  A flood of events specifically aimed at overwhelming this loop directly impacts Tokio's ability to process events efficiently, affecting all tasks managed by that loop.

    * **Example:** A network application using Tokio is targeted by a SYN flood attack. The Tokio event loop becomes saturated handling connection requests, preventing it from processing legitimate connections or other I/O events, leading to denial of service.

    * **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), application unresponsiveness, network connection failures.

    * **Risk Severity:** High

    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Rate Limiting Connections:** Implement connection rate limiting *before* accepting connections into Tokio's event loop to prevent excessive connection attempts.
        * **Connection Queues with Limits:** Limit the size of connection queues *managed by the application* to prevent backlog buildup in the event loop.
        * **Efficient Event Handling:** Optimize event handling logic *within Tokio tasks* to minimize the processing time per event and reduce pressure on the event loop.

## Attack Surface: [Network Protocol Vulnerabilities (Application Layer, Tokio Context)](./attack_surfaces/network_protocol_vulnerabilities__application_layer__tokio_context_.md)

* **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the application-level protocols implemented using Tokio's networking primitives (TCP, UDP) where asynchronous complexities introduced by Tokio contribute to the vulnerability.

    * **How Tokio Contributes:** While Tokio itself doesn't introduce protocol flaws, the asynchronous nature of Tokio programming can make protocol implementation more complex and error-prone.  Subtle bugs in asynchronous state management or handling of I/O events within protocol implementations built on Tokio can lead to vulnerabilities.

    * **Example:** A custom protocol built on Tokio's TCP streams has a vulnerability in its asynchronous message parsing logic.  Race conditions or incorrect state management in the asynchronous parser, facilitated by Tokio's concurrency model, allow an attacker to send crafted messages causing unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.

    * **Impact:** Information Disclosure, Remote Code Execution, Denial of Service, depending on the vulnerability.

    * **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)

    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Secure Asynchronous Protocol Design:** Design protocols with security in mind, specifically considering the complexities of asynchronous state management and concurrency within Tokio.
        * **Robust Asynchronous Parsing and Handling:** Implement robust parsing and handling of protocol messages, paying extra attention to error handling and input validation in the asynchronous context to prevent injection attacks and buffer overflows.
        * **Security Audits and Testing (Asynchronous Focus):** Conduct security audits and penetration testing specifically focusing on the asynchronous aspects of protocol implementations built on Tokio.

## Attack Surface: [Race Conditions in Asynchronous Code](./attack_surfaces/race_conditions_in_asynchronous_code.md)

* **Description:** Race conditions occur when the outcome of a program depends on the unpredictable timing of events in Tokio's concurrent asynchronous environment, leading to unexpected and potentially exploitable behavior.

    * **How Tokio Contributes:** Tokio's asynchronous programming model inherently introduces concurrency.  If shared mutable state is not carefully managed *using Tokio's synchronization primitives correctly*, race conditions become a significant risk.  The non-deterministic nature of asynchronous execution in Tokio exacerbates this.

    * **Example:** Two asynchronous tasks spawned by `tokio::spawn` concurrently access and modify shared data without proper synchronization using Tokio's `Mutex` or `RwLock`.  Due to the timing of task execution managed by Tokio's scheduler, data corruption or inconsistent application state occurs, potentially leading to exploitable logic errors.

    * **Impact:** Data Corruption, Inconsistent State, Logic Errors, Unexpected Behavior, Potential for Exploitation.

    * **Risk Severity:** High

    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Synchronization Primitives (Tokio Provided):**  Utilize Tokio's provided synchronization primitives (`Mutex`, `RwLock`, channels, atomics) *correctly and consistently* to protect shared mutable state within asynchronous tasks.
        * **Immutable Data Structures and Message Passing:** Favor immutable data structures and message passing between tasks *using Tokio channels* to minimize shared mutable state and reduce the attack surface for race conditions.
        * **Concurrency-Focused Code Reviews and Testing:** Conduct code reviews and testing specifically focused on identifying and eliminating race conditions in Tokio asynchronous code, paying attention to shared state and synchronization.
