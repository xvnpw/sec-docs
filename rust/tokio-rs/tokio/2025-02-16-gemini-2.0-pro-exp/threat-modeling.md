# Threat Model Analysis for tokio-rs/tokio

## Threat: [Unbounded Task Spawning via Malicious Input](./threats/unbounded_task_spawning_via_malicious_input.md)

*   **Threat:** Unbounded Task Spawning via Malicious Input

    *   **Description:** An attacker sends crafted input that causes the application to spawn a very large number of Tokio tasks via `tokio::task::spawn` or `tokio::task::spawn_blocking`. The attacker might repeatedly send such requests. The vulnerability lies in how the application uses Tokio's task spawning functions based on untrusted input.
    *   **Impact:** Resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, file descriptors), leading to denial of service. The application becomes unresponsive or crashes.
    *   **Affected Tokio Component:** `tokio::task::spawn`, `tokio::task::spawn_blocking`, and any application code that uses these functions based on external, attacker-controlled input.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Task Limiter:** Use a `Semaphore` (from `tokio::sync`) or a custom task limiter to restrict the maximum number of concurrent tasks *created via Tokio*. Reject or queue new requests when the limit is reached. This is a *Tokio-specific* mitigation.
        *   **Bounded Channels:** Use bounded `mpsc` channels (`tokio::sync::mpsc::channel` with a defined capacity) for communication between tasks spawned by Tokio. This prevents unbounded queue growth if a consumer task is slower than a producer, a scenario often exploited in DoS attacks.
        *   **Input Validation (Application-Level, but Essential):** Strictly validate and sanitize all input that influences task creation. This is crucial, but it's *application logic*, not a Tokio-specific feature.
        *   **Rate Limiting (Often External, but Important):** Implement rate limiting (within the application or using a reverse proxy) to limit the frequency of requests. This is often handled *outside* of Tokio.
        *   **Monitoring (Tokio-Specific Aspects):** Monitor the number of active tasks *managed by Tokio* and resource usage. Set alerts for unusual spikes. Use Tokio's tracing facilities to monitor task creation.

## Threat: [Blocking I/O within Async Context](./threats/blocking_io_within_async_context.md)

*   **Threat:** Blocking I/O within Async Context

    *   **Description:** A blocking operation (e.g., `std::fs::read_to_string`, a synchronous HTTP request, a long CPU-bound calculation *without* `spawn_blocking`) is performed within an `async` function or a Tokio task. This blocks the Tokio worker thread. The vulnerability is the *misuse of Tokio* by introducing blocking calls into its asynchronous context.
    *   **Impact:** The Tokio worker thread becomes blocked, preventing other tasks *managed by Tokio* from making progress. This leads to a denial of service, even with few requests. Latency increases significantly.
    *   **Affected Tokio Component:** The entire Tokio runtime is affected, as a single blocked worker thread can stall the entire system. Specifically, any `async fn` or code within a `tokio::task::spawn` or `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` block that contains blocking calls.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Asynchronous Libraries:** Use Tokio's asynchronous equivalents for *all* I/O operations (e.g., `tokio::fs`, `tokio::net`, asynchronous HTTP clients). This is the core mitigation â€“ using Tokio *correctly*.
        *   **`spawn_blocking` for CPU-Bound Work:** Offload long-running CPU-bound computations to a separate thread pool *using `tokio::task::spawn_blocking`*. This is a *Tokio-specific* mitigation.
        *   **Code Review (Essential, but General):** Thoroughly review all code within `async` functions and Tokio tasks for *any* blocking operations.
        *   **Third-Party Library Audit (Important, but General):** Carefully audit all third-party libraries.
        *   **Profiling (Tokio-Specific Aspects):** Use profiling tools, potentially integrated with Tokio's tracing, to identify blocking operations during development. Look for long periods where Tokio worker threads are not making progress.

## Threat: [Slowloris-Style Attack on Tokio Listener](./threats/slowloris-style_attack_on_tokio_listener.md)

*   **Threat:** Slowloris-Style Attack on Tokio Listener

    *   **Description:** An attacker establishes many TCP connections to the application's Tokio listener (`tokio::net::TcpListener`) but sends data very slowly or keeps connections open without sending data. This exploits how Tokio handles network connections.
    *   **Impact:** Exhaustion of connection resources (file descriptors, memory) *managed by Tokio*. The application becomes unable to accept new connections, leading to denial of service.
    *   **Affected Tokio Component:** `tokio::net::TcpListener`, `tokio::net::TcpStream`, and any code that uses these components to handle incoming connections.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Timeouts:** Implement strict timeouts on all I/O operations *using `tokio::time::timeout`*. This is a *Tokio-specific* mitigation. Set reasonable timeouts for `accept`, `read`, and `write` operations.
        *   **Connection Limits (Tokio and OS):** Configure connection limits on the Tokio runtime *and* the underlying operating system. This involves both Tokio-specific configuration and OS-level settings.
        *   **Reverse Proxy (Often External):** Use a reverse proxy (like Nginx or HAProxy). This is often handled *outside* of Tokio.
        *   **Connection Tracking (Tokio-Specific Aspects):** Monitor the number of open connections and their state *using Tokio's tracing or metrics facilities*. Identify and close connections that are idle for an extended period.

## Threat: [Data Race on Shared Mutable State (Specifically within Tokio Tasks)](./threats/data_race_on_shared_mutable_state__specifically_within_tokio_tasks_.md)

*   **Threat:** Data Race on Shared Mutable State (Specifically within Tokio Tasks)

    *   **Description:** Multiple Tokio tasks access and modify the same shared mutable data without proper synchronization *using Tokio's synchronization primitives*. The attacker might send concurrent requests to trigger the race. The core issue is incorrect use of Tokio's concurrency model.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, inconsistent application state, unpredictable behavior, potential information disclosure, or crashes.
    *   **Affected Tokio Component:** Any code that shares mutable data between Tokio tasks without using Tokio's synchronization primitives correctly. Specifically, incorrect use of `tokio::sync::Mutex`, `tokio::sync::RwLock`, or atomics within the context of Tokio tasks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Tokio Synchronization Primitives:** Use *Tokio's* synchronization primitives correctly:
            *   `tokio::sync::Mutex`: For exclusive access.
            *   `tokio::sync::RwLock`: For read-write access.
            *   Atomic types (e.g., `std::sync::atomic`): For simple operations (can be used with Tokio).
            *   Channels (`tokio::sync::mpsc`, `tokio::sync::oneshot`): For message passing, avoiding shared mutable state. This is a key *Tokio-specific* approach.
        *   **Minimize Shared Mutable State (General Principle):** Favor message passing and immutable data structures.
        *   **`loom` (Tokio-Specific Testing):** Use the `loom` crate for testing concurrent code *that uses Tokio*. `loom` helps detect data races.

## Threat: [Improper Use of `spawn_blocking` with Privileged Code](./threats/improper_use_of__spawn_blocking__with_privileged_code.md)

* **Threat:** Improper Use of `spawn_blocking` with Privileged Code

    * **Description:** An attacker provides input that influences code executed within `tokio::task::spawn_blocking`, and that code interacts with privileged resources without proper validation. This is a specific misuse of a *Tokio* feature.
    * **Impact:** The attacker might gain unauthorized access to system resources, execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges, or bypass security restrictions.
    * **Affected Tokio Component:** `tokio::task::spawn_blocking`, and any code executed within it that interacts with privileged resources.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation (Essential, but General):** Strictly validate and sanitize all input.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege (General Principle):** Grant only necessary permissions.
        *   **Sandboxing (Often External):** Consider using sandboxing techniques.
        *   **Code Review (Essential, but General):** Carefully review any code executed within `spawn_blocking`.
