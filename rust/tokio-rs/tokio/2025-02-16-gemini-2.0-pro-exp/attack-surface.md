# Attack Surface Analysis for tokio-rs/tokio

## Attack Surface: [Asynchronous Race Conditions](./attack_surfaces/asynchronous_race_conditions.md)

*   **Description:** Concurrent execution of asynchronous tasks accessing shared mutable state without proper synchronization leads to unpredictable behavior and potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Tokio Contributes:** Tokio's core asynchronous model *enables* concurrent task execution, making race conditions *possible* if developers don't implement proper synchronization. This is a direct consequence of using Tokio's asynchronous capabilities.
    *   **Example:** Two Tokio tasks concurrently modify a shared data structure (e.g., a HashMap) without using a `tokio::sync::Mutex`. An attacker could time requests to exploit this and corrupt the data.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, inconsistent application state, denial of service, potential for privilege escalation (depending on the affected data).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (can lead to significant data integrity issues and potentially exploitable vulnerabilities).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use Tokio Synchronization Primitives:** Employ `tokio::sync::Mutex`, `RwLock`, `Semaphore` correctly to protect shared mutable state.
        *   **Minimize Shared Mutability:** Favor immutable data and message passing (e.g., using Tokio channels) over shared mutable state.
        *   **Atomic Operations:** Use `std::sync::atomic` for simple shared variables where appropriate, ensuring they are used correctly within the Tokio context.
        *   **Code Reviews:** Focus on asynchronous code and shared state access within Tokio tasks.
        *   **Testing:** Use `loom` and other concurrency testing tools to specifically target race conditions in Tokio-based code.

## Attack Surface: [Asynchronous Deadlocks](./attack_surfaces/asynchronous_deadlocks.md)

*   **Description:** Two or more Tokio tasks become blocked indefinitely, waiting for each other to release resources (often locks), leading to application unresponsiveness.
    *   **How Tokio Contributes:** Tokio's task scheduling and synchronization mechanisms (specifically, `tokio::sync` primitives) are *directly* involved in creating the conditions for deadlocks if misused.
    *   **Example:** Task A (within Tokio) holds `tokio::sync::Mutex` X and awaits acquisition of `tokio::sync::Mutex` Y, while Task B (also within Tokio) holds Y and awaits X.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service (application becomes completely unresponsive).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (complete application failure).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Careful Lock Ordering:** Establish and enforce a consistent order for acquiring `tokio::sync` locks across all Tokio tasks.
        *   **Lock Timeouts:** Use `tokio::sync::Mutex::try_lock_for` to prevent indefinite blocking.
        *   **Avoid Holding Locks Across Await:** Minimize holding `tokio::sync` locks across `.await` points within Tokio tasks.
        *   **Deadlock Detection (tokio-console):** Utilize `tokio-console` to identify and diagnose deadlocks specifically within the Tokio runtime.
        *   **Code Reviews:** Focus on `tokio::sync` lock acquisition and release patterns.

## Attack Surface: [Task Starvation](./attack_surfaces/task_starvation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker floods the Tokio runtime with numerous long-running or computationally intensive tasks, preventing legitimate tasks from receiving adequate processing time.
    *   **How Tokio Contributes:** Tokio's task scheduler is *directly* targeted by this attack. The attacker exploits Tokio's ability to handle many tasks, but overwhelms it.
    *   **Example:** An attacker submits thousands of Tokio tasks that perform computationally expensive operations, saturating the Tokio worker threads.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service (legitimate requests are delayed or dropped due to Tokio task queue saturation).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (significant performance degradation and potential unavailability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Rate Limiting (Tokio-Aware):** Implement rate limiting, considering the asynchronous nature of Tokio tasks.  Use libraries that integrate well with Tokio.
        *   **Bounded Task Queues (Tokio):** Use bounded task queues or worker pools *within* the Tokio runtime to limit concurrent task execution.
        *   **Task Prioritization (Tokio):** If possible, prioritize critical Tokio tasks.
        *   **Resource Monitoring (Tokio):** Monitor Tokio-specific metrics (e.g., task queue lengths, worker thread utilization) using tools like `tokio-console`.
        *   **Timeouts (Tokio):** Use `tokio::time::timeout` to prevent individual Tokio tasks from running indefinitely.

## Attack Surface: [Unsafe Code Vulnerabilities (Tokio Internals)](./attack_surfaces/unsafe_code_vulnerabilities__tokio_internals_.md)

*   **Description:** Bugs in Tokio's internal `unsafe` code (used for performance) could lead to memory safety issues. This is *intrinsic* to Tokio itself.
    *   **How Tokio Contributes:** Tokio *itself* contains the `unsafe` code. This is not a consequence of *using* Tokio, but a property of Tokio's implementation.
    *   **Example:** A hypothetical buffer overflow in Tokio's I/O handling due to incorrect `unsafe` pointer manipulation within the Tokio codebase.
    *   **Impact:** Memory corruption, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution (worst case).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (potential for complete system compromise).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Tokio Updated:** This is the *primary* mitigation.  Regularly update to the latest Tokio version to receive security patches.
        *   **Avoid Custom `unsafe` Interactions:** Do *not* write custom `unsafe` code that interacts with Tokio's internal data structures.
        *   **Rely on Tokio Maintainers:** Trust the Tokio team's expertise in `unsafe` code.
