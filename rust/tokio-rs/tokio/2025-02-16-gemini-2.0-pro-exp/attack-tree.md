# Attack Tree Analysis for tokio-rs/tokio

Objective: To cause a Denial of Service (DoS) or achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) on an application using the Tokio runtime by exploiting Tokio-specific vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Resource Exhaustion (Tokio-Specific)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_resource_exhaustion__tokio-specific_.md)

Description:  Attacks that aim to exhaust resources managed by the Tokio runtime, leading to a Denial of Service. This is distinct from general OS-level resource exhaustion.
Likelihood: Medium to High
Impact: Medium to High (DoS, potential for limited data leaks if combined with other vulnerabilities)
Effort: Low to Medium
Skill Level: Novice to Intermediate
Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Too Many Tasks](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_too_many_tasks.md)

Description:  Spawning an excessive number of Tokio tasks, overwhelming the scheduler or exceeding configured limits.
Likelihood: High
Impact: Medium
Effort: Low
Skill Level: Novice
Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Unbounded Channels](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_unbounded_channels.md)

Description:  Flooding unbounded `mpsc` channels with messages, leading to excessive memory consumption within Tokio's internal structures.
Likelihood: Medium
Impact: High
Effort: Low
Skill Level: Novice
Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Race Conditions (Tokio/App Logic)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_race_conditions__tokioapp_logic_.md)

Description:  Concurrent access to shared mutable state without proper synchronization, leading to unpredictable behavior, data corruption, or potentially exploitable vulnerabilities.
Likelihood: Medium to High
Impact: Low to Very High (data corruption, crashes, unpredictable behavior, potentially exploitable for RCE in complex scenarios)
Effort: Low to Medium
Skill Level: Intermediate to Advanced
Detection Difficulty: Medium to Hard
