  - Bugs or vulnerabilities in Tokio could lead to application instability or security issues.
  - Lack of adoption or community support could hinder the project's long-term viability.
  - Dependencies on external libraries or Rust language features could introduce instability or security concerns.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security Controls:
  - security control: Memory safety provided by the Rust programming language, inherently reducing classes of vulnerabilities like buffer overflows. Implemented by: Rust Compiler.
  - security control: Focus on code correctness and thorough testing within the Tokio project. Implemented by: Tokio project development practices, CI/CD pipelines.
  - security control: Community contributions and code reviews help identify and address potential issues. Implemented by: Tokio project contribution guidelines and review process on GitHub.
  - security control: Use of static analysis tools (like `clippy` and `rustfmt`) to enforce code quality and catch potential errors. Implemented by: Tokio project CI/CD pipelines.

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies used by Tokio. Mitigation: Dependency review and updates.
  - accepted risk: Misuse of Tokio APIs by developers leading to insecure applications. Mitigation: Comprehensive documentation and examples.
  - accepted risk: Emergence of new attack vectors or vulnerabilities in asynchronous programming models. Mitigation: Continuous monitoring of security research and updates to Tokio.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated dependency scanning to detect known vulnerabilities in Tokio's dependencies.
  - security control: Integrate fuzzing into the CI/CD pipeline to proactively discover potential bugs and vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Conduct periodic security audits by external security experts to review the codebase and identify potential weaknesses.
  - security control: Publish security guidelines and best practices for developers using Tokio to build secure applications.
  - security control: Establish a clear process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities in Tokio.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Not directly applicable to Tokio itself as it is a library.
    - Applications built using Tokio will need to implement their own authentication mechanisms if required.
  - Authorization:
    - Not directly applicable to Tokio itself.
    - Applications built using Tokio will need to implement their own authorization mechanisms if required.
  - Input Validation:
    - Applications using Tokio for network communication must perform robust input validation to prevent injection attacks and other input-related vulnerabilities.
    - Tokio provides tools for handling network data, but input validation is the responsibility of the application developer.
  - Cryptography:
    - Tokio provides asynchronous networking capabilities that can be used to implement secure communication protocols (e.g., TLS).
    - Cryptographic implementations and secure key management are the responsibility of the applications built using Tokio, potentially leveraging other Rust crates for cryptography.

## DEPLOYMENT

Tokio itself is not deployed as a standalone service. It is a library that is included in Rust applications, and the deployment of a Tokio-based application depends entirely on the nature of that application.

Assuming a common scenario where a Tokio-based application is deployed as a network service in a cloud environment:

    instance("VM Instance / Container Instance")
    end

    load_balancer("Load Balancer")
    internet("Internet")
    monitoring("Monitoring System")

    internet -- "Requests" --> load_balancer
    load_balancer -- "Forwards to" --> instance

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Applications built using Tokio are the critical business processes. The reliability and performance of these applications directly impact the business. If Tokio has vulnerabilities or performance issues, it can negatively affect all applications built upon it.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Tokio itself does not directly handle business data. However, applications built using Tokio will handle various types of data. The sensitivity of this data depends entirely on the application.
  - For applications using Tokio, data sensitivity can range from public information to highly confidential data like personal identifiable information (PII), financial data, or trade secrets.
  - The data sensitivity and types should be assessed in the context of each specific application built using Tokio.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What are the specific types of applications that are primarily built using Tokio? (e.g., web servers, databases, message brokers, etc.)
  - What is the risk appetite of organizations using Tokio? (Startups vs. Fortune 500 companies)
  - Are there specific compliance requirements that applications built with Tokio need to adhere to? (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS)
  - What is the process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities in Tokio?
  - Are there any existing security guidelines or best practices for developers using Tokio?

- Assumptions:
  - Tokio is primarily used for building network-facing applications.
  - Security concerns are mainly focused on the applications built using Tokio, rather than Tokio itself as a library.
  - Developers using Tokio are expected to have a reasonable level of security awareness and implement security controls in their applications.
  - The deployment environment for Tokio-based applications can vary widely, from on-premise to cloud environments.
  - The Rust compiler and ecosystem provide a baseline level of security due to memory safety and other language features.
