# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business priorities and goals:
  - Provide a robust, reliable, and user-friendly command-line argument parsing library for Rust developers.
  - Enable Rust developers to easily build command-line interfaces for their applications.
  - Maintain a widely adopted and trusted library within the Rust ecosystem.
- Most important business risks:
  - Risk of bugs or vulnerabilities in the library leading to issues in applications that depend on it.
  - Risk of performance issues impacting the usability of applications using the library.
  - Risk of lack of maintenance or community support leading to stagnation and reduced adoption.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing security controls:
  - security control: Open source development model, allowing for community review and contribution, hosted on GitHub.
  - security control: Use of Rust programming language, which provides memory safety and reduces certain classes of vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests to ensure functionality and catch regressions, described in repository's test suite.
  - security control: Code review process via GitHub pull requests before merging changes, visible in repository's pull request history.
- Accepted risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities.
  - accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities in dependencies that clap-rs/clap relies upon.
- Recommended security controls:
  - security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools in the Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline to detect potential vulnerabilities in code changes.
  - security control: Consider incorporating dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by clap-rs/clap.
  - security control: Establish a clear process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities, including a security policy and contact information.
- Security requirements:
  - Authentication: Not applicable for a library. Clap-rs/clap itself does not handle user authentication.
  - Authorization: Not applicable for a library. Clap-rs/clap itself does not handle user authorization.
  - Input validation: Critical. Clap-rs/clap must robustly validate and sanitize command-line arguments to prevent unexpected behavior, crashes, or vulnerabilities in applications using it. This is implicitly part of the library's core functionality.
  - Cryptography: Not directly applicable. Clap-rs/clap itself is not expected to perform cryptographic operations. However, applications using clap-rs/clap might handle sensitive data, and clap-rs/clap should not introduce vulnerabilities that could compromise such data if passed as arguments (though passing sensitive data as command line arguments is generally discouraged).

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical business process we are trying to protect:
  - Providing a reliable, secure, and functional command-line argument parsing library to the Rust community. The critical process is the development, build, and distribution of this library.
- Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
  - Source code: Publicly available on GitHub, but integrity and availability are important to prevent malicious modifications or disruptions.
  - Build artifacts (compiled library): Publicly available on Crates.io, integrity and availability are crucial to ensure users download legitimate and functional library versions.
  - Crates.io publishing credentials: Sensitive. Compromise could lead to malicious package uploads.
  - GitHub account credentials: Sensitive. Compromise could lead to code manipulation or repository takeover.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What is the intended scope for threat modeling? Is it focused solely on the clap-rs/clap library itself, or does it extend to applications that use the library? (Assumption: Focus is primarily on the library itself).
  - Are there any specific security concerns or past incidents that are driving this design document and threat modeling exercise? (Assumption: This is a proactive security assessment, not triggered by a specific incident).
  - What is the acceptable risk level for the clap-rs/clap project? (Assumption: Aim for a low risk level given the library's wide usage and importance in the Rust ecosystem).
- Assumptions:
  - The clap-rs/clap project aims to be a widely used and trusted library in the Rust ecosystem.
  - Security and reliability are important non-functional requirements for the clap-rs/clap library.
  - The primary distribution channel for clap-rs/clap is Crates.io.
  - The development and build infrastructure relies on GitHub and GitHub Actions.
