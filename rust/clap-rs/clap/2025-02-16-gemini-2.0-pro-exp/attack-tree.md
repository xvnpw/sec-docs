## Attack Tree Path: [Sub-Goal 1: Trigger Unexpected Application Logic [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/sub-goal_1_trigger_unexpected_application_logic__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker aims to make the application behave in ways not intended by the developers. This is a critical sub-goal because it encompasses a wide range of potential vulnerabilities and is often the starting point for more serious attacks. Weak argument validation is a primary enabler.

## Attack Tree Path: [A2: Exploit Argument Validation Bypass [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/a2_exploit_argument_validation_bypass__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker attempts to circumvent the validation checks implemented by the application, either those built into `clap` or custom validators. This is a critical node because it's the gateway to many specific vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [A2.1: Fuzz with Invalid Argument Types/Values [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/a2_1_fuzz_with_invalid_argument_typesvalues__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker uses a fuzzer to send a large number of invalid or unexpected inputs to the application, targeting the argument parsing logic. This is high-risk due to the effectiveness of fuzzing in finding vulnerabilities, especially in custom validation code.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
    *   **Impact:** Medium to Very High (ranging from crashes to potential code execution)
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [A2.2: Leverage Poorly Defined Argument Constraints [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/a2_2_leverage_poorly_defined_argument_constraints__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker provides argument values that are technically valid according to `clap`'s basic type checking but violate the intended constraints or assumptions of the application. This is high-risk because it's a very common developer oversight.
    *   **Likelihood:** High
    *   **Impact:** Low to Medium
    *   **Effort:** Very Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Sub-Goal 2: Cause Resource Exhaustion [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/sub-goal_2_cause_resource_exhaustion__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker aims to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory), leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. This is critical because it directly impacts application availability.

## Attack Tree Path: [B1: Overflow Allocations/Buffers [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/b1_overflow_allocationsbuffers__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker provides an argument value that is used to determine the size of a memory allocation. By providing a very large value, the attacker can trigger an overflow, leading to a crash or potentially other vulnerabilities. This is high-risk due to its potential for severe impact.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Sub-Goal 3: Disclose Sensitive Information](./attack_tree_paths/sub-goal_3_disclose_sensitive_information.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker aims to obtain sensitive information through argument manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [C1: Trigger Verbose/Debug Output (if enabled) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/c1_trigger_verbosedebug_output__if_enabled___high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** If the application has a verbosity flag (e.g., `--verbose`) and the verbose output contains sensitive information, the attacker can simply enable this flag to obtain the data. This is high risk because of the potential for significant data breaches.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium to Very High
    *   **Effort:** Very Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Easy
