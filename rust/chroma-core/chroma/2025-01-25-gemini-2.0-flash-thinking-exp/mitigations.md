# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for chroma-core/chroma

## Mitigation Strategy: [Access Control Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/access_control_configuration.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Access Control Configuration
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review ChromaDB Access Control Features:** Consult the official ChromaDB documentation to understand the available access control mechanisms. This might include features like API key authentication, role-based access control (RBAC), or integration with external authentication providers.
    2.  **Implement Authentication:** Enable and enforce authentication for all access to the ChromaDB API.  This prevents unauthorized users or services from interacting with your ChromaDB instance.  Use strong, randomly generated API keys or leverage more robust authentication methods if supported by your deployment environment.
    3.  **Configure Authorization (if available):** If ChromaDB offers authorization features (like RBAC), define roles and permissions that align with the principle of least privilege. Grant users and services only the necessary permissions to access and manipulate ChromaDB data. For example, separate roles for read-only access, data modification, and administrative tasks.
    4.  **Regularly Review Access Control:** Periodically review and update access control configurations to ensure they remain appropriate and effective. Remove or adjust permissions for users or services that no longer require access or whose roles have changed.
    5.  **Secure Key Management:** If using API keys or other secrets for authentication, implement secure key management practices. Store keys securely (e.g., using a secrets manager), rotate keys regularly, and avoid hardcoding keys in application code.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized users or malicious actors from accessing, modifying, or deleting data stored in ChromaDB. This is crucial for data confidentiality and integrity.
    *   **Data Leakage (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of data leakage by ensuring only authenticated and authorized entities can retrieve data from ChromaDB.
    *   **Data Tampering (Medium Severity):** Prevents unauthorized modification of data, maintaining data integrity.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Significantly reduces risk. Strong access control is a primary defense against unauthorized access.
    *   **Data Leakage:** Significantly reduces risk. Access control limits who can retrieve sensitive data.
    *   **Data Tampering:** Moderately reduces risk. Authorization helps prevent unauthorized modifications.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented or Missing.
    *   Basic authentication (like API keys if available in ChromaDB deployment) might be used.
    *   Fine-grained authorization (RBAC or similar) is likely missing or not fully configured.
    *   Regular access control reviews and secure key management practices might be absent.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Lack of enforced authentication for ChromaDB API access.
    *   Missing authorization configuration to restrict access based on roles or permissions.
    *   No regular review process for access control configurations.
    *   Inadequate secure key management practices for authentication credentials.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Encryption at Rest and in Transit](./mitigation_strategies/encryption_at_rest_and_in_transit.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Encryption at Rest and in Transit
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Encryption at Rest (if supported):** Check ChromaDB documentation for options to enable encryption at rest for the data stored on disk. This protects data if the storage media is physically compromised.  This might involve configuring storage-level encryption provided by the underlying storage system or if ChromaDB offers built-in encryption features.
    2.  **Enforce HTTPS for API Access:** Ensure all communication with the ChromaDB API is conducted over HTTPS. This encrypts data in transit between your application and the ChromaDB instance, preventing eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. Configure your application and ChromaDB deployment to enforce HTTPS.
    3.  **Consider Client-Side Encryption (for sensitive data):** For highly sensitive data, consider encrypting the data *before* sending it to ChromaDB for embedding. This adds an extra layer of protection, ensuring data is encrypted even within the ChromaDB storage. Implement robust key management for client-side encryption.
    4.  **Verify Encryption Configuration:** Regularly verify that encryption at rest and in transit are properly configured and enabled. Check logs and configurations to confirm encryption is active.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Leakage (High Severity):** Encryption at rest protects data if storage media is compromised. Encryption in transit prevents eavesdropping during communication.
    *   **Data Breach (High Severity):** Reduces the impact of a data breach by rendering the stolen data unreadable without the decryption keys.
    *   **Eavesdropping (Medium Severity):** HTTPS encryption prevents attackers from intercepting and reading data transmitted between the application and ChromaDB.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Leakage:** Significantly reduces risk. Encryption is a strong defense against data leakage from storage or network interception.
    *   **Data Breach:** Significantly reduces impact. Encrypted data is much less valuable to attackers.
    *   **Eavesdropping:** Significantly reduces risk. HTTPS effectively prevents eavesdropping on API communication.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented or Missing.
    *   HTTPS for API access is likely implemented as a general best practice.
    *   Encryption at rest might be missing or not explicitly configured for ChromaDB's storage.
    *   Client-side encryption is likely not implemented.
    *   Verification of encryption configuration might be lacking.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Lack of configured encryption at rest for ChromaDB data storage.
    *   No client-side encryption for highly sensitive data before embedding.
    *   Missing verification process to ensure encryption is properly enabled and functioning.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Query Complexity Limits within ChromaDB (if configurable)](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_query_complexity_limits_within_chromadb__if_configurable_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Input Validation and Query Complexity Limits within ChromaDB (if configurable)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review ChromaDB Configuration Options:** Consult ChromaDB documentation to see if it offers configuration options for input validation or query complexity limits. This might include settings to restrict:
        *   Maximum size of input vectors.
        *   Maximum length of text content or metadata fields.
        *   Complexity of search queries (e.g., maximum number of filters, maximum vector dimensions).
        *   Maximum number of results returned per query.
    2.  **Implement Configurable Limits:** If ChromaDB provides such configuration options, implement appropriate limits to prevent resource exhaustion and potential denial-of-service attacks. Set limits based on your application's requirements and resource capacity.
    3.  **Validate Query Parameters:** Even if ChromaDB has built-in limits, validate query parameters in your application code *before* sending them to ChromaDB. This provides an additional layer of defense and allows for more application-specific validation rules.
    4.  **Monitor Query Performance:** Monitor ChromaDB's query performance and resource utilization. Identify and investigate any unusually slow or resource-intensive queries. Adjust query complexity limits as needed based on monitoring data.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks (Medium to High Severity):** Limits on query complexity and input size help prevent malicious actors from overwhelming ChromaDB with excessively large or complex requests that could exhaust resources and cause service disruption.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Prevents unintentional resource exhaustion due to poorly constructed or overly broad queries.
    *   **Slow Performance (Low to Medium Severity):** By limiting query complexity, you can help maintain consistent and acceptable query performance.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks:** Moderately reduces risk. Limits can mitigate some DoS attempts, but may not prevent sophisticated attacks.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Moderately reduces risk. Limits help control resource usage but might need to be carefully tuned.
    *   **Slow Performance:** Moderately improves performance stability by preventing resource-intensive queries.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Likely Missing.
    *   ChromaDB's default configuration is likely used without explicit query complexity or input validation limits.
    *   Application-level query parameter validation might be basic or missing.
    *   Monitoring of query performance specifically for identifying resource-intensive queries might be absent.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Lack of configured query complexity limits within ChromaDB (if supported).
    *   Missing input validation limits within ChromaDB (if supported).
    *   Insufficient application-level validation of query parameters.
    *   No dedicated monitoring of query performance to identify and address resource-intensive queries.
