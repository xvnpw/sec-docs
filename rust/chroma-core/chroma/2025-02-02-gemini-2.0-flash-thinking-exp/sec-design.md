# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, Chroma, is an AI-native open-source embedding database. The primary business goal is to provide developers with a simple and efficient way to store and query embeddings for AI applications. Embeddings are numerical representations of data, crucial for modern machine learning tasks like semantic search, recommendation systems, and natural language processing. By offering an open-source solution, Chroma aims to foster innovation and accessibility in the AI field.

Business priorities for Chroma are:
- Ease of use and integration for developers.
- High performance and scalability to handle large embedding datasets.
- Robustness and reliability for production deployments.
- Openness and community-driven development.

Key business risks associated with Chroma include:
- Data breaches exposing sensitive embeddings or associated metadata.
- Unauthorized access to the database, leading to data manipulation or exfiltration.
- Performance bottlenecks or instability impacting AI application functionality.
- Lack of community adoption and support, hindering project growth and sustainability.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls for the Chroma project, based on a review of the GitHub repository and common open-source practices, include:

- security control: Code review process via GitHub pull requests. Implemented in: GitHub repository workflow.
- security control: Use of standard Python security practices. Implemented in: Codebase.
- security control: Dependency management using `pip` and `poetry`. Implemented in: `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock`.
- security control: Open-source licensing, allowing community scrutiny. Implemented in: LICENSE file in the repository.

Accepted risks for the Chroma project, based on typical open-source project assumptions and lack of explicit security documentation:

- accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability discovery and patching.
- accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
- accepted risk: Lack of formal security audits or penetration testing.
- accepted risk: Default configurations might not be hardened for production environments.

Recommended security controls to implement as high priority:

- recommended security control: Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to the database and its API.
- recommended security control: Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks.
- recommended security control: Implement encryption at rest and in transit to protect sensitive embedding data.
- recommended security control: Integrate automated security scanning tools (SAST/DAST) into the CI/CD pipeline.
- recommended security control: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure and response process.

Security requirements for the Chroma project:

- Authentication:
  - Requirement: The system must support authentication to verify the identity of clients accessing the database.
  - Requirement: Different authentication methods should be considered, such as API keys, OAuth 2.0, or integration with existing identity providers.
- Authorization:
  - Requirement: The system must implement authorization to control access to specific resources and operations based on user roles or permissions.
  - Requirement: Granular access control should be considered, allowing restrictions at the database, collection, or even document level.
- Input Validation:
  - Requirement: All external inputs, including API requests and data ingestion, must be validated to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection).
  - Requirement: Input validation should be performed on both the client and server sides.
- Cryptography:
  - Requirement: Sensitive data, including embeddings and potentially metadata, must be encrypted at rest.
  - Requirement: Communication channels, especially API endpoints, must be encrypted in transit using TLS/HTTPS.
  - Requirement: Secure key management practices must be implemented for encryption keys.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process being protected:

- Efficient and reliable storage and retrieval of embeddings for AI applications. Disruption or compromise of this process would directly impact the functionality of AI systems relying on Chroma.

Data being protected and its sensitivity:

- Embeddings: These are numerical representations of data and can be highly sensitive depending on the source data they represent. If embeddings are derived from personally identifiable information (PII), financial data, or other confidential sources, their compromise could lead to privacy breaches, data leaks, or misuse of sensitive information.
- Metadata associated with embeddings: This metadata might include information about the source data, timestamps, user associations, or other contextual details. The sensitivity of metadata depends on its nature and potential to reveal sensitive information when combined with embeddings or other data.
- API access credentials (API keys, OAuth tokens): These credentials are used to authenticate and authorize access to the Chroma API. Compromise of these credentials could lead to unauthorized access to the database, data manipulation, or exfiltration.

Data Sensitivity Levels:

- High: Embeddings and metadata derived from PII, financial data, health records, or other highly confidential sources. Compromise could lead to significant harm, legal repercussions, and reputational damage.
- Medium: Embeddings and metadata derived from less sensitive data but still requiring protection to maintain business confidentiality or operational integrity. Compromise could lead to moderate harm or business disruption.
- Low: Embeddings and metadata derived from publicly available or non-sensitive data. Compromise would have minimal impact.
