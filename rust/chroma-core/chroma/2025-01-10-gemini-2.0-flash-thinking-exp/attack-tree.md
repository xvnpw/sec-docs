## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1 & Critical Node: Exploit Chroma API (Authentication/Authorization)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_&_critical_node_exploit_chroma_api__authenticationauthorization_.md)

* CRITICAL NODE: Bypass Authentication/Authorization
    * HIGH-RISK: Exploit Default Credentials (if any): Attackers attempt to use default usernames and passwords that might be present in initial configurations or poorly managed deployments. Success grants full API access.
    * HIGH-RISK: Exploit Authentication Weaknesses (e.g., insecure API keys, lack of rate limiting): Attackers exploit weak or easily guessable API keys, or the absence of rate limiting to perform brute-force attacks on API keys or authentication endpoints. Successful exploitation leads to unauthorized API access.
* HIGH-RISK PATH 1 & CRITICAL NODE: Perform Injection Attacks
    * HIGH-RISK & CRITICAL NODE: Prompt Injection (Manipulate embedding generation or retrieval logic): Attackers craft malicious input prompts to influence the embedding process or retrieval logic. This can lead to biased search results, exposure of sensitive information, or manipulation of application behavior.
* CRITICAL NODE: Identify and exploit known vulnerabilities in Chroma's API endpoints: Attackers research and exploit publicly known security vulnerabilities in specific versions of the Chroma API. Successful exploitation can lead to various impacts, including unauthorized access, data breaches, or remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2 & Critical Node: Manipulate Chroma Data Storage (Direct Access)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_&_critical_node_manipulate_chroma_data_storage__direct_access_.md)

* CRITICAL NODE: Gain Direct Access to Data Store: Attackers bypass the API and attempt to directly access the underlying storage mechanism used by Chroma.
    * HIGH-RISK & CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Weak File System Permissions (if using local storage): If Chroma stores data on the local file system, attackers exploit misconfigured file permissions to gain read or write access to the data files.
    * HIGH-RISK & CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Database Credentials (if using a database backend): If Chroma uses a database, attackers attempt to compromise database credentials to gain direct access to the stored data.
    * HIGH-RISK & CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Cloud Storage Misconfigurations (if using cloud storage): If Chroma uses cloud storage, attackers exploit misconfigured access policies or security settings to gain unauthorized access to the storage buckets.
* HIGH-RISK PATH 2: Modify Data Integrity
    * HIGH-RISK: Directly alter embedding vectors to influence retrieval results: Attackers with direct storage access modify the numerical values of embedding vectors, subtly or drastically changing how the application interprets and retrieves information, leading to biased or incorrect results.
    * HIGH-RISK: Inject malicious data into collections: Attackers with direct storage access inject fake or malicious data points into Chroma collections, polluting the data and potentially influencing application behavior or misleading users.
* HIGH-RISK PATH 2: Delete or Corrupt Data
    * Irreversibly remove or damage Chroma collections, impacting application functionality: Attackers with direct storage access delete entire collections or corrupt the underlying data files, leading to data loss and application downtime.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 3 & Critical Node: Exploit Chroma Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3_&_critical_node_exploit_chroma_dependencies.md)

* CRITICAL NODE: Identify and Exploit Vulnerable Dependencies: Attackers target vulnerabilities in the third-party libraries that Chroma relies on.
    * HIGH-RISK & CRITICAL NODE: Exploit known vulnerabilities in libraries used by Chroma (e.g., through supply chain attacks): Attackers exploit publicly known vulnerabilities in Chroma's dependencies. This can be done directly or through supply chain attacks where malicious code is injected into a dependency. Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution or other severe impacts.
    * HIGH-RISK & CRITICAL NODE: Leverage vulnerabilities in dependencies for code execution or information disclosure: Attackers identify and exploit less common or zero-day vulnerabilities in Chroma's dependencies to execute arbitrary code on the server or leak sensitive information.
