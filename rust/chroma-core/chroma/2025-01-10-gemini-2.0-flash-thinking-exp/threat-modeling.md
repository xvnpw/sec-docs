# Threat Model Analysis for chroma-core/chroma

## Threat: [Unauthorized Data Access via Chroma API](./threats/unauthorized_data_access_via_chroma_api.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Data Access via Chroma API
    *   **Description:** An attacker might attempt to bypass authentication or authorization mechanisms **on the Chroma API** to gain access to vector embeddings and associated metadata they are not intended to see. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities **in the API itself**, the application's authentication logic interacting with Chroma, or through leaked credentials used for Chroma access.
    *   **Impact:** Confidential vector embeddings or metadata could be exposed, potentially revealing sensitive information about the underlying data represented by the embeddings. This could lead to privacy violations, intellectual property theft, or competitive disadvantage.
    *   **Affected Component:** Chroma API endpoints (e.g., `/api/collections/{collection_name}/get`, `/api/collections/{collection_name}/query`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication mechanisms **for the Chroma API** (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0).
        *   Enforce authorization checks **at the Chroma API level** to ensure users can only access data they are permitted to.
        *   Use TLS/SSL to encrypt communication between the application and **the Chroma API**.
        *   Regularly audit access logs **on the Chroma instance or its access points** to detect suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Malicious Data Injection via Chroma API](./threats/malicious_data_injection_via_chroma_api.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Data Injection via Chroma API
    *   **Description:** An attacker, with or without authorized access, might inject crafted or malicious vector embeddings or metadata **into Chroma through its API**. This could be done to poison search results, influence application logic based on vector similarity, or potentially exploit vulnerabilities **in Chroma's indexing or processing logic**.
    *   **Impact:**  Search results could be manipulated to return incorrect or biased information. Application features relying on vector similarity could malfunction or provide misleading outputs. In severe cases, it might lead to data corruption **within Chroma** or application errors.
    *   **Affected Component:** Chroma API endpoints for adding data (e.g., `/api/collections/{collection_name}/add`). **Chroma's indexing and storage mechanisms.**
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all data before storing it **in Chroma**.
        *   Enforce strict data schemas and types for embeddings and metadata **within Chroma**.
        *   Implement access controls **on the Chroma API** to restrict who can add or modify data.
        *   Consider using checksums or other integrity checks to detect data tampering **within Chroma**.

## Threat: [Data Exfiltration via Chroma API](./threats/data_exfiltration_via_chroma_api.md)

*   **Threat:** Data Exfiltration via Chroma API
    *   **Description:** An attacker with unauthorized access **to the Chroma API** could attempt to extract large amounts of vector embeddings and metadata. This could be done by repeatedly querying **the API** or exploiting potential batch retrieval functionalities **offered by Chroma**.
    *   **Impact:**  Bulk exfiltration of sensitive vector embeddings and metadata **stored in Chroma**, leading to significant data breaches and potential misuse of the information.
    *   **Affected Component:** Chroma API endpoints for retrieving data (e.g., `/api/collections/{collection_name}/get`, `/api/collections/{collection_name}/query`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting and request throttling **on the Chroma API** to prevent excessive data retrieval.
        *   Monitor network traffic for unusual data egress patterns **originating from the Chroma instance**.
        *   Implement strong access controls and audit logging **on the Chroma API** to detect and prevent unauthorized access.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Chroma API](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_chroma_api.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) via Chroma API
    *   **Description:** An attacker could flood **the Chroma API** with a large number of requests, consuming resources and potentially causing the Chroma instance to become unresponsive or crash. This could disrupt the application's functionality that relies on Chroma.
    *   **Impact:**  Application downtime, impacting users and business operations. Potential data loss or corruption if the Chroma instance crashes unexpectedly.
    *   **Affected Component:** Chroma API endpoints. **Chroma's resource management** (CPU, memory, network).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting and request throttling **on the Chroma API**.
        *   Implement proper resource allocation and monitoring **for the Chroma instance**.
        *   Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to filter malicious traffic **targeting the Chroma API**.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Chroma's Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_chroma's_dependencies.md)

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Chroma's Dependencies
    *   **Description:** Chroma relies on various third-party libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited to compromise **the Chroma instance** or the application using it.
    *   **Impact:**  Potential for various security breaches depending on the nature of the dependency vulnerability, including remote code execution **on the Chroma server**, data breaches **within Chroma's storage**, or denial of service **affecting the Chroma instance**.
    *   **Affected Component:** **Chroma's dependencies** (e.g., libraries used for networking, data processing, etc.).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium to High (depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update Chroma to the latest version to benefit from security patches in its dependencies.
        *   Monitor security advisories for Chroma and its dependencies.
        *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities **in Chroma's dependencies**.

## Threat: [Insecure Chroma Configuration](./threats/insecure_chroma_configuration.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Chroma Configuration
    *   **Description:** Misconfigurations **of the Chroma instance**, such as default credentials, weak authentication settings, or open ports, could expose it to attacks.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access **to the Chroma instance**, data breaches **of data stored in Chroma**, or the ability for attackers to control **the Chroma instance**.
    *   **Affected Component:** **Chroma's configuration settings** and deployment environment.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow security best practices for deploying and configuring Chroma.
        *   Change default credentials immediately.
        *   Secure network access **to the Chroma instance**, limiting access to authorized applications.
        *   Regularly review and audit **Chroma's configuration**.
