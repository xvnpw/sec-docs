# Attack Surface Analysis for chroma-core/chroma

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated Chroma API Access](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_chroma_api_access.md)

**Description:** The Chroma API (either embedded or client/server mode) is accessible without any authentication requirements.

**How Chroma Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Chroma exposes an API for interaction. If not properly secured, this becomes a direct entry point.

**Example:** An attacker can directly send HTTP requests to the Chroma API endpoints to create, delete, query, or modify collections and embeddings without providing any credentials.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the vector database, including data loss, data corruption, and unauthorized access to sensitive information.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0) for accessing the Chroma API.
* Ensure that the Chroma API is not exposed publicly without authentication if using client/server mode.
* Utilize network security measures (firewalls, network segmentation) to restrict access to the Chroma API to authorized clients only.

## Attack Surface: [API Input Validation Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/api_input_validation_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** The Chroma API does not properly validate input parameters provided by users or the application.

**How Chroma Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Chroma accepts various data types through its API for creating collections, adding embeddings, and performing queries. Lack of validation can lead to unexpected behavior.

**Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious query with excessively long strings or special characters in metadata fields, potentially causing errors, resource exhaustion, or unexpected behavior in Chroma.

**Impact:** Denial of service, potential for data corruption, and in rare cases, potential for exploiting underlying library vulnerabilities.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict input validation on the application side before sending data to the Chroma API.
* Utilize Chroma's built-in validation mechanisms if available.
* Sanitize and escape user-provided data before using it in Chroma API calls.
* Implement rate limiting on API requests to prevent abuse.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Data through Chroma API](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_data_through_chroma_api.md)

**Description:** The Chroma API returns more information than necessary, potentially exposing sensitive data stored within the vector database.

**How Chroma Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Chroma stores embeddings and associated metadata. If API responses are not carefully controlled, sensitive information can be leaked.

**Example:** An attacker can craft specific queries that unintentionally reveal sensitive metadata associated with embeddings, such as user identifiers or confidential document titles.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, privacy violations, and potential misuse of sensitive data.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully design API queries and responses to only return necessary information.
* Implement access controls within Chroma (if available) to restrict access to sensitive collections or metadata.
* Filter or redact sensitive information from API responses before they are returned to the client.

## Attack Surface: [Chroma Persistence Layer Security Issues](./attack_surfaces/chroma_persistence_layer_security_issues.md)

**Description:** The underlying storage mechanism used by Chroma (e.g., DuckDB) is not properly secured.

**How Chroma Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Chroma relies on a persistence layer to store data. Weaknesses in this layer directly impact Chroma's security.

**Example:** If using a file-based persistence, an attacker gaining access to the server's filesystem could directly access or modify the Chroma database files.

**Impact:** Data breach, data corruption, and potential for complete compromise of the vector database.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Secure the underlying storage mechanism according to its best practices (e.g., file system permissions, encryption at rest).
* If using a client/server setup, ensure secure network communication between the Chroma server and the storage backend.
* Regularly back up the Chroma data to prevent permanent data loss in case of a security incident.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Chroma Client Library](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_chroma_client_library.md)

**Description:** The Chroma client library used by the application contains security vulnerabilities.

**How Chroma Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The client library is the primary way the application interacts with Chroma. Vulnerabilities here can be exploited.

**Example:** An outdated version of the Chroma Python client library might have a known vulnerability that allows for remote code execution if a specially crafted response is received from the Chroma server.

**Impact:** Potential for remote code execution on the application server, leading to complete system compromise.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep the Chroma client library updated to the latest stable version.
* Regularly review the security advisories for the Chroma client library and its dependencies.
* Implement secure coding practices when using the client library to avoid common pitfalls.
