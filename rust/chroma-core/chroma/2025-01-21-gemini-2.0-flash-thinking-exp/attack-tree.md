# Attack Tree Analysis for chroma-core/chroma

Objective: Attacker's Goal: To compromise the application using ChromaDB by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within ChromaDB itself.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

Compromise Application Using ChromaDB Weakness
*   Exploit Data Manipulation Vulnerabilities
    *   Inject Malicious Embeddings [CRITICAL]
*   Exploit Query/Retrieval Vulnerabilities
    *   Information Leakage via Query Manipulation [CRITICAL]
*   Exploit Operational/Deployment Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]
    *   Access to Underlying Data Store [CRITICAL]
```


## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Data Manipulation Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_data_manipulation_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This high-risk path focuses on manipulating the data stored within ChromaDB to compromise the application. The application trusts the integrity and content of the embeddings it retrieves from ChromaDB.

    *   **Inject Malicious Embeddings [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Attack Description:** An attacker crafts specific embedding vectors that, when retrieved by the application and used in its logic, cause unintended and harmful behavior. This could involve:
            *   **Code Injection:**  The embedding data, when processed, is interpreted as code and executed by the application.
            *   **Logic Errors:** The embedding is designed to trigger specific conditional branches or calculations within the application that lead to incorrect or malicious outcomes.
            *   **Data Manipulation within the Application:** The embedding influences the application to modify its own internal data or external systems in an unauthorized way.
        *   **Why it's Critical:** Successful injection of malicious embeddings can directly lead to code execution, data breaches, or significant disruption of the application's functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Query/Retrieval Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_queryretrieval_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This high-risk path targets vulnerabilities in how the application constructs and executes queries against ChromaDB, allowing attackers to retrieve more information than intended.

    *   **Information Leakage via Query Manipulation [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Attack Description:** An attacker crafts or manipulates queries sent to ChromaDB to bypass intended access controls and retrieve sensitive information that the application stores. This often occurs when:
            *   The application dynamically builds queries based on user input without proper sanitization.
            *   ChromaDB's own access controls (if any) are insufficient or can be bypassed through clever query construction.
        *   **Why it's Critical:**  Successful information leakage can expose confidential data, trade secrets, or personal information, leading to significant privacy breaches and regulatory consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Operational/Deployment Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_operationaldeployment_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This high-risk path focuses on weaknesses in how ChromaDB is deployed and operated, allowing attackers to bypass its intended security boundaries.

    *   **Access to Underlying Data Store [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Attack Description:** If ChromaDB uses a persistent storage mechanism (like DuckDB), and the underlying storage has weak permissions or is directly accessible, an attacker can bypass ChromaDB entirely and directly manipulate the stored data. This could involve:
            *   Directly reading sensitive data from the database files.
            *   Modifying or deleting embeddings and metadata without going through ChromaDB's API.
            *   Potentially injecting malicious data directly into the storage.
        *   **Why it's Critical:** Gaining direct access to the underlying data store represents a complete compromise of the data within ChromaDB. It bypasses all intended access controls and allows for unrestricted manipulation and exfiltration of information. The impact is very high as the attacker has full control over the data.
