# Threat Model Analysis for chroma-core/chroma

## Threat: [Data Poisoning](./threats/data_poisoning.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker, with sufficient privileges or by exploiting a vulnerability *within Chroma's data ingestion mechanisms*, injects malicious or subtly altered embeddings and/or metadata into Chroma. This could involve adding fake data points, manipulating existing ones, or inserting data designed to skew search results.
*   **Impact:** Compromised search accuracy, leading to incorrect information retrieval, biased results, and potentially misleading application users. In some cases, poisoned data could be crafted to trigger vulnerabilities in downstream processing or analysis.
*   **Affected Component:** `chromadb.api.models.Collection.add` function, underlying storage mechanisms (e.g., DuckDB, persistent storage).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all data *before* adding it to Chroma.
    *   Enforce strong authentication and authorization controls *within the application layer* to limit who can add or modify data in Chroma.
    *   Consider implementing data integrity checks or checksums *at the application level* to detect unauthorized modifications in Chroma.
    *   Monitor data insertion patterns for anomalies *at the application level*.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Data Access](./threats/unauthorized_data_access.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Chroma database, potentially through compromised credentials, *Chroma API vulnerabilities*, or misconfigurations *of the Chroma instance itself*. This allows them to view sensitive embeddings and associated metadata.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of potentially sensitive information embedded within the vectors or metadata. This could include personal data, proprietary information, or insights derived from the data.
*   **Affected Component:** Chroma API endpoints (e.g., `/api/v1/collections/{collection_name}/get`), underlying storage mechanisms, *Chroma's authentication and authorization modules (if implemented and vulnerable)*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for accessing the Chroma API *as recommended by Chroma's documentation*.
    *   Securely store and manage any API keys or credentials used to interact with Chroma.
    *   Enforce network segmentation to restrict access to the Chroma instance.
    *   Encrypt data at rest and in transit *as supported and configured within Chroma's deployment*.
    *   Regularly review and audit access logs *provided by Chroma or the underlying infrastructure*.

## Threat: [Data Modification/Tampering](./threats/data_modificationtampering.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker, with unauthorized access or by exploiting *vulnerabilities in Chroma's data modification mechanisms*, modifies existing embeddings or metadata within Chroma. This could involve altering vector representations or changing associated text or identifiers.
*   **Impact:** Corruption of the vector database, leading to inaccurate search results and potentially breaking application functionality that relies on the integrity of the data.
*   **Affected Component:** `chromadb.api.models.Collection.update` function, underlying storage mechanisms.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong access controls *at the application level* to restrict modification privileges in Chroma.
    *   Consider implementing data versioning or audit trails *at the application level* to track changes in Chroma.
    *   Regularly back up the Chroma database to facilitate recovery from data corruption.

## Threat: [Malicious Query Construction](./threats/malicious_query_construction.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts specific queries that exploit vulnerabilities *in Chroma's query processing logic*. This could involve overly complex queries that consume excessive resources *within Chroma*, queries designed to bypass access controls *implemented within Chroma*, or queries that trigger unexpected behavior *in Chroma*.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service due to resource exhaustion *within the Chroma instance*, potential information disclosure if access controls *within Chroma* are bypassed, or unexpected application behavior *due to Chroma's response*.
*   **Affected Component:** Chroma query processing engine (within `chromadb.api.models.Collection.query`), vector similarity search algorithms.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement input validation and sanitization on any user-provided input used in constructing Chroma queries.
    *   Enforce query complexity limits (e.g., maximum number of results, maximum query time) *at the application level when interacting with Chroma*.
    *   Regularly update Chroma to patch known query processing vulnerabilities.
    *   Monitor query patterns for suspicious activity *at the application level*.

## Threat: [API Key Compromise](./threats/api_key_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** If Chroma is configured to use API keys for authentication, an attacker could obtain these keys through various means (e.g., insecure storage, network interception, social engineering).
*   **Impact:** Full access to the Chroma instance, allowing the attacker to perform any operation, including data manipulation, deletion, and exfiltration.
*   **Affected Component:** Chroma API authentication mechanisms.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Securely store and manage API keys (e.g., using environment variables, secrets management systems).
    *   Implement API key rotation policies.
    *   Consider alternative authentication methods if available and more secure.
    *   Restrict the scope and permissions associated with API keys.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Chroma relies on various third-party libraries and dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited to compromise the Chroma instance or the application using it.
*   **Impact:**  A wide range of potential impacts depending on the specific vulnerability, including remote code execution, information disclosure, and denial of service *affecting the Chroma instance*.
*   **Affected Component:** All components within Chroma relying on vulnerable dependencies.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Chroma and its dependencies to the latest versions.
    *   Utilize dependency scanning tools to identify and address known vulnerabilities in Chroma's dependencies.
    *   Monitor security advisories for Chroma and its dependencies.

## Threat: [Insecure Default Configurations](./threats/insecure_default_configurations.md)

*   **Description:** Default configurations of Chroma might not be secure, potentially leaving the instance vulnerable to attack. This could include weak default passwords, open ports *configured by default in Chroma*, or disabled security features *that Chroma offers*.
*   **Impact:** Easier exploitation of other vulnerabilities, unauthorized access, and potential compromise of the Chroma instance.
*   **Affected Component:** Chroma configuration settings.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Review and harden the default configurations of Chroma upon deployment.
    *   Change default passwords and disable unnecessary features or services *within Chroma's configuration*.
    *   Follow security best practices for configuring the underlying infrastructure *hosting Chroma*.
