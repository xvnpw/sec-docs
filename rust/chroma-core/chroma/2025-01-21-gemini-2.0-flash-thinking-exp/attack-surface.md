# Attack Surface Analysis for chroma-core/chroma

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated or Weakly Authenticated Chroma API Access](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_or_weakly_authenticated_chroma_api_access.md)

* **Attack Surface:** Unauthenticated or Weakly Authenticated Chroma API Access
    * **Description:** The Chroma API is exposed without proper authentication or uses easily guessable/default credentials.
    * **How Chroma Contributes:** Chroma provides an API for interaction, and if not secured, becomes a direct entry point.
    * **Example:** An attacker directly calls Chroma API endpoints (e.g., `/api/v1/add`) without providing any credentials or using default API keys, allowing them to add, modify, or delete data.
    * **Impact:** Data breach (exfiltration, modification, deletion), denial of service, potential compromise of the application relying on Chroma.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strong authentication mechanisms like API keys, OAuth 2.0, or mutual TLS for accessing the Chroma API.
        * Ensure default API keys or credentials are changed immediately upon deployment.
        * Restrict network access to the Chroma API to only authorized services or IP addresses.
        * Regularly audit and rotate API keys.

## Attack Surface: [API Endpoint Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/api_endpoint_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Attack Surface:** API Endpoint Vulnerabilities
    * **Description:**  Vulnerabilities exist in Chroma's API endpoints that can be exploited.
    * **How Chroma Contributes:** Chroma's API implementation might contain bugs or logic flaws.
    * **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious payload in a request to the `/api/v1/query` endpoint that causes Chroma to crash or leak internal information. This could involve overly long strings, unexpected data types, or attempts to bypass input validation.
    * **Impact:** Denial of service, information disclosure (e.g., internal paths, error details), potential for remote code execution (less likely but possible depending on the vulnerability).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep Chroma updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
        * Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all data sent to Chroma API endpoints.
        * Perform security testing (e.g., fuzzing, penetration testing) specifically targeting the Chroma API.
        * Implement rate limiting and request size limits to mitigate potential denial-of-service attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Data Storage and Persistence](./attack_surfaces/insecure_data_storage_and_persistence.md)

* **Attack Surface:** Insecure Data Storage and Persistence
    * **Description:** Chroma's stored data (vector embeddings and metadata) is not adequately protected.
    * **How Chroma Contributes:** Chroma manages the storage of vector data, and its security depends on its implementation and configuration.
    * **Example:** If Chroma stores data on disk with overly permissive file system permissions, an attacker gaining access to the server could directly read or modify the vector embeddings and associated metadata.
    * **Impact:** Data breach (exfiltration, modification), data corruption, potential manipulation of application behavior based on altered embeddings.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Ensure Chroma's data storage location has appropriate file system permissions, restricting access to only the necessary user accounts.
        * Consider encrypting the data at rest if Chroma supports it or by using underlying storage encryption mechanisms.
        * Regularly back up Chroma data and store backups securely.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Chroma's Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_chroma's_dependencies.md)

* **Attack Surface:** Vulnerabilities in Chroma's Dependencies
    * **Description:**  Chroma relies on third-party libraries that may contain security vulnerabilities.
    * **How Chroma Contributes:** Chroma integrates these dependencies into its codebase.
    * **Example:** A known vulnerability exists in a specific version of a library used by Chroma. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability if the application is running a vulnerable version of Chroma.
    * **Impact:**  Varies depending on the vulnerability, but could range from denial of service to remote code execution.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update Chroma to the latest version, which typically includes updates to its dependencies.
        * Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in Chroma's dependencies.
        * Monitor security advisories for Chroma and its dependencies.
