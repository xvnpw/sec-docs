# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for chroma-core/chroma

## Mitigation Strategy: [Authentication and Authorization (Chroma Server)](./mitigation_strategies/authentication_and_authorization__chroma_server_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Authentication and Authorization (Chroma Server)

**Description:**
1.  **Enable Authentication:** If using Chroma in a client-server configuration, *ensure authentication is enabled on the Chroma server itself*. This is a configuration setting within Chroma.
2.  **Strong Credentials:** Use strong, unique passwords or API keys/tokens for client authentication *to the Chroma server*. Avoid default credentials. Configure these within Chroma's settings.
3.  **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** If Chroma supports it (future versions might), implement RBAC *within Chroma* to define different roles with specific permissions.  If not directly supported, simulate RBAC through careful management of client-side access and query construction (see below).
4.  **Regular Audits:** Periodically review Chroma's user accounts and permissions (if applicable) to ensure they are still appropriate. This involves checking Chroma's configuration.

**Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (Severity: High):** Prevents unauthorized clients from connecting to the Chroma server.
    *   **Data Modification (Severity: High):** Limits the ability of unauthorized clients to modify data or embeddings stored in Chroma.
    *   **Data Exfiltration (Severity: High):** Restricts access to sensitive data stored in Chroma.

**Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** High impact; fundamental security control for the Chroma server.
    *   **Data Modification:** High impact; protects data integrity within Chroma.
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** High impact; limits data leakage from Chroma.

**Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic authentication using username/password is enabled in Chroma's configuration.

**Missing Implementation:**
    *   No RBAC implemented *within Chroma* (relying on client-side controls).
    *   No regular audits of Chroma's user accounts and permissions (if applicable).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting (Chroma Server)](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting__chroma_server_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Rate Limiting (Chroma Server)

**Description:**
1.  **Chroma-Level Rate Limiting:** If Chroma provides built-in rate limiting capabilities (check the server configuration and documentation), configure these limits directly within Chroma.
2.  **Define Limits:** Set rate limits based on the type of request (reads, writes, deletes) and expected usage patterns.  Configure these limits *within Chroma's settings*.
3.  **Monitor and Adjust:** Continuously monitor Chroma's rate limiting effectiveness (if available through Chroma's monitoring features) and adjust limits as needed.

**Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: High):** Prevents attackers from overwhelming the Chroma server with requests.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Severity: High):** Protects Chroma's resources from being depleted.
    *   **Abuse (Severity: Medium):** Limits the ability of users to abuse the Chroma server.

**Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** High impact; essential for protecting the Chroma server against DoS.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** High impact; prevents Chroma's resources from being depleted.
    *   **Abuse:** Moderate impact; controls usage of the Chroma server.

**Currently Implemented:**
    *   No rate limiting is currently implemented *within Chroma*.

**Missing Implementation:**
    *   Chroma-level rate limiting is completely missing (if supported by the version in use).  This is a significant vulnerability *if* Chroma offers this feature.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Query Complexity Limits](./mitigation_strategies/query_complexity_limits.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Query Complexity Limits

**Description:**
1.  **Maximum Results:** Enforce a limit on the number of results returned by a single query *using Chroma's query parameters* (e.g., the `limit` parameter in `get()` or `query()`).
2.  **Maximum Distance/Similarity Threshold:** Set limits on the acceptable distance or similarity threshold *within Chroma's query parameters* (e.g., `where` clause with distance constraints).
3.  **Filter Complexity:** Limit the complexity of filtering conditions *within Chroma's query parameters* (e.g., the number of `AND` or `OR` clauses in the `where` clause).  This might require careful client-side construction of queries.
4.  **Query String Length:** If Chroma exposes a raw query string interface, limit the length of the query string *that is sent to Chroma*.
5.  **Informative Error Messages:** If Chroma returns error messages for exceeding complexity limits, ensure your application handles these gracefully.

**Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: High):** Prevents attackers from crafting computationally expensive queries that could overload Chroma.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Severity: High):** Limits Chroma's resource consumption by complex queries.

**Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** High impact; protects Chroma from resource exhaustion attacks.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** High impact; controls Chroma's resource usage.

**Currently Implemented:**
    *   A maximum results limit (`limit=100`) is enforced *when calling Chroma's `query()` function*.

**Missing Implementation:**
    *   No limits on distance/similarity thresholds *within Chroma queries*.
    *   No limits on filter complexity *within Chroma queries* (relying on client-side validation, which is less effective).
    *   No limits on query string length (if applicable to the Chroma interface used).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Outlier Detection (Post-Embedding, within Chroma)](./mitigation_strategies/outlier_detection__post-embedding__within_chroma_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Outlier Detection (Post-Embedding, within Chroma)

**Description:**
    1. **Leverage Chroma's Filtering:** If Chroma provides built-in functions or filtering capabilities that can be used for outlier detection (e.g., range queries on embedding dimensions, nearest neighbor searches with distance thresholds), use these *directly within Chroma queries*.
    2. **Post-Processing of Chroma Results:** If Chroma doesn't have direct outlier detection, retrieve embeddings from Chroma (using appropriate limits and filters) and perform outlier detection *using the retrieved data*. This is less efficient but still leverages Chroma's storage and retrieval.
    3. **Quarantine within Chroma:** If outliers are detected, use Chroma's update or delete functionality to mark them as inactive or remove them from the active collection. This keeps the outlier management *within the Chroma context*.

**Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Data Poisoning (Severity: Critical):** Identifies and isolates potentially malicious embeddings *stored in Chroma*.
    * **Embedding Manipulation (Severity: Critical):** Detects embeddings *within Chroma* that have been altered or injected.

**Impact:**
    * **Data Poisoning:** Moderate to high impact; depends on how effectively Chroma's features can be used for outlier detection.
    * **Embedding Manipulation:** Moderate to high impact; helps identify and isolate manipulated embeddings *within Chroma*.

**Currently Implemented:**
    * Basic distance-based outlier detection is implemented by retrieving embeddings from Chroma and processing them externally.

**Missing Implementation:**
    * No direct use of Chroma's filtering capabilities (if any exist) for outlier detection.
    * No automated quarantining of outliers *within Chroma*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Inference Attack Mitigations (Query-Level)](./mitigation_strategies/inference_attack_mitigations__query-level_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Inference Attack Mitigations (Query-Level)

**Description:**
1.  **Access Control to Query Results (Chroma-Specific):** Implement fine-grained access control *at the query level*.  This means constructing Chroma queries that *only retrieve data the user is authorized to see*.  This leverages Chroma's filtering capabilities (`where` clause) to enforce access control.  This is *crucial* because it prevents the application from even *accessing* unauthorized data within Chroma.
2.  **Audit Query Logs (If Chroma Provides):** If Chroma provides query logging, regularly review these logs *specifically looking for patterns that might indicate inference attacks*.
3. **Data Minimization (Collection Design):** When designing your Chroma collections, only store the minimum necessary data. Avoid storing unnecessary sensitive information *within Chroma*.

**Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Inference Attacks (Severity: Medium to High):** Reduces the risk of attackers inferring sensitive information from query results *returned by Chroma*.

**Impact:**
    *   **Inference Attacks:** The impact depends on the granularity of access control implemented *through Chroma queries*.  Fine-grained control is essential.

**Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic access control to query results based on user roles, implemented by modifying the `where` clause in Chroma queries.

**Missing Implementation:**
    *   No regular auditing of Chroma's query logs (if available).
    *   No formal data minimization policy applied to Chroma collection design.
