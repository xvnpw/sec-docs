# Threat Model Analysis for chroma-core/chroma

## Threat: [Unauthorized Data Modification via API](./threats/unauthorized_data_modification_via_api.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker, without proper authentication, sends crafted HTTP requests to the Chroma API (e.g., `POST /api/v1/add`, `POST /api/v1/update`, `POST /api/v1/delete`) to add, modify, or delete embeddings and associated metadata. The attacker might use common API attack techniques like parameter tampering or injection.
    *   **Impact:** Data integrity compromise, leading to incorrect search results, biased AI model behavior, or complete data loss.  Could also lead to data poisoning if the attacker inserts malicious embeddings.
    *   **Affected Chroma Component:** Chroma API Server (specifically, the endpoints handling data modification: `/add`, `/update`, `/delete`, and related functions within `chromadb/api/fastapi.py` and `chromadb/server/fastapi/__init__.py` and data validation logic in `chromadb/api/models/Collection.py`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication for all API endpoints using API keys, JWTs, or mTLS.  Enforce authentication *before* any data processing.
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all API parameters to prevent injection attacks.  Validate data types, lengths, and formats.  Use a schema validation library.
        *   Implement authorization checks to ensure that authenticated users only have access to the data and operations they are permitted to use.  Use a role-based access control (RBAC) system.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Excessive Embedding Additions](./threats/denial_of_service_via_excessive_embedding_additions.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a large number of `POST /api/v1/add` requests with validly formatted but potentially meaningless embeddings, overwhelming Chroma's storage and processing capacity. This could exhaust disk space, memory, or CPU resources.
    *   **Impact:** Chroma server becomes unresponsive, preventing legitimate users from accessing or using the service.  Potential data loss if disk space is completely exhausted.
    *   **Affected Chroma Component:** Chroma API Server (`chromadb/api/fastapi.py`), Embedding Storage (`chromadb/db/*` - specifically, the chosen database implementation like DuckDB or ClickHouse), and potentially the embedding generation component if it's integrated with Chroma.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting on the `/add` endpoint, restricting the number of additions per client/IP address/time window.
        *   Implement resource quotas (disk space, memory) for individual collections or users.
        *   Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O) and trigger alerts when thresholds are exceeded.
        *   Use a scalable database backend (e.g., ClickHouse) that can handle large volumes of data.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Complex Similarity Queries](./threats/denial_of_service_via_complex_similarity_queries.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts computationally expensive similarity search queries (`POST /api/v1/get`, `POST /api/v1/query`) using large `n_results` values, high-dimensional embeddings, or inefficient distance metrics. This exploits the computational complexity of nearest neighbor search.
    *   **Impact:** Chroma server becomes unresponsive due to high CPU and memory usage, impacting all users.
    *   **Affected Chroma Component:** Chroma API Server (`chromadb/api/fastapi.py`), Query Engine (`chromadb/segment/` and related index implementations like HNSW in `chromadb/segment/impl/index/hnswlib.py`), Distance Calculation functions (`chromadb/utils/distance_fns.py`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Limit the maximum value of `n_results` that can be requested.
        *   Implement query timeouts to terminate long-running queries.
        *   Provide options for users to select less computationally expensive distance metrics (e.g., cosine similarity instead of Euclidean distance if appropriate).
        *   Optimize indexing strategies (e.g., using appropriate HNSW parameters) to improve query performance.
        *   Consider pre-computing and caching results for frequently used queries.

## Threat: [Configuration File Tampering](./threats/configuration_file_tampering.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the Chroma server's file system and modifies the configuration file (e.g., `chroma_server.yaml` or environment variables), disabling security features, changing persistence settings, or altering logging configurations.
    *   **Impact:**  Weakened security posture, potential data loss, or inability to audit actions.  Could lead to other vulnerabilities becoming exploitable.
    *   **Affected Chroma Component:** Chroma Server startup and configuration loading logic (`chromadb/config.py`, `chromadb/server/*`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store the configuration file in a secure location with restricted access permissions (read-only for most users, write access only for designated administrators).
        *   Use a configuration management tool (e.g., Ansible, Chef, Puppet) to manage and enforce consistent configurations.
        *   Implement file integrity monitoring to detect unauthorized changes to the configuration file.
        *   Use environment variables for sensitive configuration settings (e.g., API keys, database credentials) instead of storing them directly in the configuration file.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (High/Critical Impact)](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities__highcritical_impact_.md)

*   **Description:**  Chroma depends on various third-party libraries. *High or critical* vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited to compromise Chroma, leading to severe consequences.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, but *high or critical* vulnerabilities could lead to remote code execution, complete data compromise, or complete denial of service.
    *   **Affected Chroma Component:** Potentially any component that uses the vulnerable dependency.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High/Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update Chroma and its dependencies to the latest versions.
        *   Use a software composition analysis (SCA) tool to identify and track known vulnerabilities in dependencies, *prioritizing high and critical severity issues*.
        *   Consider using a dependency pinning strategy to control the specific versions of dependencies used.
        *   Monitor security advisories for the dependencies used by Chroma, *focusing on high and critical alerts*.
