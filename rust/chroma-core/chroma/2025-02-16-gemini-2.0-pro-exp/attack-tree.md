## Attack Tree Path: [Unauthorized API Access (1.1) -> Weak API Keys/Secrets (1.1.1)](./attack_tree_paths/unauthorized_api_access__1_1__-_weak_api_keyssecrets__1_1_1_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker gains unauthorized access to the Chroma API by exploiting weak or compromised API keys.
*   **Attack Steps:**
    1.  **Reconnaissance:** The attacker attempts to discover API keys through various means.
    2.  **Credential Acquisition:**
        *   **Guessing:** Attempting to guess weak or default API keys.
        *   **Theft:** Stealing keys from exposed locations (e.g., `.env` files, Git history, misconfigured cloud storage, source code).
        *   **Phishing/Social Engineering:** Tricking developers or administrators into revealing their keys.
    3.  **API Exploitation:** Using the acquired keys to directly access the Chroma API and retrieve data.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Very Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Resource Exhaustion (2.1) -> Embedding Flood (2.1.1)](./attack_tree_paths/resource_exhaustion__2_1__-_embedding_flood__2_1_1_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker overwhelms the Chroma server with a large number of embedding requests, causing a denial of service.
*   **Attack Steps:**
    1.  **Script Preparation:** The attacker creates a script or uses a tool to generate a large volume of embedding requests.
    2.  **Request Flood:** The script sends a continuous stream of requests to the Chroma API, targeting the embedding endpoints.
    3.  **Resource Depletion:** The server's resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) are exhausted, leading to slow response times or complete unavailability.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Chroma Server Vulnerabilities (1.2) -> Deserialization Vulnerabilities (1.2.2)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_chroma_server_vulnerabilities__1_2__-_deserialization_vulnerabilities__1_2_2_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker exploits a vulnerability in Chroma's deserialization process to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Attack Steps:**
    1.  **Vulnerability Identification:** The attacker identifies a Chroma endpoint that uses unsafe deserialization (e.g., Python's `pickle`).
    2.  **Payload Crafting:** The attacker crafts a malicious serialized object that, when deserialized, will execute their desired code. This often involves using known "gadget chains" for the specific serialization library.
    3.  **Payload Delivery:** The attacker sends the malicious payload to the vulnerable endpoint.
    4.  **Code Execution:** When Chroma deserializes the payload, the attacker's code is executed, potentially leading to data exfiltration, system compromise, or other malicious actions.
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** High
*   **Skill Level:** High
*   **Detection Difficulty:** High
