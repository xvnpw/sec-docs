# Attack Surface Analysis for chroma-core/chroma

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Data Access](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_data_access.md)

*Description:* Attackers gain access to embeddings and metadata stored *within Chroma* that they should not be able to see.
*Chroma Contribution:* Chroma is the data store and access point; its internal access control mechanisms (or lack thereof) are directly responsible.
*Example:* An attacker exploits a misconfigured Chroma API endpoint or a vulnerability in Chroma's authentication to query the database and retrieve sensitive embeddings.
*Impact:* Data breach, privacy violation, regulatory non-compliance, reputational damage.
*Risk Severity:* **Critical** (if sensitive data is involved) or **High** (for less sensitive data).
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   Implement strong authentication within Chroma (e.g., API keys with limited scope, robust user management if supported).
    *   Enforce granular authorization *within Chroma* (e.g., collection-level permissions, if available).  If Chroma lacks fine-grained controls, this must be enforced at the application layer *before* interacting with Chroma.
    *   Regularly audit Chroma's access logs and configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (Resource Exhaustion) - Targeting Chroma](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__resource_exhaustion__-_targeting_chroma.md)

*Description:* Attackers flood *Chroma itself* with requests or large data insertions, making the Chroma service unavailable.
*Chroma Contribution:* Chroma's query processing and data storage mechanisms are the direct targets.  Its internal handling of resource limits is crucial.
*Example:* An attacker sends thousands of queries per second directly to the Chroma API, overwhelming the Chroma server and causing it to crash or become unresponsive.
*Impact:* Chroma service disruption, loss of availability for all applications using that Chroma instance.
*Risk Severity:* **High**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   Configure Chroma's internal rate limiting and resource quotas (if supported).  If not supported natively, implement these limits *at the application layer* before requests reach Chroma.
    *   Monitor Chroma's server resource usage (CPU, memory, storage, network) and set alerts for anomalies.
    *   If using a Chroma deployment that supports it, scale horizontally to distribute the load.
    *   Implement robust error handling *within Chroma* (and the application layer) to prevent crashes due to malformed requests.

## Attack Surface: [Code Injection/RCE (within Chroma)](./attack_surfaces/code_injectionrce__within_chroma_.md)

*Description:* Attackers exploit vulnerabilities *in Chroma's code or its direct dependencies* to execute arbitrary code on the server running Chroma.
*Chroma Contribution:* This is entirely dependent on vulnerabilities *within Chroma itself* or libraries *directly bundled with or required by* Chroma.
*Example:* An attacker discovers a vulnerability in Chroma's query parsing logic and crafts a malicious API request that exploits this vulnerability to gain shell access to the server running Chroma.
*Impact:* Complete server compromise *of the Chroma instance*, data theft, data manipulation, potential lateral movement (if the server has network access).
*Risk Severity:* **Critical**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   Keep Chroma *itself* up-to-date with the latest security patches. This is paramount.
    *   Use software composition analysis (SCA) tools to identify and track vulnerabilities in Chroma *and its direct dependencies*.
    *   Regularly conduct security audits and penetration testing *specifically targeting the Chroma deployment*.
    *   Run Chroma in a sandboxed or containerized environment to limit the impact of a successful exploit *on the host system*.  This does *not* prevent compromise of Chroma itself, but limits the blast radius.
