## Attack Tree Path: [**High-Risk Path 1: Exploit Client-Side Solana Interactions**](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_exploit_client-side_solana_interactions.md)

This path represents attacks targeting the user's interaction with the Solana blockchain through the application's client-side interface.
The primary risk lies in gaining control of the user's private key or manipulating their transaction signing process.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Critical Node & High-Risk Path 1.1: Compromise User's Private Key**](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_&_high-risk_path_1_1_compromise_user's_private_key.md)

This is a critical node because a compromised private key grants the attacker complete control over the user's associated Solana accounts and assets.
This path is high-risk due to the potential for direct financial loss for the user.

## Attack Tree Path: [**High-Risk Path 1.1.1: Phishing Attack Targeting Wallet Credentials**](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_1_1_phishing_attack_targeting_wallet_credentials.md)

*   Attack Vector: An attacker deceives the user into providing their private key or seed phrase by impersonating a legitimate entity (e.g., the application, a wallet provider). This can be done through fake websites, emails, or social media messages.
*   Impact: Complete compromise of the user's Solana wallet, leading to potential theft of all associated assets.
*   Likelihood: High, as phishing attacks are common and often successful against less vigilant users.

## Attack Tree Path: [**High-Risk Path 2: Exploit Backend Solana Interactions**](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_exploit_backend_solana_interactions.md)

This path focuses on attacks targeting the application's backend infrastructure and its interaction with the Solana blockchain.
The core risk is the compromise of the backend server's private key, which allows the attacker to act on behalf of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Critical Node & High-Risk Path 2.1: Compromise Backend Server's Private Key**](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_&_high-risk_path_2_1_compromise_backend_server's_private_key.md)

This is a critical node because the backend server's private key is used to sign transactions and interact with Solana on behalf of the application. Compromise of this key grants the attacker significant control.
This path is high-risk as it can lead to the unauthorized transfer of funds, manipulation of on-chain data, or disruption of application functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [**High-Risk Path 2.1.1: Exploiting Server Vulnerabilities (e.g., RCE)**](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_1_1_exploiting_server_vulnerabilities__e_g___rce_.md)

*   Attack Vector: Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the backend server's operating system, web server, or application code (e.g., Remote Code Execution - RCE) to gain unauthorized access and potentially retrieve the stored private key.
*   Impact: Complete compromise of the backend server, including access to the private key, leading to potential theft of funds or manipulation of application state.
*   Likelihood: Medium, depending on the security practices implemented on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [**High-Risk Path 2.1.2: Insider Threat/Compromised Credentials**](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_1_2_insider_threatcompromised_credentials.md)

*   Attack Vector: A malicious insider with authorized access or an external attacker who has compromised legitimate administrative credentials gains access to the server and retrieves the private key.
*   Impact: Similar to exploiting server vulnerabilities, leading to potential theft of funds or manipulation of application state.
*   Likelihood: Low, but the impact is critical if successful.

## Attack Tree Path: [**High-Risk Path 2.1.3: Misconfigured Key Management (e.g., Stored in Plaintext)**](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_1_3_misconfigured_key_management__e_g___stored_in_plaintext_.md)

*   Attack Vector: The backend server's private key is stored insecurely, such as in plaintext files, easily accessible configuration files, or unencrypted databases.
*   Impact: Easy retrieval of the private key by an attacker who gains even limited access to the server.
*   Likelihood: Medium, as developers may sometimes overlook secure key management practices.

## Attack Tree Path: [**High-Risk Path 3: Exploit Smart Contract (Program) Vulnerabilities**](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3_exploit_smart_contract__program__vulnerabilities.md)

This path focuses on vulnerabilities within the Solana smart contracts (programs) that the application interacts with.
Exploiting these vulnerabilities can lead to unauthorized state changes, theft of assets, or disruption of the contract's intended functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [**High-Risk Path 3.1: Logic Errors in Program Code**](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3_1_logic_errors_in_program_code.md)

This path covers common programming errors in smart contracts that can be exploited.

## Attack Tree Path: [**High-Risk Path 3.1.1: Reentrancy Attacks Leading to Unauthorized State Changes**](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3_1_1_reentrancy_attacks_leading_to_unauthorized_state_changes.md)

*   Attack Vector: An attacker leverages a vulnerability where a function can be called recursively before the initial call's state changes are finalized, potentially allowing them to drain funds or manipulate state in an unintended way.
*   Impact: Significant financial loss or manipulation of the smart contract's state.
*   Likelihood: Medium, especially if standard reentrancy prevention patterns are not implemented.

## Attack Tree Path: [**High-Risk Path 3.1.2: Integer Overflow/Underflow Leading to Incorrect Calculations**](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3_1_2_integer_overflowunderflow_leading_to_incorrect_calculations.md)

*   Attack Vector:  Mathematical operations within the smart contract can result in integer overflow or underflow, leading to incorrect calculations for balances, rewards, or other critical values.
*   Impact: Financial loss or incorrect state updates due to flawed calculations.
*   Likelihood: Medium, if safe math libraries are not used or proper checks are missing.

## Attack Tree Path: [**High-Risk Path 3.1.3: Incorrect Access Control Leading to Unauthorized Actions**](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3_1_3_incorrect_access_control_leading_to_unauthorized_actions.md)

*   Attack Vector: Flaws in the smart contract's access control logic allow unauthorized users or contracts to perform privileged actions, such as withdrawing funds or modifying critical parameters.
*   Impact: Unauthorized modification of the smart contract's state or theft of assets.
*   Likelihood: Medium, if access control mechanisms are not carefully designed and implemented.

## Attack Tree Path: [**High-Risk Path 3.1.5: Business Logic Flaws Allowing Exploitation of Functionality**](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3_1_5_business_logic_flaws_allowing_exploitation_of_functionality.md)

*   Attack Vector:  Flaws in the intended business logic of the smart contract allow attackers to manipulate the contract in unintended ways to gain an advantage or steal assets. This can be a broad category encompassing various design flaws.
*   Impact:  Can range from minor disruptions to significant financial losses, depending on the specific flaw.
*   Likelihood: Medium, as complex business logic can be prone to oversights.

## Attack Tree Path: [**High-Risk Path 3.2: Solana-Specific Program Vulnerabilities**](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3_2_solana-specific_program_vulnerabilities.md)

This path highlights vulnerabilities unique to the Solana programming model.

## Attack Tree Path: [**High-Risk Path 3.2.1: Account Confusion Attacks**](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3_2_1_account_confusion_attacks.md)

*   Attack Vector: Attackers exploit the flexible account model in Solana to trick a program into processing instructions with accounts it was not intended to interact with, potentially leading to unauthorized access or state changes.
*   Impact: Unauthorized access to or manipulation of account data.
*   Likelihood: Medium, requires careful design and validation of account addresses within program logic.
