## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict CPI Ordering and Reentrancy Guards (Solana-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_cpi_ordering_and_reentrancy_guards__solana-specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Analyze CPI Flow (Solana Context):**  Thoroughly map out all cross-program invocations (CPIs) within your Solana program.  Identify any potential for recursive calls *back into your own program* via other Solana programs. This is crucial because Solana's single-threaded execution *within an instruction* doesn't prevent reentrancy across CPIs.
2.  **State Updates Before CPIs:**  Structure your Solana program's logic so that *all* state changes (modifications to Solana account data) are completed *before* any CPIs are made. This leverages Solana's account model to ensure consistency.
3.  **Reentrancy Guard Implementation (Solana-Specific):**
    *   Use a Solana account (or a field within an existing Solana account) to store the reentrancy guard. This leverages Solana's state management.
    *   At the *beginning* of your Solana program's entry point, check the guard. If locked, return a `ProgramError`.
    *   Immediately *set* the guard to locked.
    *   At the *end* of your Solana program's entry point (even on error), *reset* the guard. Use a pattern that guarantees this reset, even with Solana's error handling.
    *   For *CPI-aware* guards (essential on Solana), use a counter. Increment before the CPI, decrement after. Only allow execution if the counter is zero initially. This accounts for Solana's CPI depth limits.
4.  **Post-CPI Validation (Solana Accounts):** After *each* CPI, re-validate the state of *your program's Solana accounts*.  The called program might have modified them. This is critical in Solana's mutable account model.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **CPI Reentrancy (Solana-Specific):** (Severity: Critical) - Prevents attackers from recursively calling your Solana program via CPIs to manipulate state, steal funds, or bypass security checks. This is *unique* to Solana's CPI mechanism.
    *   **Logic Errors (Solana State):** (Severity: High) - Reduces logic errors from inconsistent Solana account state due to CPIs.
    *   **Data Corruption (Solana Accounts):** (Severity: High) - Post-CPI validation prevents data corruption in Solana accounts by external programs.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **CPI Reentrancy:** Risk reduced from Critical to Low.
    *   **Logic Errors:** Risk reduced from High to Medium.
    *   **Data Corruption:** Risk reduced from High to Medium.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Hypothetical Project)
    *   Partially. Reentrancy guards (boolean) in `programs/token_transfer/src/lib.rs`. CPI ordering mostly followed, but post-CPI validation is inconsistent.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   CPI-aware guards (counters) missing for instructions with multiple CPIs (e.g., `batch_transfer`).
    *   Post-CPI validation missing in handlers interacting with custom oracles.
    *   Consistent guard reset pattern (like `finally`) is not used, risking human error.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Account Ownership and PDA Validation (Solana-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/account_ownership_and_pda_validation__solana-specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Ownership Checks (Solana Account Model):** At the start of each instruction handler, verify the ownership of *all* Solana accounts passed.
    *   `account_info.is_signer`: Check if a Solana account has signed (for signer accounts).
    *   `account_info.owner == program_id`: Check if a Solana account is owned by *your* program.
    *   `account_info.owner == expected_owner`: Check if a Solana account is owned by a *specific* program (e.g., the Token Program).  This is crucial for interacting with other Solana programs.
2.  **PDA Derivation (Solana-Specific):**
    *   When using a PDA (Program Derived Address), *always* re-derive it within your Solana program using `Pubkey::find_program_address(&[seeds], &program_id)`. 
    *   Compare the re-derived PDA to the one provided in the instruction data. Return a `ProgramError` if they don't match.
    *   *Never* trust a user-provided PDA without this verification. This is fundamental to Solana's security model.
3.  **Seeds Validation (Solana PDAs):**  Carefully validate the *seeds* used for PDA derivation. Ensure they are the correct type/length and prevent predictable PDAs.
4.  **Bump Seed Handling (Solana PDAs):** Store the bump seed securely within the Solana account data. Use it consistently and protect it from modification.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Account Access (Solana Accounts):** (Severity: Critical) - Prevents unauthorized access to Solana accounts.
    *   **PDA Manipulation (Solana-Specific):** (Severity: Critical) - Prevents attackers from using incorrect or malicious PDAs. This is *unique* to Solana.
    *   **Account Substitution (Solana Accounts):** (Severity: High) - Prevents substituting one Solana account for another.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduced from Critical to Low.
    *   **PDA Manipulation:** Risk reduced from Critical to Low.
    *   **Account Substitution:** Risk reduced from High to Low.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Hypothetical Project)
    *   Mostly. Ownership checks and PDA validation are common.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Missing ownership checks for some configuration/metadata accounts.
    *   Incomplete seeds validation, potentially allowing edge-case PDA manipulation.
    *   Inconsistent bump seed handling.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Compute Unit Budgeting and Optimization (Solana-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/compute_unit_budgeting_and_optimization__solana-specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Profiling (Solana Compute Units):** Use Solana's profiling tools to measure the *compute unit* consumption of your program's instructions. Identify hotspots.
2.  **Algorithm Optimization (for Compute Units):** Optimize algorithms and data structures to reduce computational complexity, *specifically* to minimize Solana compute unit usage.
3.  **Loop Optimization (Solana Limits):** Minimize loop iterations. Avoid nested loops. If iterating over many Solana accounts, use pagination to stay within compute unit limits.
4.  **CPI Optimization (Solana Costs):** Minimize CPI calls, as each consumes Solana compute units.
5.  **Data Structure Size (Solana Serialization):** Minimize Solana account data structure size to reduce serialization/deserialization compute unit costs.
6.  **Conditional Logic (Solana Efficiency):** Use `if` statements to avoid unnecessary computations, saving Solana compute units.
7. **Early Exits (Solana Cost Reduction):** Return early from instruction handlers if preconditions are not met, to save compute units.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Solana Compute Units):** (Severity: High) - Reduces the risk of exceeding Solana's compute unit limits. This is *unique* to Solana's resource model.
    *   **Transaction Failures (Solana Limits):** (Severity: Medium) - Reduces failures due to excessive compute unit consumption.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Risk reduced from High to Medium.
    *   **Transaction Failures:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Hypothetical Project)
    *   Partially. Some basic optimization.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive profiling and optimization not done.
    *   Inefficient loops and data structures present.
    *   CPI calls not always minimized.
    *   No specific compute unit budget enforced.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rent Exemption (Solana-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/rent_exemption__solana-specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify All Accounts (Solana):** Identify all Solana accounts your program creates.
2.  **Calculate Minimum Balance (Solana Rent):** Use `Rent::get()?.minimum_balance(account_data_len)` to calculate the minimum balance for rent exemption. `account_data_len` is the Solana account data size in bytes. This is *entirely Solana-specific*.
3.  **Ensure Sufficient Lamports (Solana):** When creating a Solana account, fund it with *at least* the minimum balance for rent exemption.
4.  **Handle Insufficient Funds (Solana):** If insufficient lamports, return a `ProgramError`.
5.  **Reallocation (Solana Rent):** If increasing a Solana account's size, increase lamports to maintain rent exemption. Use `reallocate` and transfer lamports.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Account Deletion (Solana Rent):** (Severity: High) - Prevents Solana accounts from being deleted due to insufficient rent. This is *unique* to Solana.
    *   **Data Loss (Solana Accounts):** (Severity: High) - Prevents data loss from account deletion.
    *   **Program Failure (Solana Dependencies):** (Severity: High) - Prevents failures if a relied-upon Solana account is deleted.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Account Deletion:** Risk reduced from High to Low.
    *   **Data Loss:** Risk reduced from High to Low.
    *   **Program Failure:** Risk reduced from High to Low.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Hypothetical Project)
    *   Mostly. Most account creation functions ensure rent exemption.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Some older functions don't properly handle rent exemption.
    *   Reallocation logic doesn't always maintain rent exemption.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Schema Definition and Account Data Validation (Solana-Focused)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_schema_definition_and_account_data_validation__solana-focused_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Borsh Schema (Solana Serialization):** Define clear `borsh` schemas for all Solana account data structures and instruction data. Use Rust structs and enums. Borsh is the default and recommended serialization format for Solana.
2.  **Discriminator Fields (Solana Type Safety):** Include discriminator fields (enums or unique IDs) to distinguish between different Solana account types or instruction variants. This is crucial to prevent type confusion attacks *within Solana's account model*.
3.  **Deserialization (Solana Borsh):** Use `borsh::try_from_slice` to deserialize Solana account and instruction data.
4.  **Post-Deserialization Validation (Solana Accounts):** *Immediately* after deserialization, validate the data within a dedicated function (e.g., `validate(&self)`).
    *   Check discriminator field values.
    *   Verify field ranges.
    *   Ensure field relationships are consistent.
    *   Check any other invariants.
5.  **Error Handling (Solana ProgramError):** If validation fails, return a specific `ProgramError`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Type Confusion/Deserialization Errors (Solana-Specific):** (Severity: Critical) - Prevents attackers from misinterpreting data intended for one Solana account type as another. This is specific to how Solana handles account data.
    *   **Data Corruption (Solana Accounts):** (Severity: High) - Ensures Solana account data validity.
    *   **Logic Errors (Solana State):** (Severity: Medium) - Reduces logic errors from invalid Solana account data.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Type Confusion:** Risk reduced from Critical to Low.
    *   **Data Corruption:** Risk reduced from High to Low.
    *   **Logic Errors:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Hypothetical Project)
    *   Partially. `Borsh` schemas are defined, and deserialization is used. Discriminators are used in some cases.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive post-deserialization validation functions (`validate(&self)`) are missing for many account types. Validation is ad-hoc, leading to inconsistencies.
    *   Discriminator fields are not consistently used.
    *   Some older account types use custom serialization instead of `borsh`.
