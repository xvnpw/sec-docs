## Attack Tree Path: [1. [CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Solana Program (Smart Contract) Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/1___critical_node__exploit_solana_program__smart_contract__vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Exploiting vulnerabilities within the Solana programs (smart contracts) that the application interacts with. This is a direct attack on the core logic and data handling on the blockchain.
*   Success can lead to:
    *   Unauthorized manipulation of program state.
    *   Theft of assets managed by the program.
    *   Disruption of program functionality.
    *   Compromise of application logic that relies on the program.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. [CRITICAL NODE] Vulnerability in Custom Solana Program deployed by Application [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/2___critical_node__vulnerability_in_custom_solana_program_deployed_by_application__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Focuses specifically on vulnerabilities in *custom* Solana programs developed and deployed by the application team. These are often less scrutinized than well-established SPL programs.
    *   **Program Logic Errors:**
        *   Exploiting flaws in the program's business logic, such as:
            *   Integer overflows or underflows leading to incorrect calculations (e.g., token amounts).
            *   Logic flaws in state transitions allowing for unintended actions or bypassing intended workflows.
            *   Reentrancy-like issues (though Solana's execution model differs from Ethereum, similar concurrency-related vulnerabilities can exist).
        *   Success can lead to:
            *   Manipulation of program state (e.g., token balances, ownership).
            *   Bypassing intended program restrictions.
            *   Financial loss.
    *   **Access Control Vulnerabilities:**
        *   Exploiting weaknesses in how the program enforces permissions and access control.
        *   Examples include:
            *   Inadequate checks on transaction signers or accounts.
            *   Privilege escalation vulnerabilities allowing unauthorized users to perform administrative actions.
        *   Success can lead to:
            *   Unauthorized actions within the program (e.g., minting tokens, transferring assets).
            *   Data breaches if access controls protect sensitive information.
            *   Compromise of application functionality that relies on access control.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. [CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Solana Client Library (SDK) Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/3___critical_node__exploit_solana_client_library__sdk__vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Targeting vulnerabilities within the Solana Client Libraries (SDKs) used by the application (e.g., `solana-web3.js`, Rust SDK).
    *   **Vulnerability in Transaction Construction/Signing:**
        *   Exploiting flaws in the SDK's functions for creating and signing Solana transactions.
        *   This could allow an attacker to:
            *   Manipulate transaction parameters without detection.
            *   Forge signatures or bypass signature verification.
            *   Inject malicious transactions into the application's workflow.
        *   Success can lead to:
            *   Unauthorized transactions being sent on behalf of the application or users.
            *   Financial loss through unauthorized transfers.
            *   Data manipulation on the blockchain.
    *   **Vulnerability in Data Parsing/Serialization:**
        *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in how the SDK parses and serializes data when interacting with the Solana network.
        *   Examples include:
            *   Buffer overflows when processing blockchain data.
            *   Deserialization flaws allowing for code execution through crafted data.
        *   Success can lead to:
            *   Code execution within the application's client or server.
            *   Denial of service.
            *   Data corruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. [CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Application's Misuse of Solana Features [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/4___critical_node__exploit_application's_misuse_of_solana_features__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Focuses on vulnerabilities arising from *how* the application implements and utilizes Solana features, rather than vulnerabilities in Solana itself.
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Insecure Key Management by Application [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Private Key Exposure:**
            *   The most critical key management vulnerability. If private keys are compromised, the attacker gains full control over the associated Solana accounts.
            *   Common exposure methods:
                *   Storing private keys in insecure locations (e.g., plaintext files, application code, client-side storage).
                *   Leaking keys through application logs or error messages.
                *   Accidental exposure through version control systems.
            *   Success leads to:
                *   Complete control over compromised accounts.
                *   Unauthorized transfer of funds or assets.
                *   Data manipulation associated with the accounts.
                *   Reputational damage and loss of user trust.
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Improper Transaction Handling by Application [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Lack of Input Validation on Transaction Data:**
            *   Failing to properly validate and sanitize data before including it in Solana transactions.
            *   This can allow attackers to inject malicious data that:
                *   Exploits vulnerabilities in Solana programs.
                *   Causes unexpected behavior in the application or on the blockchain.
                *   Manipulates application logic.
        *   **Logic Errors in Application's Transaction Construction:**
            *   Flaws in the application's code that constructs Solana transactions.
            *   Examples include:
                *   Incorrectly calculating transaction parameters.
                *   Missing necessary instructions or accounts in transactions.
                *   Logic errors in conditional transaction building.
            *   Success can lead to:
                *   Transactions failing in unexpected ways.
                *   Transactions having unintended consequences.
                *   Exploitable inconsistencies in application state or blockchain state.
