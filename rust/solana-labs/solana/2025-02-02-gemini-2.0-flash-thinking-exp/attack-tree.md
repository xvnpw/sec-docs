## Attack Tree Path: [1. [CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Solana Program (Smart Contract) Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/1___critical_node__exploit_solana_program__smart_contract__vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities within Solana programs (smart contracts) that the application interacts with. This is a direct attack on the core logic and data handling on the blockchain.
*   **Criticality:** Very High. Successful exploitation can lead to direct manipulation of on-chain assets, data corruption, and complete compromise of the application's blockchain functionality.
*   **Focus Areas for Mitigation:**
    *   Secure Solana program development lifecycle (secure coding, reviews, audits).
    *   Robust input validation and sanitization within programs.
    *   Thorough testing and formal verification of program logic.
    *   Regular security audits by smart contract security experts.
    *   Careful dependency management for SPL programs.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. [CRITICAL NODE] Vulnerability in Custom Solana Program deployed by Application [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/2___critical_node__vulnerability_in_custom_solana_program_deployed_by_application__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Specifically targeting vulnerabilities in custom Solana programs developed and deployed by the application team. This is often a higher risk than exploiting well-known SPL programs as custom programs may be less scrutinized.
*   **Criticality:** Very High.  Directly impacts the application's unique on-chain functionality and data.
*   **Specific High-Risk Sub-Vectors:**
    *   **Program Logic Errors [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting flaws in the program's logic, such as integer overflows/underflows, incorrect state transitions, or reentrancy-like issues (in Solana's context).
        *   **Action:** Crafting transactions that trigger these logic errors to manipulate program state, bypass access controls, or steal assets.
    *   **Access Control Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Bypassing or subverting the program's access control mechanisms. This could involve privilege escalation or unauthorized access to restricted functions.
        *   **Action:** Exploiting weaknesses in permission checks to perform actions that should be restricted to specific users or roles (e.g., minting tokens without authorization, transferring assets from other accounts).

## Attack Tree Path: [3. [CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Solana Client Library (SDK) Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/3___critical_node__exploit_solana_client_library__sdk__vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities within the Solana Client Library (SDK) used by the application (e.g., `solana-web3.js`, Rust SDK). This targets the interface between the application and the Solana network.
*   **Criticality:** High. Can compromise the application's ability to securely interact with the blockchain, leading to data manipulation, unauthorized transactions, or denial of service.
*   **Specific High-Risk Sub-Vectors:**
    *   **Vulnerability in Transaction Construction/Signing [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting flaws in how the SDK constructs or signs transactions. This could allow attackers to inject malicious transactions or manipulate transaction parameters.
        *   **Action:** Crafting malicious inputs or exploiting SDK functions to create and sign transactions that perform unintended actions on the blockchain.
    *   **Vulnerability in Data Parsing/Serialization [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in how the SDK parses or serializes data, such as buffer overflows or deserialization flaws.
        *   **Action:** Sending crafted data to the SDK that triggers parsing/serialization vulnerabilities, potentially leading to code execution or data corruption within the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. [CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Application's Misuse of Solana Features [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/4___critical_node__exploit_application's_misuse_of_solana_features__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities arising from the application's incorrect or insecure usage of Solana features, even if Solana itself is secure. This focuses on application-level integration flaws.
*   **Criticality:** Very High.  Often easier to exploit than core Solana vulnerabilities and can have direct and severe consequences for the application and its users.
*   **Specific High-Risk Sub-Vectors:**
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Insecure Key Management by Application [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:**  Compromising private keys managed by the application due to insecure storage, handling, or generation.
        *   **Specific High-Risk Sub-Vector:**
            *   **Private Key Exposure [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:**  Private keys being exposed through insecure storage (e.g., in code, logs, client-side storage), accidental leaks, or compromised infrastructure.
                *   **Action:** Stealing exposed private keys to gain full control over associated Solana accounts, enabling unauthorized transactions, data manipulation, and asset theft.
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Improper Transaction Handling by Application [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:**  Vulnerabilities related to how the application constructs, validates, and sends transactions to the Solana network.
        *   **Specific High-Risk Sub-Vectors:**
            *   **Lack of Input Validation on Transaction Data [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Insufficient or missing input validation on data included in transactions.
                *   **Action:** Injecting malicious or unexpected data into transaction fields, potentially leading to program logic errors, data corruption, or unintended actions on the blockchain.
            *   **Logic Errors in Application's Transaction Construction [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Flaws in the application's code that constructs transactions, leading to incorrect transaction parameters, unintended actions, or vulnerabilities.
                *   **Action:** Exploiting logic errors in transaction construction to create transactions that bypass intended security measures, manipulate data, or cause financial loss.
