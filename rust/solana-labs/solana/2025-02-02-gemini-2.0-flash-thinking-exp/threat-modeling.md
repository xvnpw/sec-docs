# Threat Model Analysis for solana-labs/solana

## Threat: [Program Logic Errors and Bugs](./threats/program_logic_errors_and_bugs.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the on-chain program's code (smart contract) by sending crafted transactions. This can lead to unauthorized state changes, fund theft, or program denial of service.
*   **Impact:** Loss of program funds, critical application functionality failure, complete compromise of program logic.
*   **Solana Component Affected:** On-Chain Program (Smart Contract), Program Instructions, Accounts.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Mandatory rigorous security audits by expert Solana security professionals.
    *   Extensive testing, including fuzzing and formal verification of critical logic.
    *   Secure coding practices and static analysis during development.
    *   Implement circuit breakers and emergency program halt mechanisms.

## Threat: [Program Upgrade Vulnerabilities](./threats/program_upgrade_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker compromises the program upgrade authority and deploys a malicious program version. This allows for complete control over the application, including fund theft and data manipulation.
*   **Impact:** Total application compromise, catastrophic loss of user funds, irreversible damage to application and user trust.
*   **Solana Component Affected:** On-Chain Program Upgrade Mechanism, Program Upgrade Authority, Accounts.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Extremely secure management of upgrade authority keys (hardware wallets, multi-sig).
    *   Mandatory staged upgrades on test networks before mainnet.
    *   Timelock mechanisms for upgrades to allow user review and response.
    *   Public and auditable upgrade code changes.

## Threat: [Rent Exemption Exploitation (High Impact Scenario)](./threats/rent_exemption_exploitation__high_impact_scenario_.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker creates a massive number of rent-exempt accounts, aiming to bloat the ledger state and degrade Solana network performance, potentially leading to widespread denial of service.
*   **Impact:** Network-wide performance degradation, potential denial of service for applications and users, increased resource consumption for validators.
*   **Solana Component Affected:** Solana Runtime, Account Storage, Rent Mechanism.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (in large-scale exploitation scenarios).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Careful program design to limit unnecessary account creation.
    *   Rate limiting account creation within applications.
    *   Network-level monitoring and potential rate limiting at the validator level (Solana core responsibility).

## Threat: [RPC Endpoint Denial of Service (DoS)](./threats/rpc_endpoint_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker floods public Solana RPC endpoints with requests, overwhelming the service and preventing legitimate application and user access to the Solana network.
*   **Impact:** Application downtime, inability to interact with Solana, degraded user experience, potential financial losses due to service disruption.
*   **Solana Component Affected:** Solana RPC API, RPC Infrastructure.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (for applications critically dependent on RPC availability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Robust RPC infrastructure with rate limiting and request throttling.
    *   DDoS mitigation services in front of RPC endpoints.
    *   Consider private or dedicated RPC nodes for critical applications.

## Threat: [SDK and Library Vulnerabilities (High Impact Scenario)](./threats/sdk_and_library_vulnerabilities__high_impact_scenario_.md)

*   **Description:** Critical vulnerabilities in Solana SDKs or libraries are exploited by attackers. This could lead to client-side or server-side code execution, allowing for application compromise or malicious actions on behalf of users.
*   **Impact:** Application compromise, data breaches, unauthorized actions, potential compromise of user systems interacting with the application.
*   **Solana Component Affected:** Solana SDKs (JavaScript SDK, Rust SDK, etc.), Application Dependencies.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (if critical vulnerabilities are present and exploitable).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly maintain up-to-date SDKs and libraries with latest security patches.
    *   Proactive monitoring of security advisories for Solana SDKs and dependencies.
    *   Regular security scanning of application dependencies and SDKs.
