# BUSINESS POSTURE

The Solana project aims to create a high-performance, permissionless blockchain platform. The primary business goal is to provide a scalable and fast infrastructure for decentralized applications (dApps) and cryptocurrencies, addressing the limitations of existing blockchain platforms in terms of transaction speed and cost. Solana targets developers and users who require high throughput and low latency for blockchain applications, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and other high-transaction volume use cases.

Key business priorities include:
- Achieving high transaction throughput and low latency.
- Maintaining network stability and availability.
- Fostering a vibrant ecosystem of developers and applications.
- Ensuring the security and integrity of the blockchain.
- Promoting decentralization and censorship resistance.

Most important business risks that need to be addressed:
- Network congestion and performance degradation under high load.
- Security vulnerabilities in the Solana protocol or smart contracts leading to financial losses or data breaches.
- Centralization risks in validator operations or governance.
- Regulatory uncertainty and compliance challenges for blockchain platforms.
- Competition from other high-performance blockchain platforms.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Solana uses a Proof of History (PoH) consensus mechanism combined with Proof of Stake (PoS) to secure the blockchain. Described in Solana documentation and whitepaper.
- security control: Rust programming language is used for development, which inherently provides memory safety and reduces certain classes of vulnerabilities. Implemented in the codebase.
- security control: Code is publicly available on GitHub, allowing for community review and scrutiny. Implemented in GitHub repository.
- security control: Solana Foundation and community actively engage in bug bounty programs to incentivize vulnerability disclosure. Described in Solana documentation and community channels.

Accepted risks:
- accepted risk: Novelty of the Proof of History consensus mechanism introduces potential for unforeseen vulnerabilities.
- accepted risk: Reliance on third-party validators for network security introduces trust assumptions.
- accepted risk: Complexity of the Solana protocol increases the attack surface and potential for implementation errors.

Recommended security controls:
- security control: Implement regular, independent security audits of the Solana protocol and core codebase by reputable security firms.
- security control: Establish a formal Security Incident Response Plan (SIRP) to handle security incidents effectively.
- security control: Integrate automated security scanning tools (SAST, DAST, dependency scanning) into the development pipeline.
- security control: Implement rate limiting and DDoS protection mechanisms at the network level.
- security control: Provide secure coding guidelines and training for developers building on Solana.

Security requirements:
- Authentication:
  - Requirement: Nodes participating in the network (validators, RPC nodes) must be authenticated to prevent unauthorized access and participation.
  - Requirement: Users interacting with the blockchain (e.g., sending transactions) must be authenticated through cryptographic key pairs.
- Authorization:
  - Requirement: Transaction authorization must be enforced through digital signatures, ensuring that only authorized users can perform actions on the blockchain.
  - Requirement: Access control mechanisms should be in place to restrict access to sensitive data and functionalities within the Solana network and related infrastructure.
- Input validation:
  - Requirement: All inputs to the Solana protocol, including transactions and network messages, must be rigorously validated to prevent injection attacks and other input-related vulnerabilities.
  - Requirement: Smart contracts deployed on Solana must implement robust input validation to protect against vulnerabilities.
- Cryptography:
  - Requirement: Strong cryptographic algorithms and secure key management practices must be used for all cryptographic operations, including consensus, transaction signing, and data encryption where applicable.
  - Requirement: Cryptographic libraries should be regularly updated and vetted for known vulnerabilities.

```

Build Process Description:

The Solana project likely utilizes a modern CI/CD pipeline for building and publishing software artifacts. The build process can be described as follows:

1. Developer commits code changes to the GitHub repository.
2. GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines are triggered automatically upon code commits or pull requests.
3. The build process is initiated, which involves:
    - Compiling Rust code using Cargo build system.
    - Running unit and integration tests.
4. Security checks are performed as part of the build pipeline:
    - Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools are used to scan the codebase for potential vulnerabilities.
    - Linters are used to enforce code quality and style guidelines, reducing potential for errors.
    - Dependency scanning tools are used to identify vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
5. If all checks pass, container images (e.g., Docker images for Validator and RPC nodes) are built.
6. Built container images and other artifacts are pushed to an artifact registry (e.g., a container registry like Docker Hub or a cloud provider's registry).

Build Process Security Controls:

- security control: Automated CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions) ensures consistent and repeatable builds.
- security control: Source code version control (Git/GitHub) provides traceability and integrity of code changes.
- security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) integrated into the build pipeline to identify code vulnerabilities early.
- security control: Dependency scanning to detect and manage vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
- security control: Code linters to enforce code quality and reduce potential errors.
- security control: Container image scanning to identify vulnerabilities in base images and dependencies within containers.
- security control: Secure artifact registry with access control to protect build artifacts.
- security control: Code signing and artifact signing to ensure integrity and authenticity of build artifacts.

Data sensitivity levels:
- Private keys: Critical
- Transaction data: Confidential
