## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Browser Vulnerabilities (XSS to access storage) -> Directly Modify Client-Side Storage](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_browser_vulnerabilities__xss_to_access_storage__-_directly_modify_client-side_storage.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If Relay or related libraries store data in browser storage (like LocalStorage), attackers with XSS vulnerabilities can directly manipulate this data.
    *   **High-Risk Path Justification:** This path has a "Medium" likelihood (depends on application's XSS defenses) and leads to "High" impact (data theft, session hijacking). XSS is a common vulnerability, making this a significant risk.

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft Malicious GraphQL Queries (Client-Side) -> Inject Fragments or Variables to Expose Sensitive Data](./attack_tree_paths/craft_malicious_graphql_queries__client-side__-_inject_fragments_or_variables_to_expose_sensitive_da_873f8a41.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** By crafting queries with specific fragments or variables, attackers might be able to access data they are not authorized to see, especially if server-side authorization is not robust.
    *   **High-Risk Path Justification:** This path has a "Medium" likelihood (if server-side auth is weak) and leads to "High" impact (data breach). It's a direct way to access unauthorized data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Tamper with Network Requests/Responses -> Use Man-in-the-Middle Attacks](./attack_tree_paths/tamper_with_network_requestsresponses_-_use_man-in-the-middle_attacks.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers can intercept network traffic and modify Relay's GraphQL requests or responses.
    *   **High-Risk Path Justification:** This path has a "Medium" likelihood (on insecure networks) and leads to "High" impact (data breach, manipulation). While requiring a MITM position, the potential impact is severe.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Server-Side Relay Implementations -> Bypass Server-Side Validation Based on Relay Data](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_server-side_relay_implementations_-_bypass_server-side_validation_based_on_relay_da_acd6d6de.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If the server relies solely on Relay data for validation without proper sanitization or authorization checks, attackers can manipulate this data.
    *   **High-Risk Path Justification:** This path has a "Medium" likelihood (common vulnerability) and leads to "High" impact (unauthorized access, data manipulation). Weak server-side validation is a frequent issue.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weak Authorization Checks on Subscriptions -> Subscribe to Unauthorized Data Streams](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weak_authorization_checks_on_subscriptions_-_subscribe_to_unauthorized_data_streams.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If the server doesn't properly authorize subscription requests, attackers might be able to subscribe to data they shouldn't have access to.
    *   **High-Risk Path Justification:** This path has a "Medium" likelihood and leads to "High" impact (data breach). If subscription authorization is flawed, it's relatively easy to exploit.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Sensitive Information Through Debugging Endpoints -> Leak Internal Data Structures or Application State](./attack_tree_paths/access_sensitive_information_through_debugging_endpoints_-_leak_internal_data_structures_or_applicat_1bf8e700.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If Relay's developer tools or debugging endpoints are accidentally exposed in a production environment, attackers might be able to access sensitive information about the application's state, data structures, or internal workings.
    *   **High-Risk Path Justification:** Although "Low" likelihood (should not be in production), the impact is "High," making it a critical risk if developer tools are accidentally exposed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Relay Application](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_relay_application.md)

This is the overarching goal of the attacker.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Client-Side Relay Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_client-side_relay_vulnerabilities.md)

This represents a category of attacks targeting the client-side implementation of Relay.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Relay's Query Handling](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_relay's_query_handling.md)

This involves targeting the mechanisms Relay uses to fetch data via GraphQL queries.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Server-Side Relay Interactions](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_server-side_relay_interactions.md)

This category encompasses attacks targeting the communication and data exchange between the Relay client and the GraphQL server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Relay Payloads](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_relay_payloads.md)

This refers to intercepting and modifying the data transmitted between the client and server in Relay's specific format.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Server-Side Relay Implementations](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_server-side_relay_implementations.md)

This highlights vulnerabilities arising from improper or insecure handling of Relay data on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Relay's Subscription Mechanism](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_relay's_subscription_mechanism.md)

This targets the real-time data update functionality provided by Relay subscriptions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Relay Developer Tooling/Debugging Features (if exposed in production)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_relay_developer_toolingdebugging_features__if_exposed_in_production_.md)

This focuses on the risks associated with leaving debugging functionalities active in a live environment.
