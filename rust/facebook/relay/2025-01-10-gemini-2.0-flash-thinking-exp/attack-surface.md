## Attack Surface: [Client-Controlled Query Variables (GraphQL Injection)](./attack_surfaces/client-controlled_query_variables__graphql_injection_.md)

**Attack Surface: Client-Controlled Query Variables (GraphQL Injection)**

*   **Description:** User-supplied input is directly used to construct GraphQL query variables without proper sanitization or validation. This can allow attackers to manipulate the query to access unauthorized data or perform unintended actions.
*   **How Relay Contributes:** Relay relies heavily on variables to make queries dynamic. If these variables are directly derived from user input without server-side validation, it creates an injection point directly facilitated by Relay's data fetching mechanisms.
*   **Example:** A search feature uses a user-provided string directly as a value in a GraphQL query variable to filter results. An attacker could inject malicious GraphQL syntax into the search string to bypass intended filtering or access other data through Relay's query execution.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to data, potential for data manipulation depending on the server-side resolvers accessed via the manipulated Relay query.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement robust server-side validation of all query variables:** Sanitize and validate all user-provided input before using it in GraphQL resolvers that are targeted by Relay queries.
    *   **Utilize parameterized queries/prepared statements on the GraphQL server:** This helps prevent injection by treating user input as data, not executable code, when processing queries initiated by Relay.
    *   **Avoid directly embedding user input into query strings on the client-side:** Rely on Relay's variable mechanism and enforce strict server-side validation for these variables.

## Attack Surface: [Complex Query Depth and Server Resource Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/complex_query_depth_and_server_resource_exhaustion.md)

**Attack Surface: Complex Query Depth and Server Resource Exhaustion**

*   **Description:** Attackers craft deeply nested or computationally expensive GraphQL queries that can overwhelm the server's resources, leading to denial of service.
*   **How Relay Contributes:** Relay's ability to fetch nested data based on fragments and connections can make it easier for attackers to construct complex queries that exploit server-side resource limitations when processing Relay's data fetching requests.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a query through a Relay application with multiple nested connections (e.g., users -> posts -> comments -> likes -> users who liked the comment, repeated multiple times), causing the server to perform numerous database joins and consume significant resources due to Relay's efficient but potentially exploitable data fetching.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, server downtime, performance degradation for legitimate users interacting with the Relay application.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement query complexity analysis and limits on the GraphQL server:** Reject queries initiated by Relay that exceed a predefined complexity threshold.
    *   **Set limits on query depth and breadth:** Restrict the level of nesting and the number of items fetched in connections requested by Relay.
    *   **Implement pagination for connections:** Encourage developers using Relay to implement pagination to avoid fetching large lists of data at once.
    *   **Monitor server resource usage:** Detect and respond to unusual query patterns originating from Relay clients.

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side Cache Poisoning](./attack_surfaces/client-side_cache_poisoning.md)

**Attack Surface: Client-Side Cache Poisoning**

*   **Description:** A malicious actor manipulates the data returned by the GraphQL server, causing Relay's client-side cache to store incorrect or malicious data. Subsequent requests made by the Relay application might serve this poisoned data.
*   **How Relay Contributes:** Relay's client-side caching mechanism directly relies on the integrity of the data received from the server. If the server is compromised or vulnerable, Relay will cache and potentially serve this malicious data to the user interface.
*   **Example:** An attacker compromises the GraphQL server and modifies the response for a specific user's profile. Relay caches this modified (potentially malicious) data. When other users view that profile through the Relay application, they might see the altered information served from the cache.
*   **Impact:** Displaying incorrect information, application malfunction within the Relay application, potential for further client-side attacks if the poisoned data is used in client-side logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement strong server-side data integrity checks:** Ensure the GraphQL server only returns valid and expected data to be consumed by Relay.
    *   **Secure the GraphQL server infrastructure:** Protect the server from unauthorized access and modifications that could lead to Relay caching malicious data.
    *   **Employ proper cache invalidation strategies:** Ensure that cached data used by Relay is refreshed when necessary to prevent serving stale or incorrect information.

## Attack Surface: [Supply Chain Vulnerabilities in Relay Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/supply_chain_vulnerabilities_in_relay_dependencies.md)

**Attack Surface: Supply Chain Vulnerabilities in Relay Dependencies**

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities exist in the dependencies used by the Relay library itself. If these dependencies are compromised, it could introduce security flaws into the application using Relay.
*   **How Relay Contributes:** As a client-side library, Relay relies on various JavaScript packages. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies are directly incorporated into applications that include the Relay library.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability is discovered in a core JavaScript library used by Relay for data manipulation. Attackers could potentially exploit this vulnerability in applications using the affected version of Relay, even if the application's own code is secure.
*   **Impact:** Wide range of potential impacts depending on the nature of the vulnerability in the dependency, including code execution within the Relay application's context, data breaches if Relay's data handling is compromised, and denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regularly update Relay and its dependencies:** Keep the Relay library and its dependencies up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Use dependency scanning tools:** Employ tools to identify known vulnerabilities in project dependencies, including those of Relay.
    *   **Monitor security advisories for Relay and its dependencies:** Stay informed about reported security issues and apply necessary updates promptly.
    *   **Consider using a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM):** Maintain a list of all components in your application, including Relay and its dependencies, to better track and manage potential vulnerabilities.
