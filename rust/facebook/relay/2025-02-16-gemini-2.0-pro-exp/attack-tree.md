## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: 2. Exploit Relay Server-Side Integration](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_2__exploit_relay_server-side_integration.md)

**Description:** This represents the entire category of attacks targeting the server-side components of the Relay application, including the GraphQL server and its integration with the backend database. Server-side vulnerabilities are generally more critical due to direct access to sensitive data and resources.
    *   **Why Critical:** Server-side compromise often grants broader access and control compared to client-side exploits.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node & High-Risk Path: 2.2 GraphQL Schema Design Flaws](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_&_high-risk_path_2_2_graphql_schema_design_flaws.md)

**Description:** This encompasses vulnerabilities arising from the design of the GraphQL schema itself, which defines the API's attack surface.
    *   **Why Critical:** The schema's design fundamentally dictates what data and operations are exposed, making flaws here highly impactful.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node & High-Risk Path: 2.2.1 Missing or Inadequate Authorization](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_&_high-risk_path_2_2_1_missing_or_inadequate_authorization.md)

**Description:** This is the most critical vulnerability. It means that the GraphQL schema lacks proper authorization checks, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive data or operations. This could be due to missing `auth` directives, improperly configured resolvers, or a complete lack of an authorization layer.
    *   **Attack Vector Details:**
        *   An attacker sends GraphQL queries or mutations to the server.
        *   The server processes the request without verifying if the user has the necessary permissions.
        *   The server returns sensitive data or performs unauthorized actions.
    *   **Why Critical & High-Risk:** This is a fundamental security flaw that can completely bypass other security measures. It's relatively easy to exploit and has a high impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node & High-Risk Path: 2.1.1 Leaking Sensitive Data via GraphQL Fields](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_&_high-risk_path_2_1_1_leaking_sensitive_data_via_graphql_fields.md)

**Description:** This vulnerability occurs when the GraphQL schema exposes sensitive fields without proper protection, even if Relay's client-side data masking is in place.  The attacker bypasses the client and directly queries the GraphQL API.
    *   **Attack Vector Details:**
        *   An attacker examines the GraphQL schema (often through introspection).
        *   The attacker identifies sensitive fields that are not adequately protected by authorization checks.
        *   The attacker crafts a GraphQL query directly targeting those sensitive fields.
        *   The server returns the sensitive data.
    *   **Why Critical & High-Risk:** This bypasses client-side security and directly exposes sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node & High-Risk Path: 1.2.1 Crafted Queries to Bypass Intended Fetch Restrictions](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_&_high-risk_path_1_2_1_crafted_queries_to_bypass_intended_fetch_restrictions.md)

**Description:** This involves an attacker crafting malicious GraphQL queries that circumvent the intended data fetching restrictions imposed by Relay (e.g., pagination limits, connection filters, or custom logic).
    *   **Attack Vector Details:**
        *   An attacker analyzes the application's client-side code and network traffic to understand how Relay fetches data.
        *   The attacker identifies potential weaknesses in the query construction or validation.
        *   The attacker crafts a GraphQL query that manipulates variables, fragment spreads, or directives to access data outside the intended scope.
        *   The server, if not properly validating the query, processes the request and returns unauthorized data.
    *   **Why Critical & High-Risk:** This allows direct data exfiltration by bypassing intended access controls.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: 1.3.1 Crafted Mutations](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_3_1_crafted_mutations.md)

**Description:** Similar to crafted queries, this involves an attacker crafting malicious GraphQL mutations to perform unauthorized actions or manipulate data in unexpected ways.
    *   **Attack Vector Details:**
        *   An attacker analyzes the application's client-side code and network traffic to understand how Relay handles mutations.
        *   The attacker identifies potential weaknesses in the mutation input validation or server-side logic.
        *   The attacker crafts a GraphQL mutation that manipulates input parameters to perform unauthorized actions (e.g., deleting data, modifying user roles, creating fraudulent transactions).
        *   The server, if not properly validating the mutation, executes the request and modifies the application state in an unauthorized way.
    *   **Why High-Risk:** This allows direct manipulation of application state, potentially leading to data corruption, denial of service, or other severe consequences.
