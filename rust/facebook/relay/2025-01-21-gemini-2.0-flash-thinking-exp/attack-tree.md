# Attack Tree Analysis for facebook/relay

Objective: Attacker's Goal: To compromise the application by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the Relay framework (focusing on high-risk scenarios).

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Relay-Fetched Data](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_cross-site_scripting__xss__via_relay-fetched_data.md)

* Attack Vector: An attacker injects malicious scripts into data that is subsequently fetched by Relay and rendered on the client-side without proper sanitization.
* Critical Nodes Involved:
    * Exploit Client-Side Rendering Logic: The vulnerability lies in how the application handles data during rendering.
    * Inject Malicious Code via Server-Side Data: The point where malicious content enters the data flow.
    * Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Relay-Fetched Data: The successful execution of the injected script in the user's browser.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Leverage Dynamic Query Building with Insufficient Sanitization](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_leverage_dynamic_query_building_with_insufficient_sanitization.md)

* Attack Vector: Developers dynamically construct GraphQL queries on the client-side (or potentially server-side Relay implementations) using unsanitized input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious GraphQL code.
* Critical Nodes Involved:
    * Exploit GraphQL Injection via Relay: The overarching category of exploiting GraphQL injection through Relay.
    * Leverage Dynamic Query Building with Insufficient Sanitization: The specific insecure practice that enables the injection.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 3: Trigger Resource Exhaustion on Server](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3_trigger_resource_exhaustion_on_server.md)

* Attack Vector: An attacker crafts complex or deeply nested GraphQL queries that are sent via Relay, overwhelming the server's resources and leading to a denial of service.
* Critical Nodes Involved:
    * Exploit Relay's Interaction with GraphQL Server: The context of exploiting the communication between Relay and the server.
    * Trigger Resource Exhaustion on Server: The successful execution of the DoS attack.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 4: Bypass Authorization Checks via Relay](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_4_bypass_authorization_checks_via_relay.md)

* Attack Vector: An attacker crafts GraphQL queries that bypass authorization checks implemented in the application, gaining access to data they are not authorized to view.
* Critical Nodes Involved:
    * Exploit Relay's Interaction with GraphQL Server: The context of manipulating the Relay-server communication.
    * Bypass Authorization Checks via Relay: The act of circumventing access controls.
    * Craft Queries to Access Unauthorized Data: The specific action of creating malicious queries.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 5: Insecure Query Construction](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_5_insecure_query_construction.md)

* Attack Vector: Developers write code that dynamically builds GraphQL queries without proper sanitization, leading to GraphQL injection vulnerabilities.
* Critical Nodes Involved:
    * Exploit Developer Misuse of Relay: The root cause being incorrect usage of the framework.
    * Insecure Query Construction: The general category of writing insecure queries.
    * Dynamically Build Queries without Proper Sanitization: The specific coding practice that introduces the vulnerability.
