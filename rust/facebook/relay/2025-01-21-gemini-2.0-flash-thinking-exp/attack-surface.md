# Attack Surface Analysis for facebook/relay

## Attack Surface: [Complex Query Attacks (GraphQL Denial of Service)](./attack_surfaces/complex_query_attacks__graphql_denial_of_service_.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious actors craft excessively complex or deeply nested GraphQL queries that consume significant server resources (CPU, memory, database connections), leading to performance degradation or complete service disruption.
    *   **How Relay Contributes:** Relay's declarative data fetching using fragments can make it easier for attackers to understand the data model and relationships, potentially simplifying the process of crafting complex queries that exploit these relationships. The framework encourages fetching related data, which, if not handled with proper server-side safeguards, can be abused.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a query that recursively requests nested connections (e.g., `users { friends { friends { friends ... } } }`) without limits, causing the server to attempt to retrieve and process an enormous amount of data.
    *   **Impact:** Server overload, application slowdown, service unavailability, increased infrastructure costs.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement query complexity analysis and cost limiting on the GraphQL server.
        *   Set maximum query depth and breadth limits.
        *   Implement request timeouts.
        *   Use pagination for connections and lists.
        *   Monitor server resource usage and identify suspicious query patterns.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Client-Side Fragments](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_client-side_fragments.md)

*   **Description:** Relay fragments define the data requirements for components. If sensitive data is included in fragments used in publicly accessible parts of the application, it could be inadvertently exposed in the client-side code or network requests.
    *   **How Relay Contributes:** Relay's fragment colocation encourages defining data needs directly within components. If developers are not careful, they might include sensitive information in fragments that are then fetched and present in the client-side application state, even if not directly displayed.
    *   **Example:** A fragment used in a public profile component inadvertently fetches a user's private email address, which is then present in the client-side Relay Store even if the UI doesn't explicitly render it.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive user data, potential violation of privacy regulations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully review fragments to ensure they only request necessary data for the specific component.
        *   Avoid including sensitive information in fragments used in publicly accessible areas.
        *   Utilize server-side access controls to ensure only authorized data is returned.
        *   Consider using different fragments for different access levels or contexts.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Relay Directives or Extensions](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_relay_directives_or_extensions.md)

*   **Description:** If the application uses custom GraphQL directives or extensions alongside Relay, vulnerabilities in these custom components can introduce security risks.
    *   **How Relay Contributes:** Relay interacts with the GraphQL server, including any custom directives or extensions. If these custom components have security flaws, they can be exploited through Relay's normal data fetching mechanisms.
    *   **Example:** A custom directive designed for authorization has a flaw that allows bypassing access controls, enabling unauthorized data access through Relay queries that utilize this directive.
    *   **Impact:** Bypassing security controls, unauthorized data access, potential for arbitrary code execution if the directive interacts with server-side logic insecurely.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and test custom directives and extensions for security vulnerabilities.
        *   Follow secure coding practices when developing custom GraphQL logic.
        *   Implement proper input validation and sanitization within custom directives.
        *   Keep custom directive implementations up to date with security patches.
