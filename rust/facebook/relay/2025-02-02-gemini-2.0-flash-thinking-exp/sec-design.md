# BUSINESS POSTURE

The primary business priority that Relay addresses is to streamline and enhance the development of data-driven React applications. By providing a structured and efficient way to fetch and manage data from GraphQL APIs, Relay aims to increase developer productivity, improve application performance, and create a more maintainable codebase.

The key business goals are:

- Accelerate development cycles for React applications that consume GraphQL APIs.
- Improve the runtime performance of data fetching in React applications.
- Enhance the maintainability and scalability of React applications by providing a predictable data management layer.
- Enable developers to focus on application logic rather than data fetching complexities.

The most important business risks that need to be addressed are:

- Security vulnerabilities in the Relay framework itself could compromise applications built with it, leading to data breaches or service disruptions.
- Inefficient or insecure data fetching practices, even when using Relay, can lead to performance bottlenecks or exposure of sensitive data.
- Lack of proper security controls in applications built with Relay could result in unauthorized access to data or functionality.
- Supply chain risks associated with Relay's dependencies could introduce vulnerabilities into applications.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:

- security control: Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) practices are assumed to be followed by the Relay development team at Facebook, including code reviews, testing, and vulnerability management. (Location: Facebook's internal development processes).
- security control: Dependency management using standard JavaScript package managers (npm/yarn) which allows for vulnerability scanning of dependencies. (Location: package.json, yarn.lock/package-lock.json).
- security control: Publicly available GitHub repository allows for community security reviews and contributions. (Location: GitHub repository).
- security control: Reliance on HTTPS for communication between the browser and the GraphQL server in typical web application deployments. (Location: Standard web security practice).

Accepted risks:

- accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in Relay framework code that might be discovered after release. Mitigation: Active community and Facebook security team monitoring, regular updates.
- accepted risk: Security vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies used by Relay. Mitigation: Regular dependency updates and vulnerability scanning.
- accepted risk: Misuse of Relay by developers leading to insecure data handling in applications. Mitigation: Documentation, best practices guidelines, and developer training.

Recommended security controls:

- security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline for Relay framework development.
- security control: Integrate Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools into the CI/CD pipeline to continuously monitor and manage dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
- security control: Publish security advisories and vulnerability disclosure policy for Relay to encourage responsible reporting and timely patching of security issues.
- security control: Provide security focused documentation and best practices for developers using Relay to build secure applications, including guidance on authentication, authorization, and input validation in GraphQL context.

Security requirements:

- Authentication:
    - Requirement: Relay itself does not handle authentication, but applications built with Relay must integrate with authentication mechanisms to secure access to the GraphQL API.
    - Requirement: Relay should be agnostic to the authentication method used by the application and GraphQL API (e.g., OAuth 2.0, JWT, API keys).
    - Requirement: Securely transmit authentication tokens or credentials when communicating with the GraphQL server, using HTTPS.

- Authorization:
    - Requirement: Relay should facilitate the implementation of authorization logic within applications to control access to data fetched from the GraphQL API.
    - Requirement: Applications should enforce authorization checks based on user roles or permissions before displaying or processing data fetched by Relay.
    - Requirement: Relay should not bypass or weaken authorization mechanisms implemented in the GraphQL API.

- Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Relay applications must validate user inputs before including them in GraphQL queries to prevent injection attacks (e.g., GraphQL injection).
    - Requirement: Relay should provide mechanisms or guidance for developers to sanitize or escape user inputs when constructing GraphQL queries.
    - Requirement: GraphQL server should also perform input validation to protect against malicious queries.

- Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Relay should support and encourage the use of HTTPS for all communication with the GraphQL server to protect data in transit.
    - Requirement: Relay itself might not directly handle encryption of data at rest, but applications using Relay should consider encrypting sensitive data if it is stored client-side (e.g., in local storage or cookies).
    - Requirement: If Relay or its dependencies handle any sensitive data internally (e.g., API keys during development), it should be stored securely and encrypted at rest.

2. Code commit triggers the CI/CD system (e.g., GitHub Actions).
3. CI/CD system initiates the build pipeline.
4. Build & Test step:
    - Fetches code from the repository.
    - Installs dependencies (npm/yarn install).
    - Compiles code (Relay Compiler, Babel, Webpack).
    - Runs unit and integration tests.
5. SAST Scanner step:
    - Performs Static Application Security Testing to identify potential vulnerabilities in the codebase.
6. SCA Scanner step:
    - Performs Software Composition Analysis to identify vulnerabilities in dependencies.
7. Publish Artifacts step:
    - If build, tests, and security scans are successful, build artifacts (npm packages, static assets) are published to the Artifact Repository (e.g., npm registry, CDN).

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process: Development and deployment of data-driven React applications that rely on efficient and secure data fetching from GraphQL APIs. Disruption or compromise of this process would impact the ability to deliver and maintain applications, potentially leading to business losses and reputational damage.

Data being protected:

- GraphQL Schema: Defines the structure and capabilities of the GraphQL API. Exposure or manipulation could lead to unauthorized data access or API misuse. Sensitivity: Medium to High (depending on the data exposed).
- GraphQL Queries and Fragments: Define data requirements within React applications. While not data itself, vulnerabilities in query handling could lead to data breaches. Sensitivity: Medium.
- Application Code (React, Relay): Contains business logic and data handling code. Compromise could lead to application vulnerabilities and data breaches. Sensitivity: High.
- User Data fetched via GraphQL: The actual data fetched from the GraphQL API. Sensitivity varies greatly depending on the application and the type of data (can range from low to highly sensitive PII, financial data, etc.). Sensitivity: Low to High (context-dependent).
- Build Artifacts (npm packages, static assets): If compromised, could lead to supply chain attacks and distribution of malicious code. Sensitivity: Medium.

Data Sensitivity: The sensitivity of data handled by Relay applications is highly context-dependent and depends on the specific application built using Relay and the GraphQL API it interacts with. It can range from publicly available data to highly sensitive personal or financial information. The security measures should be tailored to the sensitivity of the data being processed by each specific application.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

- What specific security features are built into the Relay framework itself, beyond standard JavaScript security practices? (e.g., built-in input sanitization, protection against GraphQL injection).
- Are there any official security guidelines or best practices provided by the Relay team for developers building applications with Relay?
- What is the vulnerability disclosure policy for Relay, and how are security updates communicated to the community?
- Are there any specific security considerations for using Relay with different types of GraphQL servers or authentication mechanisms?

Assumptions:

- BUSINESS POSTURE: It is assumed that organizations using Relay prioritize rapid development and efficient data fetching for React applications. Security is a significant concern but needs to be balanced with development speed and agility.
- SECURITY POSTURE: It is assumed that standard web application security practices are applicable to applications built with Relay. The security of the GraphQL API and backend data sources is considered to be managed separately, but Relay applications must interact with them securely.
- DESIGN: It is assumed that Relay is primarily used in browser-based web applications. The deployment architecture described is a common pattern for such applications. The build process utilizes standard JavaScript tooling and CI/CD practices.
