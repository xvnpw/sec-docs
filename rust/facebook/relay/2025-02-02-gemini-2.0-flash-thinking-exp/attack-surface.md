# Attack Surface Analysis for facebook/relay

## Attack Surface: [GraphQL Injection](./attack_surfaces/graphql_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in GraphQL query construction to inject malicious GraphQL syntax or logic, leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or denial of service.
*   **How Relay Contributes to Attack Surface:** Relay's fragment composition and automatic query generation can make it more complex to trace the origin and composition of GraphQL queries. This complexity can obscure injection points and make thorough server-side input validation even more critical. Relay applications, by their nature, heavily rely on GraphQL, making them a primary target for GraphQL injection attacks.
*   **Example:** An attacker injects malicious GraphQL code into a variable used in a Relay-generated query. This injected code bypasses server-side authorization checks and retrieves sensitive user data that should not be accessible to the attacker.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, unauthorized access to sensitive information, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Robust Server-Side Input Validation:** Implement comprehensive input validation and sanitization on the GraphQL server for all query variables and input fields. Treat all client-provided data as untrusted.
    *   **Parameterized GraphQL Queries:** Utilize GraphQL server features or libraries that support parameterized queries to separate code from data, effectively preventing injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **GraphQL Security Libraries:** Employ GraphQL security libraries and tools that offer built-in protection against injection attacks and enforce secure coding practices.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct frequent security audits and penetration testing specifically targeting GraphQL endpoints and query handling logic in Relay applications.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Complex GraphQL Queries (Relay Context)](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_complex_graphql_queries__relay_context_.md)

*   **Description:** Crafting excessively complex or deeply nested GraphQL queries to consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory, database connections), leading to service disruption.
*   **How Relay Contributes to Attack Surface:** Relay applications, driven by component-based data fetching and fragment composition, can inadvertently generate or allow users to trigger complex GraphQL queries. The framework's focus on data fetching efficiency might sometimes overshadow considerations for query complexity limits from a security perspective.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a GraphQL query with deeply nested relationships and numerous filters, exploiting the data fetching patterns of a Relay application. This query overwhelms the GraphQL server, causing it to become unresponsive and denying service to legitimate users.
*   **Impact:** Service disruption, application downtime, resource exhaustion, financial loss due to unavailability.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **GraphQL Query Complexity Analysis and Limiting:** Implement server-side mechanisms to analyze and limit the complexity, depth, and cost of GraphQL queries. Reject queries that exceed predefined thresholds.
    *   **Query Cost Calculation:** Implement a query cost calculation mechanism that assigns costs to different GraphQL operations (fields, connections, etc.) and limits the total cost of a query.
    *   **Rate Limiting on GraphQL Endpoint:** Implement rate limiting on the GraphQL endpoint to restrict the number of requests from a single IP address or user within a given timeframe, mitigating brute-force DoS attempts.
    *   **Resource Monitoring and Alerting:** Continuously monitor server resource usage (CPU, memory, database connections) and set up alerts to detect and respond to potential DoS attacks in real-time.

## Attack Surface: [Fragment Colocation and Over-fetching Leading to Data Exposure (Relay Context)](./attack_surfaces/fragment_colocation_and_over-fetching_leading_to_data_exposure__relay_context_.md)

*   **Description:** Poorly managed or overly broad GraphQL fragments, encouraged by Relay's colocation principle, can lead to unintended data exposure by fetching more data than necessary for a component, potentially including sensitive information.
*   **How Relay Contributes to Attack Surface:** Relay's emphasis on fragment colocation, while beneficial for code organization and data fetching efficiency, can inadvertently encourage developers to create fragments that fetch more data than strictly required by a specific component. This can lead to over-fetching and exposing sensitive data on the client-side, even if the component doesn't directly utilize all of it.
*   **Example:** A GraphQL fragment designed for an administrative component, which fetches sensitive user details (e.g., social security numbers, financial information), is accidentally reused or included in a fragment composition for a user-facing component. This results in regular users receiving sensitive admin-level data in the GraphQL response, even if the UI component is not intended to display it directly. This exposed data could be accessed through browser developer tools or client-side code inspection.
*   **Impact:** Unintended data exposure, potential information disclosure of sensitive data, increased attack surface as exposed data can be targeted for further exploitation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Fragment Scoping and Minimization:** Carefully scope GraphQL fragments to fetch only the absolutely necessary data for each component. Avoid creating overly broad or generic fragments that fetch more data than required.
    *   **Regular Fragment Review and Auditing:** Implement a process for regularly reviewing and auditing GraphQL fragments to identify and refactor any fragments that are overly broad or expose unnecessary data.
    *   **GraphQL Schema Design with Least Privilege:** Design the GraphQL schema with the principle of least privilege in mind. Implement field-level authorization and access control to ensure users can only access data they are explicitly authorized to view, regardless of the client-side query.
    *   **Server-Side Data Filtering and Projection:** Implement server-side data filtering and projection to ensure that only authorized and necessary data is returned in GraphQL responses, even if the client-side query requests more. This acts as a defense-in-depth measure against over-fetching vulnerabilities.
