# Threat Model Analysis for mimblewimble/grin

## Threat: [Grin Node Denial of Service (DoS)](./threats/grin_node_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker floods a Grin node (running `grin-server` or `grin-wallet` in node mode) with a high volume of invalid or resource-intensive requests or network traffic. This overwhelms the node's processing capabilities, memory, and bandwidth, causing it to become unresponsive and unable to participate in the Grin network or process legitimate transactions. This attack targets the Grin node software itself.
*   **Impact:** Application downtime if relying on the targeted node, disruption of Grin network participation for the node, inability to send or receive Grin transactions through the affected node, potential cascading effects on the Grin network if many nodes are targeted.
*   **Grin Component Affected:** `grin-server` and `grin-wallet` (node functionality), Grin Network Protocol (peer-to-peer communication, transaction propagation).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **For Grin Node Operators:** Implement robust firewall configurations to filter malicious network traffic. Configure rate limiting and request throttling within `grin-server` or at the network level. Monitor node resource usage and network traffic for anomalies. Deploy intrusion detection and prevention systems. Ensure the Grin node software is regularly updated to the latest version with security patches. Consider using load balancing and distributed node infrastructure for redundancy.
    *   **For Application Developers:** Design applications to be resilient to node outages. Implement failover mechanisms to connect to alternative Grin nodes if the primary node becomes unavailable. Avoid relying on a single, publicly exposed Grin node.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack on Slatepack Exchange](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_slatepack_exchange.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts the communication channel used for exchanging slatepacks during the interactive Grin transaction building process, a core feature of the Mimblewimble protocol implemented in `grin-wallet`. If the communication channel is not secured using encryption and authentication, the attacker can eavesdrop on the slatepack data and potentially modify it in transit. By replacing the receiver's slatepack with a manipulated version (e.g., containing the attacker's output key), the attacker can redirect funds intended for the legitimate recipient to an address they control. This attack exploits the interactive and potentially insecure nature of the slatepack exchange process defined by Grin.
*   **Impact:** Theft of funds intended for the legitimate recipient, transaction manipulation leading to financial loss for the sender, compromise of transaction integrity and confidentiality within the Grin interactive transaction process.
*   **Grin Component Affected:** Mimblewimble Protocol (interactive transaction building, slatepack format), `grin-wallet` (slatepack generation, parsing, and exchange logic), Grin Transaction Building Process.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **For Application Developers & Users:** **Crucially, always use secure communication channels (HTTPS, TLS, secure messaging applications with end-to-end encryption) for exchanging slatepacks.**  Verify the security of the communication channel before initiating slatepack exchange. If possible, use out-of-band verification methods to confirm the recipient's slatepack details. Educate users about the critical importance of secure slatepack exchange and the risks of using unencrypted channels. Consider implementing application-level encryption for slatepack data before transmission, even if the underlying transport is not fully trusted.
    *   **For Grin Protocol/Wallet Development:** Explore potential enhancements to the slatepack exchange process to incorporate built-in security features like authenticated encryption or standardized secure communication protocols. Provide clear guidance and warnings to users about the security risks of insecure slatepack exchange within the official Grin documentation and wallet tools.
