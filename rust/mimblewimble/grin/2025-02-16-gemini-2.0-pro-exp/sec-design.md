# Grin Project Design Document

## BUSINESS POSTURE

Grin is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency project implementing the Mimblewimble protocol. Its primary goals are to provide a scalable, fungible, and confidential cryptocurrency. The project prioritizes privacy and aims to be a lightweight and minimalist blockchain.

Business Priorities:

*   Provide a high degree of privacy for users and their transactions.
*   Maintain a scalable and efficient blockchain.
*   Foster a decentralized and community-driven development process.
*   Resist censorship and maintain network resilience.
*   Offer a fungible cryptocurrency where all coins are equal.

Business Risks:

*   Regulatory scrutiny and potential legal challenges due to the high level of privacy.
*   Adoption challenges due to the complexity of the underlying technology and competition from other privacy coins.
*   Potential vulnerabilities in the Mimblewimble protocol or its implementation that could compromise privacy or security.
*   Scalability limitations that could hinder transaction throughput as the network grows.
*   Maintaining a robust and active developer community to ensure ongoing development and security.

## SECURITY POSTURE

Grin's security model relies on the cryptographic properties of the Mimblewimble protocol and best practices in secure software development.

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Cryptographic primitives inherent to Mimblewimble (Pedersen commitments, Confidential Transactions, CoinJoin, Cut-through) provide transaction privacy and obfuscation. (Described in Mimblewimble protocol specifications and Grin codebase).
*   security control: Code reviews and audits are conducted to identify and address potential vulnerabilities. (Visible in GitHub pull requests and discussions).
*   security control: Use of Rust programming language, known for its memory safety features, reduces the risk of common software vulnerabilities. (Project codebase).
*   security control: Community participation in identifying and reporting security issues. (GitHub issues and community forums).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Reliance on relatively new and less-tested cryptographic techniques (Mimblewimble) compared to more established cryptocurrencies.
*   accepted risk: Potential for undiscovered vulnerabilities in the codebase despite ongoing reviews and audits.
*   accepted risk: The inherent complexity of the Mimblewimble protocol makes it more challenging to understand and audit compared to simpler blockchain designs.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Formal verification of critical components of the codebase.
*   security control: Bug bounty program to incentivize external security researchers to find and report vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Regular penetration testing by independent security firms.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication: Not directly applicable in the traditional sense, as Grin uses cryptographic keys for transaction authorization. Users are responsible for securing their private keys.
*   Authorization: Transaction authorization is based on cryptographic signatures, ensuring only the owner of a private key can spend their coins.
*   Input Validation: The protocol enforces strict validation rules for transaction data to prevent malformed transactions and potential attacks.
*   Cryptography: Grin relies heavily on strong cryptographic primitives, including Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and Pedersen commitments, to ensure confidentiality and integrity.

### BUILD

Grin uses a continuous integration (CI) system based on GitHub Actions. The build process is triggered by pull requests and commits to the main branch.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer["Developer"]
    GitHub["GitHub Repository"]
    GitHubActions["GitHub Actions"]
    Artifacts["Build Artifacts (Grin Binaries)"]

    Developer -- "Pushes Code" --> GitHub
    GitHub -- "Triggers Workflow" --> GitHubActions
    GitHubActions -- "Builds & Tests" --> GitHubActions
    GitHubActions -- "Publishes" --> Artifacts
```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developers push code changes to the GitHub repository.
2.  GitHub Actions automatically triggers a workflow.
3.  The workflow performs the following steps:
    *   Checks out the code.
    *   Sets up the Rust build environment.
    *   Runs linters and code formatters (e.g., `rustfmt`, `clippy`).
    *   Compiles the code.
    *   Runs unit and integration tests.
    *   If all checks and tests pass, creates build artifacts (Grin binaries).
4.  The build artifacts are published and made available for download.

Security Controls:

*   security control: Automated build process ensures consistency and reproducibility.
*   security control: Linters and code formatters enforce coding standards and help prevent common errors.
*   security control: Automated testing (unit and integration tests) verifies the correctness of the code.
*   security control: GitHub Actions provides a secure and isolated build environment.
*   security control: Code signing of release binaries (not explicitly mentioned in the repository, but a recommended practice).

## RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Maintaining the integrity and privacy of the Grin blockchain.
*   Ensuring the availability and resilience of the Grin network.
*   Facilitating secure and private transactions for users.

Data to Protect:

*   Transaction data (amounts, sender/receiver information): Sensitivity - High (due to privacy focus). Although Mimblewimble obfuscates this, vulnerabilities could expose it.
*   Private keys: Sensitivity - Extremely High. Compromise leads to loss of funds.
*   Node metadata (IP addresses, network topology): Sensitivity - Medium. Could be used for deanonymization attacks or network disruption.

## QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   What is the specific threat model used for Grin development (e.g., STRIDE, DREAD)?
*   Are there any formal security audits planned or completed for the Grin codebase?
*   What is the process for handling security vulnerabilities reported by external researchers?
*   What are the specific plans for addressing potential scalability limitations in the future?
*   What mechanisms are in place to prevent or mitigate denial-of-service (DoS) attacks on the Grin network?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: The Grin community prioritizes privacy above all else, even if it means sacrificing some performance or usability.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: The core developers of Grin have a strong understanding of cryptography and secure coding practices.
*   DESIGN: The Grin network will remain decentralized and resistant to censorship.
*   DESIGN: Users are responsible for securing their own private keys and wallets.
*   DESIGN: The optional API server, if used, will be properly secured and will not introduce new vulnerabilities.
