## Attack Tree Path: [51% Attack (Rent Hashrate)](./attack_tree_paths/51%_attack__rent_hashrate_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains temporary control of over 50% of the Grin network's hashrate by renting it from a service like NiceHash. This allows them to manipulate the blockchain.
*   **Attack Steps:**
    1.  Identify a hashrate rental service that offers sufficient power for the Grin Cuckoo Cycle algorithm.
    2.  Calculate the required hashrate and rental duration to achieve a 51% attack.
    3.  Secure sufficient funds (likely in another cryptocurrency) to pay for the rental.
    4.  Configure the rented hashrate to point to a malicious Grin node controlled by the attacker.
    5.  Launch the attack, attempting to double-spend coins or censor transactions.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (Becoming Medium)
*   **Impact:** Very High (Network disruption, double-spending, loss of confidence)
*   **Effort:** Medium (Requires significant financial resources)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (Understanding of mining, rental services, and blockchain manipulation)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Hashrate distribution is public, but rapid changes can be hard to react to)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Continuously monitor network hashrate distribution.
    *   Develop alerts for significant hashrate shifts.
    *   Encourage a diverse and decentralized mining community.
    *   Explore alternative PoW algorithms or hybrid PoW/PoS (long-term).

## Attack Tree Path: [Eclipse Attack (Isolate Node)](./attack_tree_paths/eclipse_attack__isolate_node_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker isolates a target Grin node from the legitimate network by controlling all of its peer connections, feeding it false information.
*   **Attack Steps:**
    1.  Identify the target Grin node's IP address and port.
    2.  Create multiple malicious Grin nodes (or use compromised nodes).
    3.  Flood the target node with connection requests from the malicious nodes.
    4.  Exploit any weaknesses in the target node's peer selection logic to ensure only malicious peers are connected.
    5.  Feed the isolated node a false blockchain fork or prevent it from receiving valid transactions.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium (Can disrupt individual node, facilitate double-spends against that node, or censor transactions)
*   **Effort:** Low (Can be automated with scripts)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (Networking knowledge, scripting)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (Requires monitoring node connections and behavior, differentiating malicious from legitimate peers)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust random peer selection and connection management.
    *   Limit the number of outbound connections.
    *   Monitor for unusual connection patterns.
    *   Encourage users to connect from diverse IP address ranges.

## Attack Tree Path: [Target Wallet (Key Theft)](./attack_tree_paths/target_wallet__key_theft_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Grin wallet software (or a third-party wallet used by the application) to steal the user's private keys.
*   **Attack Steps:**
    1.  Identify a vulnerability in the target wallet software (e.g., buffer overflow, format string vulnerability, insecure storage of keys).
    2.  Craft an exploit that leverages the vulnerability.
    3.  Deliver the exploit to the target user (e.g., through a malicious website, phishing email, or compromised software update).
    4.  Execute the exploit to extract the private keys.
    5.  Use the stolen keys to transfer Grin coins to an attacker-controlled address.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (Requires finding and exploiting a vulnerability)
*   **Impact:** High (Direct loss of funds)
*   **Effort:** High (Requires vulnerability research and exploit development)
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced/Expert (Vulnerability research, exploit development)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard (Often requires forensic analysis after the fact)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Rigorous code reviews, static analysis, and fuzzing of the wallet software.
    *   Careful dependency management and vetting.
    *   Sandboxing of the wallet software.
    *   User education on software updates and phishing.

## Attack Tree Path: [Target Wallet (Slate Exfiltration)](./attack_tree_paths/target_wallet__slate_exfiltration_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts or modifies Grin transaction "slates" during offline transaction creation or transmission, allowing them to steal funds.
*   **Attack Steps:**
    1.  Identify a point where slates are handled insecurely (e.g., unencrypted transmission, storage in an insecure location, vulnerable application logic).
    2.  Intercept the slate during transmission (e.g., man-in-the-middle attack, network sniffing).  Or, access the slate from insecure storage.
    3.  Modify the slate to redirect funds to an attacker-controlled address (if possible, depending on the stage of the transaction).
    4.  Complete the transaction using the modified slate.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on how the application handles slates)
*   **Impact:** High (Direct loss of funds)
*   **Effort:** Medium (Requires intercepting network traffic or compromising systems handling slates)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate/Advanced (Networking, potentially exploit development)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (Requires monitoring network traffic and system logs, verifying slate integrity)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement secure slate handling: encryption, authentication, and secure storage.
    *   Use secure communication channels for slate transmission.
    *   Educate users about the risks of insecure slate handling.
    *   Implement integrity checks on slates.

## Attack Tree Path: [Target Exchange (Withdrawal Fraud)](./attack_tree_paths/target_exchange__withdrawal_fraud_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker bypasses security measures at a Grin exchange or custodial service to initiate unauthorized withdrawals of Grin coins.
*   **Attack Steps:**
    1.  Identify vulnerabilities in the exchange's withdrawal process (e.g., weak authentication, insufficient authorization checks, flaws in multi-signature implementation).
    2.  Exploit the vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to withdrawal functions.
    3.  Initiate withdrawals to attacker-controlled addresses.
    4.  Attempt to cover their tracks by manipulating logs or exploiting other vulnerabilities.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (Requires bypassing multiple security layers)
*   **Impact:** High (Loss of funds for the exchange and its users)
*   **Effort:** High (Requires compromising multiple systems and security controls)
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced/Expert (Penetration testing, social engineering, exploit development)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (Requires robust intrusion detection, monitoring, and auditing)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement a hot/cold wallet system.
    *   Use multi-signature wallets for withdrawals.
    *   Enforce strong authentication and authorization controls.
    *   Regularly audit code and security practices.
    *   Conduct penetration testing.
    *   Implement robust monitoring and alerting systems.
