*   **Attack Vector:** Attacker intercepts communication channels during the exchange of Slatepack messages between transacting parties.
        *   **Impact:**  Attacker can read, modify, or drop Slatepack messages, potentially leading to transaction manipulation, theft of funds, or denial of service.
        *   **Critical Node:** Direct path to critical impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2. Denial of Service (DoS) during Interactive Transaction [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2_2__denial_of_service__dos__during_interactive_transaction__critical_node_.md)

        *   **Impact:** Application downtime, inability to process transactions, financial losses, reputational damage.
        *   **Critical Node:** High likelihood and potential for significant disruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.1. Flood with Invalid Slatepacks](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_1__flood_with_invalid_slatepacks.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attacker sends a large volume of malformed or invalid Slatepack messages to overwhelm the application's processing capabilities.
            *   **Impact:** Application slowdown or crash, resource exhaustion, preventing legitimate transactions.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.2. Exploit Slatepack Processing Vulnerabilities (Parsing, Deserialization)](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_2__exploit_slatepack_processing_vulnerabilities__parsing__deserialization_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attacker crafts malicious Slatepacks designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the application's Slatepack parsing or deserialization logic (e.g., buffer overflows, format string bugs).
            *   **Impact:** Application crash, potential code execution, denial of service, data corruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.3. Key Compromise during Interactive Transaction [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2_3__key_compromise_during_interactive_transaction__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attacker gains access to user's private keys used for Grin transactions.
        *   **Impact:** Complete loss of user funds, unauthorized transactions, reputational damage.
        *   **Critical Node:** Direct path to critical impact (loss of funds).

## Attack Tree Path: [2.3.1. Target User's Private Keys used for Grin Transactions [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2_3_1__target_user's_private_keys_used_for_grin_transactions__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attacker employs various methods (phishing, malware, social engineering, application vulnerabilities) to steal user's private keys.
            *   **Impact:** User key compromise, leading to potential fund theft and transaction manipulation.
            *   **Critical Node:** The step that directly leads to key compromise and its severe consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Slatepack Vulnerabilities (Format, Parsing, Logic) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_slatepack_vulnerabilities__format__parsing__logic___critical_node_.md)

This branch focuses on vulnerabilities related to the Slatepack format itself and how the application processes it.
    *   It is a critical node as vulnerabilities here can have wide-ranging impacts.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1. Malicious Slatepack Injection [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1__malicious_slatepack_injection__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attacker injects crafted, potentially malicious Slatepacks into the application through various input points (API endpoints, file uploads, etc.).
        *   **Impact:**  DoS, code execution, data manipulation, depending on the vulnerability exploited.
        *   **Critical Node:** Common and potentially high impact vulnerability type.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1.1. Find Injection Point in Application (e.g., API endpoint, file upload)](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_1__find_injection_point_in_application__e_g___api_endpoint__file_upload_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attacker identifies weaknesses in the application's input handling that allow for the injection of arbitrary Slatepack data.
            *   **Impact:** Enables malicious Slatepack injection attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2. Slatepack Format Vulnerabilities (in Grin Library itself) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/3_2__slatepack_format_vulnerabilities__in_grin_library_itself___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Vulnerabilities exist within the Grin library's code responsible for handling Slatepack format, parsing, or processing.
        *   **Impact:** Critical, potentially widespread exploitation across all applications using the vulnerable Grin library version, leading to DoS, code execution, or other severe consequences.
        *   **Critical Node:** Widespread impact if exploited due to dependency on Grin library.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Grin Node Vulnerabilities (Underlying Grin Daemon) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_grin_node_vulnerabilities__underlying_grin_daemon___critical_node_.md)

This branch focuses on vulnerabilities in the Grin node software that the application relies upon.
