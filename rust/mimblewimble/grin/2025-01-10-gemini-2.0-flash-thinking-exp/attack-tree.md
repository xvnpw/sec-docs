## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Compromise Grin Transactions](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_compromise_grin_transactions.md)

* Attack Vector: Manipulate Transaction Data [CRITICAL NODE]
    * Description: An attacker aims to alter the data within a Grin transaction before it is finalized and broadcast.
    * Critical Node: Modify Transaction Amount [CRITICAL NODE]
        * Attack Vector: Exploit Lack of Input Validation on Transaction Amount
            * Description: The application fails to properly validate the amount being sent in a Grin transaction.
            * Attacker Action: The attacker provides a malicious amount (e.g., a negative value, an excessively large value, or a value exceeding available funds) that the application processes without error.
            * Potential Impact: Financial loss for the application or its users, incorrect balance updates, potential for denial of service if negative amounts are processed.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Compromise Grin Key Management [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_compromise_grin_key_management__critical_node_.md)

* Attack Vector: Key Extraction [CRITICAL NODE]
    * Description: The attacker attempts to retrieve the Grin private keys or seed phrase used by the application.
    * Critical Node: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Application's Key Storage [CRITICAL NODE]
        * Attack Vector: Insecure Storage of Seed Phrase or Private Keys [CRITICAL NODE]
            * Description: The application stores the Grin seed phrase or private keys in a plain text format or using weak encryption.
            * Attacker Action: The attacker gains unauthorized access to the storage location (e.g., through a file system vulnerability, database breach, or compromised server) and retrieves the unprotected key material.
            * Potential Impact: Complete compromise of the Grin wallet associated with the application, leading to theft of funds and the ability to perform unauthorized transactions.
        * Attack Vector: Lack of Encryption for Key Material [CRITICAL NODE]
            * Description: The application does not encrypt the Grin seed phrase or private keys at all.
            * Attacker Action: Similar to the above, the attacker gains access to the storage location and finds the key material readily available.
            * Potential Impact: Same as above.
        * Attack Vector: Access Control Vulnerabilities to Key Storage [CRITICAL NODE]
            * Description: The application's key storage mechanism has inadequate access controls, allowing unauthorized users or processes to read the key material.
            * Attacker Action: The attacker exploits these weak access controls to read the key files or database entries.
            * Potential Impact: Same as above.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node (within "Exploit Grin Node Interaction")](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node__within_exploit_grin_node_interaction_.md)

* Attack Vector: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Grin Node API
    * Critical Node: Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Grin Node (Critical) [CRITICAL NODE]
        * Description: A vulnerability exists in the Grin node's API that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server running the Grin node.
        * Attacker Action: The attacker crafts a malicious API request that exploits the vulnerability.
        * Potential Impact: Complete compromise of the Grin node server, potentially leading to data breaches, manipulation of the application's Grin interactions, and further attacks on the application infrastructure.
