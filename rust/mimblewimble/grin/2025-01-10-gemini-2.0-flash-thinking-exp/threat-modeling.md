# Threat Model Analysis for mimblewimble/grin

## Threat: [Malicious Slatepack Injection/Manipulation](./threats/malicious_slatepack_injectionmanipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts or generates a malicious slatepack during the interactive transaction building process. This could involve altering the amount, recipient information (though Grin doesn't have addresses in the traditional sense, it could manipulate kernel commitments or other identifying data within the slate), or injecting malicious kernels. The attacker could then trick the victim into signing and broadcasting this modified transaction.

    *   **Impact:** Loss of funds for the victim if the amount is increased or the output is redirected. Potential for the victim to unknowingly participate in illicit activities if malicious kernels are injected.

    *   **Affected Grin Component:** Interactive Transaction Building Process (Slate Exchange)

    *   **Risk Severity:** High

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement end-to-end encryption for slate exchange.
        *   Visually verify transaction details (amount, recipient information if available through other means) before signing.
        *   Use trusted communication channels for slate exchange.
        *   Implement robust input validation on received slatepacks before processing.
        *   Consider using secure, out-of-band verification methods for transaction details.

## Threat: [Key Extraction from Compromised Wallet or Application](./threats/key_extraction_from_compromised_wallet_or_application.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the storage location of Grin private keys, either through compromising the wallet software, the application integrating Grin, or the underlying operating system. This could involve exploiting software vulnerabilities, social engineering, or physical access.

    *   **Impact:** Complete loss of control over the associated Grin funds, allowing the attacker to spend them at will.

    *   **Affected Grin Component:** Wallet Functionality, Key Management

    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use strong encryption for storing private keys (e.g., using wallet encryption features).
        *   Implement secure key generation and derivation practices.
        *   Store keys in secure locations with restricted access permissions.
        *   Consider using hardware wallets or secure enclaves for key storage.
        *   Regularly back up wallet data securely.
        *   Keep wallet software and the integrating application up-to-date with security patches.

## Threat: [Malicious Kernel Injection During Transaction Building](./threats/malicious_kernel_injection_during_transaction_building.md)

*   **Description:** During the interactive transaction building process, an attacker could attempt to inject a malicious kernel into the transaction. This kernel could have unintended side effects or potentially exploit vulnerabilities in the Grin protocol or node implementation.

    *   **Impact:** Unpredictable behavior of the Grin network or the recipient's node upon processing the transaction. Potential for exploitation of vulnerabilities leading to further compromise.

    *   **Affected Grin Component:** Interactive Transaction Building Process, Kernel Handling

    *   **Risk Severity:** High

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly validate all components of a received slate before signing.
        *   Implement checks to ensure the transaction structure and kernels conform to expected patterns.
        *   Use trusted and well-vetted Grin libraries for transaction building.
        *   Educate users about the risks of interacting with untrusted parties during transaction building.

## Threat: [Exploiting Bulletproof Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploiting_bulletproof_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker discovers and exploits a cryptographic vulnerability in the Bulletproofs implementation used by Grin. This could potentially allow the attacker to forge transactions, extract private information, or disrupt the network.

    *   **Impact:**  Loss of confidentiality and integrity of Grin transactions. Potential for significant financial losses and network instability.

    *   **Affected Grin Component:** Cryptographic Library (Bulletproofs implementation)

    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Stay updated on security audits and research related to Bulletproofs.
        *   Use the latest stable version of Grin, which incorporates any necessary patches.
        *   Rely on reputable and well-audited implementations of Bulletproofs.

## Threat: [Compromised Grin Node Manipulation](./threats/compromised_grin_node_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises the Grin node that the application is connected to. This could allow the attacker to manipulate transaction data reported to the application, censor transactions, or potentially steal private keys if the node manages them.

    *   **Impact:**  The application might receive incorrect information about transaction status or balances. Transactions might be blocked or altered. Potential for theft of funds if the compromised node has access to private keys.

    *   **Affected Grin Component:** Grin Node API, Node Core Functionality

    *   **Risk Severity:** High

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Connect to a trusted and well-maintained Grin node.
        *   Consider running your own Grin node for greater control and security.
        *   Implement secure communication channels (TLS) between the application and the Grin node.
        *   Regularly monitor the Grin node's logs and activity for suspicious behavior.
        *   Implement input validation on data received from the Grin node API.
