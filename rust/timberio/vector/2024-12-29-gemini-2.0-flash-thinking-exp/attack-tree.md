**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors:**

**High-Risk Path: Manipulate Log/Metric Data to Influence Application Behavior**

*   **Critical Node: Gain Access to Vector's Data Stream/Storage**
    *   Attack Vectors:
        *   Exploit Source Vulnerability to Inject Malicious Data
            *   Example: Vulnerability in application logging library leading to crafted log entries.
        *   Compromise Vector's Input Pipeline
            *   Example: Man-in-the-middle attack on the connection between the application and Vector's input.
        *   Exploit Vector's Internal Data Handling
            *   Example: Vulnerability in Vector's transformation logic allowing data injection.
        *   Compromise Vector's Sink Destination
            *   Example: If Vector is writing to a file, gain write access to that file.
    *   Attack Vectors (Directly from the High-Risk Path):
        *   Inject Malicious Log/Metric Data
            *   Example: Injecting log entries that trigger specific application logic flaws (e.g., SQL injection via log data).
        *   Alter Log/Metric Data
            *   Example: Modifying log entries to hide malicious activity or to trigger false alerts.
        *   Delete or Filter Legitimate Data
            *   Example: Configuring Vector to drop specific log entries that would reveal an attack.

**High-Risk Path: Disrupt Vector Operation, Leading to Application Instability or Data Loss**

*   Attack Vectors:
    *   Overload Vector with Data
        *   Identify Vector's Input Sources
            *   Example: Determine the application's logging mechanism and Vector's source configuration.
        *   Flood Vector with Excessive Data
            *   Example: Generate a large volume of meaningless log data to overwhelm Vector's processing capacity.

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Vector Configuration Vulnerabilities**

*   **Critical Node: Gain Access to Vector's Configuration**
    *   Attack Vectors:
        *   Exploit Weak Access Controls on Configuration Files
            *   Example: Default credentials or insecure file permissions on Vector's configuration files.
        *   Exploit Vector's Management API Vulnerabilities
            *   Example: Unauthenticated or vulnerable API endpoints for configuration management.
    *   Attack Vectors (Directly from the High-Risk Path):
        *   Modify Configuration to Cause Failure
            *   Example: Setting invalid parameters or disabling critical components in Vector's configuration.

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Vector's Role in Data Routing/Delivery**

*   **High-Risk Path: Redirect Data to Malicious Destinations**
    *   **Critical Node: Gain Access to Vector's Configuration**
        *   Attack Vectors:
            *   Exploit Weak Access Controls on Configuration Files
                *   Example: Default credentials or insecure file permissions on Vector's configuration files.
            *   Exploit Vector's Management API Vulnerabilities
                *   Example: Unauthenticated or vulnerable API endpoints for configuration management.
    *   Attack Vectors (Directly from the High-Risk Path):
        *   Modify Sink Configuration
            *   Example: Change the destination of logs to an attacker-controlled server.

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Vector's Access Control or Authentication Mechanisms**

*   Attack Vectors:
    *   Exploit Weak Authentication
        *   Example: Default credentials or brute-forcing authentication mechanisms for Vector's management interface.
    *   Exploit Authorization Flaws
        *   Example: Gaining access to sensitive Vector functionalities without proper authorization.
    *   Leverage Compromised Credentials
        *   Example: Obtaining valid credentials for Vector's management interface through phishing or other means.
