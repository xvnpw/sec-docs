## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using Vector [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_vector__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal. An attacker successfully exploiting any of the high-risk paths below will achieve this objective, leading to potential data breaches, service disruption, or unauthorized access to the application and its resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Data Ingestion into Vector [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_data_ingestion_into_vector__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

**Inject Malicious Data via Supported Input Formats (e.g., JSON, Syslog) [HIGH-RISK NODE]:**
        * Attack Vector: Exploiting vulnerabilities in how Vector parses data formats like JSON or Syslog.
        * Techniques:
            * **Log Injection:** Injecting control characters or malicious commands within log messages that, when processed by the application, could lead to command execution or other unintended actions. For example, injecting shell commands into a log message that the application later uses in a system call.
            * **Payload Injection:** Crafting malicious payloads within the data format that, when processed by the application, trigger vulnerabilities like SQL injection if the data is used in database queries without proper sanitization.
        * Impact: Application compromise, potential for data manipulation, information disclosure, or even remote code execution on the application server.
    **Manipulate Log Files Before Vector Reads Them [HIGH-RISK NODE]:**
        * Attack Vector: Gaining unauthorized access to the file system where log files are stored before Vector processes them.
        * Techniques:
            * **Direct File Modification:**  If file permissions are weak, an attacker could directly edit log files, injecting malicious entries.
            * **Log Rotation Exploitation:**  Manipulating log rotation mechanisms to inject malicious content into newly created log files.
            * **Symbolic Link Attacks:** Replacing legitimate log files with symbolic links pointing to attacker-controlled files containing malicious data.
        * Impact:  Influencing application behavior based on the injected log data, potentially leading to incorrect decision-making, triggering vulnerabilities, or masking malicious activity.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Data Transformation within Vector [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_data_transformation_within_vector__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

**Manipulate Vector's Configuration to Perform Malicious Transformations [HIGH-RISK NODE, HIGH-RISK BRANCH]:**
        **Inject Malicious Configuration via Configuration Files [HIGH-RISK NODE]:**
            * Attack Vector: Gaining unauthorized access to Vector's configuration files.
            * Techniques:
                * **Exploiting Weak File Permissions:** If configuration files are stored with overly permissive access rights, attackers can directly modify them.
                * **Exploiting Configuration Management Vulnerabilities:** If Vector uses an external configuration management system, vulnerabilities in that system could allow attackers to push malicious configurations.
                * **Leveraging Default Credentials:** If default credentials for accessing configuration files or systems are not changed, attackers can use them to gain access.
            * Impact:  Complete control over how Vector processes data. Attackers can:
                * **Modify Data:** Alter the content of logs or metrics before they reach their destination.
                * **Filter Data:** Suppress critical security logs, masking malicious activity.
                * **Inject Malicious Output:**  Craft transformations that inject malicious data into output sinks, potentially compromising downstream systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Data Egress from Vector [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_data_egress_from_vector__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

**Exploit Injection Vulnerabilities in Output Formatting [HIGH-RISK NODE]:**
        * Attack Vector: Exploiting flaws in how Vector formats data for output to various sinks (e.g., databases, APIs).
        * Techniques:
            * **SQL Injection:** If Vector formats data for database output without proper sanitization, attackers could inject malicious SQL queries.
            * **Command Injection:**  If Vector formats data for command-line execution on a sink, attackers could inject malicious commands.
            * **LDAP Injection:** If outputting to LDAP, attackers could inject malicious LDAP queries.
        * Impact:  Compromising downstream systems that receive data from Vector, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized access to those systems.
    **Exploit Authentication/Authorization Weaknesses in Sink Connections [HIGH-RISK NODE]:**
        * Attack Vector: Exploiting weak or default credentials used by Vector to connect to output sinks.
        * Techniques:
            * **Using Default Credentials:** If default usernames and passwords for database or API connections are not changed.
            * **Credential Stuffing/Brute-Force:** Attempting to gain access using lists of known credentials or brute-forcing passwords.
            * **Exploiting Credential Storage Vulnerabilities:** If Vector stores credentials insecurely, attackers could retrieve them.
        * Impact: Gaining unauthorized access to the output sinks, allowing attackers to read, modify, or delete data within those systems.
    **Manipulate Vector's Configuration to Change Output Destinations [HIGH-RISK NODE]:**
        * Attack Vector: Gaining unauthorized access to Vector's configuration to redirect output traffic.
        * Techniques:
            * **Exploiting Weak File Permissions:** Similar to injecting malicious configuration, weak file permissions allow direct modification.
            * **Exploiting Configuration APIs:** If Vector exposes an API for configuration, vulnerabilities could allow unauthorized changes to output destinations.
        * Impact:  Redirecting sensitive logs or metrics to attacker-controlled servers, enabling data exfiltration and potentially providing insights into the application's operations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities within Vector's Core Functionality [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_within_vector's_core_functionality__critical_node_.md)

This path encompasses exploiting inherent flaws in the Vector application itself. While specific attack vectors depend on the discovered vulnerabilities, common examples include:
        * **Exploiting Known CVEs:** Utilizing publicly known vulnerabilities with available exploits to gain unauthorized access or execute code.
        * **Exploiting Memory Corruption Bugs:** Triggering buffer overflows or use-after-free vulnerabilities to gain control of the Vector process.
        * **Exploiting Logic Errors:**  Finding and exploiting flaws in Vector's internal logic to cause unexpected behavior or gain unauthorized access.
    Impact: Can lead to arbitrary code execution on the Vector instance, potentially allowing attackers to pivot to other systems, access sensitive data, or disrupt Vector's functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Vector's Environment or Dependencies [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_vector's_environment_or_dependencies__critical_node_.md)

This path focuses on compromising the environment in which Vector runs, rather than Vector itself.
        * **Exploiting OS Vulnerabilities:**  If the operating system hosting Vector has unpatched vulnerabilities, attackers can gain system-level access.
        * **Exploiting Dependency Vulnerabilities:**  Vulnerabilities in libraries or dependencies used by Vector can be exploited to compromise the Vector process.
        * **Exploiting Containerization/Orchestration Weaknesses:** If Vector runs in a container, vulnerabilities in the container runtime or orchestration platform (like Kubernetes) could allow for container escape or broader infrastructure compromise.
    Impact: Can lead to full system compromise, allowing attackers to control the server where Vector and potentially the application reside.
