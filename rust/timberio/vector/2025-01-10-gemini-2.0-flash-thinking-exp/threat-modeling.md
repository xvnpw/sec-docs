# Threat Model Analysis for timberio/vector

## Threat: [Tampered Log Data in Transit](./threats/tampered_log_data_in_transit.md)

**Description:** An attacker could intercept and modify log data while it's being transmitted to Vector. This is possible if the connection between the log source and Vector's ingestion endpoint is not encrypted or authenticated.

**Impact:**  Compromised data integrity within Vector, inaccurate security audits performed using Vector data, failure to detect real threats due to manipulated logs.

**Affected Component:** Network communication to Vector's ingestion endpoints.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enforce TLS encryption for all network connections to Vector's ingestion endpoints.
*   Consider using secure transport protocols that provide both encryption and authentication for Vector inputs.

## Threat: [Denial of Service through Log Flooding](./threats/denial_of_service_through_log_flooding.md)

**Description:** An attacker could overwhelm Vector with a large volume of log data, potentially exhausting its resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O). This could prevent Vector from processing legitimate logs and disrupt its monitoring capabilities.

**Impact:** Loss of visibility into system behavior within Vector, delayed incident detection due to Vector overload, and potential service disruptions if downstream systems rely on timely data from Vector.

**Affected Component:** Vector process, specifically input buffers and processing pipelines.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement rate limiting or traffic shaping at the network level or within Vector's source configurations.
*   Configure Vector with appropriate resource limits and monitoring to detect resource exhaustion.
*   Implement backpressure mechanisms in Vector pipelines to handle bursts of data.

## Threat: [Injection Attacks via Log Data](./threats/injection_attacks_via_log_data.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious payloads within log messages that are processed by Vector. If Vector transforms don't properly sanitize this data, it could lead to command injection or other forms of exploitation within the Vector process itself or when Vector interacts with external systems.

**Impact:** Compromise of the Vector instance, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution within Vector's environment or when Vector interacts with sinks.

**Affected Component:** Vector Transforms, Vector Sinks (depending on how data is written).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization within Vector transforms before data is passed to sinks.
*   Avoid using Vector transforms that directly execute code based on log content without careful sanitization.

## Threat: [Configuration Tampering](./threats/configuration_tampering.md)

**Description:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to Vector's configuration files or management interface and modify its settings. This could involve changing data routing rules, disabling security features within Vector, or injecting malicious configurations that affect Vector's behavior.

**Impact:** Data being sent to unauthorized destinations by Vector, loss of critical log data processing by Vector, exposure of sensitive information managed by Vector (e.g., credentials), and potential for complete compromise of the Vector instance.

**Affected Component:** Vector Configuration (files, environment variables, management API if exposed).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Restrict access to Vector's configuration files and management interface using strong authentication and authorization.
*   Store sensitive configuration data (e.g., credentials) securely using secrets management solutions integrated with Vector.
*   Implement version control and auditing for Vector configuration changes.

## Threat: [Secrets Management Vulnerabilities](./threats/secrets_management_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Vector often needs to store sensitive credentials (e.g., API keys, database passwords) for connecting to sources and sinks. If these secrets are stored insecurely within Vector's configuration (e.g., in plain text), they could be exposed to attackers gaining access to Vector's configuration.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to external systems by leveraging compromised Vector credentials, data breaches through Vector's connections, and compromise of connected services.

**Affected Component:** Vector Configuration, specifically where credentials for sources and sinks are defined.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Utilize Vector's built-in secrets management features or integrate with external secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault).
*   Avoid storing secrets directly in Vector configuration files or environment variables.
*   Implement least privilege principles for credentials used by Vector.

## Threat: [Plugin Vulnerabilities](./threats/plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Vector's functionality can be extended through plugins (components). Vulnerabilities in these plugins, whether first-party or third-party, could be directly exploited by attackers to compromise the Vector process. This could allow for remote code execution, information disclosure within Vector's environment, or denial of service of the Vector instance.

**Impact:** Compromise of the Vector instance, potential access to sensitive data handled by Vector, and disruption of logging pipelines managed by Vector.

**Affected Component:** Vector Components (plugins, extensions).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Only use trusted and well-maintained Vector plugins.
*   Keep Vector and its plugins updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Review the code of third-party plugins before deployment if possible.

## Threat: [Data Exfiltration to Unauthorized Destinations](./threats/data_exfiltration_to_unauthorized_destinations.md)

**Description:** If Vector's output configurations are compromised or misconfigured, log data processed by Vector could be sent to unintended or malicious destinations controlled by an attacker. This directly involves Vector's routing and output mechanisms.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive log data processed by Vector to unauthorized parties, potentially leading to data breaches and regulatory violations due to Vector's actions.

**Affected Component:** Vector Sinks (output destinations).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Strictly control access to Vector's output configurations.
*   Implement destination whitelisting within Vector to ensure data is only sent to approved locations.
*   Monitor network traffic from the Vector instance for unexpected outbound connections.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Vector Instance](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_vector_instance.md)

**Description:** If access to the Vector server or container is not properly secured, attackers could gain unauthorized control directly over the Vector instance. This allows them to modify Vector configurations, access Vector logs, or even compromise the underlying system running Vector.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the Vector logging infrastructure, data breaches through access to Vector's data, and potential for further lateral movement within the network from the compromised Vector instance.

**Affected Component:** Vector Process, underlying operating system or container environment.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong authentication and authorization for access to the Vector server or container.
*   Follow security best practices for the underlying operating system or container environment hosting Vector.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Vector Software Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_vector_software_itself.md)

**Description:** Like any software, Vector might contain undiscovered security vulnerabilities. Exploiting these could allow attackers to directly compromise the Vector instance and potentially the systems it monitors through Vector's functionality.

**Impact:** Remote code execution on the Vector instance, information disclosure within Vector's environment, and denial of service of the Vector service.

**Affected Component:** Vector Core Software, Dependencies.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Vector software updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Subscribe to security advisories for Vector.
*   Implement a vulnerability scanning process for the Vector instance and its dependencies.
