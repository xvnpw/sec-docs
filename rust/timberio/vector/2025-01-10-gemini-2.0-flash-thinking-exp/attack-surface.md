# Attack Surface Analysis for timberio/vector

## Attack Surface: [Input Validation Vulnerabilities in Vector's Data Processing](./attack_surfaces/input_validation_vulnerabilities_in_vector's_data_processing.md)

*   Description: Vector's internal data processing logic has vulnerabilities that can be exploited with crafted input.
    *   How Vector Contributes: Vector's parsing and transformation logic (VRL) can be susceptible to bugs if not implemented and maintained securely.
    *   Example: A specially crafted log entry causes Vector's parsing engine to crash, leading to a denial of service.
    *   Impact: Denial of service for the logging/metrics pipeline, potential for information disclosure if parsing errors reveal internal data.
    *   Risk Severity: Medium  *(While previously marked as Medium, the potential for information disclosure through parsing errors warrants considering it High in certain contexts. However, strictly adhering to the previous severity, it remains Medium. For this filtered list focusing on *direct* Vector involvement and High/Critical, we'll omit it unless we re-evaluate the severity based on specific context.)*

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Input Configurations](./attack_surfaces/insecure_input_configurations.md)

*   Description: Vector's input sources are configured insecurely, allowing unauthorized data injection.
    *   How Vector Contributes: Vector relies on user configuration for defining input sources, and misconfigurations can expose attack vectors.
    *   Example: A Vector HTTP input endpoint is left publicly accessible without authentication, allowing anyone to inject arbitrary data.
    *   Impact: Injection of malicious data, potentially overwhelming Vector or feeding harmful data to downstream systems.
    *   Risk Severity: High
    *   Mitigation Strategies:
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for all Vector input endpoints.
        *   Restrict access to Vector input ports and interfaces using firewalls and network segmentation.
        *   Regularly review and audit Vector input configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Data Ingestion/Egress](./attack_surfaces/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_on_data_ingestionegress.md)

*   Description: Communication channels between data sources/destinations and Vector are not properly secured, allowing interception and manipulation.
    *   How Vector Contributes: Vector facilitates data transfer, and if these transfers are not encrypted, it becomes a point of vulnerability.
    *   Example: An attacker intercepts unencrypted log data being sent from an application to Vector, potentially gaining access to sensitive information.
    *   Impact: Data breaches, manipulation of logs or metrics, potentially leading to compromised insights or actions.
    *   Risk Severity: High
    *   Mitigation Strategies:
        *   Enforce TLS/SSL encryption for all communication between Vector and its data sources and destinations.
        *   Verify the authenticity of endpoints using certificates.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Vector's Transformation Language (VRL)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_vector's_transformation_language__vrl_.md)

*   Description: The Vector Remap Language (VRL) used for data transformation has vulnerabilities that can be exploited.
    *   How Vector Contributes: Vector's core functionality relies on VRL, and flaws in its implementation can be exploited.
    *   Example: A vulnerability in a VRL function allows an attacker to craft a transformation that executes arbitrary code on the Vector instance.
    *   Impact: Code execution on the Vector server, information disclosure, denial of service.
    *   Risk Severity: Critical
    *   Mitigation Strategies:
        *   Keep Vector updated to the latest version with security patches.
        *   Thoroughly test and audit all custom VRL transformations.
        *   Avoid using untrusted or poorly understood VRL code.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Output Destinations](./attack_surfaces/insecure_output_destinations.md)

*   Description: Vector is configured to send data to insecure destinations, exposing the data.
    *   How Vector Contributes: Vector is responsible for delivering data, and if the destination is insecure, Vector facilitates the exposure.
    *   Example: Vector sends logs containing sensitive customer data to a publicly accessible cloud storage bucket without proper access controls.
    *   Impact: Data breaches, compliance violations.
    *   Risk Severity: Critical
    *   Mitigation Strategies:
        *   Ensure all output destinations are properly secured with authentication, authorization, and encryption.
        *   Implement access controls on output destinations to restrict access to authorized users and systems.
        *   Regularly audit Vector output configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Remote Management Interface Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/remote_management_interface_vulnerabilities.md)

*   Description: Vector's remote management interface (if enabled) has security vulnerabilities.
    *   How Vector Contributes: Vector might expose a management interface for configuration and monitoring, which can be a target.
    *   Example: A known vulnerability in Vector's API allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access and reconfigure the system.
    *   Impact: Full control over the Vector instance, potential for data manipulation, denial of service, or pivoting to other systems.
    *   Risk Severity: Critical
    *   Mitigation Strategies:
        *   Disable remote management interfaces if not strictly necessary.
        *   If required, ensure the interface is only accessible over secure networks (VPN, private network).
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for the management interface.
        *   Keep Vector updated to the latest version with security patches.

## Attack Surface: [Default Credentials](./attack_surfaces/default_credentials.md)

*   Description: Default credentials are used for Vector's management interface or internal components.
    *   How Vector Contributes: Vector, like many applications, might have default credentials that need to be changed.
    *   Example: An attacker uses default credentials to log into Vector's web UI and reconfigure its outputs.
    *   Impact: Unauthorized access and control over the Vector instance.
    *   Risk Severity: High
    *   Mitigation Strategies:
        *   Immediately change all default credentials upon installation and configuration of Vector.
        *   Enforce strong password policies.

## Attack Surface: [Third-Party Plugin Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/third-party_plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

*   Description: Vulnerabilities exist in third-party plugins used by Vector for sources, sinks, or transforms.
    *   How Vector Contributes: Vector's extensibility through plugins introduces dependencies on external code.
    *   Example: A vulnerability in a community-developed Vector sink plugin allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
    *   Impact:  Wide range of impacts depending on the plugin's functionality, including code execution, data breaches, and denial of service.
    *   Risk Severity:  Medium to High *(While some plugin vulnerabilities might be medium, the potential for high-impact vulnerabilities warrants including this as a high-risk element directly related to Vector's plugin architecture.)*
    *   Mitigation Strategies:
        *   Only use trusted and well-maintained Vector plugins.
        *   Keep all Vector plugins updated to the latest versions with security patches.
        *   Carefully evaluate the security implications of using third-party plugins before deploying them.
