## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Application via Vector [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__compromise_application_via_vector__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized access to the application, its data, or its underlying infrastructure by exploiting vulnerabilities related to Vector.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Vector Configuration Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_vector_configuration_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

Vector's configuration is a central point of control. Vulnerabilities here allow attackers to manipulate Vector's behavior, data flow, and potentially gain code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Misconfiguration Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__misconfiguration_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

This node represents attacks that leverage common misconfigurations in Vector setup. These are often easier to exploit than complex software vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Vector Input/Source Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_vector_inputsource_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

Vector processes data from various sources. Exploiting vulnerabilities in how Vector handles input data can lead to attacks on Vector itself or downstream systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Vector Process/Binary Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_vector_processbinary_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

Directly targeting vulnerabilities within the Vector software (binary or its dependencies) can lead to severe compromise, including code execution and system takeover.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Vector Deployment Environment [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_vector_deployment_environment__critical_node_.md)

The security of the environment where Vector is deployed (containers, host systems) is crucial. Weaknesses here can be exploited to compromise Vector and potentially the entire infrastructure.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Weak Access Control/Permissions [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_weak_access_controlpermissions__critical_node_.md)

Insufficient access controls and weak permissions are fundamental security flaws that can amplify the impact of other vulnerabilities and provide attackers with easy entry points.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Configuration Injection [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__configuration_injection__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Environment Variable Injection:** Injecting malicious environment variables during Vector's startup or deployment. This can alter Vector's configuration, potentially leading to code execution or data exfiltration.
*   **Configuration File Injection/Tampering:** Mounting malicious configuration files into Vector containers or gaining access to the host system to modify Vector's configuration files (e.g., `vector.toml`, `vector.yaml`). This allows complete control over Vector's behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Environment Variable Injection [HIGH-RISK PATH] -> [HIGH-RISK PATH] Inject malicious environment variables during Vector deployment/startup [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__environment_variable_injection__high-risk_path__-__high-risk_path__inject_malicious_cf61e770.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Exploiting insecure container orchestration or deployment pipelines to inject malicious environment variables.
*   Compromising systems or processes that manage Vector's environment variables.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Insecure Source Configuration [HIGH-RISK PATH] -> [HIGH-RISK PATH] Expose sensitive data via improperly configured sources (e.g., file source reading sensitive logs) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__insecure_source_configuration__high-risk_path__-__high-risk_path__expose_sensitive__f4c88a14.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Misconfiguring Vector's source components (e.g., `file` source) to read sensitive data that should not be processed or exposed.
*   Granting Vector excessive permissions to access data sources, allowing it to read sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Insecure Sink Configuration [HIGH-RISK PATH] -> [HIGH-RISK PATH] Exfiltrate data to attacker-controlled sink (e.g., attacker's HTTP endpoint, S3 bucket) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__insecure_sink_configuration__high-risk_path__-__high-risk_path__exfiltrate_data_to__0c25ce9c.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Misconfiguring Vector's sink components (e.g., `http` sink, `aws_s3` sink) to send data to destinations controlled by the attacker.
*   Compromising credentials used by Vector to authenticate to sinks, allowing attackers to redirect data flow.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Unencrypted Communication Configuration [HIGH-RISK PATH] -> [HIGH-RISK PATH] Configure Vector to send data over unencrypted channels (HTTP, plain TCP) allowing eavesdropping [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__unencrypted_communication_configuration__high-risk_path__-__high-risk_path__configu_5951369d.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Configuring Vector to use unencrypted protocols (e.g., plain HTTP, TCP) for communication between Vector components or with sources/sinks.
*   Failing to enable TLS/SSL encryption where it is supported by Vector and its integrations.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Source Injection Attacks [HIGH-RISK PATH] -> [HIGH-RISK PATH] Log Injection [HIGH-RISK PATH] -> [HIGH-RISK PATH] Inject malicious payloads into logs that are processed by Vector, potentially exploiting downstream systems or Vector itself [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__source_injection_attacks__high-risk_path__-__high-risk_path__log_injection__high-ri_7b7f08ab.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Injecting malicious payloads into application logs that are ingested by Vector. These payloads can exploit vulnerabilities in downstream log processing systems, SIEMs, or even Vector itself if it improperly handles the injected data.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Known Vector Software Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH] -> [HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit publicly disclosed CVEs in Vector [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__known_vector_software_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path__-__high-risk_path__exploit_p_22ea0d80.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Exploiting publicly known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) in the specific version of Vector being used. This requires identifying vulnerable Vector instances and using available exploits.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Misconfigured container security settings allowing escape [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__misconfigured_container_security_settings_allowing_escape__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Deploying Vector containers with overly permissive security settings that allow container escape. Examples include privileged containers, host network access, or insecure seccomp/AppArmor profiles.
*   Exploiting vulnerabilities in container runtime environments when combined with misconfigurations to escape the container.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Host System Compromise [HIGH-RISK PATH] -> [HIGH-RISK PATH] Weak host system security configurations [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__host_system_compromise__high-risk_path__-__high-risk_path__weak_host_system_securit_9cc9839f.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Exploiting common host system misconfigurations such as weak passwords, open ports, unpatched operating systems, or insecure services running on the host where Vector is deployed.
*   Gaining initial access to the host system through other vulnerabilities and then leveraging weak configurations to escalate privileges or maintain persistence.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Weak Access Control/Permissions [HIGH-RISK PATH] -> [HIGH-RISK PATH] Insufficient Access Control to Vector Configuration [HIGH-RISK PATH] -> [HIGH-RISK PATH] Unauthorized access to configuration files [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__weak_access_controlpermissions__high-risk_path__-__high-risk_path__insufficient_acc_aff8fb0c.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Failing to properly restrict access to Vector's configuration files (e.g., `vector.toml`, `vector.yaml`) on the file system.
*   Exploiting weak file system permissions or access control mechanisms to gain unauthorized read or write access to configuration files.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Weak Permissions on Vector Process/Files [HIGH-RISK PATH] -> [HIGH-RISK PATH] Excessive permissions for Vector process [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__weak_permissions_on_vector_processfiles__high-risk_path__-__high-risk_path__excessi_fd56d413.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Running the Vector process with unnecessarily broad permissions, such as running as root user inside containers or on host systems.
*   Granting the Vector process excessive capabilities or roles that are not required for its intended function.
