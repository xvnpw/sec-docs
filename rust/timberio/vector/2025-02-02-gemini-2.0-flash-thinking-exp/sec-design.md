# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, represented by the GitHub repository `timberio/vector`, aims to provide a high-performance, open-source observability data pipeline. It is designed to collect, transform, and route logs, metrics, and traces.

Business Priorities and Goals:

- Provide a reliable and scalable observability data pipeline solution.
- Offer a flexible and configurable platform to handle diverse observability data formats and sources.
- Ensure high performance and low resource consumption for efficient data processing.
- Support a wide range of data sources and destinations to integrate with existing observability infrastructure.
- Foster an open-source community and ecosystem around the project.

Business Risks:

- Data loss or corruption during processing or routing, leading to incomplete or inaccurate observability data.
- Performance bottlenecks or scalability limitations that hinder the ability to handle increasing data volumes.
- Security vulnerabilities that could expose sensitive observability data or compromise the system.
- Lack of adoption or community support, leading to project stagnation or failure to meet user needs.
- Incompatibility with evolving observability standards or technologies, requiring significant rework.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

- security control: Code is hosted on GitHub, leveraging GitHub's infrastructure security. (Implemented: GitHub platform)
- security control: Project is open-source, allowing for community review and vulnerability identification. (Implemented: Open-source nature)
- accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability identification and patching may introduce delays.
- accepted risk: Open-source nature may expose internal design details to potential attackers.

Recommended Security Controls:

- security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to identify vulnerabilities early in the development process.
- security control: Conduct regular penetration testing and security audits to proactively identify and address security weaknesses.
- security control: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure and response process to handle security issues effectively.
- security control: Provide secure configuration guidelines and best practices for users to deploy and operate Vector securely.
- security control: Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks.
- security control: Implement robust logging and monitoring of security-relevant events for incident detection and response.

Security Requirements:

- Authentication:
  - requirement: Vector itself might not require user authentication for data processing, but integrations with external systems (e.g., control plane, APIs) should use strong authentication mechanisms.
  - requirement: If Vector exposes any management interfaces (API, CLI), these must be protected with authentication.
- Authorization:
  - requirement: Access to configuration and management functions should be restricted to authorized users or roles.
  - requirement: If Vector interacts with external systems requiring authorization, it should support appropriate authorization protocols (e.g., API keys, OAuth).
- Input Validation:
  - requirement: All data inputs from sources and configuration inputs must be thoroughly validated to prevent injection attacks and data corruption.
  - requirement: Configuration parsing should be robust and prevent vulnerabilities arising from malformed configurations.
- Cryptography:
  - requirement: Sensitive data in transit should be encrypted using TLS/HTTPS.
  - requirement: Consider encryption of sensitive data at rest if Vector is designed to store data locally (e.g., buffering, caching).
  - requirement: Securely manage cryptographic keys and secrets used for encryption and authentication.

```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developer writes code and commits changes to the Version Control System (VCS), which is GitHub in this case.
2.  The Build System, likely GitHub Actions, is triggered by code changes in the VCS.
3.  The Build System compiles the code, runs automated tests (unit tests, integration tests), and performs static application security testing (SAST) using a SAST scanner.
4.  If tests and SAST checks pass, the Build System builds container images and binaries artifacts.
5.  Container images are pushed to a Container Registry.
6.  Binaries artifacts are stored for distribution.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

- Observability Data Pipeline Operation: Ensuring continuous and reliable collection, processing, and routing of observability data is critical for monitoring application and infrastructure health, performance, and security. Disruption or failure of this process can lead to blind spots in observability, hindering incident detection and response.

Data Sensitivity:

- Observability Data (Logs, Metrics, Traces): Sensitivity depends on the data sources being monitored. Logs, metrics, and traces can contain sensitive information such as:
    - Application data: User IDs, request parameters, business transactions, error messages, which might contain personally identifiable information (PII) or confidential business data.
    - Infrastructure data: Server names, IP addresses, network configurations, security events, which can reveal infrastructure details and potential vulnerabilities.
    - Security events: Audit logs, security alerts, intrusion detection logs, which are inherently sensitive and require confidentiality and integrity.

Data Sensitivity Level: Potentially High. Observability data can contain sensitive information depending on the monitored systems and applications. Proper security controls are necessary to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of this data.
