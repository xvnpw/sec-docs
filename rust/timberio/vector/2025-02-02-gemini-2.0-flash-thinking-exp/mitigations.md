## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement TLS Encryption for All Vector Communication](./mitigation_strategies/implement_tls_encryption_for_all_vector_communication.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Implement TLS Encryption for All Vector Communication

**Description:**
*   Step 1: **Configure Vector Sinks for TLS:**  For each Vector sink that supports TLS (e.g., `http`, `elasticsearch`), enable TLS in the sink configuration. Specify the paths to TLS certificate, private key, and CA certificate if required for mutual TLS or custom CA verification. Example: in `http` sink, set `tls.enabled: true`, `tls.key_path`, `tls.cert_path`, and `tls.ca_cert_path` as needed.
*   Step 2: **Configure Vector Sources for TLS (if applicable):** If Vector is acting as a server (e.g., using `http_listener` source), configure TLS for the source to accept only encrypted connections. Set `tls.enabled: true` and provide necessary certificate paths in the source configuration.
*   Step 3: **Enforce TLS for Internal Vector Communication (if applicable):** If using Vector aggregator components, ensure TLS is enabled for communication between agents and aggregators, and between aggregators and sinks, by configuring TLS settings in listeners and connectors.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Data in Transit Interception (Confidentiality Breach):** Severity: High. Unencrypted data transmitted by Vector can be intercepted and read by attackers on the network.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** Severity: High. Without TLS, attackers can intercept and potentially modify data in transit between Vector components or between Vector and external systems.

**Impact:**
*   Data in Transit Interception (Confidentiality Breach): High reduction. TLS encryption makes intercepted data unreadable, significantly reducing the risk of confidentiality breaches.
*   Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks: High reduction. TLS with proper certificate verification prevents attackers from impersonating legitimate endpoints and manipulating data flow.

**Currently Implemented:** Partially - TLS is configured for Vector agents sending logs to our central Elasticsearch sink using the `http` sink with `tls.enabled: true`.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   TLS is not enforced for potential future internal communication between Vector agents and aggregators.
*   TLS is not configured for Vector sources if we were to use Vector as a data receiver (e.g., `http_listener`).
*   TLS might be missing for other sinks if they are added in the future and support TLS.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Data Masking and Redaction within Vector Pipelines](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_data_masking_and_redaction_within_vector_pipelines.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Utilize Data Masking and Redaction within Vector Pipelines

**Description:**
*   Step 1: **Identify Sensitive Data Fields:** Determine which fields in your logs, metrics, or traces contain sensitive information that needs to be protected.
*   Step 2: **Implement Vector Transforms:**  In your Vector pipeline configuration, insert appropriate transforms like `mask`, `regex_replace`, or `replace` to target and modify the identified sensitive fields.
*   Step 3: **Define Transformation Rules:** Configure the transforms with specific rules (e.g., regular expressions, field names) to accurately mask or redact sensitive data. For example, use `mask` transform with a regex to replace email addresses with asterisks.
*   Step 4: **Apply Transforms in Pipelines:** Ensure these transforms are applied in the Vector pipeline *before* data is sent to sinks, ideally as early as possible in the processing stage.
*   Step 5: **Test and Verify Transformations:** Thoroughly test your Vector pipeline configuration with sample data to confirm that masking and redaction rules are working as expected and are not inadvertently affecting non-sensitive data.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Data Leakage through Logs/Metrics/Traces:** Severity: High. Sensitive data present in logs, metrics, or traces can be exposed if sinks are compromised or accessed by unauthorized users.
*   **Compliance Violations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS):** Severity: High.  Storing or transmitting sensitive data in logs without proper masking or redaction can lead to regulatory non-compliance.

**Impact:**
*   Data Leakage through Logs/Metrics/Traces: High reduction. Masking and redaction significantly reduce the risk of exposing sensitive data in sinks, even if sinks are compromised.
*   Compliance Violations: High reduction. By removing or obscuring sensitive data, the risk of violating data protection regulations is substantially lowered.

**Currently Implemented:** Partially - Basic masking is used for API keys in application logs using the `mask` transform in our Vector agent pipelines.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Consistent redaction of PII (like email addresses, usernames, IP addresses) is not implemented across all log sources.
*   Masking or redaction is not applied to metrics or traces data.
*   More sophisticated redaction techniques (like tokenization or pseudonymization, if needed) are not explored.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Securely Manage Vector Configuration and Secrets *within Vector*](./mitigation_strategies/securely_manage_vector_configuration_and_secrets_within_vector.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Securely Manage Vector Configuration and Secrets *within Vector*

**Description:**
*   Step 1: **Utilize Vector's Secret Management Features (if available):** Explore if Vector offers built-in secret management capabilities or integrations with external secret stores.  (Note: Vector's built-in secret management might be limited, so focus on external integration if possible).
*   Step 2: **Configure Vector to Read Secrets from Environment Variables or Files:** If direct secret management integration is limited, configure Vector to read sensitive credentials (API keys, passwords) from environment variables or securely mounted files instead of hardcoding them in configuration files.
*   Step 3: **Avoid Hardcoding Secrets in Configuration:**  Strictly avoid embedding secrets directly within Vector configuration files that are stored in version control or are easily accessible.
*   Step 4: **Securely Store Configuration Files (excluding secrets):** Store Vector configuration files (that do not contain secrets) in a secure location with appropriate access controls. Use version control for configuration files to track changes and enable rollback.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Exposure of Secrets in Configuration Files:** Severity: High. Hardcoded secrets in Vector configuration files can be easily exposed if configuration files are compromised or accidentally leaked.
*   **Unauthorized Access to Sinks and Sources:** Severity: High. Compromised secrets can be used to gain unauthorized access to downstream sinks or upstream data sources that Vector interacts with.

**Impact:**
*   Exposure of Secrets in Configuration Files: High reduction. By avoiding hardcoding, the risk of directly exposing secrets through configuration files is eliminated.
*   Unauthorized Access to Sinks and Sources: High reduction. Securely managing secrets reduces the likelihood of secrets being compromised and misused for unauthorized access.

**Currently Implemented:** Partially - We are using Kubernetes Secrets to inject API keys as environment variables into Vector agent containers, which Vector reads.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Vector configuration files themselves (excluding secrets) are not consistently stored in a version-controlled and access-controlled manner.
*   We are not fully leveraging potential Vector integrations with dedicated secret management solutions if available and beneficial.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Rate Limiting and Traffic Shaping within Vector Pipelines](./mitigation_strategies/implement_rate_limiting_and_traffic_shaping_within_vector_pipelines.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Rate Limiting and Traffic Shaping within Vector Pipelines

**Description:**
*   Step 1: **Identify Sinks with Rate Limits:** Determine if your downstream sinks (e.g., logging platforms, monitoring systems) have rate limits or can be overwhelmed by excessive data volume.
*   Step 2: **Configure Vector Rate Limiting Transforms:**  Use Vector's `rate_limit` transform in your pipelines to control the rate at which data is forwarded to sinks. Configure parameters like `limit` (events per second) and `period`.
*   Step 3: **Implement Traffic Shaping with Vector Routing (if needed):** If you have different types of data with varying priorities, use Vector's routing capabilities and potentially the `filter` transform to prioritize important data streams and shape traffic to sinks accordingly.
*   Step 4: **Monitor Vector Performance and Sink Load:** Monitor Vector's performance metrics and the load on your sinks to ensure rate limiting and traffic shaping configurations are effective and not causing data loss or performance bottlenecks.
*   Step 5: **Adjust Rate Limits Dynamically (if possible):** Explore if Vector allows for dynamic adjustment of rate limits based on sink health or other metrics for more adaptive traffic management.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Sink Overload and Denial of Service:** Severity: Medium.  Sudden spikes in data volume or malicious activity can overwhelm downstream sinks, leading to service disruptions or data loss.
*   **Resource Exhaustion on Sinks:** Severity: Medium.  Uncontrolled data flow can exhaust resources (CPU, memory, network) on sinks, impacting their performance and stability.

**Impact:**
*   Sink Overload and Denial of Service: Medium reduction. Rate limiting and traffic shaping protect sinks from being overwhelmed by excessive data, improving their availability and resilience.
*   Resource Exhaustion on Sinks: Medium reduction. By controlling data flow, resource consumption on sinks is managed, preventing resource exhaustion and performance degradation.

**Currently Implemented:** No - Rate limiting is currently not implemented in our Vector pipelines.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Rate limiting is not configured for any of our Vector sinks.
*   Traffic shaping based on data priority is not implemented.
*   Dynamic rate limit adjustments are not explored.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Validate and Sanitize Input Data within Vector Pipelines](./mitigation_strategies/validate_and_sanitize_input_data_within_vector_pipelines.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Validate and Sanitize Input Data within Vector Pipelines

**Description:**
*   Step 1: **Define Input Data Schemas:**  Clearly define the expected schema and data types for each data source that Vector ingests.
*   Step 2: **Utilize Vector Validation Transforms:**  Implement Vector transforms like `json_parser`, `logfmt_parser`, or custom transforms with scripting languages (e.g., Lua) to parse and validate input data against the defined schemas.
*   Step 3: **Implement Sanitization Transforms:** Use Vector transforms like `regex_replace`, `replace`, or custom transforms to sanitize input data by removing or modifying potentially harmful or malformed data. This can include escaping special characters, removing invalid characters, or normalizing data formats.
*   Step 4: **Handle Invalid Data:** Configure Vector pipelines to handle invalid or malformed data appropriately. This could involve dropping invalid events, routing them to a separate "dead-letter queue" sink for investigation, or applying default values.
*   Step 5: **Test Input Validation and Sanitization:** Thoroughly test your Vector pipeline configuration with various types of input data, including valid, invalid, and potentially malicious data, to ensure validation and sanitization rules are effective.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Injection Attacks via Logs/Metrics/Traces:** Severity: Medium. Malicious data injected into logs, metrics, or traces could potentially exploit vulnerabilities in downstream systems that process this data.
*   **Data Corruption and Processing Errors:** Severity: Medium. Malformed or invalid input data can cause errors in Vector pipelines or downstream systems, leading to data corruption or processing failures.

**Impact:**
*   Injection Attacks via Logs/Metrics/Traces: Medium reduction. Input validation and sanitization reduce the risk of malicious data being passed through Vector pipelines and potentially exploiting downstream systems.
*   Data Corruption and Processing Errors: Medium reduction. By ensuring data conforms to expected schemas and sanitizing potentially problematic data, the risk of data corruption and processing errors is lowered.

**Currently Implemented:** No - Input validation and sanitization are not explicitly implemented in our Vector pipelines.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   No explicit validation of input data schemas is performed in Vector pipelines.
*   Data sanitization beyond basic masking is not implemented.
*   Handling of invalid or malformed data is not explicitly configured; Vector might be dropping or misprocessing invalid data silently.
