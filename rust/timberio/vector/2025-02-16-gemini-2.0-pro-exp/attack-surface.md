# Attack Surface Analysis for timberio/vector

## Attack Surface: [Network Input Source Flooding (DoS/DDoS)](./attack_surfaces/network_input_source_flooding__dosddos_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers flood network-based input sources (TCP, UDP, HTTP) with excessive data, overwhelming Vector or the network.
*   **Vector Contribution:** Vector's core function as a data aggregator, listening on network ports for various input sources, makes it a direct target for DoS attacks.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends millions of UDP packets per second to a Vector instance configured to receive syslog data on UDP port 514.
*   **Impact:** Vector becomes unresponsive, preventing legitimate log data processing. Network congestion may impact other services relying on the same network.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical if Vector is essential for security monitoring or other critical functions).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rate Limiting (Vector Config):** Configure Vector's `limit` transform (or equivalent) to restrict the rate of incoming data from each source IP address or network. This is a *direct* Vector mitigation.
    *   **Resource Limits (OS-Level, but Vector-Aware):** Configure operating system resource limits (e.g., `ulimit` in Linux) specifically for the Vector process to prevent it from consuming excessive resources. This is OS-level, but done *because* of Vector.
    *   **Traffic Shaping/QoS (Network-Level, but Vector-Aware):** Use network traffic shaping or Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms, configured with awareness of Vector's traffic, to prioritize legitimate traffic. This is network-level, but done *because* of Vector.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Payload Injection (via Input Sources)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_payload_injection__via_input_sources_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject crafted data into input sources to exploit vulnerabilities in Vector's parsing, transformation, or sink logic.
*   **Vector Contribution:** Vector's support for numerous input formats (JSON, XML, syslog, raw TCP/UDP, etc.) and its powerful VRL transformation language *directly* create a large attack surface for injection vulnerabilities.  The parsing and processing logic *within* Vector is the target.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a specially crafted JSON payload to a Vector instance, exploiting a deserialization vulnerability in Vector's internal JSON parsing library.  Or, an attacker sends a malicious syslog message designed to trigger a buffer overflow in Vector's syslog parser.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution (most severe), information disclosure, denial of service, data corruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation (Vector Config):** Implement strict input validation *within Vector's configuration* for all input sources. Use Vector's features (if available) to validate data types, lengths, and formats. Prioritize allowlists over blocklists. This is a *direct* Vector mitigation.
    *   **Sanitization (Vector Config):** Use Vector's transformation capabilities (e.g., VRL) to sanitize input data, removing or escaping potentially dangerous characters *before* further processing. This is a *direct* Vector mitigation.
    *   **Regular Expression Security (Vector Config):** Carefully review and test all regular expressions used *within Vector's configuration* (e.g., in `regex` transforms) to prevent ReDoS attacks. Use tools to analyze regex complexity. This is a *direct* Vector mitigation.
    *   **VRL Sandboxing (Inherent to Vector):** Rely on Vector's inherent design, which provides some level of sandboxing for VRL execution, to limit the impact of malicious VRL code. This is a *direct* aspect of Vector's architecture.
    *   **Dependency Management (Vector Updates):** Keep Vector itself up-to-date to patch vulnerabilities in its internal components and bundled libraries. This is *directly* related to Vector's security.
    *   **Least Privilege (OS-Level, but Vector-Specific):** Run the Vector process with the *least privileges necessary* to perform its tasks. This limits the impact of a successful exploit. This is OS-level, but done *because* of Vector.

## Attack Surface: [VRL Code Injection](./attack_surfaces/vrl_code_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious VRL code into Vector's configuration, leading to arbitrary code execution within Vector's context.
*   **Vector Contribution:** VRL, being a core component of Vector and a powerful scripting language, *directly* introduces this attack surface. The vulnerability lies within Vector's VRL interpreter.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains access to Vector's configuration file and modifies a VRL transform to execute arbitrary shell commands (e.g., using VRL's ability to interact with the system, if such features exist and are enabled).
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution (most severe), information disclosure, denial of service, data corruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Configuration File Security (OS-Level, but Vector-Specific):** Protect Vector's configuration files with strong file permissions, restricting access to authorized users only. This is crucial *because* of Vector's reliance on configuration.
    *   **Configuration Validation (Vector-Specific):** Implement strict validation of Vector's configuration *within Vector itself* (if possible) or through external tools, including validation of the VRL code. This is a *direct* Vector mitigation.
    *   **Code Review (Vector Config):** Regularly review VRL code *within Vector's configuration* for potential security vulnerabilities. This is a *direct* Vector mitigation.
    *   **Least Privilege (OS-Level, but Vector-Specific):** Run the Vector process with the least privileges necessary. This limits the impact of malicious VRL code. This is OS-level, but done *because* of Vector.
    *   **Monitoring (Vector Logs):** Monitor Vector's logs and resource usage for signs of suspicious activity related to VRL execution. This is a *direct* Vector mitigation.

## Attack Surface: [Sink Credential Exposure](./attack_surfaces/sink_credential_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers gain access to credentials (API keys, passwords) used by Vector to authenticate with sinks (e.g., cloud services).
*   **Vector Contribution:** Vector *directly* requires and manages these credentials to send data to various sinks. The way Vector stores and handles these credentials is the key factor.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains access to Vector's configuration file, which contains an unencrypted AWS S3 access key.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to cloud services, financial losses.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical depending on the sensitivity of the connected sink).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Environment Variables (OS-Level, but Vector-Specific):** Store credentials in environment variables rather than directly in Vector's configuration file. This is a common practice, made necessary *because* of Vector's need for credentials.
    *   **Secret Management Systems (External, but Vector-Integrated):** Use a secret management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) and configure Vector to *retrieve* credentials from it. This is an integration *with* Vector.
    *   **Configuration File Encryption (OS/Tool-Level, but Vector-Specific):** Encrypt Vector's configuration file if it must contain sensitive information. This is done *because* of Vector's configuration.
    *   **Least Privilege (Sink-Specific, but Vector-Driven):** Grant Vector only the *necessary* permissions to access the sink. This is configured on the sink side, but driven by Vector's requirements.
    *  **Regular Credential Rotation (Sink and Vector):** Regularly rotate credentials to limit the impact of a compromise.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vector relies on external libraries, which may contain vulnerabilities.
*   **Vector Contribution:** Vector, as a software project, *directly* introduces this risk through its dependencies. The vulnerabilities are *within* Vector's codebase (via its dependencies).
*   **Example:** A vulnerability is discovered in a logging library used internally by Vector, allowing for remote code execution.
*   **Impact:** Varies, but could include arbitrary code execution, information disclosure, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (High to Critical).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA) (Tooling, Vector-Focused):** Use an SCA tool to identify and track Vector's dependencies and their known vulnerabilities. This is done *specifically* for Vector.
    *   **Regular Updates (Vector Updates):** Keep Vector itself up-to-date. This is the *primary* mitigation, as updates often include patched dependencies. This is *directly* related to Vector's security.
    *   **Dependency Pinning (Vector Config):** If possible, pin Vector's dependency versions to specific, known-good versions (though this can hinder security updates). This is a configuration choice *within* Vector's build/deployment process.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated/Unauthorized API Access](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticatedunauthorized_api_access.md)

* **Description:** If Vector exposes an API, attackers could access it without proper authentication or authorization.
    * **Vector Contribution:** If Vector's API feature is enabled, Vector *directly* exposes this attack surface. The vulnerability lies in the API's implementation *within* Vector.
    * **Example:** An attacker sends requests to Vector's API to modify its configuration or retrieve internal data without providing any credentials.
    * **Impact:** Configuration tampering, data exfiltration, denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Authentication (Vector Config):** Implement strong authentication mechanisms for Vector's API (e.g., API keys, JWTs, mutual TLS) *within Vector's configuration*. This is a *direct* Vector mitigation.
        *   **Authorization (Vector Config):** Implement authorization checks *within Vector's API implementation* to ensure that only authorized users can access specific API endpoints and resources. This is a *direct* Vector mitigation.
        *   **Input Validation (Vector API):** Validate all input to Vector's API to prevent injection attacks. This is part of the API's implementation *within* Vector.
        *   **Rate Limiting (Vector Config):** Implement rate limiting for Vector's API *within Vector's configuration* to prevent denial-of-service attacks. This is a *direct* Vector mitigation.
        *   **Disable if Unnecessary (Vector Config):** If Vector's API is not needed, disable it entirely *within Vector's configuration*. This is a *direct* Vector mitigation.
