# Threat Model Analysis for timberio/vector

## Threat: [Unauthorized Vector Instance Deployment](./threats/unauthorized_vector_instance_deployment.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Vector Instance Deployment

    *   **Description:** An attacker deploys a rogue Vector instance within the network, masquerading as a legitimate instance. The attacker configures their instance to listen on the same ports or use the same service discovery mechanisms as the legitimate instance, intercepting data or injecting malicious data.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data interception and theft.
        *   Injection of fabricated data into the pipeline.
        *   Disruption of legitimate data flow (DoS).
        *   Potential for lateral movement within the network.
    *   **Affected Component:** Vector's service discovery mechanisms (if used), network configuration, and any component that interacts with Vector based on its network presence (sources and sinks).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Network Segmentation.
        *   Strong Authentication (e.g., mTLS) between Vector and other components.

        *   Restrict File System Permissions.
        *   Secure Configuration Management.
        *   File Integrity Monitoring (FIM).
        *   Secrets Management (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
        *   Regular Configuration Audits.

*   **Threat:** Exploitation of Vector Source Vulnerability (e.g., `file` source)

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a specific Vector *source* component.  For example, a crafted log file could trigger a buffer overflow in the `file` source's parsing logic.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Denial of service (Vector crashes).
        *   Potential for arbitrary code execution.
        *   Data corruption.
    *   **Affected Component:** The specific *source* component being exploited (e.g., `file`, `journald`, `kafka`, `http`, `syslog`). This impacts the input handling and parsing logic of that *source*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Vector Updated.
        *   Input Validation within the source component (Vector developer responsibility).
        *   Fuzz Testing of source components.
        *   Security Audits of Vector's codebase (source components).
        *   Least Privilege for Vector's access to source data.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vector Sink Vulnerability (e.g., `http` sink)](./threats/exploitation_of_vector_sink_vulnerability__e_g____http__sink_.md)
