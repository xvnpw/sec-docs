## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation and Sanitization (using Vector Transforms)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation_and_sanitization__using_vector_transforms_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Expected Schemas:** For each data source feeding into Vector, define the precise expected data format (data types, allowed values, regular expressions, maximum lengths).
    2.  **Implement `parse_*` Transforms:** Use Vector's `parse_*` transforms (`parse_syslog`, `parse_json`, `parse_regex`, `parse_grok`, etc.) *immediately* after the source in the pipeline.  Configure these transforms to *strictly* enforce the defined schemas. Example:
        ```toml
        [sources.my_http_source]
          type = "http"
          # ... other source config ...

        [transforms.parse_json_data]
          inputs = ["my_http_source"]
          type = "parse_json"
          field = "message" # Assuming the JSON is in a field named "message"
          drop_invalid = true  # CRUCIAL: Drop data that doesn't match the schema

        [sinks.my_output]
          inputs = ["parse_json_data"]
          # ... rest of sink config ...
        ```
    3.  **Reject Non-Conforming Data:** Ensure `drop_invalid = true` (or equivalent) is set on the parsing transforms.  Alternatively, route invalid data to a dedicated error-handling pipeline (using `route` transform). *Never* attempt to "fix" invalid data within Vector.
    4.  **Length Limits (within Transforms):** Use the `limit` transform *after* parsing to enforce maximum lengths for specific fields.  This is a second layer of defense.
        ```toml
        [transforms.limit_field_length]
          inputs = ["parse_json_data"] # After parsing
          type = "limit"
          field = "username"
          max_bytes = 64 # Example limit
          drop = true
        ```
    5.  **Whitelist Characters (using `regex`):** Within `parse_regex` or a separate `remap` transform using VRL, define whitelists of allowed characters for sensitive fields using regular expressions.
    6.  **Rate Limiting (using `throttle`):** Implement rate limiting *within Vector* using the `throttle` transform. This is in *addition* to any external rate limiting.
        ```toml
        [transforms.throttle_input]
          inputs = ["my_http_source"] # Or after parsing, depending on needs
          type = "throttle"
          condition = ".timestamp > now() - duration(\"1s\")" # Example: 1 event per second
          max_events = 1
          key_fields = ["source_ip"] # Throttle based on source IP
        ```

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Injection Attacks (High Severity):** Prevents malicious code/data injection by strictly enforcing input formats.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (High Severity):** Limits the impact of large inputs and high data volumes.
    *   **Data Corruption (Medium Severity):** Ensures only valid data is processed.
    *   **Logic Errors (Medium Severity):** Reduces errors caused by unexpected input.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Injection Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low/Negligible).
    *   **Denial of Service:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Medium/Low).
    *   **Data Corruption:** Risk significantly reduced (Medium to Low).
    *   **Logic Errors:** Risk reduced (Medium to Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Likely partially implemented.  Parsing transforms are common, but strictness and `drop_invalid` are often missing.  `limit` and `throttle` are less consistently used.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Comprehensive Schema Definitions:**  Schemas are often incomplete.
    *   **`drop_invalid = true`:**  This crucial setting is frequently omitted.
    *   **Whitelist Character Enforcement:**  Often overlooked.
    *   **Consistent `throttle` Usage:**  Rate limiting within Vector is often missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Transformation Logic (using VRL and Lua Sandboxing)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_transformation_logic__using_vrl_and_lua_sandboxing_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Prefer VRL:** Use Vector Remap Language (VRL) for transformations whenever possible. VRL is inherently safer than Lua.
    2.  **Lua Sandboxing (if used):** If Lua is *absolutely necessary*:
        *   **Review Vector's Lua Documentation:** Understand the limitations of Vector's Lua sandboxing.
        *   **Restrict Libraries:**  In the `lua` transform configuration, explicitly list *only* the required Lua libraries.  Do *not* allow access to unnecessary libraries.
        *   **Disable System Calls:** Ensure the Lua script cannot make system calls.  Vector's sandboxing *should* prevent this by default, but verify.
        *   **Resource Limits (within Lua):**  If possible, set resource limits (CPU, memory) *within* the Lua script itself using Lua's debugging and resource control features. This is an advanced technique.
    3.  **Input Validation (within Transforms):**  Even within VRL or Lua transforms, *continue* to validate and sanitize data.  Do *not* assume data is safe. Use VRL's type checking and string manipulation functions.
    4.  **Avoid Dynamic Code Generation:**  *Never* generate VRL or Lua code dynamically based on untrusted input within a transform. This is a critical security risk.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Critical Severity):** Prevents arbitrary code execution through Lua vulnerabilities.
    *   **Data Leakage (High Severity):** Reduces data leaks through transform logic errors.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (High Severity):** Limits resource consumption by malicious Lua scripts.
    *   **Logic Errors (Medium Severity):** Input validation within transforms prevents errors.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution:** Risk significantly reduced (Critical to Low/Negligible).
    *   **Data Leakage:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Medium/Low).
    *   **Denial of Service:** Risk reduced (High to Medium/Low).
    *   **Logic Errors:** Risk reduced (Medium to Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   VRL is increasingly used.  Lua sandboxing is usually enabled by default, but library restrictions and resource limits within Lua are often not explicitly configured.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Strict Lua Library Restrictions:**  Often, all standard Lua libraries are accessible.
    *   **Resource Limits within Lua:**  This advanced technique is rarely implemented.
    *   **Input Validation within Transforms:**  Frequently overlooked.
    *   **Avoidance of Dynamic Code Generation:**  This critical rule may be violated.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Output Handling (Sink Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_output_handling__sink_configuration_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **TLS/SSL Encryption:**  In the `vector.toml` configuration for *each sink*, ensure TLS/SSL encryption is enabled and configured correctly.  Use the `tls` options provided by the specific sink.  Example (for an HTTP sink):
        ```toml
        [sinks.my_http_sink]
          type = "http"
          # ... other sink config ...
          inputs = ["..."]
          endpoint = "https://my-api.example.com" # Use HTTPS
          tls.verify_certificate = true # CRUCIAL: Verify the certificate
          tls.verify_hostname = true # CRUCIAL: Verify the hostname
        ```
    2.  **Authentication:**  Configure strong authentication for each sink using the sink's specific options.  Use environment variables or a secret management system to store credentials (as described earlier, but this is *configured* within the sink definition).
    3.  **Output Validation (using `remap`):**  In high-security scenarios, add a `remap` transform *before* the sink to perform a final validation of the data being sent.  This is less common but can be a valuable defense-in-depth measure.  This could involve checking for data anomalies or known malicious patterns using VRL.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Breach (Critical Severity):** Prevents unauthorized access to data in sinks.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (High Severity):** TLS/SSL with certificate verification protects data in transit.
    *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Strong authentication prevents unauthorized access to sinks.
    *   **Data Tampering (High Severity):** Output validation (if implemented) helps prevent data tampering.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Breach:** Risk significantly reduced (Critical to Low/Negligible).
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low/Negligible).
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low/Negligible).
    *   **Data Tampering:** Risk reduced (High to Medium/Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   TLS/SSL is commonly used, but `verify_certificate` and `verify_hostname` are sometimes overlooked.  Authentication is usually implemented, but credential management practices vary.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **`tls.verify_certificate = true` and `tls.verify_hostname = true`:**  These crucial TLS settings are often missed.
    *   **Output Validation (using `remap`):**  Rarely implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Monitoring and Alerting (using `internal_metrics`)](./mitigation_strategies/monitoring_and_alerting__using__internal_metrics__.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable `internal_metrics` Source:**  Add the `internal_metrics` source to your `vector.toml`:
        ```toml
        [sources.internal_metrics]
          type = "internal_metrics"
        ```
    2.  **Configure a Sink for Metrics:**  Configure a sink (e.g., Prometheus, Datadog, InfluxDB, or even a simple `file` sink for testing) to receive the metrics from the `internal_metrics` source.
    3.  **Alerting (External):**  Set up alerts *in your monitoring system* (not directly within Vector) based on key Vector metrics.  Examples:
        *   High `events_failed_total`.
        *   High `buffer_usage_ratio`.
        *   Low `events_processed_total`.
        *   High `component_errors_total` for specific components.
    4. **Enable and Configure Vector Logging:** Use the global options in `vector.toml` to configure logging:
        ```toml
        data_dir = "/var/lib/vector"  # Ensure Vector has write access to this directory

        [log]
          level = "info"  # Or "debug" for more detail, but be mindful of disk space
          format = "json" # Structured logging is recommended
        ```

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Undetected Attacks (High Severity):**  Metrics and logs help detect attacks.
    *   **Performance Degradation (Medium Severity):**  Metrics identify bottlenecks.
    *   **Configuration Errors (Medium Severity):**  Metrics and logs can reveal errors.
    *   **Data Loss (High Severity):** Monitoring buffer usage helps prevent data loss.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Undetected Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Medium/Low).
    *   **Performance Degradation:** Risk reduced (Medium to Low).
    *   **Configuration Errors:** Risk reduced (Medium to Low).
    *   **Data Loss:** Risk reduced (High to Medium/Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `internal_metrics` is often *not* enabled by default.  Basic logging is usually enabled, but the level and format may not be optimal for security monitoring.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **`internal_metrics` Source and Sink:**  This is the most significant gap.
    *   **Structured Logging (`format = "json"`):**  Often overlooked, making log analysis more difficult.
    *   **Appropriate Log Level:**  The log level may be too low (not enough detail) or too high (excessive disk usage).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limits (using Vector's Built-in Features)](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limits__using_vector's_built-in_features_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **`buffer` Configuration (Sinks):** For sinks that use buffers (e.g., `file`, `http`, `kafka`, `clickhouse`), configure the `buffer` settings *within the sink definition* in `vector.toml`.  Set appropriate `max_size` and `type` values to control memory usage.  Example:
        ```toml
        [sinks.my_buffered_sink]
          type = "file" # Example
          # ... other sink config ...
          inputs = ["..."]
          path = "/path/to/output.log"
          buffer.type = "disk" # Or "memory"
          buffer.max_size = 102400 # 100KB, adjust as needed
        ```
    2.  **`batch` Configuration (Sinks):** For sinks, configure `batch` settings (e.g., `batch.max_bytes`, `batch.timeout_secs`) to control the size and frequency of data sent to the sink. This helps prevent overwhelming the sink and can indirectly limit resource usage.
    3. **`throttle` Transform:** (Already covered in Input Validation, but it's also a resource limiting strategy). Use the `throttle` transform to limit the rate of data flow.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (High Severity):** Prevents Vector from being overwhelmed.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Controls Vector's resource consumption.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Medium/Low).
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk significantly reduced (Medium to Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `buffer` settings are sometimes configured, but often not optimized.  `batch` settings are commonly used.  `throttle` is less consistently used for resource limiting.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Optimized `buffer` Settings:**  The `max_size` may be too large or not set at all.
    *   **Strategic Use of `throttle`:**  `throttle` is often not used proactively to limit resource usage.
