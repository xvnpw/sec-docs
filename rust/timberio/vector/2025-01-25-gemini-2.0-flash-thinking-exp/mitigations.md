# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for timberio/vector

## Mitigation Strategy: [1. Secure Configuration Storage (Vector-Focused)](./mitigation_strategies/1__secure_configuration_storage__vector-focused_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Vector Configuration Storage
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize Vector's Secret Management:**  Instead of embedding sensitive credentials directly in `vector.toml` or environment variables, leverage Vector's built-in secret management features. This allows you to reference secrets from external systems or define them securely within Vector's configuration. Refer to Vector's documentation on secret management for specific configuration options (e.g., using `secrets.providers`).
    2.  **Restrict File System Access (if applicable):** If configuration files are stored locally, ensure the Vector process user has read-only access to the configuration files.  This prevents accidental or malicious modification of the configuration by the running Vector process itself, or other processes running under the same user if not properly isolated.
    3.  **Configuration Version Control:** Store Vector configuration files in a version control system (like Git). This enables tracking changes, reverting to previous configurations, and auditing modifications made to Vector's configuration over time.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exposure of Sensitive Credentials (High Severity):** Directly embedding secrets in configuration files or environment variables increases the risk of accidental exposure or unauthorized access.
    *   **Configuration Tampering (Medium Severity):**  Unauthorized modification of configuration files can lead to service disruption or security vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exposure of Sensitive Credentials:** High Reduction - Significantly reduces the risk by using dedicated secret management features designed for secure credential handling within Vector.
    *   **Configuration Tampering:** Low Reduction - Primarily relies on external file system permissions and version control, Vector's direct contribution is limited to encouraging best practices.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Configuration files are in Git. Vector's secret management features are not actively used; environment variables are still the primary method for secrets.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Implement Vector's secret management features to handle sensitive credentials for sources and sinks instead of relying solely on environment variables.
    *   Explore using a dedicated secrets provider supported by Vector for enhanced security.

## Mitigation Strategy: [2. Principle of Least Privilege for Vector Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/2__principle_of_least_privilege_for_vector_configuration.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Principle of Least Privilege for Vector Configuration Management
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Separate Configuration Roles:**  Distinguish between roles that *read* Vector configuration (e.g., for monitoring) and roles that *modify* Vector configuration (e.g., administrators).
    2.  **Control Access to Configuration Files/Repositories:**  Use access control mechanisms (like Git repository permissions or file system permissions if configurations are managed locally) to restrict write access to Vector configuration files only to authorized personnel responsible for Vector administration.
    3.  **Read-Only Access for Monitoring:** If providing access to Vector configurations for monitoring purposes, grant read-only access to the configuration files or repository to prevent accidental or unauthorized changes.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Configuration Changes (Medium Severity):**  Users with unnecessary write access could unintentionally or maliciously modify Vector configurations.
    *   **Insider Threats (Medium Severity):** Limits the potential damage from compromised or malicious internal users by restricting their ability to alter Vector configurations.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Configuration Changes:** Moderate Reduction - Reduces the risk by limiting who can modify configurations, minimizing accidental or intentional misconfigurations.
    *   **Insider Threats:** Moderate Reduction - Limits the impact of insider threats by restricting access to configuration management actions.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Informal role separation exists, but no enforced access control specifically for Vector configuration files beyond general server access.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Implement stricter access control on the repository or file system where Vector configurations are stored, specifically limiting write access to authorized administrators.
    *   Document and enforce clear roles and responsibilities for Vector configuration management.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Integrate `vector validate`:** Incorporate the `vector validate` command-line tool into your CI/CD pipeline or pre-deployment scripts.
    2.  **Automated Validation:** Run `vector validate` on every configuration change.  Configure your pipeline to fail if `vector validate` reports any errors in the configuration file.
    3.  **Pre-Production Validation:**  Always validate Vector configurations before deploying them to production environments. This step should be mandatory in your deployment process.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Configuration Errors Leading to Service Disruption (Medium Severity):** Invalid configurations can cause Vector to fail to start, crash, or misbehave, disrupting data processing.
    *   **Security Misconfigurations (Medium Severity):**  Configuration errors can inadvertently introduce security vulnerabilities by misconfiguring sources, sinks, or transforms.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Configuration Errors Leading to Service Disruption:** High Reduction - Significantly reduces the risk by proactively identifying and preventing deployment of invalid configurations.
    *   **Security Misconfigurations:** Moderate Reduction - Helps catch some security-related configuration errors, but not all.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. `vector validate` is used manually sometimes, but not consistently integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Fully integrate `vector validate` into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically validate configurations on every change.
    *   Make configuration validation a mandatory step before any Vector deployment.

## Mitigation Strategy: [4. Disable Unnecessary Vector Components](./mitigation_strategies/4__disable_unnecessary_vector_components.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Disable Unnecessary Vector Components
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Enabled Components:**  Examine your `vector.toml` or `vector.yaml` configuration and identify all configured sources, transforms, and sinks.

    3.  **Remove Unused HTTP API (if applicable):** If you are not using Vector's HTTP API for control or monitoring, explicitly disable it in the configuration to reduce the attack surface.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Increased Attack Surface (Low to Medium Severity):** Unnecessary components represent potential attack vectors if vulnerabilities are discovered in them.
    *   **Resource Consumption (Low Severity):** Unnecessary components can consume system resources unnecessarily.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Increased Attack Surface:** Moderate Reduction - Reduces the attack surface by eliminating potential entry points from unused Vector features.
    *   **Resource Consumption:** Low Reduction - Minor improvement in resource utilization.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We generally configure only needed components, but no formal review to explicitly disable unused ones.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Conduct a formal review of configured Vector components.
    *   Document the purpose of each enabled component and justify its necessity.
    *   Implement a process for regularly reviewing and pruning unnecessary components.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable HTTPS:** If you use Vector's HTTP API, ensure it is configured to use HTTPS for all communication. Configure Vector to use TLS certificates for secure connections. Refer to Vector's documentation on enabling TLS for the HTTP API.
    2.  **Implement Authentication:** Enable authentication for the HTTP API. Configure Vector to require authentication for all API requests. Explore Vector's supported authentication methods (e.g., API keys, potentially integration with external auth systems if available in Vector).
    3.  **Authorization (if applicable):** If Vector offers authorization controls for the HTTP API, implement them to restrict which users or systems can perform specific actions via the API.
    4.  **Rate Limiting (if possible via Vector or Reverse Proxy):** If Vector or a reverse proxy in front of Vector allows rate limiting for the HTTP API, configure it to prevent denial-of-service attacks.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Control Plane (High Severity):**  Unsecured HTTP API allows attackers to manipulate Vector's configuration or potentially disrupt operations.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (Medium Severity):** Without HTTPS, API communication is vulnerable to eavesdropping and manipulation.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks (Medium Severity):** Unprotected API can be targeted by DoS attacks.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Control Plane:** High Reduction - Significantly reduces the risk by preventing unauthorized access and control via the API.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** High Reduction - Eliminates the risk of eavesdropping and tampering during API communication.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks:** Moderate Reduction - Reduces the risk by limiting the impact of DoS attempts on the API.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. HTTPS is enabled. Authentication and authorization are not fully implemented. Rate limiting is not configured.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Implement authentication for the Vector HTTP API.
    *   Explore and implement authorization controls if offered by Vector for the HTTP API.
    *   Configure rate limiting for the HTTP API, either directly in Vector if supported or using a reverse proxy.

## Mitigation Strategy: [6. Authentication for Vector Data Sources and Sinks (Vector-Focused)](./mitigation_strategies/6__authentication_for_vector_data_sources_and_sinks__vector-focused_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Vector Source and Sink Authentication
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize Source/Sink Authentication Options:** For each configured Vector source and sink, leverage the available authentication options provided by Vector and the specific source/sink type. Refer to Vector's documentation for each source and sink to understand supported authentication methods (e.g., API keys, tokens, certificates, usernames/passwords).
    2.  **Configure Strong Authentication:** Configure Vector sources and sinks to use the strongest available authentication methods. Avoid default or weak credentials.
    3.  **Secure Credential Configuration:** When configuring authentication credentials in Vector, use Vector's secret management features (as described in Mitigation Strategy 1) to avoid embedding secrets directly in configuration files.
    4.  **Least Privilege Permissions (within Vector configuration):** Configure Vector sources and sinks with the minimum necessary permissions required for Vector to function correctly. For example, grant read-only access to log sources where appropriate. This is configured within Vector's source/sink configuration parameters.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access (High Severity):**  Without proper authentication in Vector's source/sink configurations, unauthorized parties could potentially access data from sources or write to sinks via Vector if misconfigured or exploited.
    *   **Data Tampering (Medium Severity):**  Compromised or misconfigured sinks could allow attackers to modify or inject data into sinks via Vector.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access:** High Reduction - Significantly reduces the risk by enforcing authentication for data flow within Vector pipelines.
    *   **Data Tampering:** Moderate Reduction - Reduces the risk of data tampering by securing access to sinks through Vector's configuration.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Authentication is used for most sources/sinks, but not consistently enforced or using Vector's secret management for credentials. Least privilege is generally considered but not rigorously configured within Vector.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Ensure all configured Vector sources and sinks utilize appropriate authentication mechanisms.
    *   Consistently use Vector's secret management features to handle credentials for source and sink authentication.
    *   Review and refine source and sink configurations to enforce least privilege access within Vector's configuration parameters.

## Mitigation Strategy: [7. Data Sanitization and Masking within Vector Pipelines](./mitigation_strategies/7__data_sanitization_and_masking_within_vector_pipelines.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Vector Data Sanitization and Masking
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Data:** Determine which data fields processed by Vector contain sensitive information (PII, secrets, etc.).
    2.  **Implement Vector Transforms:** Utilize Vector's transformation capabilities to sanitize or mask sensitive data fields *within the Vector pipeline*. Use transforms like `mask`, `regex_replace`, `json_decode`/`json_encode` with filtering, or custom Lua transforms to redact, anonymize, or hash sensitive data before it reaches sinks.
    3.  **Define Sanitization Rules:**  Clearly define and document data sanitization rules for each sensitive data field.
    4.  **Test Sanitization:** Thoroughly test data sanitization transforms to ensure they are effective and do not inadvertently expose sensitive information or break data integrity.
