# Attack Surface Analysis for timberio/vector

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Configuration Files](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_configuration_files.md)

*   **Description:** Vector configuration files (TOML, YAML) containing sensitive information are accessible to unauthorized users due to improper file system permissions.
*   **Vector Contribution:** Vector relies on configuration files to define its behavior, including credentials and sensitive settings. Improperly secured files directly expose Vector's configuration and secrets.
*   **Example:** A publicly readable `vector.toml` file contains API keys for a sink, allowing an attacker to extract these keys and potentially compromise downstream systems.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, potential data exfiltration, unauthorized access to downstream systems, denial of service through configuration modification.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Restrict File Permissions:** Implement strict file permissions (e.g., `chmod 600`) to ensure configuration files are readable only by the Vector process user and authorized administrators.
    *   **External Secret Management:** Utilize environment variables or dedicated secret management solutions to avoid storing sensitive secrets directly within configuration files whenever feasible.

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected Remote Configuration Management APIs](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_remote_configuration_management_apis.md)

*   **Description:** Vector's API for remote configuration and management is exposed without proper authentication or authorization.
*   **Vector Contribution:** Vector offers an optional API component for remote management. Enabling this API without proper security directly creates a critical access point to Vector's configuration and operation.
*   **Example:** The Vector API is enabled without authentication on a publicly accessible network. An attacker uses the API to reconfigure Vector to drop logs or redirect metrics to a malicious sink.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized configuration changes, data redirection, denial of service, potential complete control over Vector's data pipeline and operation.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory Authentication and Authorization:**  If using the API, enforce strong authentication (e.g., API keys, TLS client certificates) and implement granular authorization to restrict API access to only authorized users and systems.
    *   **Network Isolation:**  Restrict network access to the API port using firewalls or network segmentation to limit exposure to trusted networks only.
    *   **Disable API by Default:**  Disable the API component if remote management is not strictly necessary to minimize the attack surface.

## Attack Surface: [Source Input Injection (Vector's Lack of Sanitization)](./attack_surfaces/source_input_injection__vector's_lack_of_sanitization_.md)

*   **Description:** Vector ingests data from various sources and if it doesn't sanitize input, malicious or crafted data can be injected and processed, potentially causing harm in downstream systems.
*   **Vector Contribution:** Vector acts as a central data ingestion point. If Vector itself doesn't implement input sanitization, it propagates potentially malicious data downstream, increasing the attack surface of the entire observability pipeline.
*   **Example:** An attacker injects specially crafted log messages into a system monitored by Vector. Vector forwards these logs to a database sink without sanitization. The malicious log data exploits a SQL injection vulnerability in the database application.
*   **Impact:** SQL injection, command injection, or other injection vulnerabilities in downstream systems that process data from Vector, leading to data breaches or system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement Input Sanitization in VRL:** Utilize Vector Remap Language (VRL) transforms to sanitize and validate input data from sources before it is processed further and sent to sinks. Focus on escaping or removing potentially harmful characters or patterns.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Sinks:** Configure downstream systems (sinks) with the principle of least privilege to limit the impact of potential injection attacks originating from unsanitized data passed by Vector.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service via Source Overload (Vector Vulnerability)](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service_via_source_overload__vector_vulnerability_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker floods Vector sources with excessive data, exploiting Vector's processing limitations and causing a denial of service.
*   **Vector Contribution:** Vector, as a data pipeline, can become a bottleneck if overwhelmed with data.  Its susceptibility to overload directly impacts the availability of the observability pipeline.
*   **Example:** An attacker floods a Vector TCP source with a massive volume of connection requests and data, exceeding Vector's connection limits and processing capacity, causing it to become unresponsive and stop processing legitimate data.
*   **Impact:** Disruption of observability pipelines, loss of critical monitoring data, potential cascading failures in dependent systems relying on Vector's data.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rate Limiting and Throttling:** Implement rate limiting and throttling mechanisms at the source level (if supported) or within Vector using transforms or dedicated components to control the volume of incoming data.
    *   **Resource Limits and Monitoring:** Configure resource limits for Vector (CPU, memory) and implement monitoring and alerting to detect resource exhaustion and potential DoS attacks.
    *   **Network Security Controls:** Employ firewalls and intrusion prevention systems to filter malicious traffic and mitigate volumetric DoS attacks before they reach Vector.

## Attack Surface: [Sink Misconfiguration and Data Exfiltration](./attack_surfaces/sink_misconfiguration_and_data_exfiltration.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrectly configured Vector sinks unintentionally send sensitive data to unauthorized or insecure destinations.
*   **Vector Contribution:** Vector's role in routing data to various sinks makes misconfiguration a direct path for data leakage. Incorrect sink configurations within Vector directly lead to unintended data flow.
*   **Example:** A misconfigured Vector sink sends production logs containing PII to a publicly accessible cloud storage bucket instead of a secure, private storage location, resulting in a data breach.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, exposure of sensitive information, compliance violations, reputational damage.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rigorous Configuration Review:** Implement a mandatory and thorough review process for all Vector configurations, especially sink configurations, to ensure data is routed only to authorized and secure destinations.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Sink Credentials:**  Utilize dedicated service accounts with minimal necessary permissions for Vector sinks to limit the scope of potential damage if sink credentials are compromised or misconfigured.
    *   **Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Measures:** Consider implementing DLP tools to monitor data flow through Vector and detect and prevent accidental or malicious data exfiltration via misconfigured sinks.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Vector relies on third-party libraries and dependencies that may contain known security vulnerabilities.
*   **Vector Contribution:** Vector's security posture is directly dependent on the security of its dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can directly compromise Vector itself.
*   **Example:** A critical vulnerability is discovered in a widely used library that Vector depends on. If Vector is not updated promptly, deployments become vulnerable to exploits targeting this dependency vulnerability, potentially leading to remote code execution on Vector hosts.
*   **Impact:** Compromise of Vector process, potential data breaches, denial of service, unauthorized access to the host system, supply chain attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Automated Dependency Scanning:** Implement automated dependency scanning tools to regularly check Vector's dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Prompt Updates and Patching:**  Establish a process for promptly updating Vector to the latest versions to benefit from security patches and dependency updates. Subscribe to Vector security advisories and release notes.
    *   **Dependency Management and Review:**  Maintain a clear inventory of Vector's dependencies and regularly review dependency updates for potential security implications before upgrading. Consider using dependency pinning to ensure consistent and controlled updates.
