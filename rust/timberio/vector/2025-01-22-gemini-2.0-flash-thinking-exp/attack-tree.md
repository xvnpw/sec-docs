## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Application via Vector [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__compromise_application_via_vector__critical_node_.md)

*   This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success here means the attacker has achieved some level of control or negative impact on the application that utilizes Vector.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Vector Configuration Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_vector_configuration_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Configuration Injection:**
        *   **Environment Variable Injection:** Injecting malicious environment variables during Vector's deployment or startup. This can be achieved if the attacker can influence the environment where Vector is launched (e.g., container orchestration misconfiguration, compromised CI/CD pipeline).
        *   **Configuration File Injection/Tampering:**
            *   **Mount malicious configuration file into Vector container:** Replacing the legitimate Vector configuration file with a malicious one by exploiting container volume mount misconfigurations.
    *   **Unencrypted Communication Configuration:** Configuring Vector to send data over unencrypted channels like HTTP or plain TCP. This allows eavesdropping on sensitive data in transit.
    *   **Misconfiguration Exploitation:**
        *   **Insecure Source Configuration:**
            *   **Expose sensitive data via improperly configured sources:** Configuring Vector sources to read from locations containing sensitive data that should not be processed or exposed (e.g., reading application logs containing secrets).
        *   **Insecure Sink Configuration:**
            *   **Exfiltrate data to attacker-controlled sink:**  Misconfiguring Vector sinks to send data to a destination controlled by the attacker (e.g., an attacker's HTTP endpoint or cloud storage bucket).

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Misconfiguration Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__misconfiguration_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

*   This node is a sub-category of Configuration Vulnerabilities, specifically focusing on the exploitation of configuration errors.
*   **Attack Vectors:** (Already detailed under "Exploit Vector Configuration Vulnerabilities - Misconfiguration Exploitation" above)
    *   Insecure Source Configuration (Exposing Sensitive Data)
    *   Insecure Sink Configuration (Exfiltrate data to attacker-controlled sink)

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Vector Input/Source Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_vector_inputsource_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Source Injection Attacks:**
        *   **Log Injection:** Injecting malicious payloads into logs that are ingested by Vector. This can exploit vulnerabilities in downstream systems that process the logs or even Vector itself if it improperly handles the injected data.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Vector Process/Binary Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_vector_processbinary_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Known Vector Software Vulnerabilities:**
        *   **Exploit publicly disclosed CVEs in Vector:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in the specific version of Vector being used. This requires the attacker to identify the Vector version and find or develop exploits for known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Vector Deployment Environment [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_vector_deployment_environment__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Misconfigured container security settings allowing escape:** Exploiting misconfigurations in container security settings (e.g., privileged containers, insecure capabilities) to escape the Vector container and gain access to the host system.
    *   **Host System Compromise:**
        *   **Weak host system security configurations:** Exploiting general weaknesses in the host system's security configuration where Vector is running (e.g., weak passwords, open ports, unpatched OS vulnerabilities).

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Weak Access Control/Permissions [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_weak_access_controlpermissions__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Insufficient Access Control to Vector Configuration:**
        *   **Unauthorized access to configuration files:** Gaining unauthorized access to Vector's configuration files (e.g., `vector.toml`, `vector.yaml`) due to weak file system permissions or lack of access control mechanisms.
    *   **Weak Permissions on Vector Process/Files:**
        *   **Excessive permissions for Vector process:** Vector process running with overly broad permissions (e.g., running as root in a container). This increases the potential damage if Vector itself is compromised.
