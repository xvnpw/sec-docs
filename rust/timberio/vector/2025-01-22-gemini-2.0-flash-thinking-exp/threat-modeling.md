# Threat Model Analysis for timberio/vector

## Threat: [Configuration Injection/Manipulation](./threats/configuration_injectionmanipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in Vector's configuration loading mechanism. By injecting malicious configuration snippets through untrusted sources (e.g., if Vector dynamically loads configuration from an external API without proper validation), they can alter Vector's behavior. This could involve redirecting data to attacker-controlled sinks, manipulating data via transforms, or potentially achieving code execution within the Vector process if the injection method allows for it.
*   **Impact:** Service disruption of the data pipeline, data manipulation (altering or deleting data in transit), unauthorized access to downstream systems by redirecting data flow, potential for remote code execution within Vector.
*   **Affected Component:** Configuration Loading Mechanism, potentially Transforms (if dynamically configurable).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement rigorous validation and sanitization for any external input used to generate or modify Vector configurations.
    *   **Avoid Dynamic Configuration from Untrusted Sources:** Minimize or eliminate dynamic configuration loading from external, untrusted sources. Prefer static configuration files managed securely.
    *   **Configuration Schema Validation:** Enforce schema validation for Vector configuration files to prevent injection of unexpected or malicious structures.
    *   **Version Control and Code Review:** Use version control for configuration files and implement code review processes for all configuration changes.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the Vector process with minimal necessary privileges to limit the impact of potential code execution vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Misconfigured Sinks](./threats/misconfigured_sinks.md)

*   **Description:** Operators incorrectly configure Vector sinks, leading to data being sent to unintended and potentially insecure destinations. For example, a sink meant for a private database might be misconfigured to send data to a public cloud storage bucket without proper access controls, or to an external, attacker-controlled endpoint.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches and confidentiality loss due to data being exposed to unauthorized parties, compliance violations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) if sensitive data is leaked, reputational damage.
*   **Affected Component:** Sinks, Sink Configuration within Vector.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Thorough Testing and Validation:** Rigorously test and validate all sink configurations in non-production environments before deploying to production.
    *   **Automated Configuration Checks:** Implement automated configuration checks and validation processes to detect misconfigurations before deployment.
    *   **Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC):** Manage Vector configurations using IaC to enforce consistent, validated, and auditable configurations.
    *   **Regular Configuration Audits:** Periodically review and audit sink configurations to ensure they remain correct and secure over time.
    *   **Monitoring for Unexpected Egress:** Implement monitoring and alerting for unusual data egress patterns that might indicate misconfigured sinks.

## Threat: [Insufficient Access Control to Configuration Management](./threats/insufficient_access_control_to_configuration_management.md)

*   **Description:** Lack of proper access controls for Vector's configuration files or any exposed management interfaces allows unauthorized users (both internal and external attackers) to modify Vector's behavior. This could involve changing sinks, transforms, or sources, leading to data redirection, manipulation, or service disruption.
*   **Impact:** Data leaks due to redirection of data flow, service disruption by altering pipeline configuration, data manipulation by modifying transforms, unauthorized monitoring of data flow.
*   **Affected Component:** Configuration Files, Management Interfaces (if exposed by Vector), Vector's Access Control mechanisms (or lack thereof).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement RBAC for access to Vector configuration files and any management interfaces, if provided by Vector or the deployment environment.
    *   **Restrict Configuration Access:** Limit access to Vector configuration files and management tools to only authorized administrators and processes.
    *   **Regular Access Audits:** Regularly audit access logs related to configuration files and management interfaces to detect and investigate unauthorized access attempts.
    *   **Secure Management Interfaces:** If Vector exposes management interfaces, ensure they are properly secured with authentication and authorization mechanisms. Disable unnecessary interfaces.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Transforms](./threats/vulnerable_transforms.md)

*   **Description:** Custom or community-provided Vector transforms might contain security vulnerabilities such as code injection flaws, buffer overflows, or logic errors. If an attacker can control the input data processed by a vulnerable transform or manipulate the transform's configuration, they could exploit these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code within the Vector process, manipulate data in transit, or cause service disruption.
*   **Impact:** Code execution within the Vector process, data manipulation during transformation, service disruption of the data pipeline, potential for privilege escalation if vulnerabilities allow escaping the transform's execution environment.
*   **Affected Component:** Transforms (especially custom or community-provided ones), Vector's Transform Execution Environment.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Security Review of Custom Transforms:** Conduct thorough security reviews and testing of all custom transforms before deployment.
    *   **Trusted Community Transforms:** Use well-vetted and trusted community transforms from reputable sources.
    *   **Input Validation in Transforms:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization within transforms to prevent injection attacks and handle unexpected data gracefully.
    *   **Transform Sandboxing/Isolation:** Consider sandboxing or isolating the execution environment of transforms to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Vector and transforms updated to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Insecure Configuration Storage](./threats/insecure_configuration_storage.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information, such as credentials for sinks (databases, APIs, cloud storage), API keys, and encryption keys, is stored in plain text within Vector configuration files. An attacker gaining access to these files (e.g., through file system access, configuration management system vulnerability) can read this sensitive data.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, unauthorized access to downstream systems and services using compromised credentials, data exfiltration, potential for further attacks leveraging compromised credentials.
*   **Affected Component:** Configuration Files, potentially Secrets Management integrations (if poorly configured within Vector).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Environment Variables for Secrets:** Utilize environment variables to inject sensitive configuration values instead of hardcoding them in configuration files.
    *   **Dedicated Secrets Management:** Employ dedicated secrets management solutions (like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) to securely store and retrieve sensitive credentials for Vector.
    *   **Configuration Encryption at Rest:** If configuration files must contain sensitive information, encrypt them at rest using appropriate encryption mechanisms.
    *   **Strict Access Control to Configuration:** Implement strict access control to Vector configuration files and directories, limiting access to only authorized personnel and processes.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation within Vector Process](./threats/privilege_escalation_within_vector_process.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities within Vector itself or its configuration could be exploited by an attacker who has already compromised the Vector process (e.g., through a vulnerable transform) to escalate their privileges on the system where Vector is running. This could lead to gaining root or administrator level access.
*   **Impact:** Full system compromise, data exfiltration, lateral movement within the infrastructure, complete loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the affected system.
*   **Affected Component:** Vector Core Application, Operating System Context, Vector Process Security.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Deploy and run Vector with the principle of least privilege. Run the Vector process as a dedicated, non-privileged user with minimal necessary permissions.
    *   **Regular Updates and Patching:** Keep Vector updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities that could be exploited for privilege escalation.
    *   **System Hardening:** Implement security hardening measures for the system running Vector, such as disabling unnecessary services, applying OS security patches, and using security tools like SELinux or AppArmor.
    *   **Process Monitoring:** Monitor Vector process activity for suspicious behavior that might indicate a privilege escalation attempt.
