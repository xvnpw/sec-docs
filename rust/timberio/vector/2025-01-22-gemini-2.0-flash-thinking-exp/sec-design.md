This design document provides a detailed overview of Vector's architecture, components, data flow, deployment models, and security considerations. It is intended to serve as a foundation for threat modeling and security analysis of Vector deployments.

## 2. System Architecture

Vector's architecture is centered around a pipeline model, where observability data progresses through distinct stages: **Sources**, **Transforms**, and **Sinks**, all orchestrated by a central **Control Plane**.

### 2.1. Components

*   **Sources:** The entry points for data ingestion into Vector.
    *   **Functionality:** Sources are responsible for:
        *   Establishing connections to various data origins.

*   **Sinks:** The exit points for processed data from Vector, delivering events to external destinations.
    *   **Functionality:** Sinks are responsible for:
        *   Establishing connections to destination systems.
        *   Serializing and formatting events according to the destination's requirements.
        *   Transmitting events to the destination.
        *   Handling sink-specific authentication and authorization.
        *   Implementing buffering and retry mechanisms for reliable delivery.
        *   Managing connection pooling and error handling for data delivery.

        *   **Pipeline Orchestration:** Initializes, starts, stops, and manages the data flow between sources, transforms, and sinks. Ensures proper sequencing and error handling within the pipeline.
        *   **Health Checks and Monitoring:** Performs internal health checks on Vector components and the overall pipeline. Exposes health status via HTTP endpoints and internal metrics.
        *   **Metrics Collection and Exposure:** Gathers internal metrics related to Vector's performance, resource utilization (CPU, memory, network), and pipeline throughput. Exposes these metrics in Prometheus format for monitoring and alerting.
        *   **Logging and Error Reporting:** Generates logs for Vector's internal operations, including startup, shutdown, configuration changes, errors, and warnings. Provides detailed logging for debugging and auditing purposes.
        *   **Signal Handling:** Manages system signals (e.g., SIGTERM, SIGINT, SIGHUP) for graceful shutdown and configuration reloading.

### 2.2. Data Flow

Data within Vector flows unidirectionally through the pipeline in an asynchronous, event-driven manner:

1.  **Data Ingestion (Sources):** Sources actively ingest data from configured external systems based on their specific mechanisms (e.g., polling files, listening on network ports, subscribing to message queues).
2.  **Event Creation and Internal Representation:** Sources parse and structure the raw ingested data into Vector's internal event format. This format provides a consistent representation for data processing throughout the pipeline.
3.  **Transformation Pipeline (Transforms):** Events are sequentially passed through the configured transforms. Each transform applies its defined logic to modify, filter, or enrich the events. Transforms operate in memory and do not persist data themselves.
4.  **Routing and Fan-out:** After transformations, events are routed to one or more sinks based on the pipeline configuration. Vector supports fan-out, allowing events to be sent to multiple destinations simultaneously.
5.  **Data Delivery (Sinks):** Sinks serialize and format events according to the requirements of their respective destinations and deliver them. Sinks handle connection management, buffering, retries, and error handling to ensure reliable data delivery.

Vector utilizes internal asynchronous channels and buffering mechanisms to manage data flow, handle backpressure, and ensure efficient resource utilization. This architecture allows Vector to handle high volumes of data with low latency and minimal resource overhead.

### 2.3. Configuration

Vector's behavior is defined through a declarative TOML configuration file. This file specifies:

*   **`sources` Section:** Defines each data source instance, including:
    *   `type`: The type of source (e.g., `file`, `http`, `kafka`).
    *   `inputs`: Source-specific configuration parameters (e.g., file paths, listening addresses, Kafka brokers).
    *   `decoding`: Optional data decoding settings (e.g., character encoding).
    *   `rate_limits`: Configuration for rate limiting data ingestion from the source.
    *   `authentication` and `authorization`: Credentials and settings for secure access to the data source.
*   **`transforms` Section:** Defines a sequence of data transformations to be applied, including:
    *   `type`: The type of transform (e.g., `filter`, `remap`, `aggregate`).
    *   `inputs`: Specifies which sources or previous transforms provide input to this transform.
    *   `parameters`: Transform-specific configuration parameters (e.g., filter expressions, VRL code, aggregation settings).
*   **`sinks` Section:** Defines each data destination, including:
    *   `type`: The type of sink (e.g., `loki`, `elasticsearch`, `http`).
    *   `inputs`: Specifies which sources or transforms provide input to this sink.
    *   `encoding`: Data encoding settings for the sink (e.g., JSON, protobuf).
    *   `address` or `endpoints`: Destination-specific connection details (e.g., server addresses, API endpoints).
    *   `authentication` and `authorization`: Credentials and settings for secure access to the data sink.
    *   `buffering`: Configuration for sink-side buffering and retry mechanisms.
    *   `request_limits`: Configuration for rate limiting requests to the sink.
*   **`global` Section:** Defines global settings for the Vector instance, such as:
    *   `data_dir`: Directory for persistent data (e.g., on-disk buffers).
    *   `api`: Configuration for Vector's internal API (e.g., health check endpoint).
    *   `logs`: Configuration for Vector's internal logging (e.g., log level, output format).
    *   `telemetry`: Configuration for internal metrics exposure (e.g., Prometheus endpoint).

Configuration changes can be applied dynamically by reloading the configuration file, allowing for runtime adjustments to the data pipeline without requiring a full restart of Vector.

## 3. Deployment Model

Vector's flexible architecture supports various deployment models, catering to different use cases and scaling requirements:

*   **Agent (Forwarder):** Deployed as a lightweight agent on individual hosts, virtual machines, containers, or edge devices.
    *   **Use Case:** Collecting local logs, metrics, and traces from the host or application. Typically forwards data to a central aggregator or observability backend.
    *   **Characteristics:** Resource-efficient, focused on data collection and initial processing. Often deployed per host or application instance.
*   **Aggregator (Central Collector):** Deployed as a centralized collector to receive data from multiple Vector agents or other sources.
    *   **Use Case:** Centralizing data ingestion, performing more complex transformations, and routing data to multiple destinations. Can act as a buffer and load balancer for downstream systems.
    *   **Characteristics:** Higher resource requirements than agents, designed for handling aggregated data streams. May perform more intensive transformations and routing logic.
*   **Standalone:** Deployed as a single, self-contained instance that handles all stages of the pipeline, from ingestion to delivery.
    *   **Use Case:** Smaller deployments, testing environments, or specific use cases where a distributed architecture is not required.
    *   **Characteristics:** Simpler deployment model, suitable for less demanding workloads. Can be scaled vertically by increasing resources.
*   **Distributed Deployment (Horizontally Scaled Aggregators):**  For high-scale environments, Vector aggregators can be deployed horizontally behind a load balancer.
    *   **Use Case:** Handling massive data volumes, achieving high availability and fault tolerance.
    *   **Characteristics:** Requires more complex configuration management and coordination. Load balancing distributes traffic across multiple aggregator instances. Configuration consistency across instances is crucial. Considerations for state management and data partitioning may arise depending on the specific use case and sinks.  While Vector itself isn't inherently a distributed system with built-in coordination, deploying multiple instances behind a load balancer provides horizontal scalability and redundancy.

**Deployment Environments:**

Vector is designed to operate across diverse environments:

*   **Cloud Platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure):**  Seamlessly deployable on cloud infrastructure using virtual machines (EC2, Compute Engine, Azure VMs), container orchestration platforms (Kubernetes, ECS, GKE, AKS), and serverless functions (though less common for full pipeline due to potential state management complexities).
*   **On-Premise Data Centers:**  Deployable on physical servers, virtualized environments (VMware, Hyper-V), and on-premise Kubernetes clusters.
*   **Edge Computing Environments:**  Suitable for deployment on edge devices, gateways, and IoT infrastructure for local data processing, filtering, and forwarding before sending data to the cloud or central data centers.

## 4. Key Features Relevant to Security

Vector incorporates several features and considerations relevant to security, which are crucial for threat modeling:

*   **Data Buffering and Persistence:** Vector's buffering mechanisms (in-memory and optional on-disk persistence) enhance data reliability but introduce security considerations for persisted data.
    *   **Security Implication:** Data persisted to disk (using `data_dir`) may contain sensitive information. Encryption at rest for the `data_dir` should be considered, especially in environments with strict data privacy requirements. Access control to the `data_dir` is also critical.
*   **TLS/SSL Encryption:** Vector supports TLS/SSL encryption for secure communication with sources and sinks that utilize these protocols (e.g., `http`, `kafka`, `redis`, cloud provider APIs).
    *   **Security Benefit:** Protects data in transit from eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. Configuration of TLS/SSL certificates and key management are important security aspects.
*   **Authentication and Authorization:** Many sources and sinks support authentication mechanisms (API keys, username/password, certificates, OAuth, IAM roles). Vector can be configured to leverage these mechanisms.
    *   **Security Benefit:** Restricts access to data sources and destinations to authorized entities. Secure storage and management of credentials within Vector's configuration are paramount. Principle of least privilege should be applied when configuring access permissions.
*   **Data Masking and Redaction (via `remap` transform):** The `remap` transform with VRL provides powerful capabilities for masking, redacting, or anonymizing sensitive data within events before they reach sinks.
    *   **Security Benefit:** Helps protect sensitive information (PII, secrets, etc.) and comply with data privacy regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.).  Careful design and testing of VRL-based masking rules are essential to ensure effectiveness and avoid unintended data leakage.
*   **Rate Limiting and Backpressure Handling:** Vector's rate limiting and backpressure mechanisms contribute to system stability and resilience against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
    *   **Security Benefit:** Prevents resource exhaustion and service disruption caused by excessive data ingestion or sink overload. Can mitigate certain types of DoS attacks targeting Vector itself or downstream systems.
*   **Configuration Security:** Vector's TOML configuration files are critical security assets.
    *   **Security Implication:** Configuration files may contain sensitive credentials, API keys, and connection strings. Secure storage, access control, and version control of configuration files are essential. Secrets management solutions should be considered for storing and injecting sensitive configuration values.
*   **Observability and Auditing (Internal Metrics and Logs):** Vector's internal metrics and logs provide valuable insights for monitoring, troubleshooting, and security auditing.
    *   **Security Benefit:** Logs can be used to detect suspicious activities, configuration changes, errors, and performance anomalies. Metrics can help identify resource utilization patterns and potential security incidents. Secure storage and analysis of Vector's logs are important for security monitoring and incident response.
*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** While Vector relies on individual source and transform components to handle input validation, the overall pipeline design should consider input validation at source level and sanitization at transform level to prevent injection attacks and data corruption.
    *   **Security Best Practice:** Implement robust input validation in sources to reject malformed or malicious data early in the pipeline. Use transforms (e.g., `remap` with VRL) to sanitize and normalize data to prevent injection vulnerabilities in downstream sinks or processing stages.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** When configuring Vector, adhere to the principle of least privilege. Grant only necessary permissions to Vector processes, configuration files, data directories, and external systems (sources and sinks). Run Vector processes with non-root user accounts whenever possible.
