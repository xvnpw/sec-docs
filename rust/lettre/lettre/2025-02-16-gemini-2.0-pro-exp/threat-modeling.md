# Threat Model Analysis for lettre/lettre

## Threat: [Unencrypted SMTP Connection (Tampering, Information Disclosure)](./threats/unencrypted_smtp_connection__tampering__information_disclosure_.md)

*   **Description:** The application connects to the SMTP server without using TLS/SSL encryption.  An attacker on the network path (e.g., a compromised Wi-Fi network) can intercept the communication, read the email content (including credentials if sent in plain text), and potentially modify the email in transit. This directly relates to how `lettre` is configured to connect.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive information (email content, potentially SMTP credentials), man-in-the-middle attacks, email modification.
    *   **Lettre Component Affected:** `transport::smtp::SmtpTransport`, specifically the configuration of `TlsParameters`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enforce TLS:**  Use `SmtpTransport::builder_dangerous()` (or the non-dangerous builder if possible) with a `TlsParameters` configuration that *requires* TLS (e.g., `Tls::Required`).  Do *not* use `Tls::None` or `Tls::Opportunistic` in production.
        *   **Certificate Verification:**  Verify the SMTP server's certificate to ensure it's valid and issued by a trusted certificate authority.  Avoid self-signed certificates in production.
        *   **Strong Ciphers:** Configure `TlsParameters` to use strong, modern cipher suites.

## Threat: [SMTP Credential Exposure (Information Disclosure)](./threats/smtp_credential_exposure__information_disclosure_.md)

*   **Description:** If `lettre`'s debug logging is enabled at too verbose a level in a production environment, or if logs are mishandled, SMTP credentials (username and password) could be exposed. This is a direct risk related to how `lettre`'s logging is used.
    *   **Impact:**  Compromise of the SMTP account, unauthorized email sending, spam, phishing.
    *   **Lettre Component Affected:** `transport::smtp::SmtpTransport`, specifically the authentication mechanism and logging configuration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Disable Debug Logging in Production:**  Use appropriate logging levels (e.g., `info`, `warn`, `error`) for production.  Never enable `debug` or `trace` logging in production.
        *   **Log Redaction:**  If logging is necessary, carefully redact any sensitive information (passwords, API keys) from log files.
        *   **Secure Log Storage:**  Store logs securely and restrict access to authorized personnel.
        *   **Use Environment Variables:** Store SMTP credentials in environment variables, *not* directly in the code.

## Threat: [Vulnerability in Lettre Dependency (Elevation of Privilege, Denial of Service, Information Disclosure)](./threats/vulnerability_in_lettre_dependency__elevation_of_privilege__denial_of_service__information_disclosur_54b22026.md)

* **Description:** A vulnerability exists in one of Lettre's dependencies (e.g., a TLS library, an email parsing library). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to compromise the application. While not *directly* a `lettre` vulnerability, it's a direct consequence of using `lettre`.
    * **Impact:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, but could include arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.
    * **Lettre Component Affected:** Potentially any, depending on the vulnerable dependency.
    * **Risk Severity:** Potentially Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Keep Dependencies Updated:** Regularly update `lettre` and all of its dependencies to the latest versions using `cargo update`.
        * **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use a vulnerability scanner (e.g., `cargo audit`) to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
        * **Dependency Pinning (with caution):** Consider pinning dependencies to specific versions to prevent unexpected updates, but be sure to regularly review and update these pinned versions to address security vulnerabilities.
