## Attack Tree Path: [1. Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion:](./attack_tree_paths/1__denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Large Email Attack
    *   **Description:** An attacker sends an email with excessively large attachments, an extremely long body, or a large number of recipients, aiming to consume server resources (memory, CPU, disk space, network bandwidth) and prevent the application from processing legitimate requests. `lettre` itself doesn't impose size limits, so the application is responsible for enforcing them.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Low
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Implement strict limits on email size (headers, body, attachments) *before* passing data to `lettre`.
        *   Use a streaming approach for attachments to avoid loading them entirely into memory.
        *   Employ a rate-limiting mechanism to prevent an attacker from sending a flood of emails.
        *   Use a dedicated email processing queue to avoid blocking the main application thread.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Information Disclosure/Exfiltration via Header Injection:](./attack_tree_paths/2__information_disclosureexfiltration_via_header_injection.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Inject CRLF Sequences
    *   **Description:** The attacker injects Carriage Return (CR) and Line Feed (LF) characters (`\r\n`) into email header fields. This can manipulate the SMTP protocol, allowing the attacker to inject additional headers, potentially modify the email body, or even send separate emails. This can lead to email spoofing, bypassing security filters, or leaking sensitive information.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (if input validation is good, but medium if not)
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   *Strictly* sanitize and validate *all* user-provided input used to construct email headers. This is the most crucial defense.
        *   Use a dedicated library for header sanitization, if available.
        *   Encode header values appropriately to prevent CRLF injection.
        *   Implement a whitelist of allowed headers and reject emails with unexpected headers.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Dependency Vulnerability:](./attack_tree_paths/3__remote_code_execution__rce__via_dependency_vulnerability.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Known CVE in Dependency
    *   **Description:** A vulnerability with a published Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier exists in one of `lettre`'s dependencies. The attacker leverages this known vulnerability, often using publicly available exploit code, to gain remote code execution on the server. This is a very common and dangerous attack vector.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Low-Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Low-Medium
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   *Regularly* update `lettre` and *all* of its dependencies to the latest versions. This is the primary defense.
        *   Use a dependency vulnerability scanner (e.g., `cargo audit`, `dependabot`, `snyk`) to automatically identify and report known vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement a robust patching process to quickly apply security updates.
        *   Monitor security advisories and mailing lists for `lettre` and its dependencies.
