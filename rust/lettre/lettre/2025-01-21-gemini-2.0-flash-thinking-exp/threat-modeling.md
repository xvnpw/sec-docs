# Threat Model Analysis for lettre/lettre

## Threat: [Insecure Lettre Transport Configuration due to SMTP Server Misconfiguration](./threats/insecure_lettre_transport_configuration_due_to_smtp_server_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** If the application configures `lettre`'s `Transport` to connect to an insecure or misconfigured SMTP server, it directly undermines the security of email sending through `lettre`. For example, configuring `lettre` to connect to an SMTP server that allows unencrypted connections or weak authentication mechanisms exposes email communications and credentials. An attacker could intercept email content or compromise credentials during transmission.
*   **Impact:** Eavesdropping on email communications, man-in-the-middle attacks, credential compromise, unauthorized access to email accounts, potential for further attacks leveraging compromised credentials or intercepted information.
*   **Lettre Component Affected:** `Transport` configuration within the application using `lettre` (specifically how connection security and authentication are set up when creating a `Transport`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always configure `lettre`'s `Transport` to enforce TLS/SSL encryption for SMTP connections using `Transport::starttls` or `Transport::ssl`.
    *   Utilize strong authentication mechanisms supported by both the SMTP server and `lettre` (e.g., CRAM-MD5, DIGEST-MD5, or OAuth2 where applicable) when configuring `lettre`'s `Transport`.
    *   Ensure the underlying SMTP server is also securely configured to enforce TLS/SSL and strong authentication, and does not allow insecure fallback options when used with `lettre`.

## Threat: [Insecure Credential Provision to Lettre Transport](./threats/insecure_credential_provision_to_lettre_transport.md)

*   **Description:** If SMTP credentials (username, password, API keys) are hardcoded or insecurely provided to `lettre` when creating a `Transport`, it directly compromises the security of email sending via `lettre`. An attacker gaining access to the application's codebase or configuration could easily extract these credentials and misuse them to send unauthorized emails or access the associated email account.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized email sending, spam, phishing attacks originating from the application's email account, reputational damage, potential full compromise of the email account and any associated services if the credentials are reused.
*   **Lettre Component Affected:** `Transport` creation and credential handling within the application using `lettre` (specifically how authentication information is passed to `lettre`'s `Transport` constructors or methods).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Never hardcode SMTP credentials directly in the application code when configuring `lettre`.
    *   Utilize secure methods for providing credentials to `lettre`'s `Transport`, such as retrieving them from environment variables, secure secrets management systems (like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault), or encrypted configuration files.
    *   Ensure that the process of retrieving and providing credentials to `lettre` is secure and follows least privilege principles.

## Threat: [Lettre Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/lettre_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** `lettre` relies on external Rust crates as dependencies. If critical security vulnerabilities are discovered in any of these dependencies, and these vulnerabilities are exploitable in the context of `lettre`'s functionality, applications using `lettre` could be directly affected. An attacker could potentially exploit these vulnerabilities to cause denial of service, information disclosure, or in severe cases, remote code execution within the application using `lettre`.
*   **Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the nature of the dependency vulnerability, potentially including denial of service, information disclosure, data corruption, or remote code execution within applications using `lettre`.
*   **Lettre Component Affected:** Indirectly affects all of `lettre` as the security and stability of `lettre` is dependent on the security of its dependencies.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Proactively monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for `lettre` and all its dependencies.
    *   Implement a process for regularly updating `lettre` and its dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities promptly.
    *   Utilize dependency scanning tools (e.g., `cargo audit`) in development and CI/CD pipelines to automatically detect and alert on known vulnerabilities in `lettre`'s dependencies.
    *   Incorporate security testing and code reviews that consider the potential impact of dependency vulnerabilities on applications using `lettre`.
