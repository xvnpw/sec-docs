# Attack Surface Analysis for lettre/lettre

## Attack Surface: [Unencrypted SMTP Connections (Man-in-the-Middle)](./attack_surfaces/unencrypted_smtp_connections__man-in-the-middle_.md)

*   **Description:**  When `lettre` is configured to send emails over an unencrypted connection (without TLS/SSL), all communication, including email content and potentially authentication credentials, is transmitted in plaintext and vulnerable to eavesdropping and manipulation by attackers on the network path.
*   **Lettre Contribution:** `lettre` provides the `Transport::unencrypted()` constructor, which, if used, explicitly creates an insecure, unencrypted transport.  Developers choosing this option directly introduce this attack surface.
*   **Example:**  An application initializes `lettre` with `SmtpTransport::unencrypted("mail.example.com".into())`.  When sending an email, the communication with `mail.example.com` is not encrypted. An attacker monitoring network traffic can intercept the email content and SMTP authentication details if plaintext authentication is used.
*   **Impact:**  **High**. Confidentiality breach of email content and potentially SMTP credentials. Attackers can read sensitive information, intercept communications, and potentially impersonate the sender or modify emails in transit.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always Use TLS/SSL:** Configure `lettre` to use encrypted connections. Utilize `SmtpTransport::starttls()` or `SmtpTransport::builder().ssl_config(...)` to enforce TLS encryption.
    *   **Avoid `Transport::unencrypted()`:** Never use `Transport::unencrypted()` in production or sensitive environments.
    *   **Enforce TLS on SMTP Server:** Ensure the configured SMTP server also enforces TLS and rejects unencrypted connections if possible.

## Attack Surface: [Email Header Injection](./attack_surfaces/email_header_injection.md)

*   **Description:** If user-provided data is directly used to construct email headers via `lettre`'s API without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious headers to manipulate email behavior or bypass security measures.
*   **Lettre Contribution:** `lettre`'s `MessageBuilder` API allows setting various email headers (e.g., `to`, `cc`, `bcc`, `subject`, `header`). If the application passes unsanitized user input directly to these methods, it becomes vulnerable to header injection.
*   **Example:** An application takes recipient email addresses from user input and uses `message_builder.to(user_input.parse().unwrap())`. If a user inputs `"attacker@example.com\nBcc: victim@example.com"`, `lettre` will construct an email with an injected `Bcc` header, sending the email to `victim@example.com` without the intended recipient's knowledge.
*   **Impact:** **High**.  Spam distribution, phishing campaigns, email spoofing (manipulating `From` header), bypassing spam filters, information disclosure (via `Bcc` injection).
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Sanitization:** Sanitize and validate all user-provided input before using it in `lettre`'s header setting methods.
    *   **Email Address Validation:** Use robust email address parsing and validation libraries to ensure input conforms to expected formats and prevent injection of control characters.
    *   **Avoid Direct User Control of Critical Headers:** If possible, avoid allowing users to directly control sensitive headers like `From` or `Reply-To`. Set these programmatically with trusted values.

## Attack Surface: [Email Body Injection (Cross-Site Scripting in Email Clients)](./attack_surfaces/email_body_injection__cross-site_scripting_in_email_clients_.md)

*   **Description:** When constructing HTML emails using `lettre`, if user-provided data is directly embedded into the HTML body without proper encoding, attackers can inject malicious HTML or JavaScript that can execute in a recipient's vulnerable email client.
*   **Lettre Contribution:** `lettre` allows setting the email body as HTML using `message_builder.body(Body::html(...))`. If the application embeds unsanitized user input into this HTML string, it creates an XSS vulnerability.
*   **Example:** An application uses `lettre` to send HTML emails and includes user comments directly: `Body::html(format!("<html><body><p>Comment: {}</p></body></html>", user_comment))`. If `user_comment` is `"<img src='x' onerror='alert(\"XSS\")'>"` and not sanitized, `lettre` will include this malicious HTML in the email body. When opened in a vulnerable email client, the JavaScript `alert('XSS')` will execute.
*   **Impact:** **High**. Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks within email clients. Attackers can potentially steal information, hijack sessions, or perform other malicious actions depending on the email client's vulnerabilities.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **HTML Encoding/Escaping:**  Thoroughly HTML-encode or escape all user-provided data before embedding it into HTML email bodies. Use libraries designed for HTML escaping to prevent injection.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** For HTML emails, consider using CSP headers (if supported by target email clients) to restrict the capabilities of the email client and mitigate XSS risks.
    *   **Prefer Plain Text Emails:** When possible, send plain text emails using `Body::plain_text(...)` to completely avoid HTML injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Templating Engines with Auto-Escaping:** Utilize templating engines that automatically handle HTML escaping to reduce the risk of developers accidentally introducing vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Plaintext Authentication (Credential Exposure)](./attack_surfaces/plaintext_authentication__credential_exposure_.md)

*   **Description:** Using plaintext authentication mechanisms (like `Login` or `Plain`) with `lettre` without TLS encryption transmits SMTP credentials in the clear, making them easily intercepted by network attackers.
*   **Lettre Contribution:** `lettre` supports various authentication mechanisms, including plaintext methods like `Login` and `Plain`. If developers configure `lettre` to use these methods *without* also ensuring TLS encryption is active, they expose credentials.
*   **Example:** An application configures `lettre` to use `smtp_transport.credentials(Credentials::new("user".into(), "password".into())).authentication_mechanism(AuthenticationMechanism::Login);` and *does not* enforce TLS. During the SMTP authentication process, the username and password are sent in plaintext over the network, which can be intercepted.
*   **Impact:** **High**. Credential compromise. Attackers gain access to the SMTP credentials, allowing them to send emails as the legitimate user, potentially for spam, phishing, or other malicious purposes.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always Use Secure Authentication with TLS:**  Use secure authentication mechanisms like `CRAM-MD5` or `OAuth2` (if supported by the SMTP server) *in conjunction with* enforced TLS encryption.
    *   **Avoid Plaintext Authentication without TLS:** Never use `AuthenticationMechanism::Login` or `AuthenticationMechanism::Plain` unless TLS encryption is absolutely guaranteed and enforced for the entire connection.
    *   **Secure Credential Management:** Securely store and manage SMTP credentials. Avoid hardcoding them in the application. Use environment variables, secrets management systems, or secure configuration practices.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Configuration (Certificate Validation Bypass)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_configuration__certificate_validation_bypass_.md)

*   **Description:** Disabling or bypassing certificate validation in `lettre`'s TLS configuration (`danger_accept_invalid_certs(true)`) completely undermines the security provided by TLS, making the application vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle attacks, even when TLS is seemingly enabled.
*   **Lettre Contribution:** `lettre` provides the `danger_accept_invalid_certs(true)` option within `SslConfig`. Using this option explicitly disables a critical security feature and weakens the TLS connection.
*   **Example:** An application configures `lettre` with `SslConfig::builder().danger_accept_invalid_certs(true).build()`. Even if TLS is used, `lettre` will accept any certificate presented by the SMTP server, including forged certificates from a MITM attacker. This allows the attacker to intercept and manipulate the supposedly secure TLS connection.
*   **Impact:** **Critical**.  Complete bypass of TLS security, enabling Man-in-the-Middle attacks. Attackers can intercept and modify all communication, including email content and credentials, as if TLS were not in place at all.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never Disable Certificate Validation in Production:**  Never use `danger_accept_invalid_certs(true)` in production or any environment where security is a concern. Ensure certificate validation is always enabled (which is the default in `lettre` if you don't explicitly set this option).
    *   **Proper Certificate Management:** Ensure the system's certificate store is correctly configured and up-to-date so that valid certificates can be properly verified.
    *   **Strict TLS Configuration:**  Configure TLS with strong cipher suites and enforce appropriate TLS versions to further strengthen the secure connection.
