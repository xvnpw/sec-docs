# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Enable Rust developers to easily integrate email sending functionality into their applications.
  - Provide a reliable and efficient email sending library.
  - Offer flexibility and customization options for different email sending scenarios.
  - Support various email transport mechanisms.
  - Maintain a well-documented and easy-to-use API.

- Business Risks:
  - Reputation damage if the library is unreliable or insecure, leading to email delivery failures or security vulnerabilities in applications using lettre.
  - Lack of adoption if the library is difficult to use or lacks essential features.
  - Security vulnerabilities in the library itself could be exploited by malicious actors to send spam or phishing emails through applications using lettre.
  - Dependency on external email services or infrastructure, which could introduce availability and performance risks.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Usage of Rust's memory safety features to prevent common vulnerabilities like buffer overflows. (Implemented in: Rust language itself)
  - security control: Code review process through pull requests on GitHub. (Implemented in: GitHub workflow)
  - security control: Open-source nature allows for community review and contributions to identify and fix security issues. (Implemented in: Open-source development model)
  - security control: Dependency management using Cargo, which helps in managing and updating dependencies, including security updates. (Implemented in: Cargo build system)
  - accepted risk: Reliance on third-party email services for actual email delivery, inheriting their security posture and potential vulnerabilities.
  - accepted risk: Security vulnerabilities in dependencies that are not immediately patched.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to detect potential vulnerabilities in the code.
  - security control: Regularly audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities and update them promptly.
  - security control: Provide clear security guidelines and best practices for developers using lettre in their applications, especially regarding handling sensitive data in emails.
  - security control: Implement input validation and sanitization within lettre to prevent injection attacks if lettre processes any user-provided data (though it primarily constructs emails based on application logic).
  - security control: Consider providing examples and documentation on secure configuration and usage of lettre with different email transport mechanisms, including TLS/SSL encryption.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: Lettre itself does not handle user authentication as it's a library. Applications using lettre are responsible for authenticating users and controlling email sending permissions.
    - Requirement: When configuring email transport mechanisms that require authentication (e.g., SMTP with username/password), lettre should support secure storage and handling of credentials, ideally relying on environment variables or secure configuration management rather than hardcoding.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Lettre does not handle authorization. Applications using lettre must implement authorization logic to ensure only authorized users or processes can send emails.
    - Requirement:  Lettre should provide clear documentation on how to securely integrate with authorization mechanisms in the application context.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Lettre should perform input validation on email addresses, headers, and body content to prevent common injection attacks (e.g., email header injection).
    - Requirement:  Validation should be applied to all inputs that are used to construct email messages, even if they originate from within the application, to prevent unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities due to incorrect data types or formats.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Lettre must support TLS/SSL encryption for secure communication with SMTP servers and other email transport mechanisms to protect email content in transit.
    - Requirement:  Lettre should encourage and default to using TLS/SSL for all network communication where sensitive data (email content, credentials) is transmitted.
    - Requirement: If lettre handles any sensitive data at rest (which is unlikely for a sending library, but consider configuration files), appropriate encryption mechanisms should be considered.

- Build Process:
  - Developer writes code and commits changes to a Version Control System (VCS) like GitHub.
  - Changes to the VCS trigger a Continuous Integration (CI) system, such as GitHub Actions.
  - CI System performs the following steps:
    - Code Checkout: Retrieves the latest code from the VCS.
    - Build Step: Compiles the Rust code using Cargo.
    - Test Step: Executes unit and integration tests to ensure code quality and functionality.
    - SAST Scanner: Runs Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools like Clippy and RustSec to identify potential security vulnerabilities and code quality issues.
    - Container Build (Optional): Builds a Docker container image if containerized deployment is used.
    - Image Push (Optional): Pushes the built container image to an Artifact Registry (e.g., Docker Registry).
  - Build Artifacts are generated, which could be executables, libraries, or container images.
  - Build Artifacts are stored in an Artifact Registry.
  - Deployment Environment retrieves artifacts from the registry for deployment.

  - security control: Supply chain security - verifying integrity of dependencies and build tools. (Implemented by: Cargo's checksum verification, using trusted build environments)

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Sending transactional emails (e.g., password resets, order confirmations) that are essential for user interaction and business operations.
  - Sending marketing or notification emails to engage users and promote products/services.
  - Any business process that relies on timely and reliable email communication.

- Data Sensitivity:
  - Email addresses of users and recipients (Personally Identifiable Information - PII).
  - Email content, which may contain sensitive business information, personal data, or confidential communications depending on the application's use case.
  - Email sending credentials (if stored or handled by the application - should be treated as highly sensitive secrets).
  - Metadata related to email sending (timestamps, recipient information, etc.) which could be considered sensitive depending on privacy regulations and business context.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What type of applications will be using lettre? (e.g., web applications, backend services, command-line tools). This will influence the deployment and security considerations.
  - What are the specific email sending requirements in terms of volume, frequency, and delivery guarantees?
  - What email transport mechanisms will be primarily used (SMTP, Sendgrid, other APIs)?
  - Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) that need to be considered?
  - What is the organization's risk appetite regarding security vulnerabilities in open-source libraries?

- Assumptions:
  - Lettre is primarily used in server-side applications to send emails programmatically, not directly exposed to end-users.
  - The application using lettre is responsible for user authentication and authorization.
  - Email sending credentials will be managed securely outside of the lettre library itself (e.g., environment variables, secrets management).
  - TLS/SSL encryption will be used for all email transmissions over the internet.
  - The application developers using lettre have a basic understanding of secure coding practices and email security principles.
  - The deployment environment provides basic security controls like network firewalls and access control.
