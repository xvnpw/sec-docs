## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Lettre (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_lettre__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized access, control, or causing damage to the application utilizing the Lettre email library.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Application's Improper Usage of Lettre (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_application's_improper_usage_of_lettre__critical_node_.md)

This critical node highlights that the most likely attack vectors stem from how the application *uses* Lettre, rather than vulnerabilities *within* Lettre itself.  Developers' mistakes in implementation are the primary weakness.

## Attack Tree Path: [Input Validation Flaws in Email Data (CRITICAL NODE - HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/input_validation_flaws_in_email_data__critical_node_-_high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application fails to properly validate and sanitize user-provided input that is used to construct email messages (headers, body, attachments).
**Vulnerability:** Lack of input sanitization allows attackers to inject malicious content or commands into the email structure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Email Header Injection (CRITICAL NODE - HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/email_header_injection__critical_node_-_high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Attackers inject malicious headers into the email by manipulating user-controlled input fields that are used to build email headers.
**Vulnerability:**  Insufficient sanitization of input used for email headers.
**Impacts (HIGH-RISK PATHs under Email Header Injection):**
*   **Send emails to unintended recipients (Spam/Phishing):** Injecting headers like `Bcc` or manipulating the `To` field can redirect emails to attacker-controlled addresses for spam or phishing campaigns.
*   **Modify email content or behavior in recipient's inbox:**  Headers like `Reply-To`, `Content-Type`, or custom headers can be manipulated to alter how the email is displayed or processed by the recipient's email client, potentially for social engineering or to bypass filters.
*   **Bypass security filters or access controls based on email headers:**  Injected headers might be used to circumvent application logic that relies on email header information for security decisions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Email Body Injection (Less likely to directly compromise app, but can be abused) (CRITICAL NODE - HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/email_body_injection__less_likely_to_directly_compromise_app__but_can_be_abused___critical_node_-_hi_8fabe596.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious content (HTML, scripts, links) into the email body by manipulating user-controlled input fields used for the email body.
**Vulnerability:** Insufficient sanitization of input used for the email body, especially when sending HTML emails.
**Impacts (HIGH-RISK PATH under Email Body Injection):**
*   **Launch social engineering attacks (phishing, malware distribution):** Malicious links or embedded scripts in the email body can be used to redirect users to phishing sites, distribute malware, or perform other social engineering attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Attachment Manipulation (If application handles attachments via Lettre) (CRITICAL NODE - HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/attachment_manipulation__if_application_handles_attachments_via_lettre___critical_node_-_high-risk_p_e6c2e3c2.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers manipulate attachment filenames, content types, or the attachment content itself, often by controlling file uploads or input fields related to attachments.
**Vulnerability:**  Lack of validation and sanitization of attachment-related data.
**Impacts (HIGH-RISK PATH under Attachment Manipulation):**
*   **Deliver malicious payloads (malware disguised as legitimate files):** Attackers can upload or specify malicious files disguised as legitimate attachments (e.g., renaming an executable to a `.pdf` or manipulating content type) to deliver malware to recipients.

## Attack Tree Path: [Configuration Vulnerabilities in Application (CRITICAL NODE - HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/configuration_vulnerabilities_in_application__critical_node_-_high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Insecure configuration practices expose sensitive information or weaken security measures.
**Vulnerability:**  Poor configuration management.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Credential Management (CRITICAL NODE - HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_credential_management__critical_node_-_high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** SMTP credentials (username, password, API keys) are stored or handled insecurely, making them accessible to attackers.
**Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATHs under Insecure Credential Management):**
*   **Hardcoded Credentials (CRITICAL NODE - HIGH-RISK PATH):** Credentials are directly embedded in the application's source code.
*   **Stored in Config Files (Unencrypted) (CRITICAL NODE - HIGH-RISK PATH):** Credentials are stored in plaintext or easily decrypted configuration files accessible on the server.
*   **Exposed in Environment Variables (Insecurely) (CRITICAL NODE - HIGH-RISK PATH):** Credentials are placed in environment variables that are easily accessible or logged, rather than using secure secrets management.
**Impact (for all Insecure Credential Management paths - HIGH-RISK PATH):**  Compromise of email sending capability, potential unauthorized access to associated accounts if credentials are reused, and reputational damage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Misconfigured Transport Security (CRITICAL NODE - HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/misconfigured_transport_security__critical_node_-_high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application is configured to send emails over unencrypted connections, exposing sensitive data in transit.
**Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH under Misconfigured Transport Security):**
*   **Disabled TLS/SSL (CRITICAL NODE - HIGH-RISK PATH):** The application is explicitly configured or defaults to sending emails over plain SMTP without using STARTTLS or other encryption mechanisms.
**Impact (for Disabled TLS/SSL path - HIGH-RISK PATH):**  Exposure of SMTP credentials and email content during transmission, making them vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks and eavesdropping.
