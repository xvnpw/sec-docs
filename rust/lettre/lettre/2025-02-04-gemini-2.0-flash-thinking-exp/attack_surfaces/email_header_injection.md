### 4. Deep Analysis of Email Header Injection Attack Surface

#### 4.1. Understanding Email Header Injection

Email Header Injection is a security vulnerability that arises when user-controlled data is incorporated into email headers without proper sanitization. Email headers are structured using specific formatting, primarily relying on newline characters (`\n` or CRLF `\r\n`) to separate headers.  By injecting newline characters and additional header fields into input intended for a single header, an attacker can manipulate the email structure and behavior.

In the context of `lettre`, which provides a convenient API for building emails, the risk emerges when developers directly use user input to populate header fields through methods like `to()`, `cc()`, `bcc()`, `subject()`, and `header()`. If this input is not carefully sanitized, attackers can inject malicious headers.

#### 4.2. Lettre API and Vulnerable Points

The `lettre::message::MessageBuilder` API offers flexibility in constructing emails, which, if misused, can lead to header injection. Key methods that are potential vulnerability points include:

*   **`to(address: Address)`:**  Sets the "To" recipient.
*   **`cc(address: Address)`:**  Sets the "Cc" recipient.
*   **`bcc(address: Address)`:**  Sets the "Bcc" recipient.
*   **`from(address: Address)`:**  Sets the "From" sender address.
*   **`reply_to(address: Address)`:** Sets the "Reply-To" address.
*   **`subject(subject: impl Into<String>)`:** Sets the email subject.
*   **`header(name: HeaderName, value: HeaderValue)`:**  Sets a custom header. This is particularly powerful as it allows setting *any* header.

**Vulnerability Mechanism:**

When an application uses user input to populate these methods without sanitization, an attacker can embed newline characters (`\n` or `\r\n`) followed by malicious header directives within their input.  `lettre`, by default, will process this input and construct the email message with the injected headers.

**Example Scenario (Illustrative Code - Vulnerable):**

```rust
use lettre::{Message, SmtpTransport, Transport};
use lettre::message::{Mailbox, MessageBuilder};

fn send_email(recipient: String, subject: String, body: String) -> Result<(), lettre::error::Error> {
    let email = MessageBuilder::new()
        .from(Mailbox::new(None, "sender@example.com".parse().unwrap()))
        .to(recipient.parse().unwrap()) // Vulnerable point: Unsanitized user input
        .subject(subject)
        .body(body)
        .unwrap();

    let mailer = SmtpTransport::builder_localhost().unwrap().build();
    mailer.send(&email)?;
    Ok(())
}

fn main() {
    // Example of malicious input
    let malicious_recipient = "attacker@example.com\nBcc: victim@example.com";
    let subject = "Important Notification";
    let body = "This is a legitimate email.";

    if let Err(e) = send_email(malicious_recipient.to_string(), subject.to_string(), body.to_string()) {
        eprintln!("Error sending email: {:?}", e);
    } else {
        println!("Email sent (potentially with injected headers).");
    }
}
```

In this vulnerable example, if `malicious_recipient` is passed as user input, the resulting email will have an injected `Bcc` header, sending a copy of the email to `victim@example.com` without the intended recipient's knowledge.

#### 4.3. Attack Vectors and Payloads

Attackers can leverage Email Header Injection to achieve various malicious objectives by injecting different types of headers. Common attack vectors and payloads include:

*   **Bcc Injection (Information Disclosure):** As demonstrated in the example, injecting `Bcc: victim@example.com` allows attackers to secretly send emails to unintended recipients, potentially disclosing sensitive information.
*   **Cc Injection (Information Disclosure/Spam Amplification):** Similar to `Bcc`, injecting `Cc` can expose email addresses to unintended recipients or be used to send spam to a wider audience.
*   **From Spoofing (Phishing/Reputation Damage):** Injecting the `From` header allows attackers to forge the sender's email address. This is commonly used in phishing attacks to impersonate trusted entities and deceive recipients.
    ```
    attacker@example.com\nFrom: legitimate@example.com
    ```
*   **Subject Manipulation (Phishing/Social Engineering):** While less critical than other headers, injecting newline characters into the subject can alter the displayed subject line, potentially making phishing emails more convincing.
    ```
    Legitimate Subject\n\nMalicious Subject
    ```
*   **Reply-To Manipulation (Phishing/Redirection):** Injecting `Reply-To` can redirect replies to an attacker-controlled address, allowing them to intercept communications.
    ```
    attacker@example.com\nReply-To: attacker_reply@example.com
    ```
*   **Content-Type Manipulation (Potential XSS - if email client vulnerable):** In rare cases, manipulating `Content-Type` headers might be exploitable if the email client is vulnerable to rendering specific content types in unexpected ways. However, this is less common and depends heavily on email client vulnerabilities.
*   **Custom Header Injection (Spam Filter Evasion/Malicious Functionality):** Attackers can inject custom headers for various purposes, including attempting to bypass spam filters by adding headers that might be interpreted favorably by filters, or to introduce headers that could be processed by vulnerable email clients or systems in unexpected ways (though less common).
*   **Disrupting Email Routing (Less Common):** In highly complex email setups, manipulating headers might theoretically disrupt email routing, but this is a less common and harder-to-exploit scenario.

#### 4.4. Impact Assessment

The impact of successful Email Header Injection can range from moderate to severe, depending on the attack vector and the context of the application.

*   **High Impact:**
    *   **Spam Distribution:** Attackers can leverage compromised applications to send large volumes of spam emails, damaging the application's reputation and potentially leading to blacklisting of its sending infrastructure.
    *   **Phishing Campaigns:** Spoofing the `From` address and manipulating other headers enables sophisticated phishing attacks, potentially leading to credential theft, malware distribution, and financial losses for users.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** `Bcc` and `Cc` injection can expose sensitive information to unintended recipients, violating privacy and potentially leading to legal and reputational damage.
    *   **Email Spoofing and Brand Damage:**  Forging the `From` address can severely damage the reputation of the spoofed organization or individual, eroding trust.
    *   **Bypassing Security Measures:** Header injection can be used to bypass certain security filters or rules that rely on header analysis, potentially enabling further attacks.

*   **Medium Impact:**
    *   **Reputational Damage (Less Severe):** Even if not directly used for spam, header injection vulnerabilities can indicate poor security practices, damaging the application's reputation.
    *   **Minor Information Disclosure (Context Dependent):**  In some contexts, `Cc` injection might lead to minor information disclosure that is not critically sensitive.
    *   **Service Disruption (Limited):** In specific scenarios, header manipulation could theoretically lead to minor disruptions in email delivery or processing, but this is less common.

*   **Low Impact:**
    *   **Subject Manipulation (Primarily Annoyance):**  While subject manipulation can be used in social engineering, its direct impact is generally lower than other forms of header injection.

**Risk Severity: High**. Due to the potential for significant impact, including spam distribution, phishing, and information disclosure, Email Header Injection is considered a high-severity risk.

#### 4.5. Mitigation Strategies

Preventing Email Header Injection requires robust input sanitization, validation, and secure coding practices. Here are detailed mitigation strategies for applications using `lettre`:

1.  **Strict Input Sanitization:**

    *   **Identify User Input Points:**  Carefully identify all points in your application where user-provided data is used to construct email headers via `lettre`. This includes data from web forms, APIs, command-line arguments, databases, etc.
    *   **Sanitize Newline Characters:**  The most critical step is to **remove or encode newline characters (`\n` and `\r`)** from user input before using it in header methods.  You can:
        *   **Remove:**  Completely strip out newline characters. This is often the simplest and most effective approach for fields where newlines are not expected or valid (e.g., email addresses, subjects).
        *   **Encode:**  Replace newline characters with a safe encoding (e.g., URL encoding `%0A`, `%0D` or HTML entities `&#10;`, `&#13;`).  This is less common for email headers and might not be universally supported by email clients.  Removing is generally preferred for security.
    *   **Consider Other Control Characters:**  While newlines are the primary concern, consider sanitizing other control characters that might have unintended effects in email headers (though less critical for injection).
    *   **Rust Example (Sanitization - Removing Newlines):**

        ```rust
        fn sanitize_input(input: &str) -> String {
            input.replace('\n', "").replace('\r', "")
        }

        // ... in the send_email function ...
        let sanitized_recipient = sanitize_input(&recipient);
        let email = MessageBuilder::new()
            // ...
            .to(sanitized_recipient.parse().unwrap()) // Sanitized input
            // ...
            .unwrap();
        ```

2.  **Email Address Validation:**

    *   **Use Robust Parsing and Validation Libraries:**  Do not rely on simple regular expressions for email address validation. Use dedicated libraries that adhere to email address specifications (RFC 5322 and related RFCs).  Rust crates like `validator` or `email_address` can be used for robust email validation.
    *   **Validate Format and Structure:**  Ensure that user input intended for email addresses conforms to the expected format. Validation should check for:
        *   Valid local part (before `@`).
        *   Valid domain part (after `@`).
        *   Correct syntax and allowed characters according to email address standards.
    *   **Reject Invalid Input:**  If validation fails, reject the input and provide informative error messages to the user, guiding them to correct their input. Do not attempt to "fix" invalid email addresses automatically, as this can introduce further vulnerabilities or unintended behavior.
    *   **Rust Example (Email Validation with `validator` crate):**

        ```rust
        use validator::validate_email;

        fn validate_and_sanitize_email(email_input: &str) -> Result<String, String> {
            let sanitized_email = email_input.replace('\n', "").replace('\r', ""); // Sanitize first
            if validate_email(&sanitized_email) {
                Ok(sanitized_email)
            } else {
                Err("Invalid email address format".to_string())
            }
        }

        // ... in the send_email function ...
        match validate_and_sanitize_email(&recipient) {
            Ok(validated_recipient) => {
                let email = MessageBuilder::new()
                    // ...
                    .to(validated_recipient.parse().unwrap()) // Validated and sanitized input
                    // ...
                    .unwrap();
                // ... send email ...
            }
            Err(error) => {
                eprintln!("Error: {}", error);
                return Err(lettre::error::Error::Transport(lettre::error::TransportError::Io(std::io::Error::new(std::io::ErrorKind::InvalidInput, error)))); // Or handle error appropriately
            }
        }
        ```

3.  **Avoid Direct User Control of Critical Headers:**

    *   **Minimize User Control:**  Whenever possible, avoid allowing users to directly control sensitive headers like `From`, `Reply-To`, and potentially `Subject` if it's critical.
    *   **Programmatic Setting:**  Set these critical headers programmatically within your application code using trusted values. For example, the `From` address should typically be configured in your application settings and not directly influenced by user input.
    *   **Limited User Choice (Whitelisting):** If you must allow users to influence certain headers (e.g., choosing from a predefined list of "From" addresses), use whitelisting or predefined options instead of directly accepting arbitrary user input.
    *   **For `Subject`:** While direct user input for the subject is often necessary, still apply sanitization to prevent newline injection and consider limiting the subject length to prevent excessively long or manipulated subjects.

4.  **Content Security Policy (CSP) for Web Applications (If Applicable):**

    *   If your application is web-based and displays email content (e.g., in a webmail interface or notification system), implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) risks that could arise if header injection somehow leads to malicious content being rendered in the email display. CSP helps restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, reducing the impact of XSS vulnerabilities.

5.  **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:**

    *   Conduct regular security audits and code reviews of your application, specifically focusing on email handling logic and areas where user input is used to construct email messages.
    *   Use static analysis tools and manual code review techniques to identify potential header injection vulnerabilities.

6.  **Principle of Least Privilege:**

    *   Ensure that the application's email sending component (and any associated service accounts or credentials) operates with the principle of least privilege.  Limit the permissions granted to only what is strictly necessary for sending emails. While not directly preventing header injection, this can limit the potential damage if an attack is successful.

By implementing these comprehensive mitigation strategies, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of Email Header Injection vulnerabilities in their `lettre`-based applications and build more secure email functionality. Remember that security is an ongoing process, and regular review and updates are crucial to maintain a strong security posture.
