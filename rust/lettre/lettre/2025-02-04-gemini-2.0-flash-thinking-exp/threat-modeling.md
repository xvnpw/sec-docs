# Threat Model Analysis for lettre/lettre

## Threat: [SMTP Credential Exposure](./threats/smtp_credential_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the SMTP server credentials (username, password) configured for use with Lettre. This compromise could stem from insecure storage of credentials in configuration files, environment variables, or application code. With these credentials, an attacker can impersonate the application and send emails through the configured SMTP server, potentially for malicious purposes like spam or phishing. They could also potentially gain broader access to the SMTP server depending on its security configuration.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Reputational Damage:** Severe damage to the application and organization's reputation due to malicious emails sent using compromised credentials.
    *   **Financial Loss:** Potential fines, service disruptions, and significant costs associated with incident response, remediation, and recovery.
    *   **Data Breach (Indirect):**  If the compromised SMTP server is used for other sensitive services, it could lead to a wider data breach beyond email functionality.
*   **Lettre Component Affected:** Configuration (Specifically, how `SmtpTransport` is configured and how credentials are handled in the application when using Lettre)
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Credential Storage:** Utilize dedicated and secure secrets management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, cloud provider secret managers) to store SMTP credentials. Avoid storing credentials in plaintext files, code, or easily accessible locations.
    *   **Environment Variables (with caution):** If using environment variables, ensure proper security measures are in place to protect access to the environment where the application runs.
    *   **Strict Access Control:** Implement stringent access control policies to limit who and what can access the stored credentials and configuration files.
    *   **Regular Credential Rotation:** Enforce a policy of regularly rotating SMTP credentials to minimize the window of opportunity if credentials are compromised.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant the SMTP account used by Lettre only the necessary permissions for sending emails, limiting potential damage if compromised.
    *   **Auditing and Monitoring:** Implement auditing and monitoring of access and usage of SMTP credentials to detect and respond to suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Email Interception & Tampering due to Misconfigured TLS/SSL](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__email_interception_&_tampering_due_to_misconfigured_tlsssl.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between the application using Lettre and the SMTP server. If TLS/SSL encryption is not correctly configured or enforced within Lettre's `SmtpTransport` setup, the attacker can potentially eavesdrop on email content (breaching confidentiality) and even modify email content in transit (compromising integrity). This attack is possible on unsecured networks or if the attacker has compromised network infrastructure.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Confidentiality Breach:** Exposure of sensitive and confidential information contained within emails to unauthorized parties.
    *   **Data Integrity Breach:** Emails can be altered or manipulated, leading to misinformation, phishing attempts appearing to originate from the application, or disruption of legitimate communications.
    *   **Severe Reputational Damage:** Loss of user trust and significant damage to reputation due to compromised and potentially manipulated email communications.
*   **Lettre Component Affected:** `SmtpTransport` (Specifically, the TLS/SSL encryption configuration within `SmtpTransport::builder()`)
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory TLS/SSL Enforcement:** Always configure `SmtpTransport` in Lettre to *enforce* TLS/SSL encryption. Use `Transport::builder().encryption(lettre::transport::smtp::Encryption::STARTTLS)` or `Encryption::ImplicitTls)` to explicitly enable and require encryption.
    *   **Strong TLS Configuration:** Ensure both the application and the SMTP server are configured to negotiate strong and modern TLS versions (TLS 1.2 or higher) and secure cipher suites. Avoid outdated or weak TLS configurations.
    *   **Strict Certificate Validation:** Implement robust certificate validation within Lettre's TLS configuration. Do not disable certificate verification in production environments. Properly handle certificate errors and ensure connections are only established with trusted SMTP servers.
    *   **Secure Network Environment:** Deploy the application in a secure network environment and implement network security best practices to minimize the risk of MitM attacks.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Critical Lettre Dependencies](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_critical_lettre_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Lettre relies on external Rust crates as dependencies. If a critical or high severity security vulnerability is discovered in one of these dependencies, applications using Lettre become indirectly vulnerable. Attackers could exploit these dependency vulnerabilities to compromise the application, potentially leading to remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Application Compromise:**  Successful exploitation of a dependency vulnerability can lead to full compromise of the application and the system it runs on.
    *   **Data Breach:** Attackers could gain unauthorized access to sensitive application data or backend systems through dependency vulnerabilities.
    *   **Denial of Service:** Certain vulnerabilities might be exploited to cause application crashes or service disruptions.
*   **Lettre Component Affected:** Dependencies (Indirectly, through vulnerabilities in crates that Lettre depends upon)
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (Severity depends on the specific vulnerability and its exploitability in the affected dependency)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Proactive Dependency Management:** Implement a proactive dependency management strategy, including regular updates of Lettre and all its dependencies to the latest versions.
    *   **Automated Dependency Scanning:** Integrate automated dependency scanning tools (e.g., `cargo audit` in CI/CD pipelines) to continuously monitor for known vulnerabilities in Lettre's dependencies.
    *   **Vulnerability Monitoring and Alerts:** Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases relevant to Rust crates and Lettre's dependency ecosystem to receive timely alerts about new vulnerabilities.
    *   **Security Audits and Reviews:** Conduct periodic security audits and code reviews to identify potential vulnerabilities, including those arising from dependencies.
    *   **Dependency Pinning and Reproducible Builds (Advanced):** Consider using dependency pinning and ensuring reproducible builds to have more control over dependency versions and reduce the risk of unexpected dependency changes introducing vulnerabilities. However, ensure pinned dependencies are still updated regularly for security patches.
