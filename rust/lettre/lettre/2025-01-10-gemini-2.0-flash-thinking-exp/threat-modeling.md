# Threat Model Analysis for lettre/lettre

## Threat: [Unencrypted SMTP Connection Leading to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks](./threats/unencrypted_smtp_connection_leading_to_man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between the application and the SMTP server when TLS/SSL is not enforced by the application using `lettre`. The attacker can read sensitive information like email content, recipient lists, and authentication credentials.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive data, potential compromise of email accounts.

**Affected Lettre Component:** `SmtpTransportBuilder`, `Transport` trait implementation for SMTP.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always configure `SmtpTransportBuilder` to use `Encryption::Opportunistic` or `Encryption::Always`.
*   Explicitly use `SmtpTransportBuilder::ssl_client_config` to configure TLS settings and enforce certificate verification where appropriate.

## Threat: [Downgrade Attacks on TLS Connections](./threats/downgrade_attacks_on_tls_connections.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates the TLS handshake process to force the connection to use an older, less secure TLS version with known vulnerabilities. This is possible if the underlying TLS implementation used by `lettre` is vulnerable or not configured securely.

**Impact:** Exposure of communication to eavesdropping and potential data manipulation.

**Affected Lettre Component:** Underlying TLS implementation (`native-tls` or `rustls`) used by `SmtpTransportBuilder`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure the application depends on a recent version of `lettre` and its TLS backend (`native-tls` or `rustls`).
*   Configure the TLS backend (if possible through `lettre`'s API or system-level settings) to disallow weak cipher suites and older TLS protocols.

## Threat: [Lack of Server Certificate Verification](./threats/lack_of_server_certificate_verification.md)

**Description:** The application, using `lettre`, does not verify the authenticity of the SMTP server's certificate, allowing an attacker to impersonate the legitimate server.

**Impact:**  The application might send sensitive information (including credentials) to a malicious server.

**Affected Lettre Component:** `SmtpTransportBuilder`, specifically the configuration of the TLS client.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use `SmtpTransportBuilder::ssl_client_config` to configure a `ClientConfig` that enables certificate verification.
*   Consider using a custom certificate store if necessary.

## Threat: [Plaintext Credential Exposure During Authentication](./threats/plaintext_credential_exposure_during_authentication.md)

**Description:** The application uses `lettre` to attempt plaintext authentication methods (like PLAIN or LOGIN) over an unencrypted connection, allowing an attacker to intercept credentials.

**Impact:** Compromise of SMTP credentials, enabling the attacker to send emails through the legitimate account.

**Affected Lettre Component:** `SmtpTransportBuilder::credentials`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always use secure authentication methods like CRAM-MD5 or XOAUTH2 when configuring credentials in `lettre`, and ensure TLS is enforced.
*   Avoid using PLAIN or LOGIN without enforcing TLS at the `lettre` transport level.

## Threat: [Header Injection Vulnerability](./threats/header_injection_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** An attacker can manipulate input that the application uses with `lettre`'s `MessageBuilder` to construct email headers (e.g., `To`, `Cc`, `Bcc`, `Subject`, `From`) to inject arbitrary headers. This can be used for spoofing, spamming, or bypassing security filters.

**Impact:** Reputation damage, phishing attacks, delivery of malicious content.

**Affected Lettre Component:** Functions or methods used to construct `Message` headers within `lettre`, such as `MessageBuilder::to`, `MessageBuilder::cc`, `MessageBuilder::subject`, etc.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user-provided input *before* using it to set email headers via `lettre`'s `MessageBuilder`.
*   Avoid directly incorporating untrusted input into header values when using `lettre`.

## Threat: [Body Injection Vulnerability](./threats/body_injection_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** An attacker can inject malicious content into the email body by manipulating input that the application uses with `lettre`'s `MessageBuilder`. This can lead to phishing attacks or distribution of malware.

**Impact:** Delivery of malicious content, potential compromise of recipients' systems.

**Affected Lettre Component:** Functions or methods used to construct the `Message` body within `lettre`, such as `MessageBuilder::body`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Sanitize and validate user-provided input used for the email body *before* passing it to `lettre`'s `MessageBuilder`.
*   Consider using templating engines with appropriate escaping mechanisms to prevent injection when constructing the body for `lettre`.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in the Underlying TLS Library (`native-tls` or `rustls`)](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_the_underlying_tls_library___native-tls__or__rustls__.md)

**Description:** Security vulnerabilities in the TLS library used by `lettre` can compromise the confidentiality and integrity of email transmissions.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive email data, potential for MITM attacks.

**Affected Lettre Component:** The underlying TLS implementation chosen during compilation, which `lettre` depends on.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update the `lettre` crate to benefit from updates to its dependencies, including `native-tls` or `rustls`.
*   Stay informed about security advisories for these libraries.
