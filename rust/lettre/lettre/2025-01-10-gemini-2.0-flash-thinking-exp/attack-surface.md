# Attack Surface Analysis for lettre/lettre

## Attack Surface: [Email Content Injection](./attack_surfaces/email_content_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can manipulate email content (body, headers) by injecting malicious code or content if user-provided data is not properly sanitized before being used with **`lettre`'s email building functions**.
*   **How `lettre` Contributes to the Attack Surface:** **`lettre` provides methods to programmatically construct email messages.** If the application directly uses unsanitized user input when building the `Message` object (e.g., using `header` or `body` methods), it becomes vulnerable to injection.
*   **Example:** An application takes a user-provided subject line. If the user enters `Subject: Important\nBcc: attacker@example.com`, and this is directly passed to **`lettre`**, the attacker's email will be added to the Bcc field.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized information disclosure, phishing attacks, spam distribution, reputation damage.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Sanitization before `lettre`:** Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user-provided data **before** incorporating it into the email content using **`lettre`'s methods**. Use escaping or encoding techniques appropriate for email headers and body.
    *   **Templating Engines:** Utilize templating engines that automatically handle escaping of user input within email bodies **before passing the rendered content to `lettre`**.
    *   **Strict Header Control:** Avoid allowing users to directly control critical email headers when using **`lettre`'s header manipulation functions**. If necessary, implement strict validation and whitelisting.

## Attack Surface: [SMTP Credentials Exposure](./attack_surfaces/smtp_credentials_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** The SMTP server credentials (username and password) required by **`lettre`** can be exposed if stored insecurely or accessed through other vulnerabilities.
*   **How `lettre` Contributes to the Attack Surface:** **`lettre` requires these credentials to establish a connection with the SMTP server.** The application using **`lettre`** is responsible for securely providing these credentials through the `SmtpTransport` configuration. **Misusing `lettre`'s configuration options for SMTP transport can lead to insecure credential management.**
*   **Example:** SMTP credentials are hardcoded directly when creating the `SmtpTransport` instance in the application's code.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the email sending functionality, allowing attackers to send emails on behalf of the application.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Credential Provisioning to `lettre`:** Avoid hardcoding SMTP credentials when configuring **`lettre`'s `SmtpTransport`**.
    *   **Secure Storage:** Store credentials securely using environment variables or secrets management systems and retrieve them securely when configuring **`lettre`**.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure TLS Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_tls_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Misconfiguring TLS settings when establishing a connection with the SMTP server using **`lettre`** can expose email communication to man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.
*   **How `lettre` Contributes to the Attack Surface:** **`lettre` allows configuration of TLS settings through the `SmtpTransport` builder.** If TLS is explicitly disabled or certificate verification is disabled when configuring **`lettre`**, the connection is vulnerable.
*   **Example:** The application configures **`lettre`** with `SmtpTransport::starttls_policy(StartTlsPolicy::Opportunistic)` without ensuring the server requires STARTTLS, or disables certificate verification using `danger_accept_invalid_certs`.
*   **Impact:** Interception and potential modification of email content during transit.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enforce TLS in `lettre`:** Always enforce TLS by using `SmtpTransport::starttls_policy(StartTlsPolicy::Required)` when configuring **`lettre`**.
    *   **Verify Certificates:** Enable and ensure proper certificate verification when configuring **`lettre`** to prevent MitM attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Attachment Path Traversal](./attack_surfaces/attachment_path_traversal.md)

*   **Description:** If the application allows users to specify file paths for attachments without proper validation, attackers could potentially access and attach arbitrary files from the server's file system **when using `lettre`'s attachment features**.
*   **How `lettre` Contributes to the Attack Surface:** **`lettre` provides methods to add attachments by specifying file paths.** If the application directly uses unsanitized user-provided file paths when calling **`lettre`'s attachment functions**, it becomes vulnerable to path traversal.
*   **Example:** A user provides the file path `../../../../etc/passwd` as an attachment, and this path is directly used with **`lettre`'s attachment methods**.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potentially exposing sensitive system files or application data.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Path Validation before `lettre`:** Implement robust validation and sanitization of user-provided file paths for attachments **before using them with `lettre`'s attachment functions**.
    *   **Content Handling:** Instead of directly using file paths with **`lettre`**, consider allowing users to upload files, which can then be securely handled and attached using **`lettre`'s byte array or reader attachment methods**.
