# Threat Model Analysis for dioxuslabs/dioxus

## Threat: [3.1.1. Uncontrolled Component State Manipulation: Malicious Prop Injection](./threats/3_1_1__uncontrolled_component_state_manipulation_malicious_prop_injection.md)

**Threat:** Malicious Prop Injection
**Description:** An attacker injects crafted data into a component's props, bypassing intended validation logic within the component. This leverages Dioxus's component model and prop passing mechanism. The attacker aims to alter the component's internal state, triggering unexpected behavior *specific to how Dioxus handles state and rendering*.
**Impact:**
    *   Information Disclosure: Reveal sensitive data rendered by the component based on manipulated Dioxus state.
    *   Denial of Service: Cause the Dioxus component to enter an infinite loop or crash due to invalid state.
    *   Logic Bypass: Circumvent application logic controlled by the Dioxus component's state, exploiting Dioxus's reactivity system.
    *   Client-side manipulation: Change the behavior of client-side application, by manipulating Dioxus internal state.
**Affected Dioxus Component:** Any Dioxus component receiving props (`#[component]` macro, `Scope` object, props passed to components). The component's `render` function and state update logic *within the Dioxus framework* are the targets.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation at Component Boundary:** Implement robust validation *before* props are accepted by the Dioxus component. Use Rust's type system and custom validation functions, specifically checking for data structures and values expected by the Dioxus component.
    *   **Immutability:** Enforce immutability of props and state within the Dioxus component using Rust's ownership and borrowing. This prevents Dioxus from processing unexpected state changes.
    *   **Dioxus-Specific State Management:** Utilize Dioxus's state management tools (e.g., `dioxus-hooks`, `use_ref`) to centralize and control state updates, making it harder to inject malicious state.
    *   **Defensive Rendering:** Within the Dioxus `render` function, handle unexpected prop values gracefully, preventing crashes or unexpected behavior within the Dioxus rendering pipeline.

## Threat: [3.1.2. Excessive Re-renders (DoS): Re-render Flood (Targeting Dioxus's Diffing)](./threats/3_1_2__excessive_re-renders__dos__re-render_flood__targeting_dioxus's_diffing_.md)

**Threat:** Re-render Flood (Targeting Dioxus's Diffing)
**Description:** An attacker sends crafted input that triggers an excessive number of re-renders, specifically targeting Dioxus's Virtual DOM diffing algorithm. The attacker aims to exploit inefficiencies or edge cases in the diffing process to cause performance degradation or a denial of service. This is distinct from general DoS; it targets Dioxus's core rendering mechanism.
**Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service: The Dioxus application becomes unresponsive due to excessive Virtual DOM operations.
    *   Resource Exhaustion: Server resources (in SSR/LiveView) or client browser resources are consumed by Dioxus's rendering engine.
**Affected Dioxus Component:** Dioxus's Virtual DOM implementation, specifically the diffing algorithm and the `render` function of components.  Components with complex conditional rendering or large lists are more susceptible. `use_effect` and event handlers that trigger state changes are also key.
**Risk Severity:** High (especially for SSR/Liveview)
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dioxus-Specific Profiling:** Use Dioxus's profiling tools to identify components and rendering paths that are particularly expensive or frequently updated.
    *   **Optimize Diffing:** Carefully structure components to minimize the amount of work required by Dioxus's diffing algorithm. Avoid unnecessary changes to the Virtual DOM. Use keys effectively for lists.
    *   **Debouncing/Throttling (Dioxus Context):** Use debouncing or throttling within Dioxus event handlers and `use_effect` to limit the frequency of state updates that trigger re-renders.
    *   **Memoization (`use_memo`):** Leverage Dioxus's `use_memo` hook to avoid recomputing expensive values that haven't changed, reducing the cost of re-renders within the Dioxus framework.

## Threat: [3.1.3. Component Hijacking (LiveView/SSR): State Override via Compromised Dioxus LiveView Connection](./threats/3_1_3__component_hijacking__liveviewssr__state_override_via_compromised_dioxus_liveview_connection.md)

**Threat:** State Override via Compromised Dioxus LiveView Connection
**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Dioxus LiveView WebSocket connection and sends malicious messages to the server, specifically targeting Dioxus's server-side component state management. The attacker overwrites the state of existing Dioxus components or injects new, malicious components, exploiting how Dioxus handles state synchronization.
**Impact:**
    *   Complete Application Control: The attacker controls the Dioxus UI and application logic through manipulated Dioxus state.
    *   Data Exfiltration: Steal sensitive data displayed by Dioxus components.
    *   Data Manipulation: Modify data managed by Dioxus on the server.
    *   Denial of Service: Crash the Dioxus application or disrupt its functionality.
**Affected Dioxus Component:** The `dioxus-liveview` crate, specifically the WebSocket communication handling and the server-side Dioxus component management logic. Server-side functions that handle client messages related to Dioxus state are critical.
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure WebSocket (WSS):** Always use WSS for Dioxus LiveView connections.
    *   **Strong Authentication (Dioxus Context):** Implement robust authentication specifically for Dioxus LiveView connections, verifying user identity *before* allowing interaction with Dioxus components.
    *   **Message Validation (Dioxus-Specific):** Validate *all* incoming messages from the client on the server-side, treating them as untrusted.  Validate against the expected Dioxus message format and data types *before* updating Dioxus component state.
    *   **Authorization (Dioxus Component Level):** Implement authorization checks to ensure clients can only modify Dioxus components they are authorized to access, based on the Dioxus component ID or other identifiers.
    *   **Input Sanitization (Dioxus State):** Sanitize any data received from the client *before* using it to update Dioxus component state on the server.

## Threat: [3.3.2. Untrusted Client Input to Server Functions: Server-Side Injection via Dioxus Server Functions](./threats/3_3_2__untrusted_client_input_to_server_functions_server-side_injection_via_dioxus_server_functions.md)

**Threat:** Server-Side Injection via Dioxus Server Functions
**Description:** An attacker sends crafted data to a Dioxus server function (`#[server]`), exploiting a vulnerability in how the function handles input.  This is critical because Dioxus server functions provide a direct bridge between client-side actions and server-side logic. The vulnerability could lead to code injection or other server-side attacks *because of the direct connection Dioxus provides*.
**Impact:**
    *   Data Corruption: Modify or delete data.
    *   Code Execution: Execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   Denial of Service: Crash the server.
    *   Data Exfiltration: Steal sensitive data.
**Affected Dioxus Component:** Server functions defined using the `#[server]` macro in Dioxus fullstack applications. The parameters of these functions, and how they interact with the rest of the Dioxus application, are the primary attack surface.
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation (Dioxus Server Function Context):** Implement rigorous input validation on *all* data received from the client within Dioxus server functions. Validate data types, lengths, and formats *before* any processing.
    *   **Parameterized Queries (within Dioxus Server Functions):** If interacting with a database from a Dioxus server function, *always* use parameterized queries or an ORM to prevent SQL injection.
    *   **Command Sanitization (Dioxus Server Function Context):** If executing system commands within a Dioxus server function, meticulously sanitize and validate any user-provided input. Avoid direct string concatenation.
    *   **Least Privilege (for Dioxus Server Process):** Run the Dioxus server process with the least necessary privileges to limit the impact of a successful attack.
    *   **Output Encoding (from Dioxus Server Functions):** If the Dioxus server function returns data that includes user input, ensure proper output encoding to prevent XSS when that data is rendered by Dioxus components.
