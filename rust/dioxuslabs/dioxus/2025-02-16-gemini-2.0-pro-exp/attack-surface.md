# Attack Surface Analysis for dioxuslabs/dioxus

## Attack Surface: [1. Server Function Exploitation (Fullstack)](./attack_surfaces/1__server_function_exploitation__fullstack_.md)

*Description:* Vulnerabilities in `server` functions (Dioxus Fullstack) allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server. This is the most direct and dangerous attack surface specific to Dioxus Fullstack.
*How Dioxus Contributes:* Dioxus *provides* the `server` function mechanism, making this attack surface possible. The vulnerability is in the *implementation* of these functions, but the *existence* of the feature is Dioxus-specific.
*Example:* A `server` function that takes user input and uses it in a database query without sanitization (SQL injection), or uses it to construct a file path (path traversal).
*Impact:* Complete server compromise, data breaches, data modification, denial of service.
*Risk Severity:* **Critical**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:** Treat *all* input to `server` functions as untrusted. Use parameterized queries, validate file paths, and escape/encode data.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run `server` functions with minimal permissions.
    *   **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow standard server-side secure coding guidelines.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
    *   **Auditing and Logging:** Log all `server` function calls and parameters.

## Attack Surface: [2. Client-Side Code Injection via `eval`](./attack_surfaces/2__client-side_code_injection_via__eval_.md)

*Description:* Injection of malicious JavaScript through Dioxus's `eval` function, leading to XSS or other client-side attacks.
*How Dioxus Contributes:* Dioxus *provides* the `eval` function. While `eval` exists in JavaScript generally, Dioxus's specific implementation and its integration with the Rust/WASM environment create a unique attack vector.
*Example:* A component passing unsanitized user input directly to `eval`. `eval(format!("console.log('{}')", user_input));`
*Impact:* Theft of cookies, session hijacking, defacement, redirection, arbitrary code execution in the user's browser.
*Risk Severity:* **High**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Avoid `eval` Whenever Possible:** Use Dioxus's core features instead.
    *   **Strict Input Sanitization:** If `eval` is *unavoidable*, rigorously sanitize and validate all input using a whitelist approach.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP, ideally disallowing `unsafe-eval`.

## Attack Surface: [3. Event Handler Manipulation (Specifically related to Dioxus's event system)](./attack_surfaces/3__event_handler_manipulation__specifically_related_to_dioxus's_event_system_.md)

*Description:* Attackers exploiting vulnerabilities in how Dioxus *specifically* handles events and their associated data. This goes beyond general event manipulation and focuses on the Dioxus event system's implementation details.
*How Dioxus Contributes:* Dioxus has its own event handling system built on top of the browser's events.  Vulnerabilities could exist in how Dioxus manages event propagation, data serialization/deserialization between Rust and JavaScript, or in the internal workings of its event listeners.
*Example:* A hypothetical vulnerability where an attacker could craft a specific event payload that bypasses Dioxus's internal checks and triggers an unintended code path within a Dioxus event handler, *even if the handler itself appears to have basic input validation*. This would be a flaw in Dioxus's event system, not just the application code.  (Note: This is a hypothetical example to illustrate the *type* of vulnerability, not a known issue.)
*Impact:* Bypassing security checks, performing unauthorized actions, data corruption, potentially leading to more severe vulnerabilities.
*Risk Severity:* **High**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Strict Input Validation within Handlers:** Validate *all* data, even if it seems to come from a trusted Dioxus component.
    *   **Avoid Dynamic Event Handler Generation:** Prefer static handlers.
    *   **Rate Limiting and Debouncing:** Prevent event-based abuse.
    *   **Rely on Dioxus Updates:** Since this attack surface is deeply tied to Dioxus's internals, staying up-to-date with the latest Dioxus version is crucial to receive any security patches related to the event system.

## Attack Surface: [4. Websocket Message Manipulation (Dioxus Fullstack - specific to Dioxus's implementation)](./attack_surfaces/4__websocket_message_manipulation__dioxus_fullstack_-_specific_to_dioxus's_implementation_.md)

*Description:* Attackers manipulating websocket messages in a Dioxus Fullstack application, exploiting vulnerabilities in how Dioxus *specifically* handles websocket communication.
*How Dioxus Contributes:* Dioxus Fullstack provides the websocket communication infrastructure.  Vulnerabilities could exist in how Dioxus serializes/deserializes messages, handles connection state, or enforces security policies on the websocket connection.
*Example:* A hypothetical vulnerability where an attacker could bypass Dioxus's intended message format and inject data that is misinterpreted by the server or client, *even if basic message validation is present*. This would be a flaw in Dioxus's websocket handling, not just general websocket security. (Again, a hypothetical example.)
*Impact:* Data breaches, impersonation, denial of service, potentially server compromise.
*Risk Severity:* **High**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Use Secure Websockets (WSS):** Always encrypt the communication.
    *   **Authentication and Authorization:** Authenticate and authorize connections and messages.
    *   **Message Validation (Beyond Basic Checks):** Validate messages *specifically* against the expected format and schema defined by your Dioxus application, looking for anomalies that might indicate a manipulation attempt. This goes beyond simple type checking.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting.
    *  **Rely on Dioxus Updates:** Since this attack surface is deeply tied to Dioxus's internals, staying up-to-date with the latest Dioxus version is crucial.
