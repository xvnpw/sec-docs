# Threat Model Analysis for dioxuslabs/dioxus

## Threat: [DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Virtual DOM Manipulation](./threats/dom-based_cross-site_scripting__xss__via_virtual_dom_manipulation.md)

- **Threat:** DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Virtual DOM Manipulation
  - **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the application's UI by exploiting vulnerabilities in how Dioxus handles user-provided data during virtual DOM updates. If user input is not properly sanitized or escaped before being rendered using Dioxus's rendering mechanisms, the attacker could inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript that will be executed in the user's browser within the application's context.
  - **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser, leading to potential session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the application.
  - **Affected Component:** `rsx!` macro, component rendering logic, any place where user-provided data is dynamically rendered in the UI using Dioxus's rendering functions.
  - **Risk Severity:** High
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Utilize Dioxus's built-in mechanisms for escaping user-provided data when rendering it in the UI.
    - Sanitize user input on the client-side before rendering it using Dioxus components.
    - Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to mitigate the impact of XSS attacks.
    - Regularly review component code for potential injection points within Dioxus rendering logic.

## Threat: [Component-Level Vulnerabilities Leading to Security Issues](./threats/component-level_vulnerabilities_leading_to_security_issues.md)

- **Threat:** Component-Level Vulnerabilities Leading to Security Issues
  - **Description:** Individual Dioxus components might contain vulnerabilities due to coding errors, improper input handling, or insecure state management within the component itself. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to manipulate the component's behavior, access sensitive data managed by the component through Dioxus's state management, or trigger unintended actions within the Dioxus component lifecycle.
  - **Impact:** Varies depending on the component's function, but could include data manipulation, unauthorized access, or denial of service affecting specific parts of the application managed by Dioxus components.
  - **Affected Component:** Individual Dioxus components (e.g., function components, struct components, hooks), custom hooks managing component-specific logic.
  - **Risk Severity:** High
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Treat each Dioxus component as a potential attack surface and implement robust input validation and sanitization within components.
    - Follow secure coding practices when developing Dioxus components, including proper error handling and boundary checks.
    - Implement clear and secure state management within components using Dioxus's state management features.
    - Conduct thorough testing of individual Dioxus components.

## Threat: [Insecure State Management Leading to Data Exposure or Manipulation](./threats/insecure_state_management_leading_to_data_exposure_or_manipulation.md)

- **Threat:** Insecure State Management Leading to Data Exposure or Manipulation
  - **Description:** If application state managed by Dioxus is not handled securely, an attacker could potentially gain access to or manipulate sensitive data stored in the application's state. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in how Dioxus state updates are handled, accessing state that should be protected within the Dioxus component tree, or modifying state in unauthorized ways through Dioxus's state management mechanisms.
  - **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive user data managed by Dioxus, manipulation of application data leading to incorrect behavior or security breaches within the Dioxus application.
  - **Affected Component:** State management mechanisms provided by Dioxus (e.g., `use_state`, `use_ref`, context API).
  - **Risk Severity:** High
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Carefully design the application's state management strategy within Dioxus, considering the sensitivity of the data being stored.
    - Avoid storing sensitive information in easily accessible global state managed by Dioxus if possible.
    - Implement proper authorization checks within Dioxus components when updating state, ensuring only authorized components or actions can modify sensitive data.
    - Consider using immutable state patterns within Dioxus to prevent accidental or malicious modifications.

## Threat: [Event Handler Injection Vulnerabilities](./threats/event_handler_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

- **Threat:** Event Handler Injection Vulnerabilities
  - **Description:** An attacker could potentially inject malicious code through event handlers defined within Dioxus components if user-provided data is used to dynamically construct or manipulate event handlers without proper sanitization within the Dioxus event handling system. This could lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code when the event is triggered by Dioxus.
  - **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), potentially leading to session hijacking or other client-side attacks within the Dioxus application.
  - **Affected Component:** Event handlers within Dioxus components (e.g., `onclick`, `oninput`).
  - **Risk Severity:** High
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Avoid dynamically constructing event handlers using unsanitized user input within Dioxus components.
    - Sanitize and validate any data received from event handlers within Dioxus components before processing it.
    - Be cautious when using dynamic event listeners or callbacks within Dioxus.

## Threat: [Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Injection Vulnerabilities (if applicable)](./threats/server-side_rendering__ssr__injection_vulnerabilities__if_applicable_.md)

- **Threat:** Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Injection Vulnerabilities (if applicable)
  - **Description:** If using Dioxus with server-side rendering, an attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in the server-side rendering process to inject malicious code into the initial HTML rendered by the server using Dioxus's SSR capabilities. This could occur if user-provided data is not properly escaped or sanitized before being included in the server-rendered output generated by Dioxus.
  - **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities that are present from the initial page load, potentially leading to more severe attacks on users of the Dioxus application.
  - **Affected Component:** Server-side rendering logic provided by Dioxus (if implemented), any code responsible for generating the initial HTML using Dioxus's SSR features.
  - **Risk Severity:** High
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Apply standard server-side security best practices, including input validation and output encoding, during the server-side rendering process with Dioxus.
    - Ensure that any user-provided data included in the server-rendered HTML generated by Dioxus is properly escaped to prevent script injection.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in JavaScript Interoperability Code](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_javascript_interoperability_code.md)

- **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in JavaScript Interoperability Code
  - **Description:** If the Dioxus application interacts with JavaScript code (e.g., through `js_sys` or custom JavaScript functions) from within Dioxus components, vulnerabilities in the JavaScript code can be exploited. This could involve XSS vulnerabilities in JavaScript code that handles data passed from WASM by Dioxus, or other security flaws in the JavaScript logic called by Dioxus.
  - **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), other client-side attacks, potential data breaches if sensitive information is handled insecurely in JavaScript called by Dioxus.
  - **Affected Component:** `wasm-bindgen` interop layer used by Dioxus, `js_sys` crate, any custom JavaScript functions used for interoperability called from Dioxus components.
  - **Risk Severity:** High
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Treat the JavaScript interop boundary as a potential attack surface when developing Dioxus components.
    - Thoroughly review and test any JavaScript code used in conjunction with the Dioxus application for security vulnerabilities.
    - Sanitize and validate data passed between WASM and JavaScript at the boundary managed by Dioxus's interop mechanisms.
    - Follow secure coding practices for JavaScript development in code interacting with Dioxus.

## Threat: [Data Exposure through JavaScript Interoperability](./threats/data_exposure_through_javascript_interoperability.md)

- **Threat:** Data Exposure through JavaScript Interoperability
  - **Description:** Sensitive data might be inadvertently exposed to the JavaScript environment through the interoperability layer used by Dioxus, even if the WASM code itself is secure. This could happen if sensitive data is passed to JavaScript functions as arguments from Dioxus components or if JavaScript code can access WASM memory containing sensitive information managed by Dioxus.
  - **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive user data to potentially malicious JavaScript code or browser extensions interacting with the Dioxus application.
  - **Affected Component:** `wasm-bindgen` interop layer used by Dioxus, `js_sys` crate, any custom JavaScript functions used for interoperability called from Dioxus components.
  - **Risk Severity:** High
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Carefully manage the data passed between WASM and JavaScript within Dioxus components.
    - Avoid passing sensitive information to JavaScript unless absolutely necessary from Dioxus code.
    - If sensitive data must be passed, ensure it is handled securely in the JavaScript code and minimize its exposure when interacting with Dioxus.
    - Consider using more secure communication mechanisms if possible for data exchange between Dioxus and JavaScript.
