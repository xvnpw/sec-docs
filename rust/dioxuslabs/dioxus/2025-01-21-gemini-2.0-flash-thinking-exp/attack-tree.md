## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Rendering Logic](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_rendering_logic.md)

*   This node represents the attacker's goal of leveraging weaknesses in how Dioxus renders UI elements to compromise the application. It's critical because successful exploitation here can lead to severe vulnerabilities like XSS.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Rendering](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_rendering.md)

*   This path focuses on injecting malicious scripts into the rendered output. It's high-risk due to the critical impact of XSS, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser.
    *   **High-Risk Path: Inject Malicious HTML/JS through Props:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts input data that, when passed as props to Dioxus components, is rendered without proper sanitization, leading to the execution of malicious JavaScript.
        *   **Mechanism:** This often involves exploiting the use of features like `dangerous_inner_html` or insufficient escaping of user-provided data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious HTML/JS through Props](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_htmljs_through_props.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious HTML/JS through Dynamic Content](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_htmljs_through_dynamic_content.md)

*   **High-Risk Path: Inject Malicious HTML/JS through Dynamic Content:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers manipulate external data sources or user-provided content that Dioxus uses to dynamically generate UI elements. If this data is not sanitized, it can include malicious scripts that are then rendered and executed.
        *   **Mechanism:** This can occur when fetching data from APIs, databases, or processing user input without proper validation and escaping.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Rendering](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos__via_rendering.md)

*   This node represents attacks aimed at making the application unresponsive by overloading the rendering process. It's critical because it can disrupt the application's availability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Excessive Re-renders](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_excessive_re-renders.md)

*   **High-Risk Path: Trigger Excessive Re-renders:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts specific input or state changes that force Dioxus to perform an excessive number of re-renders.
        *   **Mechanism:** This can be achieved by exploiting inefficient component designs, poorly managed state updates, or by triggering rapid and unnecessary state changes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Interactivity and Event Handling](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_interactivity_and_event_handling.md)

*   This node focuses on exploiting how Dioxus handles user interactions and events. It's critical because vulnerabilities here can lead to state manipulation and DoS.

## Attack Tree Path: [State Manipulation via Events](./attack_tree_paths/state_manipulation_via_events.md)

*   **High-Risk Path: State Manipulation via Events:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers craft specific events or sequences of events that manipulate the application's state in unintended and harmful ways.
        *   **Mechanism:** This exploits flaws in the application's state management logic, allowing attackers to trigger state transitions that lead to data corruption, unauthorized actions, or other undesirable outcomes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Event Flooding](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos__via_event_flooding.md)

*   **High-Risk Path: Denial of Service (DoS) via Event Flooding:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker sends a large number of events to the application, overwhelming its event handling mechanism.
        *   **Mechanism:** This is a relatively simple attack that can be executed by repeatedly triggering user interface events or sending API requests that generate events.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Platform-Specific Features (Desktop, Mobile, TUI)](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_platform-specific_features__desktop__mobile__tui_.md)

*   This node represents attacks that leverage the specific capabilities and potential vulnerabilities of the platforms Dioxus targets. It's critical because these vulnerabilities can lead to severe consequences like arbitrary code execution on the user's machine.

## Attack Tree Path: [Desktop-Specific Exploits (e.g., Tauri, Wry)](./attack_tree_paths/desktop-specific_exploits__e_g___tauri__wry_.md)

*   **High-Risk Path & Critical Node: Desktop-Specific Exploits (e.g., Tauri, Wry)**

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Underlying WebView Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_underlying_webview_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **High-Risk Path: Exploit Underlying WebView Vulnerabilities:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in the underlying WebView (like Chromium in Tauri or Wry) that Dioxus uses for rendering desktop applications.
            *   **Mechanism:** This relies on the fact that Dioxus applications inherit the security posture of the WebView. If the WebView has vulnerabilities, attackers can leverage them to execute arbitrary code on the user's system, bypass security restrictions, or access sensitive data.
