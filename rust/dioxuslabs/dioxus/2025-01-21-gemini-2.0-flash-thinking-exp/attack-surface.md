# Attack Surface Analysis for dioxuslabs/dioxus

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Dioxus Component Rendering](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_dioxus_component_rendering.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into the application's UI by exploiting insufficient data sanitization during the rendering of Dioxus components.

**How Dioxus Contributes:** Dioxus renders UI based on data provided to components. If this data originates from untrusted sources and is not properly escaped or sanitized *within the Dioxus component's rendering logic*, it leads to XSS. Dioxus does not automatically escape all data; this is the developer's responsibility within the component definition.

**Example:** A Dioxus component displays user-provided text using a variable directly in the `rsx!` macro without escaping. If the user provides `<script>alert("XSS");</script>`, Dioxus will render this script, causing it to execute in the browser.

**Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser, leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement, or other malicious actions.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Always sanitize or escape user-provided data within Dioxus components before rendering.** Utilize Rust libraries designed for HTML escaping within the `rsx!` macro or before passing data to the rendering logic.
* **Employ Content Security Policy (CSP) headers** to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, mitigating the impact of successful XSS attacks.

## Attack Surface: [JavaScript Interoperability (JS Interop) Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/javascript_interoperability__js_interop__vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities arising from the interaction between Dioxus (Rust/WebAssembly) and JavaScript code.

**How Dioxus Contributes:** Dioxus provides mechanisms to call JavaScript functions from Rust and vice-versa. If data passed from Dioxus to JavaScript is not sanitized *before* the call, or if data received from JavaScript is not validated *after* the call within the Dioxus application, vulnerabilities can arise. Dioxus facilitates this interaction, making it a point of potential exploitation.

**Example:** A Dioxus application uses `js_sys::eval()` to execute JavaScript code based on user input. If the input is not sanitized in the Rust code before being passed to `eval()`, a malicious script can be executed in the browser's context.

**Impact:** XSS vulnerabilities within the JavaScript context, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution if the JavaScript interaction is not carefully managed.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Sanitize data in the Rust code before passing it to JavaScript functions.**
* **Validate data received from JavaScript within the Dioxus application immediately after the interop call.**
* **Minimize the use of dynamic JavaScript execution (like `eval()`) if possible.** If necessary, ensure extremely rigorous sanitization.
* **Carefully review and audit the JavaScript code that interacts with Dioxus.**

## Attack Surface: [Desktop Application Specific Vulnerabilities (if using Dioxus for desktop apps)](./attack_surfaces/desktop_application_specific_vulnerabilities__if_using_dioxus_for_desktop_apps_.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities specific to the desktop environment when using Dioxus to build desktop applications, particularly when interacting with the underlying operating system.

**How Dioxus Contributes:** When Dioxus is used with a desktop renderer (like `dioxus-desktop`), it provides APIs to interact with the operating system (e.g., file system access, system commands). If these APIs are used with unsanitized user input or without proper security considerations *within the Dioxus application code*, it can introduce vulnerabilities.

**Example:** A Dioxus desktop application uses a function to open a file based on a user-provided path. If the path is not validated within the Dioxus code, an attacker could provide a path to a sensitive system file, potentially leading to unauthorized access or modification.

**Impact:** File system access violations, potentially leading to the disclosure or modification of sensitive data. Command injection if Dioxus code directly executes system commands based on unsanitized input.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Sanitize and validate all user input that is used in Dioxus code to interact with the operating system or file system.**
* **Avoid executing external commands based on user input directly within the Dioxus application.** If necessary, use safe and well-vetted libraries and sanitize inputs rigorously.
* **Implement the principle of least privilege for file system access and other OS operations within the Dioxus application.**
