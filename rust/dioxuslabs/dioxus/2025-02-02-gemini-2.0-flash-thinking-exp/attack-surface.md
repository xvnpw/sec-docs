# Attack Surface Analysis for dioxuslabs/dioxus

## Attack Surface: [WASM/JavaScript Interop Serialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/wasmjavascript_interop_serialization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities introduced during the serialization and deserialization of data between Rust/WASM and JavaScript via `wasm-bindgen`. Incorrect handling of data types or untrusted data can lead to exploits.
*   **Dioxus Contribution:** Dioxus applications heavily rely on `wasm-bindgen` for interacting with the browser's JavaScript environment. This interop layer is a critical point where vulnerabilities can be introduced if data handling is not secure.
*   **Example:** A Dioxus application receives user input in JavaScript, passes it to WASM for processing, and then back to JavaScript for DOM manipulation. If the serialization/deserialization process doesn't correctly handle special characters or data types, it could lead to injection vulnerabilities when the data is used in JavaScript (e.g., DOM-based XSS).
*   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), data corruption, potential code execution in the browser depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Strict Data Type Handling:** Carefully define and enforce data types during `wasm-bindgen` interop. Use appropriate data structures and validation on both Rust and JavaScript sides.
        *   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize all user-controlled data before passing it between WASM and JavaScript, especially when dealing with strings or complex data structures.
        *   **Secure Serialization Libraries:** If using custom serialization, ensure the libraries are secure and well-vetted. Prefer using well-established and maintained libraries.
        *   **Code Reviews:** Thoroughly review code involving `wasm-bindgen` interop for potential serialization/deserialization vulnerabilities.
    *   **Users:** Keep browser and application updated. Users have limited direct mitigation for these developer-side vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Unsafe Rust Usage in WASM Context](./attack_surfaces/unsafe_rust_usage_in_wasm_context.md)

*   **Description:** Memory safety vulnerabilities arising from the use of `unsafe` Rust blocks within the Dioxus application or its dependencies, which can be exploited from the WASM environment.
*   **Dioxus Contribution:** While Dioxus itself encourages safe Rust, developers might use `unsafe` blocks for performance optimizations or when interacting with external libraries. If these `unsafe` blocks are not carefully managed, they can introduce memory safety issues exploitable from WASM.
*   **Example:** An `unsafe` block in a Dioxus component or a dependency crate introduces a buffer overflow vulnerability. An attacker could craft malicious input that, when processed by the WASM application, triggers the buffer overflow, potentially leading to code execution or denial of service.
*   **Impact:** Memory corruption, code execution, denial of service, information disclosure.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Minimize `unsafe` Usage:** Avoid `unsafe` Rust blocks whenever possible. If necessary, carefully audit and document the `unsafe` code.
        *   **Memory Safety Tools:** Utilize Rust's memory safety features and tools like `miri` and fuzzing to detect memory safety issues in `unsafe` code.
        *   **Code Reviews and Security Audits:** Thoroughly review and audit code containing `unsafe` blocks, especially in security-sensitive areas.
        *   **Dependency Audits:** Audit dependencies for `unsafe` code and known memory safety vulnerabilities.
    *   **Users:** Keep the application and browser updated. Users rely on developers to address these vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Event Handler XSS in Dioxus Components](./attack_surfaces/event_handler_xss_in_dioxus_components.md)

*   **Description:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities arising from improperly handling user input within Dioxus component event handlers, leading to the injection of malicious scripts into the DOM.
*   **Dioxus Contribution:** Dioxus components use event handlers to respond to user interactions. If these handlers directly render user-controlled data into the DOM without proper sanitization, it can create XSS vulnerabilities within the Dioxus application context.
*   **Example:** A Dioxus component has an input field and an event handler that directly renders the input value into another part of the DOM using `rsx!`. If a user enters `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` in the input field, this script could be executed when the component re-renders.
*   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, and other client-side attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize all user input before rendering it into the DOM within Dioxus components. Use appropriate escaping or sanitization libraries.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong Content Security Policy to mitigate the impact of XSS vulnerabilities, even if they exist in the application code.
        *   **Secure Rendering Practices:** Use Dioxus's features and best practices to ensure secure rendering and avoid directly embedding unsanitized user input into the DOM.
        *   **Regular Security Testing:** Perform regular security testing, including XSS testing, on Dioxus applications.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Use browser extensions that can help mitigate XSS attacks (e.g., NoScript, uMatrix, browser built-in XSS filters - though these are less reliable).
        *   Keep browser updated to benefit from the latest security features and patches.
