# Threat Model Analysis for dioxuslabs/dioxus

## Threat: [Memory Safety Exploitation via Unsafe Rust in Dioxus Core or Components](./threats/memory_safety_exploitation_via_unsafe_rust_in_dioxus_core_or_components.md)

**Description:**  Vulnerabilities arising from `unsafe` Rust code within the Dioxus framework itself or in user-developed components that are compiled into WebAssembly. An attacker could exploit memory safety issues like buffer overflows or use-after-free by crafting specific inputs or interactions that trigger these unsafe code paths within the Dioxus application. This could involve manipulating component props, events, or exploiting weaknesses in Dioxus's internal data structures.
**Impact:** Application crash, unexpected behavior, potential for arbitrary code execution within the WebAssembly sandbox, data corruption, or denial of service. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to bypass intended application logic or gain limited control within the browser environment.
**Dioxus Component Affected:** Rust core runtime, virtual DOM engine (if unsafe code is present there), user-developed components utilizing `unsafe` blocks, any Dioxus module interacting with `unsafe` code.
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Minimize and rigorously audit all `unsafe` Rust code within Dioxus components and application logic.
*   Employ extensive testing and fuzzing, specifically targeting components with `unsafe` code.
*   Utilize Rust's memory safety features and linters (Clippy) to proactively identify potential issues.
*   Keep the Rust toolchain and Dioxus framework updated to benefit from security patches and improvements in memory safety.
*   Favor memory-safe Rust patterns and libraries over `unsafe` operations whenever feasible.

## Threat: [Client-Side XSS Vulnerabilities due to Improper Rendering in Dioxus](./threats/client-side_xss_vulnerabilities_due_to_improper_rendering_in_dioxus.md)

**Description:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities stemming from Dioxus's rendering process. If Dioxus fails to properly sanitize or escape user-provided data when rendering it into the DOM, an attacker can inject malicious scripts. This could occur if vulnerabilities exist in Dioxus's virtual DOM diffing or patching algorithms, or if developers incorrectly use Dioxus APIs in a way that bypasses intended sanitization. An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript through component props, event handlers, or dynamically generated content.
**Impact:** Account compromise, session hijacking, data theft, redirection to malicious websites, defacement of the application, or further exploitation of the user's system. Successful XSS allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser in the context of the Dioxus application.
**Dioxus Component Affected:** Virtual DOM rendering engine, component rendering logic, data binding mechanisms, any component handling user input and rendering it.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly review and test Dioxus components to ensure proper sanitization and escaping of user-provided data during rendering.
*   Strictly adhere to Dioxus's recommended practices for safe attribute and content rendering.
*   Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to provide an additional layer of defense against XSS by restricting script sources and other resource loading.
*   Regularly audit Dioxus application code, especially components that handle and render user input, for potential XSS vulnerabilities.
*   Report any suspected XSS vulnerabilities in Dioxus's core rendering mechanisms to the Dioxus development team.

## Threat: [JavaScript Interop Injection via Dioxus Interop Mechanisms](./threats/javascript_interop_injection_via_dioxus_interop_mechanisms.md)

**Description:** Injection vulnerabilities arising from the interaction between Dioxus (Rust/Wasm) and JavaScript through Dioxus's interop features. If Dioxus's interop mechanisms do not properly sanitize or validate data passed between Rust/Wasm and JavaScript, an attacker could inject malicious code or data during these interop calls. This could involve manipulating data sent from Rust to JavaScript functions or vice versa, leading to XSS or other injection attacks within the JavaScript execution environment.
**Impact:** XSS vulnerabilities, arbitrary JavaScript execution, data manipulation within the JavaScript context, potentially bypassing security controls enforced by the Dioxus application or the browser. Successful exploitation allows attackers to leverage the JavaScript environment to perform actions beyond the intended scope of the Dioxus application.
**Dioxus Component Affected:** JavaScript interop mechanisms provided by Dioxus, data serialization/deserialization logic used in interop, application code utilizing Dioxus interop features.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement rigorous sanitization and validation of all data passed between Rust/Wasm and JavaScript through Dioxus interop.
*   Minimize the amount of data exchanged between Rust/Wasm and JavaScript to reduce the attack surface.
*   Thoroughly review and audit all JavaScript code used in conjunction with Dioxus interop for potential injection vulnerabilities.
*   Utilize secure communication channels and data serialization formats when performing interop calls.
*   Limit the privileges and capabilities of JavaScript code that interacts with Dioxus through interop.
*   Prefer using Dioxus's built-in functionalities over relying heavily on JavaScript interop where possible to minimize the risk.
