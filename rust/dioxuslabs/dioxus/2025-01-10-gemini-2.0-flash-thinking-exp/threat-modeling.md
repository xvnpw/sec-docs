# Threat Model Analysis for dioxuslabs/dioxus

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Improper Rendering](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_improper_rendering.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the application by providing crafted input that is not properly sanitized *by Dioxus* during the rendering process. This could involve submitting data through forms, URL parameters, or other input mechanisms. The injected script would then execute in the victim's browser when the page is rendered.

**Impact:** Successful XSS can lead to various malicious activities, including stealing user session cookies (allowing account takeover), redirecting users to phishing sites, defacing the application, or performing actions on behalf of the user without their knowledge.

**Affected Dioxus Component:** Rendering Engine (specifically the process of translating the virtual DOM to the actual DOM).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure Dioxus's rendering engine inherently escapes HTML entities by default for user-provided data.
* If custom rendering logic or components are used, developers must explicitly sanitize user input before rendering it, being aware of Dioxus's rendering behavior.

## Threat: [State Injection or Manipulation](./threats/state_injection_or_manipulation.md)

**Description:** If vulnerabilities exist in Dioxus's state management system, an attacker might find ways to directly manipulate the application's state outside of the intended update mechanisms *provided by Dioxus*. This could involve exploiting flaws in how state is stored, updated, or accessed within the Dioxus framework.

**Impact:** This could lead to the application entering an inconsistent or compromised state, potentially revealing sensitive information, allowing unauthorized actions, or causing application malfunctions.

**Affected Dioxus Component:** State Management system (e.g., `use_state`, `use_ref`, context providers).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure Dioxus's state management mechanisms are designed to prevent direct external manipulation.
* Follow secure coding practices when updating state, ensuring that updates are performed through the intended Dioxus state management APIs.

## Threat: [Exploiting Unsafe Rust Blocks within Dioxus](./threats/exploiting_unsafe_rust_blocks_within_dioxus.md)

**Description:** If the Dioxus codebase itself uses `unsafe` Rust blocks incorrectly, memory safety vulnerabilities could be introduced. An attacker might be able to trigger these unsafe code paths to cause memory corruption, potentially leading to crashes or arbitrary code execution.

**Impact:** Memory safety vulnerabilities can have severe consequences, potentially allowing for complete control over the application or the user's system.

**Affected Dioxus Component:** Core Dioxus libraries.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thorough code reviews and audits of Dioxus's codebase, focusing on `unsafe` blocks, are crucial.
* The Dioxus project should prioritize memory safety and minimize the use of `unsafe` code.

## Threat: [Serving Outdated WASM Binaries with Known Vulnerabilities (Specific to Dioxus Updates)](./threats/serving_outdated_wasm_binaries_with_known_vulnerabilities__specific_to_dioxus_updates_.md)

**Description:** If an outdated version of the compiled WASM binary, which contains known security vulnerabilities *within the Dioxus framework*, is served to users, the application remains susceptible to those vulnerabilities even if the source code has been patched in a newer Dioxus version.

**Impact:** Users accessing the application with the outdated WASM binary will be vulnerable to the exploits associated with the known Dioxus vulnerabilities.

**Affected Dioxus Component:** Deployment pipeline and server configuration in relation to Dioxus releases.

**Risk Severity:** High (if the outdated version contains critical vulnerabilities).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement a robust deployment pipeline that ensures the latest compiled WASM binary (corresponding to the intended Dioxus version) is always served after updates.
* Follow Dioxus release notes and security advisories to promptly update the framework and redeploy the application.
