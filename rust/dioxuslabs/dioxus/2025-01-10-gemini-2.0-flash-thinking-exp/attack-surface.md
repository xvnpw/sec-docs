# Attack Surface Analysis for dioxuslabs/dioxus

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Dynamic Content Rendering](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_dynamic_content_rendering.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
*   **How Dioxus Contributes:** If user-provided data is directly incorporated into the UI without proper escaping within Dioxus components, the framework will render it as HTML, potentially executing malicious scripts. This is especially relevant when using dynamic content based on user input or external data.
*   **Example:** A comment section where user input is directly rendered using Dioxus's rendering engine without sanitization. A malicious user could inject `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` which would execute in other users' browsers.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, data theft, malware distribution, defacement of the application.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Utilize Dioxus's built-in mechanisms for escaping dynamic content. Ensure all user-provided data is properly escaped before being rendered in the UI. Consider using Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to further restrict the sources from which the application can load resources.
    *   **Users:**  Limited mitigation. Avoid interacting with applications that exhibit suspicious behavior. Keep browsers updated.

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side Logic Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/client-side_logic_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers reverse engineer or manipulate the compiled WASM code to alter application behavior.
*   **How Dioxus Contributes:** Dioxus compiles the UI logic to WebAssembly (WASM) which runs in the browser. While WASM provides some level of obfuscation, it's not a security measure and can be reverse-engineered. Attackers might modify the WASM to bypass security checks or alter application logic.
*   **Example:** Modifying the WASM code of an e-commerce application to change the price of items or bypass payment processing.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized actions, bypassing security controls, financial loss.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Avoid storing sensitive logic or secrets directly in the client-side code. Implement critical security checks on the server-side. Employ code obfuscation techniques (though not a foolproof solution). Regularly review and update dependencies.
    *   **Users:** Limited mitigation. Be cautious of applications that require excessive permissions or exhibit unusual behavior.

## Attack Surface: [Desktop-Specific Risks (if using Dioxus for Desktop Applications)](./attack_surfaces/desktop-specific_risks__if_using_dioxus_for_desktop_applications_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities related to local file system access or operating system API interaction.
*   **How Dioxus Contributes:** When using Dioxus to build desktop applications, the application gains access to the local file system and operating system APIs. If not handled carefully, vulnerabilities can arise in how the application interacts with these resources.
*   **Example:** A Dioxus desktop application allowing users to specify file paths without proper sanitization, leading to path traversal vulnerabilities where attackers can access files outside the intended directory.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized file access, modification, or deletion; potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (for desktop applications)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Apply the principle of least privilege when accessing local resources. Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user-provided file paths. Avoid executing external commands based on user input. Be cautious when interacting with operating system APIs.
    *   **Users:** Grant only necessary permissions to desktop applications. Be wary of applications requesting excessive file system access. Keep your operating system and applications updated.

## Attack Surface: [Supply Chain Attacks through Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/supply_chain_attacks_through_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious code is introduced through compromised dependencies.
*   **How Dioxus Contributes:** Dioxus applications rely on external Rust crates. If any of these dependencies are compromised, malicious code can be injected into the application during the build process.
*   **Example:** A popular Dioxus UI component library is compromised, and a malicious update is released that steals user data.
*   **Impact:**  Wide-ranging impact, potentially leading to data breaches, malware installation, or complete compromise of the application and user systems.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Use dependency management tools to track and verify the integrity of dependencies. Regularly audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities. Consider using tools that perform security scanning of dependencies. Pin dependency versions to avoid unexpected updates.
    *   **Users:** Limited mitigation. Be aware of the reputation of the applications you use. Keep your software updated.
