## Attack Tree Path: [Leaf 1.1.1: Buffer Overflow in Dioxus-Generated WASM:](./attack_tree_paths/leaf_1_1_1_buffer_overflow_in_dioxus-generated_wasm.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits memory safety vulnerabilities in the Rust code that, after compilation to WASM, can lead to writing data beyond allocated buffers. This could overwrite critical data or code within the WASM memory space.
*   **Potential Consequences:** Code execution within the WASM sandbox, potentially leading to control over application logic or data. In some cases, WASM sandbox escapes might be possible, though less common.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Employ memory-safe Rust practices, utilize Rust's borrow checker effectively, use memory-safe libraries, perform rigorous testing and code reviews, and use WASM linters and static analysis tools.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leaf 1.1.2: Logic Errors in Dioxus Core Logic Manifesting in WASM:](./attack_tree_paths/leaf_1_1_2_logic_errors_in_dioxus_core_logic_manifesting_in_wasm.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Flaws in the core Dioxus logic (written in Rust) are not memory-related but lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities after compilation to WASM. This could involve incorrect state transitions, flawed authorization checks, or mishandling of user input.
*   **Potential Consequences:** Bypassing security checks, unauthorized access to data or functionality, denial of service, or unexpected application behavior.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests covering various scenarios and edge cases, conduct thorough code reviews focusing on logic and security implications, and employ static analysis tools to detect potential logic flaws.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leaf 1.2.1: State Poisoning through Unexpected Data Injection:](./attack_tree_paths/leaf_1_2_1_state_poisoning_through_unexpected_data_injection.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker manipulates data inputs or communication channels to inject malicious or unexpected data into the application's state managed by Dioxus. This can lead to the application entering an invalid or insecure state.
*   **Potential Consequences:** Displaying incorrect information, triggering unintended actions, bypassing security checks, or even causing application crashes.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all data that can influence the application state, use type safety and data validation libraries, and enforce data immutability where appropriate.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leaf 1.3.2: Exploiting vulnerabilities in Browser APIs used by Dioxus:](./attack_tree_paths/leaf_1_3_2_exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_browser_apis_used_by_dioxus.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Dioxus, when running in a browser environment, relies on various browser APIs. Attackers can exploit known vulnerabilities in these APIs to compromise the Dioxus application. This could involve issues with DOM manipulation, web storage, or other browser features.
*   **Potential Consequences:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) if DOM manipulation is involved, unauthorized access to local storage or cookies, or other browser-specific attacks.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Stay updated on browser security advisories, understand the security implications of the browser APIs Dioxus utilizes, and implement appropriate security measures to mitigate browser-specific vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leaf 1.3.3: (Desktop Only) Exploiting vulnerabilities in the underlying desktop framework (e.g., Tauri, Electron) if used with Dioxus:](./attack_tree_paths/leaf_1_3_3__desktop_only__exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_the_underlying_desktop_framework__e_g___taur_57eb70ce.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** When Dioxus is used within a desktop framework like Tauri or Electron, vulnerabilities in the framework itself can be exploited to compromise the application. This could involve issues with the framework's API, its interaction with the operating system, or its handling of web content.
*   **Potential Consequences:** Remote code execution on the user's machine, access to the file system, or other operating system-level attacks.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Follow security best practices for the chosen desktop framework, keep the framework updated to the latest secure version, and carefully review the framework's security documentation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leaf 1.3.4: (Desktop Only) Bypassing security restrictions imposed by the desktop environment through Dioxus's interaction with native APIs:](./attack_tree_paths/leaf_1_3_4__desktop_only__bypassing_security_restrictions_imposed_by_the_desktop_environment_through_0943aaaf.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If the Dioxus application interacts with native operating system APIs (directly or through the desktop framework), vulnerabilities in this interaction can allow attackers to bypass security restrictions. This could involve improper permission handling or insecure API calls.
*   **Potential Consequences:** Privilege escalation, unauthorized access to system resources, or execution of arbitrary code on the user's machine.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement proper permission management and validation for any native API calls, follow the principle of least privilege, and thoroughly audit the code interacting with native APIs.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leaf 1.4.3: Injecting malicious components or manipulating component rendering order to bypass security checks:](./attack_tree_paths/leaf_1_4_3_injecting_malicious_components_or_manipulating_component_rendering_order_to_bypass_securi_1fdf1638.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker could potentially inject malicious Dioxus components into the application or manipulate the order in which components are rendered to bypass security checks or introduce malicious functionality. This could exploit vulnerabilities in how components are loaded, managed, or interact with each other.
*   **Potential Consequences:** Execution of malicious code within the application context, bypassing authorization checks, or manipulating the user interface to deceive users.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Carefully manage component dependencies, ensure that only trusted components are rendered, implement security checks within component rendering logic, and validate component integrity.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leaf 2.1.1: Exploiting known vulnerabilities in dependencies:](./attack_tree_paths/leaf_2_1_1_exploiting_known_vulnerabilities_in_dependencies.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Third-party Rust crates used by the Dioxus application may contain known security vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the application.
*   **Potential Consequences:**  The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency, but it could range from information disclosure to remote code execution.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Regularly audit and update dependencies using tools like `cargo audit`, pin dependency versions to avoid unexpected updates, and carefully evaluate the security reputation of dependencies before including them in the project.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leaf 2.1.2: Supply chain attacks targeting Dioxus application dependencies:](./attack_tree_paths/leaf_2_1_2_supply_chain_attacks_targeting_dioxus_application_dependencies.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers compromise a dependency used by the Dioxus application, injecting malicious code into it. When the application builds and uses this compromised dependency, the malicious code is introduced into the application.
*   **Potential Consequences:**  Complete compromise of the application, including data theft, remote code execution, or deployment of malware.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Verify the integrity of downloaded crates, use trusted sources for dependencies, consider using a dependency management tool with security scanning features, and implement mechanisms to detect unexpected changes in dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leaf 2.2.1: Insecure communication between Dioxus WASM and JavaScript:](./attack_tree_paths/leaf_2_2_1_insecure_communication_between_dioxus_wasm_and_javascript.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If the Dioxus application relies on communication between the WASM code and JavaScript, vulnerabilities in this communication channel can be exploited. This could involve passing unsanitized data or exposing sensitive functionality without proper authorization.
*   **Potential Consequences:**  Cross-site scripting (XSS) if JavaScript is used to manipulate the DOM with unsanitized data from WASM, or unauthorized access to WASM functionality from JavaScript.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Sanitize all data passed between WASM and JavaScript, avoid exposing sensitive functionality directly to JavaScript without proper authorization, and use secure communication patterns.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leaf 2.2.2: Vulnerabilities introduced through custom native code integrations (FFI):](./attack_tree_paths/leaf_2_2_2_vulnerabilities_introduced_through_custom_native_code_integrations__ffi_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** When Dioxus applications integrate with native code using Foreign Function Interface (FFI), vulnerabilities in the native code or the FFI boundary can be exploited. This could involve memory safety issues in the native code or insecure data passing between WASM and native code.
*   **Potential Consequences:** Remote code execution in the native context, memory corruption, or other vulnerabilities specific to the native code.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Treat FFI boundaries as security boundaries, thoroughly audit and secure any native code integrated with the Dioxus application, follow secure coding practices for native languages, and carefully validate data passed across the FFI boundary.
