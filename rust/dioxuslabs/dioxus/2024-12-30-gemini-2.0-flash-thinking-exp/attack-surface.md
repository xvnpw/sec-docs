### Key Attack Surface List (Dioxus Specific, High & Critical)

Here's an updated list focusing on high and critical attack surfaces directly involving Dioxus:

* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Insecure Rendering**
    * **Description:**  Injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
    * **How Dioxus Contributes:** If Dioxus components directly render user-provided data or data from untrusted sources without proper sanitization or escaping, it can introduce XSS vulnerabilities. The virtual DOM manipulation, while generally safe, relies on developers using it correctly.
    * **Example:** A user provides `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">` as input, and a Dioxus component renders this string directly into the DOM without escaping. When the browser tries to load the invalid image, the `onerror` event executes the malicious script.
    * **Impact:**  Account takeover, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, data theft, defacement.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Always sanitize and escape user-provided data before rendering it in Dioxus components.** Utilize Dioxus's mechanisms for safe rendering.
        * **Employ Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.**
        * **Avoid directly rendering raw HTML from untrusted sources.**

* **Event Handler Injection**
    * **Description:**  Injecting malicious JavaScript code into event handlers.
    * **How Dioxus Contributes:** If Dioxus allows dynamically creating or modifying event handlers based on user input or external data without proper validation, attackers could inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed when the event is triggered.
    * **Example:** An attacker manipulates a form field that is used to dynamically set an `onclick` handler in a Dioxus component. They inject `'); alert('XSS'); //` into the field, potentially breaking out of the intended string and injecting malicious code.
    * **Impact:**  Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser, leading to actions similar to XSS.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Avoid dynamically generating event handlers based on untrusted input.**
        * **If dynamic event handling is necessary, carefully validate and sanitize the input used to construct the handler.**
        * **Use predefined event handlers and pass data as arguments rather than constructing code strings.**

* **JavaScript Interoperability Vulnerabilities**
    * **Description:** Security flaws arising from the interaction between Dioxus (Rust) code and JavaScript code.
    * **How Dioxus Contributes:** When Dioxus applications need to interact with existing JavaScript libraries or browser APIs, data needs to be passed between the Rust and JavaScript environments. If this data passing is not handled securely, it can introduce vulnerabilities.
    * **Example:** A Dioxus application calls a JavaScript function, passing user-provided data without sanitization. The JavaScript function then uses this data to manipulate the DOM in an unsafe way, leading to XSS.
    * **Impact:**  XSS, code injection, privilege escalation depending on the capabilities of the JavaScript code.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Carefully review and audit any JavaScript code that Dioxus interacts with.**
        * **Sanitize data before passing it to JavaScript functions and validate data received from JavaScript.**
        * **Minimize the amount of direct JavaScript interop if possible.**
        * **Use secure communication patterns between Rust and JavaScript, avoiding direct string manipulation for code execution.**
