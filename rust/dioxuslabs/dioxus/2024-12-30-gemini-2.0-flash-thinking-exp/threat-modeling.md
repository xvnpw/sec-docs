Here is the updated threat list, focusing only on high and critical threats directly involving Dioxus:

- Threat: Server-Side Rendering Injection
  - Description: An attacker can inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code by providing unsanitized user data that is directly incorporated into the HTML generated by Dioxus during server-side rendering (SSR). This injected code will then execute in the browsers of users who access the rendered page.
  - Impact: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.
  - Affected Dioxus Component: Dioxus server-side rendering logic and components that directly render user-provided data on the server.
  - Risk Severity: High
  - Mitigation Strategies:
    - Always sanitize user-provided data before including it in the server-rendered HTML using Dioxus's built-in mechanisms for safe rendering.
    - Avoid manual string concatenation for HTML construction in SSR components.
    - Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of successful XSS attacks.

- Threat: Exposure of Server-Side Secrets in SSR
  - Description: The Dioxus application running on the server might inadvertently include sensitive information (API keys, database credentials, etc.) in the initial HTML payload sent to the client during server-side rendering (SSR). This occurs if sensitive data is directly accessed and rendered within server-side components without proper safeguards.
  - Impact: Compromise of sensitive credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access to backend systems or data.
  - Affected Dioxus Component: Dioxus server-side rendering logic and components that access or handle sensitive information during the rendering process on the server.
  - Risk Severity: Critical
  - Mitigation Strategies:
    - Avoid including sensitive information directly in the server-rendered HTML.
    - Fetch sensitive data client-side after the initial render using appropriate API calls.
    - Utilize environment variables or secure secret management systems on the server to handle sensitive information, ensuring it's not directly embedded in the rendered output.

- Threat: SSR Logic Vulnerabilities
  - Description: Bugs or vulnerabilities within the Dioxus application's server-side rendering logic can be exploited by attackers. This could allow manipulation of the rendering process, access to unauthorized data handled server-side, or even lead to remote code execution on the server if the vulnerabilities are severe enough.
  - Impact: Information disclosure, unauthorized access to server-side resources, or potentially remote code execution on the server.
  - Affected Dioxus Component: The server-side Dioxus application code, its routing mechanisms, and data handling logic within server-side components.
  - Risk Severity: High
  - Mitigation Strategies:
    - Follow secure coding practices when developing the server-side Dioxus application.
    - Conduct thorough testing and code reviews, specifically focusing on the server-side rendering logic.
    - Implement proper authorization and authentication mechanisms on the server to restrict access to sensitive resources and functionalities.

- Threat: Vulnerabilities in JavaScript Interop
  - Description: If the Dioxus application relies on JavaScript interop for certain functionalities, vulnerabilities in how Dioxus manages the communication bridge between WASM and JavaScript can be exploited. An attacker might craft malicious JavaScript that interacts with the Dioxus application in unintended and harmful ways.
  - Impact: Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the browser context, potentially leading to access to browser APIs, manipulation of the Dioxus application's state or behavior, or data theft.
  - Affected Dioxus Component: The `wasm-bindgen` generated code that facilitates JavaScript interop and any Dioxus components that directly interact with JavaScript through this mechanism.
  - Risk Severity: High
  - Mitigation Strategies:
    - Carefully review and sanitize any data passed between WASM and JavaScript at the interop boundary.
    - Minimize the reliance on complex JavaScript interop and prefer WASM-based solutions where possible to reduce the attack surface.
    - Follow secure coding practices for any JavaScript code used in the interop layer.
