# Threat Model Analysis for bytecodealliance/wasmtime

## Threat: [Wasm Sandbox Escape](./threats/wasm_sandbox_escape.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious WebAssembly module that exploits a vulnerability within the Wasmtime runtime's sandboxing implementation. This allows the attacker to break out of the isolated Wasm environment and gain unauthorized access to the host system. They might attempt to execute arbitrary code, access sensitive files, or manipulate system resources.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the host system. The attacker could gain access to sensitive data, install malware, disrupt services, or pivot to other systems on the network.

**Affected Wasmtime Component:** Wasmtime Runtime (specifically the sandboxing implementation and system call interception mechanisms).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep Wasmtime updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Thoroughly vet and audit Wasm modules before execution.
* Implement strong operating system-level security measures.
* Consider using additional layers of sandboxing or virtualization.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Malicious Wasm](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_malicious_wasm.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted Wasm module designed to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, etc.) on the host system. This could be achieved through infinite loops, excessive memory allocations, or other resource-intensive operations within the Wasm module. This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, making the application or even the entire host system unresponsive.

**Impact:** Application or system unavailability, performance degradation, potential crashes.

**Affected Wasmtime Component:** Wasmtime Runtime (specifically the resource management and metering mechanisms).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Configure resource limits within Wasmtime (e.g., maximum memory, execution time).
* Implement timeouts for Wasm module execution.
* Monitor resource usage of Wasm instances.
* Implement mechanisms to isolate or terminate runaway Wasm instances.

## Threat: [Unintended Host Function Calls](./threats/unintended_host_function_calls.md)

**Description:** A malicious Wasm module attempts to call host functions that it is not intended or authorized to access. This could be due to vulnerabilities in the host function interface design *within Wasmtime's handling of host function calls* or flaws in the Wasm module's logic. The attacker could potentially bypass security restrictions and perform unauthorized actions on the host system.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to host resources, potential data breaches, or system manipulation.

**Affected Wasmtime Component:** Host Function Interface (HFI), Wasm Module Linking and Instantiation *within Wasmtime*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement a strict allowlist of host functions that Wasm modules can access *within Wasmtime's configuration*.
* Carefully design and review the host function interface to minimize the attack surface.
* Use capabilities or other fine-grained access control mechanisms for host functions *as configured within Wasmtime*.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Wasmtime Runtime Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_wasmtime_runtime_itself.md)

**Description:** Bugs or security vulnerabilities might exist within the Wasmtime runtime's code itself (interpreter, compiler, core libraries). An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities through a crafted Wasm module or by other means, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the host system or other severe consequences.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the host system, similar to a sandbox escape.

**Affected Wasmtime Component:** Core Wasmtime Runtime (Interpreter, Compiler - Cranelift, etc.).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep Wasmtime updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
* Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases related to Wasmtime.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attacks on Wasm Modules](./threats/supply_chain_attacks_on_wasm_modules.md)

**Description:** If the application loads Wasm modules from untrusted sources, these modules could be malicious and designed to exploit vulnerabilities in Wasmtime or the host environment. The attacker could inject malicious code into the Wasm module during its development or distribution.

**Impact:** Execution of malicious code within the Wasmtime environment, potentially leading to sandbox escape or other attacks.

**Affected Wasmtime Component:** Wasm Module Loading and Instantiation *within Wasmtime*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Only load Wasm modules from trusted and verified sources.
* Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity and authenticity of Wasm modules (e.g., code signing, checksums).
* Perform static analysis or security scanning of Wasm modules before deployment.
