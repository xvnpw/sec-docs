# Attack Surface Analysis for bytecodealliance/wasmtime

## Attack Surface: [Maliciously Crafted Wasm Modules](./attack_surfaces/maliciously_crafted_wasm_modules.md)

*   **Description:**  A Wasm module is intentionally designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the Wasmtime runtime.
*   **How Wasmtime Contributes:** Wasmtime is responsible for parsing, validating, and executing the Wasm module. Vulnerabilities in its parser, validator, or JIT compiler can be triggered by specific bytecode sequences or module structures.
*   **Example:** A Wasm module containing bytecode that triggers a buffer overflow in Wasmtime's JIT compiler, leading to arbitrary code execution on the host.
*   **Impact:**  Can range from denial of service (crashing the Wasmtime process or the entire application) to arbitrary code execution on the host system, potentially compromising sensitive data or the entire system.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust validation of Wasm modules before loading, potentially using static analysis tools or sandboxing the loading process itself.
    *   Keep Wasmtime updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.

## Attack Surface: [Sandbox Escape Vulnerabilities in Wasmtime](./attack_surfaces/sandbox_escape_vulnerabilities_in_wasmtime.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability in Wasmtime itself allows a malicious Wasm module to break out of the intended sandbox and gain access to host system resources or memory.
*   **How Wasmtime Contributes:** Wasmtime is responsible for enforcing the Wasm sandbox. Bugs in its implementation can lead to vulnerabilities that allow escape.
*   **Example:** A bug in Wasmtime's memory management allows a Wasm module to access memory outside of its allocated sandbox region.
*   **Impact:**  Potentially complete compromise of the host system, as the attacker gains the privileges of the Wasmtime process.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Stay vigilant for security advisories and promptly update Wasmtime to the latest patched version.
    *   Consider running Wasmtime with reduced privileges if possible.
    *   Employ additional layers of security around the Wasmtime process, such as sandboxing at the operating system level (e.g., using containers).

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Wasmtime's JIT Compiler](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_wasmtime's_jit_compiler.md)

*   **Description:** Bugs in Wasmtime's Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler can be exploited by carefully crafted Wasm modules to generate malicious native code.
*   **How Wasmtime Contributes:** Wasmtime uses a JIT compiler to translate Wasm bytecode into native machine code for execution. Vulnerabilities in this process can lead to code injection.
*   **Example:** A Wasm module contains bytecode that triggers a type confusion vulnerability in the JIT compiler, allowing the module to execute arbitrary code on the host.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the host system, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Wasmtime updated to benefit from security patches in the JIT compiler.
    *   Consider using Wasmtime's ahead-of-time compilation features (if available and suitable for the use case) to reduce the attack surface of the JIT compiler at runtime.
