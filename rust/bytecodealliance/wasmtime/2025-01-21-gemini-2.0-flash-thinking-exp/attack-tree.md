## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using Wasmtime](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_wasmtime.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents the root of all potential attack paths. Success at this node means the attacker has achieved their objective of executing arbitrary code on the host system via Wasmtime.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Wasmtime Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_wasmtime_vulnerabilities.md)

This node represents attacks that directly target weaknesses within the Wasmtime runtime itself. If successful, the attacker can leverage these vulnerabilities to gain control over the Wasmtime process or the host system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Memory Safety Issues (e.g., buffer overflows, use-after-free)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_memory_safety_issues__e_g___buffer_overflows__use-after-free_.md)

Attackers exploit flaws in Wasmtime's native code (likely Rust) that allow them to write data beyond allocated memory boundaries or access memory that has been freed. This can lead to arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Malformed Wasm Module to Trigger Parser Bugs](./attack_tree_paths/supply_malformed_wasm_module_to_trigger_parser_bugs.md)

Attackers craft a specially designed Wasm module with malformed or unexpected structures that exploit vulnerabilities in Wasmtime's parsing and validation logic. This can lead to crashes, denial of service, or even arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Malicious Wasm Module](./attack_tree_paths/supply_malicious_wasm_module.md)

This node encompasses attacks where the attacker introduces a Wasm module containing malicious code into the application's execution environment. The malicious module, when executed by Wasmtime, performs actions intended by the attacker.

## Attack Tree Path: [Directly Inject Malicious Wasm Module](./attack_tree_paths/directly_inject_malicious_wasm_module.md)

This focuses on scenarios where the attacker can directly provide the malicious Wasm module to the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application Allows Uploading/Specifying Wasm Modules](./attack_tree_paths/application_allows_uploadingspecifying_wasm_modules.md)

The application allows users to upload or specify the path to Wasm modules. An attacker can provide a malicious module that the application then loads and executes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application Fetches Wasm Modules from Untrusted Sources](./attack_tree_paths/application_fetches_wasm_modules_from_untrusted_sources.md)

The application retrieves Wasm modules from external sources that are not adequately vetted or secured. An attacker can compromise these sources and replace legitimate modules with malicious ones.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Input to Load a Different, Malicious Wasm Module](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_input_to_load_a_different__malicious_wasm_module.md)

Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the application's logic that determines which Wasm module to load. By manipulating user input or other parameters, they can trick the application into loading a malicious module instead of the intended one.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in How the Application Constructs Wasm Modules](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_how_the_application_constructs_wasm_modules.md)

If the application dynamically generates Wasm modules, attackers can exploit flaws in the generation process (e.g., injection vulnerabilities) to embed malicious code within the generated module.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Wasmtime Integration and Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_wasmtime_integration_and_configuration.md)

This node represents attacks that exploit weaknesses in how the application integrates with and configures Wasmtime, rather than targeting Wasmtime's core code directly.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Wasmtime Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_wasmtime_configuration.md)

This focuses on vulnerabilities arising from misconfigurations of Wasmtime's settings.

## Attack Tree Path: [Disable Security Features (e.g., sandboxing)](./attack_tree_paths/disable_security_features__e_g___sandboxing_.md)

The application disables crucial security features of Wasmtime, such as sandboxing, allowing malicious Wasm modules to have broader access to system resources and potentially compromise the host.

## Attack Tree Path: [Grant Excessive Permissions to Wasm Modules](./attack_tree_paths/grant_excessive_permissions_to_wasm_modules.md)

The application grants Wasm modules more permissions or capabilities than they need. This expands the attack surface and allows malicious modules to perform more damaging actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Host Function Interfaces](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_host_function_interfaces.md)

This focuses on vulnerabilities related to the interaction between Wasm modules and the host application through defined host functions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Host Functions to Access Sensitive Resources](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_host_functions_to_access_sensitive_resources.md)

Attackers exploit poorly designed or unsecured host functions to gain access to sensitive data, perform unauthorized actions, or bypass security controls within the host application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Host Function Implementations](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_host_function_implementations.md)

Attackers exploit bugs (e.g., memory safety issues, logic errors) within the implementation of the host functions themselves to gain control or cause harm to the host application.
