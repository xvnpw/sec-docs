## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Inject Malicious Module via Input -> Exploit Input Validation Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_inject_malicious_module_via_input_-_exploit_input_validation_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker leverages weaknesses in the application's input handling to inject a malicious Wasm module. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities like path traversal to overwrite legitimate modules or bypassing size limits to upload large, malicious files.
*   **Impact:** Successful injection leads to Wasmtime loading and executing the attacker's code. This can result in code execution within the Wasmtime sandbox, potentially leading to sandbox escape or direct host compromise if host functions are accessible.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Input Validation Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_input_validation_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  The application fails to properly sanitize and validate user-supplied input that determines which Wasm module is loaded or how it's processed.
*   **Impact:** Allows attackers to load arbitrary Wasm code, bypassing intended application logic and security measures, potentially leading to full compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Replace Legitimate Module -> Exploit Weaknesses in Module Management](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_replace_legitimate_module_-_exploit_weaknesses_in_module_management.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker compromises the storage location or delivery mechanism of legitimate Wasm modules and replaces them with malicious ones. This could involve supply chain attacks, compromising servers hosting the modules, or exploiting insecure storage permissions.
*   **Impact:** When the application attempts to load the intended module, it instead loads and executes the attacker's malicious code, leading to full control over the application's execution within the Wasmtime environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Wasm Compilation Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_wasm_compilation_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts a specific Wasm module designed to trigger a bug within Wasmtime's compilation process. This bug could lead to arbitrary code execution during the compilation phase itself, before the Wasm code is even executed.
*   **Impact:**  Direct code execution on the host system with the privileges of the application process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Leverage Known Wasm Vulnerabilities & Trigger Undiscovered Wasm Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_leverage_known_wasm_vulnerabilities_&_trigger_undiscovered_wasm_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit inherent vulnerabilities within the WebAssembly specification or its implementation in Wasmtime. This includes known issues like integer overflows or out-of-bounds memory access, as well as newly discovered vulnerabilities found through techniques like fuzzing and reverse engineering.
*   **Impact:** Can lead to memory corruption within the Wasmtime process, potentially allowing for information leakage, denial of service, or, critically, sandbox escape leading to host code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Application-Provided Host Functions](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_application-provided_host_functions.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The application exposes host functions to the Wasm module, allowing it to interact with the host environment. Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, logic errors) in the implementation of these host functions.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation allows the Wasm module to perform unintended actions on the host system, potentially leading to data breaches, privilege escalation, or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Application-Provided Host Functions](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_application-provided_host_functions.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The application's custom host function implementations contain security flaws that can be triggered by a malicious Wasm module.
*   **Impact:** Provides a direct bridge for the attacker from the Wasm sandbox to the host system, allowing for significant compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Bugs in the Wasmtime Sandbox Implementation](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_bugs_in_the_wasmtime_sandbox_implementation.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers identify and exploit vulnerabilities within Wasmtime's sandbox implementation itself. These bugs allow the malicious Wasm code to break out of the restricted environment and execute code directly on the host system.
*   **Impact:**  Complete bypass of the Wasmtime security model, resulting in arbitrary code execution on the host.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Heap Overflow, Stack Overflow, Use-After-Free, Integer Overflow/Underflow (Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities in Wasmtime)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_heap_overflow__stack_overflow__use-after-free__integer_overflowunderflow__memory_corru_02a1ec77.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** These are classic memory safety vulnerabilities that can exist within Wasmtime's codebase (written in C and Rust). Attackers can craft specific Wasm modules or trigger certain execution paths that cause these memory errors.
*   **Impact:** These vulnerabilities can lead to memory corruption, allowing attackers to overwrite critical data structures or inject malicious code, ultimately leading to arbitrary code execution on the host.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Logic Errors in Wasmtime's Execution Engine](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_logic_errors_in_wasmtime's_execution_engine.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Flaws in the fundamental logic of how Wasmtime interprets and executes WebAssembly instructions. These errors can lead to unexpected behavior that can be exploited for security gains.
*   **Impact:** Can result in various security issues, including incorrect execution of code leading to vulnerabilities, or conditions that enable memory corruption, ultimately allowing for arbitrary code execution.
