# Threat Model Analysis for bytecodealliance/wasmtime

## Threat: [Sandbox Escape via Memory Corruption](./threats/sandbox_escape_via_memory_corruption.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** A malicious Wasm module crafts input or exploits a vulnerability (e.g., buffer overflow, use-after-free) within the Wasmtime runtime's memory management. This allows them to overwrite memory outside the intended Wasm sandbox boundaries.
    *   **How:** The attacker might exploit a bug in how Wasmtime handles memory allocation, deallocation, or access, potentially due to incorrect bounds checking or unsafe pointer manipulation within the runtime's C/C++ code.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the host system where Wasmtime is running. The attacker could execute arbitrary code on the host, access sensitive data, or perform other malicious actions.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   **Component:** Wasmtime Runtime's Memory Management.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Wasmtime updated to the latest version with security patches.
        *   Utilize memory-safe languages where possible within Wasmtime's development.
        *   Employ rigorous testing and fuzzing of Wasmtime's memory management components.
        *   Consider using AddressSanitizer (ASan) and MemorySanitizer (MSan) during Wasmtime development and testing.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Wasmtime's Compiler (Cranelift or other)](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_wasmtime's_compiler__cranelift_or_other_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** A malicious Wasm module exploits a vulnerability in Wasmtime's compiler (e.g., Cranelift) during the compilation process. This could lead to the generation of incorrect or unsafe native code.
    *   **How:** The attacker might craft a specific Wasm module structure or instruction sequence that triggers a bug in the compiler's code generation or optimization phases.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Impact:** Potential for sandbox escape, arbitrary code execution on the host due to the execution of flawed native code.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   **Component:** Wasmtime's Compiler (e.g., Cranelift).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Wasmtime updated to the latest version, which includes compiler bug fixes.
        *   Participate in or support the security auditing and fuzzing efforts of Wasmtime's compilers.
        *   Consider using alternative Wasm compilers if security concerns arise with the default compiler.
