# Attack Surface Analysis for bytecodealliance/wasmtime

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Wasm Module Exploiting Compiler Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/malicious_wasm_module_exploiting_compiler_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** A specially crafted Wasm module is designed to trigger a bug or vulnerability within Wasmtime's compilation process (e.g., in Cranelift).
    *   **How Wasmtime Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Wasmtime's core functionality involves compiling Wasm bytecode into native code. Any vulnerabilities in the compiler itself become a potential attack vector.
    *   **Example:** A Wasm module with a specific sequence of instructions or malformed metadata causes a buffer overflow in the Cranelift compiler during code generation.
    *   **Impact:** Could lead to denial of service (crashing the compilation process), information disclosure (leaking internal compiler state), or potentially even arbitrary code execution on the host system *during compilation*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Wasmtime updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches in the compiler.
        *   Consider using pre-compiled Wasm modules if the source is trusted and the compilation step can be isolated.

## Attack Surface: [Wasm Module Sandbox Escapes](./attack_surfaces/wasm_module_sandbox_escapes.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious Wasm module bypasses the intended security boundaries of the Wasm sandbox and gains unauthorized access to host system resources or memory.
    *   **How Wasmtime Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Wasmtime is responsible for enforcing the Wasm sandbox. Vulnerabilities in the runtime's isolation mechanisms are the direct cause of this attack surface.
    *   **Example:** A bug in Wasmtime's memory management allows a Wasm module to access memory outside of its allocated linear memory region, potentially reading sensitive data or overwriting host application memory.
    *   **Impact:** Can lead to complete compromise of the host application, including data breaches, unauthorized access, and arbitrary code execution on the host system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Wasmtime updated to the latest version, as sandbox escape vulnerabilities are often critical security issues.
        *   Implement robust security reviews and testing of Wasmtime integrations.
        *   Consider using additional layers of security, such as process-level isolation, if the risk is high.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion by Malicious Wasm Module](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_by_malicious_wasm_module.md)

*   **Description:** A Wasm module is designed to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, file handles) on the host system, leading to denial of service for the application or even the entire system.
    *   **How Wasmtime Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Wasmtime executes the Wasm module, and without proper resource management, a malicious module can exploit this.
    *   **Example:** A Wasm module contains an infinite loop or performs excessive memory allocations, causing the host application to become unresponsive or crash due to out-of-memory errors.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, impacting application availability and potentially other services on the same system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure Wasmtime's resource limits (e.g., maximum memory, execution time) appropriately for the expected behavior of the Wasm modules.
        *   Implement timeouts and monitoring for Wasm module execution.
        *   Consider using a watchdog process to detect and terminate runaway Wasm instances.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Unsafe Wasm Features (if enabled)](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_unsafe_wasm_features__if_enabled_.md)

*   **Description:**  Wasmtime allows enabling potentially unsafe features like bulk memory operations or reference types. If enabled without careful consideration, these features can introduce new attack vectors.
    *   **How Wasmtime Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Wasmtime provides the option to enable these features, increasing the complexity and potential for vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** With bulk memory operations enabled, a malicious Wasm module might attempt to perform out-of-bounds memory access or overwrite critical data.
    *   **Impact:** Can lead to sandbox escapes, data corruption, or other security breaches depending on the specific unsafe feature exploited.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid enabling unsafe Wasm features unless absolutely necessary and the implications are fully understood.
        *   If unsafe features are required, implement extra layers of security and validation around their usage.

## Attack Surface: [Supply Chain Vulnerabilities in Wasmtime Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/supply_chain_vulnerabilities_in_wasmtime_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities exist in the dependencies used by Wasmtime (e.g., Cranelift, other Rust crates), which could be exploited indirectly.
    *   **How Wasmtime Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Wasmtime relies on these dependencies, and vulnerabilities in them become part of Wasmtime's overall attack surface.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability is discovered in a specific version of the `cranelift-codegen` crate that Wasmtime uses. An attacker might be able to craft a Wasm module that triggers this vulnerability during compilation.
    *   **Impact:** Can range from denial of service and information disclosure to arbitrary code execution, depending on the severity of the vulnerability in the dependency.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update Wasmtime to the latest version to benefit from updates to its dependencies that include security fixes.
        *   Monitor security advisories for Wasmtime and its dependencies.
