# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for bytecodealliance/wasmtime

## Mitigation Strategy: [Fine-Grained Resource Limits (Wasmtime Config)](./mitigation_strategies/fine-grained_resource_limits__wasmtime_config_.md)

**1. Fine-Grained Resource Limits (Wasmtime Config)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Baseline:** Run the Wasm module under normal operating conditions and monitor its resource usage (CPU, memory, fuel, table elements, etc.).
    2.  **Configure Wasmtime:** Modify the `wasmtime::Config` object before creating the `Engine`.
        *   `set_max_memory(size)`: Set `size` to a value slightly above the observed baseline memory usage, but significantly lower than the system's total memory.
        *   `set_max_table_elements(count)`: Set `count` based on the expected number of indirect function calls.
        *   `set_max_instances(count)`: Limit the number of instances.
        *   `set_max_tables(count)`: Limit the number of tables.
        *   `set_max_memories(count)`: Limit the number of memories.
        *   `set_consume_fuel(true)`: Enable fuel consumption.
        *   `set_fuel_consumed(initial_fuel)`: Set `initial_fuel` to a value that allows for a reasonable execution time, based on testing.  Experiment to find the right balance.
        *   `epoch_interruption`: Enable and configure. Set a reasonable interval (e.g., every 100ms).
    3.  **Implement Fuel Consumption (Host Calls):** Within host functions (WASI or custom), use `Caller::consume_fuel(amount)` to deduct fuel based on the computational cost of the operation.  This requires careful profiling and estimation.
    4.  **Handle Resource Exhaustion:** In your host code, check for `Trap::OutOfFuel` or other resource-related traps after calling Wasm functions.  Handle these gracefully (e.g., return an error, log the event, terminate the instance).
    5.  **Monitor and Adjust:** Continuously monitor resource usage and adjust the limits as needed.
    6. **Custom Resource Limiter:** If needed, implement `ResourceLimiter` trait.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Denial of Service):** (Severity: High) - Prevents a malicious module from consuming excessive CPU, memory, or other resources.
    *   **Infinite Loops:** (Severity: High) - Fuel consumption and epoch interruption prevent infinite loops.
    *   **Excessive Table/Instance/Memory Growth:** (Severity: Medium) - Limits sizes.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Significantly reduces the risk.
    *   **Infinite Loops:** Eliminates the risk.
    *   **Excessive Growth:** Reduces the risk to a manageable level.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `Config::max_memory()` is set in `src/engine.rs`.
    *   Fuel consumption is enabled in `src/engine.rs`.
    *   Epoch interruption is enabled in `src/engine.rs`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `consume_fuel` calls are missing in several host functions in `src/host_functions.rs`.
    *   `max_table_elements`, `max_instances`, `max_tables`, `max_memories` are not currently configured.
    *   Robust error handling for `Trap::OutOfFuel` is partially implemented.
    *   Custom `ResourceLimiter` is not implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict WASI Permissions (WasiCtxBuilder)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_wasi_permissions__wasictxbuilder_.md)

**2. Strict WASI Permissions (WasiCtxBuilder)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Required Capabilities:** Analyze the Wasm module's functionality to determine the *minimum* set of WASI capabilities it needs.
    2.  **Configure `WasiCtxBuilder`:**
        *   `inherit_stdio(false)`: Disable inheritance of standard I/O streams.
        *   `inherit_env(false)`: Disable inheritance of environment variables.
        *   `preopened_dir(dir, guest_path)`:  *Only* pre-open specific directories. Use a dedicated, sandboxed directory. Set appropriate permissions on `dir`. `guest_path` specifies how the directory appears to the Wasm module.
        *   `env(key, value)`: Set only essential environment variables.
        *   `args(args)`: Carefully control the command-line arguments.
    3.  **Avoid Unnecessary Capabilities:** Do *not* grant capabilities like `fd_fdstat_set_flags`, `path_open` with broad permissions, or network access unless absolutely necessary.
    4.  **Review and Audit:** Regularly review the WASI configuration.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized File System Access:** (Severity: High)
    *   **Unauthorized Network Access:** (Severity: High)
    *   **Information Disclosure (Environment):** (Severity: Medium)
    *   **Command Injection:** (Severity: Medium)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized File/Network Access:** Significantly reduces the risk.
    *   **Information Disclosure/Command Injection:** Reduces the risk.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `WasiCtxBuilder` is used in `src/wasi_context.rs`.
    *   A single pre-opened directory is configured.
    *   `inherit_stdio` and `inherit_env` are set to `false`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   The pre-opened directory's permissions might be too permissive.
    *   Audit the `args` passed to the Wasm module.
    *   Consider separate `WasiCtx` instances for different modules.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Wasm Module Validation (Module::validate)](./mitigation_strategies/wasm_module_validation__modulevalidate_.md)

**3. Wasm Module Validation (Module::validate)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Obtain Wasm Bytes:** Load the WebAssembly module's bytecode into a byte vector (`Vec<u8>`).
    2.  **Validate:** Call `Module::validate(&store, &wasm_bytes)`.
    3.  **Handle Errors:** If `Module::validate` returns an error, *do not* proceed. Log the error and reject the module.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malformed Wasm Bytecode:** (Severity: Medium)
    *   **Invalid Wasm Constructs:** (Severity: Medium)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malformed Bytecode/Invalid Constructs:** Eliminates the risk.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `Module::validate` is called in `src/engine.rs`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   None.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Stay Updated (Wasmtime Dependency)](./mitigation_strategies/stay_updated__wasmtime_dependency_.md)

**4. Stay Updated (Wasmtime Dependency)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor Releases:** Regularly check the Wasmtime GitHub repository for new releases and security advisories.
    2.  **Update Promptly:** When a new version of Wasmtime is released (especially with security fixes), update the project's dependency.
    3.  **Test After Update:** Thoroughly test the application after updating Wasmtime.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Wasmtime Vulnerabilities:** (Severity: Variable, potentially High)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Wasmtime Vulnerabilities:** Significantly reduces the risk.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   The project's `Cargo.toml` file specifies the Wasmtime dependency.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A formal process for monitoring releases and applying updates is not yet in place.
    *   Automated testing after Wasmtime updates is not fully implemented.
