# BUSINESS POSTURE

Wasmtime is a standalone wasm-only runtime for WebAssembly and WASI, developed by the Bytecode Alliance. It aims to provide a fast, secure, and efficient way to execute WebAssembly code outside of web browsers. This is crucial for server-side applications, embedded systems, and other environments where WebAssembly's portability and sandboxed execution are beneficial.

Business priorities and goals:

- Provide a secure and reliable runtime for WebAssembly.
- Enable the use of WebAssembly in various non-browser environments.
- Foster the growth and adoption of WebAssembly as a universal runtime.
- Offer a performant alternative to existing runtime solutions.
- Maintain a high level of compatibility with WebAssembly and WASI standards.

Most important business risks:

- Security vulnerabilities in the runtime could lead to exploits and compromise of host systems.
- Performance issues could hinder adoption and limit the applicability of Wasmtime.
- Incompatibility with evolving WebAssembly/WASI standards could fragment the ecosystem.
- Lack of features or tooling could make Wasmtime less attractive than competing solutions.
- Failure to maintain a strong community and contributor base could slow down development and innovation.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls and accepted risks (based on the provided repository and general knowledge of similar projects):

- security control: Sandboxed execution: WebAssembly code runs in a sandboxed environment, limiting its access to the host system. Implemented within the Wasmtime runtime itself.
- security control: Memory safety: WebAssembly's linear memory model and runtime checks help prevent memory corruption vulnerabilities. Implemented within the Wasmtime runtime.
- security control: Control flow integrity: WebAssembly's structured control flow and validation process help prevent control flow hijacking attacks. Implemented within the Wasmtime runtime.
- security control: Regular security audits and code reviews: The Bytecode Alliance likely conducts regular security audits and code reviews to identify and address vulnerabilities. Described in security policies and development practices.
- security control: Fuzzing: Continuous fuzzing is used to discover potential vulnerabilities. Mentioned in the repository and likely integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
- security control: Static analysis: Static analysis tools are used to identify potential security issues during development. Likely integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
- accepted risk: Potential for unknown vulnerabilities: Despite security measures, there's always a risk of undiscovered vulnerabilities in complex software like Wasmtime.
- accepted risk: Reliance on external dependencies: Wasmtime depends on external libraries (e.g., Cranelift, WASI implementations), which could introduce vulnerabilities.
- accepted risk: Performance trade-offs for security: Some security features might introduce performance overhead, which needs to be carefully balanced.

Recommended security controls:

- security control: Implement a comprehensive Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) management system to track all dependencies and their vulnerabilities.
- security control: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure and response process.
- security control: Integrate dynamic analysis tools (e.g., sanitizers) into the testing process.
- security control: Explore formal verification techniques for critical components of the runtime.

Security requirements:

- Authentication: Not directly applicable to the Wasmtime runtime itself, as it executes WebAssembly modules. Authentication would be handled by the application embedding Wasmtime or within the WebAssembly module itself.
- Authorization: Wasmtime should enforce the capabilities-based security model of WASI, restricting access to system resources based on granted capabilities.
- Input validation: Wasmtime should validate WebAssembly modules during loading to ensure they conform to the specification and do not contain malicious code. Input validation within the WebAssembly module is the responsibility of the module's developer.
- Cryptography: Wasmtime itself doesn't provide cryptographic primitives. WebAssembly modules can use WASI-crypto or other WASI extensions for cryptographic operations. Wasmtime should ensure the secure execution of these extensions.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes to protect:

-   Execution of WebAssembly modules: Ensuring the secure and reliable execution of WebAssembly code is the core function of Wasmtime.
-   Development and maintenance of Wasmtime: Maintaining the codebase, addressing vulnerabilities, and adding new features are crucial for the long-term viability of the project.
-   Community engagement: Fostering a strong community of users and contributors is essential for the growth and adoption of Wasmtime.

Data to protect and their sensitivity:

-   WebAssembly modules (provided by users): Sensitivity varies depending on the application. Could contain proprietary code, sensitive data, or intellectual property. Wasmtime's responsibility is to provide a secure execution environment, but the data's confidentiality and integrity within the module are the responsibility of the module's developer.
-   Wasmtime source code: Publicly available, but its integrity is crucial to prevent the introduction of malicious code.
-   Build artifacts: Must be protected from tampering to ensure that users are running trusted versions of Wasmtime.
-   Security reports and vulnerability information: Must be handled confidentially to prevent premature disclosure of vulnerabilities.
