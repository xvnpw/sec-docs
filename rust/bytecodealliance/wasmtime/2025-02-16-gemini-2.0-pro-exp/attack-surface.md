# Attack Surface Analysis for bytecodealliance/wasmtime

## Attack Surface: [Sandbox Escape (Host Code Execution)](./attack_surfaces/sandbox_escape__host_code_execution_.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability in Wasmtime's sandboxing mechanisms (JIT compiler, interpreter, WASI implementation) allows a malicious Wasm module to execute arbitrary code on the host system.
*   **How Wasmtime Contributes:** This is a *direct* attack on the core security guarantees of Wasmtime. Bugs in the code generation, interpretation, or WASI implementation are the primary concern.  This is entirely within Wasmtime's codebase.
*   **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability in Wasmtime's JIT compiler allows a crafted Wasm module to overwrite parts of the host's memory and redirect execution to attacker-controlled code. Or, a vulnerability in a WASI function implementation allows the module to write to arbitrary files on the host.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the host system. The attacker gains the privileges of the process running Wasmtime.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Wasmtime Updated:** Apply security updates to Wasmtime promptly. This is the *most crucial* mitigation.
    *   **Code Audits:** Regularly audit Wasmtime's codebase (and any custom extensions) for security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Fuzzing:** Fuzz test Wasmtime's API and its handling of various Wasm modules to discover potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Additional Sandboxing:** Consider running Wasmtime within a container or virtual machine to provide an additional layer of isolation (this is a mitigation *around* Wasmtime, but helps contain a Wasmtime compromise).

## Attack Surface: [WASI Implementation Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/wasi_implementation_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities exist in Wasmtime's *implementation* of WASI functions, allowing a Wasm module to perform actions beyond its granted capabilities.
    *   **How Wasmtime Contributes:** This is entirely within Wasmtime's responsibility.  The WASI implementation is part of the Wasmtime project.
    *   **Example:** A bug in Wasmtime's `fd_write` implementation could allow writing beyond allocated buffers, potentially leading to a host compromise. Or, a logic error in a file system related WASI function could allow bypassing intended permission checks.
    *   **Impact:** Depends on the specific WASI vulnerability. Could range from information disclosure to data corruption or even arbitrary code execution (if the vulnerability allows escaping the sandbox).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Wasmtime Updated:** Apply security updates to address any vulnerabilities in Wasmtime's WASI implementation.
        *   **Code Audits:** Regularly audit Wasmtime's WASI implementation for security vulnerabilities.
        *   **Fuzzing:** Fuzz test Wasmtime's WASI implementation with various inputs and configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion (Leading to Wasmtime Instability)](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion__leading_to_wasmtime_instability_.md)

*   **Description:** While resource exhaustion *generally* impacts the host, a specific vulnerability *within Wasmtime's resource management* could cause Wasmtime itself to become unstable or crash, even *before* host-level limits are reached.
    *   **How Wasmtime Contributes:** This focuses on bugs *within* Wasmtime's internal handling of memory, CPU, stack, tables, or globals, making it more susceptible to resource exhaustion attacks than it should be.
    *   **Example:** A bug in Wasmtime's garbage collection (if it has one for host-managed resources) could lead to a memory leak *within Wasmtime itself*, causing it to crash even if the Wasm module's memory usage is within configured limits. Or, a bug in the stack unwinding mechanism could lead to a crash during a stack overflow.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service specifically targeting the Wasmtime runtime. This might be more easily exploitable than exhausting *host* resources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Wasmtime Updated:** Apply security updates to address any vulnerabilities in Wasmtime's resource management.
        *   **Code Audits:** Regularly audit Wasmtime's resource management code for security vulnerabilities and potential leaks.
        *   **Fuzzing:** Fuzz test Wasmtime with modules designed to stress its resource management capabilities.
