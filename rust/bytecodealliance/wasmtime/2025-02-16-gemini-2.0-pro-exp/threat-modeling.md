# Threat Model Analysis for bytecodealliance/wasmtime

## Threat: [Sandbox Escape via JIT Compiler Vulnerability](./threats/sandbox_escape_via_jit_compiler_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious WebAssembly module that exploits a vulnerability in Wasmtime's JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler. The module contains specially crafted code that, when compiled, triggers a bug (e.g., a buffer overflow, type confusion) in the JIT, leading to arbitrary code execution *within* the Wasmtime runtime's memory space. The attacker then uses this initial foothold to attempt to escape the sandbox and gain control of the host system.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Complete compromise of the host system, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application running Wasmtime.
        *   Data theft, modification, or deletion on the host system.
        *   Potential for lateral movement to other systems on the network.
    *   **Affected Wasmtime Component:** JIT Compiler (e.g., Cranelift), potentially interacting with the memory management and sandboxing mechanisms.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mitigation:** Keep Wasmtime updated to the latest stable release to receive security patches.
        *   **Mitigation:** Implement strict input validation *before* passing data to the WebAssembly module (reduces the attack surface, though doesn't directly address a Wasmtime bug).
        *   **Mitigation:** Use a separate process for each Wasmtime instance (if feasible) to limit the impact of a successful escape.
        *   **Mitigation:** Employ a robust security monitoring system to detect and respond to unusual activity on the host system.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Infinite Loop (Wasmtime Scheduler/Engine)](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_infinite_loop__wasmtime_schedulerengine_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a WebAssembly module containing an infinite loop (or a very long-running loop) without yielding control.  This consumes excessive CPU cycles within the Wasmtime instance, *specifically exploiting weaknesses in Wasmtime's ability to preempt or limit execution*. This differs from a simple infinite loop; it targets a failure in Wasmtime's resource management.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) of the Wasmtime instance, making it unresponsive.
        *   If other modules are running in the same instance, they are also affected.
        *   Potential impact on the host application if it relies on the Wasmtime instance for critical functionality.
    *   **Affected Wasmtime Component:** Wasmtime's execution engine and scheduler.  The vulnerability lies in Wasmtime's *failure to enforce limits* effectively.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mitigation:** Keep Wasmtime updated to the latest stable release.  This is crucial as it addresses potential scheduler bugs.
        *   **Mitigation:** Configure Wasmtime's instruction limit (fuel metering) to restrict the number of instructions a module can execute.  Ensure this mechanism is *correctly enforced* by Wasmtime.
        *   **Mitigation:** Implement timeouts for WebAssembly module execution within the *host application*, acting as a secondary defense.
        *   **Mitigation:** Monitor CPU usage of Wasmtime instances and take action (e.g., terminate the instance) if limits are exceeded.

## Threat: [Memory Exhaustion via Large Allocation (Wasmtime Memory Management)](./threats/memory_exhaustion_via_large_allocation__wasmtime_memory_management_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a WebAssembly module that attempts to allocate a very large amount of memory within the Wasmtime sandbox.  The threat here is a *failure in Wasmtime's memory management to correctly enforce limits*, allowing the allocation to succeed beyond expected bounds.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) of the Wasmtime instance. The instance may crash or become unresponsive due to Wasmtime's internal memory management failure.
        *   Potential impact on the host application if it relies on the Wasmtime instance.
    *   **Affected Wasmtime Component:** Wasmtime's memory management system. The vulnerability is in Wasmtime's *failure to enforce configured limits*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mitigation:** Keep Wasmtime updated to the latest stable release to address potential memory management bugs.
        *   **Mitigation:** Configure strict memory limits for Wasmtime instances using the `Config::memory_size` or related settings.  Verify that these limits are *correctly enforced* by Wasmtime.
        *   **Mitigation:** Monitor memory usage of Wasmtime instances and take action if limits are approached or exceeded.

## Threat: [Integer Overflow leading to Sandbox Escape (Wasmtime Internals)](./threats/integer_overflow_leading_to_sandbox_escape__wasmtime_internals_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a WebAssembly module that, through carefully constructed input or operations, triggers an integer overflow *within Wasmtime's internal code* (e.g., during bounds checking, memory allocation calculations, or within the JIT compiler). This overflow leads to a vulnerability that allows the attacker to bypass sandbox restrictions and potentially gain arbitrary code execution.  This is distinct from an overflow *within* the WebAssembly module itself; it must be within Wasmtime's code.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Potentially exploitable vulnerabilities, leading to a sandbox escape and arbitrary code execution on the host system.
        *   Unpredictable behavior of the Wasmtime instance.
    *   **Affected Wasmtime Component:**  Wasmtime's internal components that perform arithmetic operations, including memory management, the JIT compiler, and potentially WASI implementations (if the vulnerability is in shared code).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the exploitability of the overflow)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mitigation:** Keep Wasmtime updated to the latest stable release. This is the primary defense.
        *   **Mitigation:** Fuzz testing of the Wasmtime API surface can help identify potential integer overflow vulnerabilities *within Wasmtime*.
