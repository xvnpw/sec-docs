# Attack Surface Analysis for bytecodealliance/wasmtime

## Attack Surface: [JIT Compiler Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/jit_compiler_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Bugs in Wasmtime's Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler leading to memory corruption or arbitrary code execution when compiling WebAssembly.
*   **Wasmtime Contribution:** Wasmtime's JIT compiler is a core component for performance, and its vulnerabilities directly expose the application.
*   **Example:** A malicious Wasm module triggers a JIT compiler bug during compilation, allowing it to overwrite Wasmtime's memory and execute arbitrary code on the host.
*   **Impact:** Sandbox escape, arbitrary code execution on the host system.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Wasmtime to the latest version.
    *   Consider using the interpreter mode if security is paramount and performance is less critical.

## Attack Surface: [Wasm Validation Bypass](./attack_surfaces/wasm_validation_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Flaws in Wasmtime's validation process that allow execution of malformed or malicious Wasm modules intended to be rejected.
*   **Wasmtime Contribution:** Wasmtime's validation is crucial for security; bypasses directly undermine its sandbox guarantees.
*   **Example:** A crafted Wasm module with invalid bytecode bypasses Wasmtime's validation due to a bug. This allows the module to perform unsafe memory operations or escape the sandbox during execution.
*   **Impact:** Sandbox escape, memory corruption, arbitrary code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Wasmtime to benefit from validation bug fixes.
    *   Report any suspected validation bypasses to the Wasmtime project.

## Attack Surface: [Outdated Wasmtime Version](./attack_surfaces/outdated_wasmtime_version.md)

*   **Description:** Using an outdated version of Wasmtime containing known, unpatched security vulnerabilities.
*   **Wasmtime Contribution:**  Direct dependency on Wasmtime means using an old version directly inherits its vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** A publicly disclosed vulnerability exists in Wasmtime version X. An application using version X remains vulnerable, allowing attackers to exploit the flaw via malicious Wasm.
*   **Impact:** Exposure to known vulnerabilities, potentially leading to sandbox escape or arbitrary code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the specific vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Maintain a process for regularly updating Wasmtime.
    *   Monitor Wasmtime security advisories and release notes.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion via Wasm Modules](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_via_wasm_modules.md)

*   **Description:** Wasm modules consuming excessive resources (CPU, memory) within Wasmtime, leading to denial of service of the host application.
*   **Wasmtime Contribution:** Wasmtime executes Wasm and needs to provide resource management; insufficient limits expose the host to resource exhaustion.
*   **Example:** A Wasm module is designed to allocate excessive memory or enter an infinite loop. Wasmtime, without proper configuration, allows this, causing the host application to become unresponsive.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service for the host application.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Configure Wasmtime with resource limits (memory, execution time).
    *   Monitor resource usage of Wasm modules and implement termination mechanisms for abusive modules.

## Attack Surface: [Data Type Mismatches in Host Function Interface (HFI)](./attack_surfaces/data_type_mismatches_in_host_function_interface__hfi_.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrect handling of data types during calls between Wasm modules and host functions by Wasmtime's interface, leading to memory safety issues.
*   **Wasmtime Contribution:** Wasmtime manages the Host Function Interface and data marshaling; errors in this layer can introduce vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** Wasmtime incorrectly handles data type conversion when passing arguments to a host function. This leads to the host function misinterpreting data as a pointer when it's not, causing a crash or exploitable memory access.
*   **Impact:** Crashes, memory corruption, potential for exploitation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use Wasmtime's HFI API correctly and ensure proper type handling in host functions.
    *   Thoroughly test data interactions between Wasm and host functions.

## Attack Surface: [Insufficient Sandboxing Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insufficient_sandboxing_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrect or weak configuration of Wasmtime's sandboxing features, resulting in a less secure execution environment for Wasm modules.
*   **Wasmtime Contribution:** Wasmtime provides sandboxing features, but their effectiveness depends on correct configuration by the user.
*   **Example:**  Wasmtime is configured with overly permissive settings, disabling key sandboxing features. This allows a malicious Wasm module to access host resources or capabilities it should not have access to.
*   **Impact:** Weakened sandbox, potential for sandbox escape and unauthorized access to host resources.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully review and configure Wasmtime's sandboxing options to enforce strong isolation.
    *   Follow security best practices for Wasmtime configuration and deployment.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Code Injection into Wasmtime Project](./attack_surfaces/malicious_code_injection_into_wasmtime_project.md)

*   **Description:**  Compromise of the Wasmtime project itself, leading to malicious code being injected into the Wasmtime codebase.
*   **Wasmtime Contribution:** Direct dependency on Wasmtime means any compromise in the project directly impacts users.
*   **Example:**  Attackers compromise Wasmtime's build infrastructure and inject malicious code into a release. Applications using this compromised Wasmtime version become vulnerable.
*   **Impact:**  Widespread compromise of applications using Wasmtime, arbitrary code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (though low probability for reputable projects)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use official Wasmtime releases from trusted sources.
    *   Verify checksums of downloaded Wasmtime binaries.
    *   Rely on the security practices of the Bytecode Alliance and the open-source community.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Wasmtime Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/compromised_wasmtime_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities or malicious code introduced through third-party dependencies used by the Wasmtime project.
*   **Wasmtime Contribution:** Wasmtime relies on external dependencies; vulnerabilities in these can indirectly affect Wasmtime's security.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability is discovered in a dependency used by Wasmtime. This vulnerability is then exploitable through Wasmtime, even if Wasmtime's core code is secure.
*   **Impact:** Indirect vulnerabilities in Wasmtime, potentially leading to sandbox escape or arbitrary code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Monitor Wasmtime's dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
    *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify vulnerable dependencies.
    *   Keep Wasmtime updated to benefit from dependency updates and security fixes.
