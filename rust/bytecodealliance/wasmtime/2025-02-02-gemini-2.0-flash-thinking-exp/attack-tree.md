## Attack Tree Path: [1. Malicious Wasm Module Injection [HIGH RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/1__malicious_wasm_module_injection__high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Direct Injection [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   If the application allows users or external sources to upload or provide Wasm modules without proper validation, attackers can directly inject malicious modules.
    *   This is a critical node because it's a direct entry point for malicious code into the application's Wasmtime environment.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attack [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    *   If Wasm modules are fetched over insecure networks (e.g., HTTP without integrity checks), attackers can intercept the download and replace legitimate modules with malicious ones.
    *   This path is high-risk when module delivery is not secured.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Wasm Module Designed for Abuse [HIGH RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/2__wasm_module_designed_for_abuse__high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Resource Exhaustion [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    *   Malicious Wasm modules can be designed to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, I/O) within the Wasmtime sandbox, leading to Denial of Service (DoS) for the application or even the host system.
    *   This is high-risk because it's relatively easy to implement in Wasm and can disrupt application availability.
*   **Logic Abuse [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Malicious Wasm modules can exploit the application's logic by interacting with host functions in unintended or malicious ways.
    *   This is a critical node because it allows attackers to manipulate application behavior and potentially bypass security controls through the defined host function interface.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Wasmtime Runtime Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_wasmtime_runtime_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Memory Safety Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Buffer Overflow [CRITICAL NODE]:** Exploiting buffer overflows in Wasmtime's C or Rust code by providing crafted Wasm modules or inputs.
    *   **Use-After-Free [CRITICAL NODE]:** Triggering use-after-free vulnerabilities in Wasmtime's memory management.
    *   These are critical nodes because memory safety vulnerabilities in Wasmtime can lead to arbitrary code execution, sandbox escape, and full host compromise.
*   **Validation Bypass [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Crafting Wasm modules that bypass Wasmtime's validation checks, allowing the execution of invalid or malicious Wasm code.
    *   This is a critical node because bypassing validation undermines a core security mechanism of Wasmtime.
*   **Logic Vulnerabilities in Wasmtime [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Compilation Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:** Triggering vulnerabilities during the Wasm-to-native compilation process.
    *   **Execution Engine Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:** Exploiting bugs in Wasmtime's execution engine.
    *   **Sandboxing Escape [CRITICAL NODE]:** Finding and exploiting weaknesses in Wasmtime's sandboxing mechanisms to break out of the Wasm sandbox.
    *   These are critical nodes because vulnerabilities in Wasmtime's core logic can lead to sandbox escape and host system compromise, bypassing the intended security boundaries.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Host Function Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_host_function_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Vulnerable Host Function Implementation [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Memory Safety Issues in Host Function Code [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** Host functions implemented with memory safety vulnerabilities (buffer overflows, use-after-free, etc.) can be exploited by malicious Wasm modules.
    *   **Logic Bugs in Host Function Code [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** Flaws in the logic of host functions can be exploited to achieve malicious goals.
    *   **Insecure Host Function Design [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** Host functions designed with excessive privileges or unsafe operations can be easily abused.
    *   These are critical nodes because host functions are the primary interface between Wasm modules and the host application, and vulnerabilities here directly expose the host application.
*   **Host Function Abuse via Wasm Module [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Parameter Manipulation [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Malicious Wasm modules can send crafted or malicious parameters to host functions to trigger vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior.
    *   **Sequence of Calls Abuse [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Wasm modules can call host functions in specific sequences or combinations that were not anticipated, leading to vulnerabilities or logic flaws being exposed.
    *   These paths are high-risk because even well-implemented host functions can be abused through parameter manipulation or unexpected call sequences if not carefully designed and validated.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Exploit Wasmtime API Misuse/Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/5__exploit_wasmtime_api_misusevulnerabilities__high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **API Misuse by Application Developer [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Incorrect Configuration [HIGH RISK PATH]:**  Insecure configuration of Wasmtime, such as disabling sandboxing or relaxing security restrictions.
    *   **Improper Resource Management [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Failure to properly configure resource limits for Wasm modules.
    *   **Unsafe API Usage Patterns [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Using Wasmtime API functions in a way that introduces vulnerabilities due to improper error handling or data management.
    *   These paths are high-risk because developer errors in API usage are common and can directly weaken the security of the Wasmtime integration.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Exploit Resource Exhaustion on Host System via Wasmtime [HIGH RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/6__exploit_resource_exhaustion_on_host_system_via_wasmtime__high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Denial of Service via Wasm Module [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Memory Exhaustion (Host) [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Wasm modules indirectly causing host system memory exhaustion.
    *   **CPU Exhaustion (Host) [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Wasm modules indirectly causing host system CPU exhaustion.
    *   **Disk/Network Exhaustion (Host) [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Wasm modules indirectly causing host system disk/network exhaustion (if permitted by host functions).
    *   These paths are high-risk because even within the Wasmtime sandbox, malicious modules can still cause resource exhaustion on the host system, leading to DoS.
*   **Wasmtime Configuration Weakness [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    *   Failure to configure resource limits in Wasmtime, making the application more susceptible to resource exhaustion attacks.
    *   This path is high-risk because it's a common configuration oversight that directly increases the risk of DoS.
