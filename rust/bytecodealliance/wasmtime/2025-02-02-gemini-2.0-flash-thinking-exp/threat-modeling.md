# Threat Model Analysis for bytecodealliance/wasmtime

## Threat: [Malicious WASM Module Execution](./threats/malicious_wasm_module_execution.md)

*   **Threat:** Execution of Untrusted WebAssembly Code
*   **Description:** An attacker provides a crafted WebAssembly module to the application. This module, when executed by Wasmtime, performs malicious actions within the sandbox. This could involve attempting to access restricted resources, exfiltrate data accessible within the sandbox, or cause a denial of service by consuming excessive resources. The attacker might exploit vulnerabilities in host functions or attempt to bypass sandbox restrictions through carefully crafted WASM code, leveraging Wasmtime's execution environment.
*   **Impact:** Data breach (if sensitive data is accessible within the sandbox), denial of service, unauthorized actions within the application's context.
*   **Affected Wasmtime Component:** Wasm Module, Instance, Host Functions (if exploited), Wasmtime Execution Engine
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Source Control:** Only load WASM modules from trusted and verified sources.
    *   **Input Validation:** Implement rigorous validation and sanitization of WASM modules before loading.
    *   **Code Signing & Verification:** Use code signing to ensure module integrity and origin.
    *   **Static Analysis & Vulnerability Scanning:** Employ tools to analyze WASM modules for potential vulnerabilities before deployment.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Minimize the capabilities and resources exposed to WASM modules through host functions and Wasmtime configuration.

## Threat: [Wasmtime Runtime Bug Exploitation](./threats/wasmtime_runtime_bug_exploitation.md)

*   **Threat:** Bugs in Wasmtime Itself
*   **Description:** An attacker leverages a vulnerability present in the Wasmtime runtime engine itself. This could be a memory corruption bug, a logic error in the compiler or interpreter, or a flaw in the API bindings. By crafting a specific WASM module or triggering a particular sequence of operations, the attacker can exploit this bug to escape the WASM sandbox and gain control over the host process, directly exploiting Wasmtime's implementation.
*   **Impact:** Sandbox escape, host process compromise, denial of service, complete system compromise in severe cases.
*   **Affected Wasmtime Component:** Wasmtime Runtime Engine (Interpreter, Compiler, API Bindings)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Wasmtime Updated:** Regularly update Wasmtime to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches.
    *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about Wasmtime security advisories and vulnerability disclosures.
    *   **Fuzzing & Security Testing:** Integrate fuzzing and security testing of Wasmtime into development and testing processes.
    *   **Report Vulnerabilities:** Promptly report any discovered Wasmtime vulnerabilities to the Bytecode Alliance.

## Threat: [Insecure Wasmtime Configuration](./threats/insecure_wasmtime_configuration.md)

*   **Threat:** Incorrect Wasmtime Configuration or Usage
*   **Description:** Developers misconfigure Wasmtime or use its API in a way that weakens security. This could involve overly permissive configurations, improper handling of host function imports within Wasmtime's API, or insecure resource limit settings within Wasmtime's configuration. An attacker could then exploit these misconfigurations to bypass intended security boundaries or gain unintended access, leveraging weaknesses introduced by improper Wasmtime setup.
*   **Impact:** Increased attack surface, weakened sandbox, potential for unauthorized access and actions, denial of service.
*   **Affected Wasmtime Component:** Wasmtime Configuration, API Usage, Host Function Setup within Wasmtime
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Understand Wasmtime Security:** Thoroughly understand Wasmtime's configuration options and security implications.
    *   **Follow Best Practices:** Adhere to Wasmtime's best practices and security guidelines for integration.
    *   **Least Privilege Configuration:** Apply the principle of least privilege when granting permissions and resources to WASM modules through Wasmtime configuration.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Periodically review and audit Wasmtime configuration and integration code for security weaknesses.

## Threat: [Insecure Host Function Imports](./threats/insecure_host_function_imports.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Host Function Imports
*   **Description:** Developers expose overly powerful or insecure host functions to WASM modules through Wasmtime's host function import mechanism. These host functions, if not carefully designed and implemented, can become attack vectors. An attacker can leverage malicious WASM code to call these insecure host functions and bypass sandbox restrictions, access sensitive host resources, or perform actions that should be restricted, exploiting the interface provided by Wasmtime for host-WASM interaction.
*   **Impact:** Sandbox escape, access to sensitive host resources, unauthorized actions on the host system.
*   **Affected Wasmtime Component:** Host Functions (as integrated with Wasmtime), Host Environment Interaction via Wasmtime
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Minimize Host Functions:** Reduce the number and capabilities of host functions exposed to WASM modules to the absolute minimum necessary.
    *   **Secure Host Function Design:** Design and implement host functions with security as a primary concern, including robust input validation, strict access control, and proper error handling.
    *   **Capability-Based Security:** Consider using capability-based security principles to control access to host functions and resources.
    *   **Host Function Audits:** Regularly audit host function implementations for potential vulnerabilities and security flaws.
