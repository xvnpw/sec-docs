## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limits and Sandboxing](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limits_and_sandboxing.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Resource Limits and Sandboxing
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Wasmtime Instance:** When creating a Wasmtime `Instance` or `Store`, configure resource limits using Wasmtime's API. This involves setting limits for:
        *   **Memory:**  Set the maximum memory (in WebAssembly pages, where each page is 64KB) a Wasm module can allocate using `Config::memory_maximum_pages`. This prevents excessive memory consumption.
        *   **Fuel:**  Enable fuel consumption tracking using `Config::consume_fuel(true)`. Then, set a fuel limit for each `Store` using `Store::set_fuel(limit)`. Fuel is a virtual unit consumed by Wasm instructions, effectively limiting execution time and preventing infinite loops or CPU exhaustion.
        *   **Stack Size:**  Limit the maximum stack size for Wasm module execution using `Config::stack_size(size_in_bytes)`. This can prevent stack overflow vulnerabilities.
    2.  **Verify Sandboxing is Active:** Wasmtime's sandboxing is enabled by default. Ensure you are not explicitly disabling it in your configuration. Wasmtime isolates Wasm modules in memory and restricts access to host resources unless explicitly granted through host functions.
    3.  **Monitor Fuel Consumption (Optional but Recommended):**  Use `Store::fuel_consumed()` or `Store::fuel_remaining()` to monitor fuel consumption during Wasm execution. This allows you to detect modules that are consuming excessive resources and potentially identify malicious or inefficient code.
    4.  **Handle Fuel Exhaustion Errors:** Implement error handling to catch `Trap::OutOfFuel` errors that occur when a Wasm module exceeds its fuel limit. Gracefully terminate the module's execution and log the event.
    5.  **Adjust Limits Based on Needs:**  Start with conservative resource limits and adjust them based on the actual resource requirements of your Wasm modules. Regularly review and fine-tune these limits as your application evolves.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (High Severity):** Malicious or buggy Wasm modules can consume excessive CPU or memory, leading to a DoS. Resource limits directly prevent uncontrolled resource consumption by Wasm modules within Wasmtime.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):**  Poorly written or computationally intensive Wasm modules can unintentionally exhaust host resources. Limits prevent accidental resource exhaustion and improve application stability.
    *   **Infinite Loops/Runaway Execution (Medium to High Severity):**  Malicious or buggy Wasm code might contain infinite loops, consuming CPU indefinitely. Fuel limits effectively prevent runaway execution by enforcing a time limit on Wasm execution.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): High risk reduction. Significantly reduces the risk of DoS attacks originating from within Wasm modules executed by Wasmtime.
    *   Resource Exhaustion: Medium risk reduction. Prevents accidental resource exhaustion and improves the overall robustness of the application.
    *   Infinite Loops/Runaway Execution: Medium to High risk reduction. Effectively mitigates the risk of infinite loops and runaway execution within Wasm modules.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Memory limits are partially implemented using `Config::memory_maximum_pages`. Sandboxing is implicitly enabled as we are using default Wasmtime configurations.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Fuel limits are not yet implemented. We need to configure `Config::consume_fuel(true)` and `Store::set_fuel(limit)` to actively limit execution time. Monitoring of fuel consumption and handling of `Trap::OutOfFuel` errors are also missing. Stack size limits are not currently configured.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep Wasmtime Updated](./mitigation_strategies/keep_wasmtime_updated.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Keep Wasmtime Updated
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor Wasmtime Releases:** Regularly check for new Wasmtime releases on the official Wasmtime website, GitHub repository, or package manager (e.g., crates.io for Rust). Pay attention to release notes and security advisories.
    2.  **Subscribe to Security Channels:** Subscribe to Wasmtime's security mailing lists or GitHub security advisories to receive notifications about security vulnerabilities and updates.
    3.  **Establish Update Cadence:** Define a schedule for updating Wasmtime in your project. Consider updating at least when security vulnerabilities are announced or with each stable release.
    4.  **Test Updates Thoroughly:** Before deploying updates to production, rigorously test the new Wasmtime version in a staging environment to ensure compatibility with your application and identify any regressions.
    5.  **Automate Update Process (Recommended):**  Automate the process of checking for and applying Wasmtime updates within your build and deployment pipeline to ensure timely updates and reduce manual effort.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Wasmtime Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Outdated Wasmtime versions may contain publicly known security vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit. Updating Wasmtime patches these vulnerabilities, directly reducing the risk of exploitation.
    *   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities (Medium to High Severity - Reduced Exposure Window):** While updates cannot prevent zero-day vulnerabilities, promptly updating Wasmtime when patches are released minimizes the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit newly discovered vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Wasmtime Vulnerabilities: High risk reduction. Directly eliminates known vulnerabilities within the Wasmtime runtime itself.
    *   Zero-Day Vulnerabilities: Medium to High risk reduction. Reduces the time window during which your application is vulnerable to newly discovered Wasmtime vulnerabilities.
*   **Currently Implemented:** We manually check for Wasmtime updates quarterly and update dependencies. We review release notes but are not subscribed to specific security channels.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Automating the update process and subscribing to Wasmtime security advisories are missing. We need to set up automated checks for new releases and integrate Wasmtime updates into our CI/CD pipeline.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Careful Configuration of Wasmtime Instance](./mitigation_strategies/careful_configuration_of_wasmtime_instance.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Careful Configuration of Wasmtime Instance
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Default Configuration:** Understand the default configuration settings of Wasmtime. Be aware of which features are enabled by default and their security implications.
    2.  **Disable Unnecessary Features:**  If your application does not require certain Wasmtime features or extensions (e.g., specific Wasm proposals, experimental features), consider disabling them in the `Config` object when creating a Wasmtime `Engine`. Reducing enabled features minimizes the attack surface.
    3.  **Configure Memory Settings:**  Beyond memory limits (as in strategy #1), review other memory-related configurations in `Config`, such as initial memory size and maximum instances. Adjust these settings based on your application's memory usage patterns and security needs.
    4.  **Control Wasm Proposals:** Wasmtime supports various WebAssembly proposals (e.g., threads, bulk memory operations). Carefully consider which proposals are necessary for your application and explicitly enable only those required using `Config`. Disabling unnecessary proposals can reduce potential attack vectors.
    5.  **Review Security-Related Configuration Options:**  Consult the Wasmtime documentation for any specific security-related configuration options available in newer versions. Wasmtime might introduce new configuration settings to enhance security over time.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Unnecessary Features (Medium Severity):** Enabling unnecessary Wasmtime features or proposals can increase the attack surface. Vulnerabilities in these features, even if not used by your application's core logic, could potentially be exploited.
    *   **Configuration Errors (Low to Medium Severity):** Incorrect or insecure Wasmtime configuration settings could weaken the security posture of your application. Careful configuration minimizes the risk of such errors.
    *   **Unexpected Behavior due to Enabled Features (Low to Medium Severity):**  Unnecessary features, especially experimental ones, might introduce unexpected behavior or interactions that could have security implications. Disabling them reduces complexity and potential for unforeseen issues.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exploitation of Unnecessary Features: Medium risk reduction. Reduces the attack surface by disabling potentially vulnerable or unnecessary features.
    *   Configuration Errors: Low to Medium risk reduction. Promotes a more secure configuration by encouraging careful review and customization.
    *   Unexpected Behavior due to Enabled Features: Low to Medium risk reduction. Reduces complexity and potential for unexpected interactions by limiting enabled features.
*   **Currently Implemented:** We are using mostly default Wasmtime configurations. We have adjusted memory limits but haven't explicitly reviewed and disabled unnecessary features or proposals.
*   **Missing Implementation:** We need to conduct a thorough review of Wasmtime configuration options, identify features and proposals not required by our application, and explicitly disable them in our `Config` when creating the Wasmtime `Engine`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Monitoring and Logging of Wasm Execution (Wasmtime Context)](./mitigation_strategies/monitoring_and_logging_of_wasm_execution__wasmtime_context_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Monitoring and Logging of Wasm Execution (Wasmtime Context)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Log Wasm Module Events:** Log key events related to Wasm module lifecycle within Wasmtime, such as:
        *   Module instantiation (when a Wasm module is loaded and prepared for execution).
        *   Function calls (especially calls to host functions and entry point functions within Wasm modules).
        *   Module termination (when a Wasm module finishes execution or is terminated due to errors or resource limits).
    2.  **Log Resource Consumption (Fuel, Memory):** If fuel limits are implemented, log fuel consumption events, especially when fuel limits are approached or exceeded. Log memory usage if possible to detect unusual memory allocation patterns.
    3.  **Log Errors and Traps:**  Log any errors or traps that occur during Wasm execution within Wasmtime. This includes `Trap` types like `OutOfFuel`, `MemoryOutOfBounds`, `IntegerOverflow`, etc. These logs can indicate potential security issues or bugs in Wasm modules.
    4.  **Integrate with Host Logging System:** Ensure that Wasmtime-related logs are integrated with your host application's logging system for centralized monitoring and analysis.
    5.  **Analyze Logs for Anomalies:** Regularly analyze Wasm execution logs for suspicious patterns, such as:
        *   Repeated errors or traps from specific Wasm modules.
        *   Unexpectedly high resource consumption.
        *   Frequent calls to sensitive host functions.
        *   Unusual sequences of function calls.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Detection of Malicious Wasm Modules (Medium to High Severity):** Monitoring and logging can help detect malicious Wasm modules by identifying anomalous behavior, resource abuse, or attempts to exploit vulnerabilities.
    *   **Identification of Buggy Wasm Modules (Low to Medium Severity):** Logs can help pinpoint buggy Wasm modules that are causing errors, resource leaks, or unexpected behavior, which could indirectly have security implications.
    *   **Post-Incident Analysis (All Severities):** Logs provide valuable data for post-incident analysis in case of security breaches or application failures involving Wasm modules. They can help understand the sequence of events and identify the root cause.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Detection of Malicious Wasm Modules: Medium to High risk reduction. Improves the ability to detect and respond to malicious activity originating from Wasm modules.
    *   Identification of Buggy Wasm Modules: Low to Medium risk reduction. Facilitates debugging and fixing buggy Wasm modules, indirectly improving security and stability.
    *   Post-Incident Analysis: All Severities. Significantly improves the ability to investigate and learn from security incidents or application failures.
*   **Currently Implemented:** We have basic logging of Wasm module instantiation and termination events in our host application. We do not currently log function calls, resource consumption, or detailed error information from Wasmtime.
*   **Missing Implementation:** We need to enhance our logging to include function calls (especially host function calls), fuel consumption, and detailed error/trap information from Wasmtime. We also need to implement log analysis and anomaly detection mechanisms to proactively identify potential security issues.
