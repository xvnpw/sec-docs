# BUSINESS POSTURE

The Wasmtime project aims to provide a secure, efficient, and embeddable runtime for WebAssembly and WASI. It enables the execution of WebAssembly modules outside of the browser environment, opening up possibilities for server-side applications, embedded systems, and plugin architectures.

- Business priorities:
  - Provide a robust and reliable WebAssembly runtime.
  - Ensure high performance and efficiency in WebAssembly execution.
  - Offer strong security guarantees for executing potentially untrusted WebAssembly code.
  - Enable easy embedding of Wasmtime into various host applications and environments.
  - Foster a vibrant ecosystem around WebAssembly and WASI.

- Business goals:
  - Become the leading standalone WebAssembly runtime.
  - Drive adoption of WebAssembly and WASI in diverse application domains.
  - Establish Wasmtime as a secure and trusted platform for WebAssembly execution.
  - Build a strong community of users and contributors.

- Business risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in the runtime could lead to exploitation when running untrusted WebAssembly code.
  - Performance bottlenecks could hinder adoption in performance-sensitive applications.
  - Lack of compatibility with emerging WebAssembly standards could limit its usefulness.
  - Competition from other WebAssembly runtimes could reduce market share.
  - Insufficient community support could slow down development and adoption.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security controls:
  - security control: Memory safety is a core principle of WebAssembly, which Wasmtime leverages to isolate WebAssembly modules from the host environment and each other. Implemented within the WebAssembly specification and enforced by Wasmtime's execution engine.
  - security control: Capability-based security model through WASI, allowing fine-grained control over WebAssembly module access to host resources. Implemented through WASI API and Wasmtime's WASI implementation.
  - security control: Sandboxing of WebAssembly modules, preventing direct access to host system resources without explicit permission. Implemented by Wasmtime's runtime environment.
  - security control: Regular security audits and vulnerability scanning of the Wasmtime codebase. Described in project's security practices (if publicly available) and general good software development practices.
  - security control: Fuzzing and property-based testing to identify potential vulnerabilities. Part of Wasmtime's testing strategy, likely integrated into CI/CD pipelines.
  - security control: Secure coding practices followed by developers, including code reviews and static analysis. Standard software development practices.

- Accepted risks:
  - accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities to be discovered in the WebAssembly specification or Wasmtime's implementation despite security efforts. Mitigation through proactive security measures and responsive vulnerability handling.
  - accepted risk: Risk of denial-of-service attacks if WebAssembly modules can consume excessive resources. Mitigation through resource limits and monitoring within Wasmtime.
  - accepted risk: Supply chain risks associated with dependencies used by Wasmtime. Mitigation through dependency scanning and management practices.

- Recommended security controls:
  - security control: Implement and enforce resource limits (memory, CPU, execution time) for WebAssembly modules to prevent denial-of-service attacks.
  - security control: Integrate static application security testing (SAST) tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect potential security vulnerabilities in the codebase.
  - security control: Implement dynamic application security testing (DAST) or fuzzing in the CI/CD pipeline to identify runtime vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure and response process to handle security issues effectively.
  - security control: Provide guidance and best practices for users on securely embedding and configuring Wasmtime in their applications.

- Security requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to Wasmtime itself as it's a runtime environment. Authentication is the responsibility of the host application embedding Wasmtime.
  - Authorization: Wasmtime must enforce the WASI capability-based security model to control WebAssembly module access to host resources. Authorization decisions are made based on WASI permissions granted to modules.
  - Input validation: Wasmtime needs to validate WebAssembly modules to ensure they conform to the WebAssembly specification and prevent malicious or malformed modules from causing issues. Input validation should occur during module loading and instantiation.
  - Cryptography: Wasmtime itself might not directly implement cryptographic primitives, but it should support WebAssembly modules that utilize cryptography. Secure handling of cryptographic keys and operations within WebAssembly modules is important, and WASI-crypto (if used) should be implemented securely.

## DEPLOYMENT

Wasmtime can be deployed in various ways depending on the use case. Common deployment scenarios include:

1.  **As a library embedded in host applications:** Host applications link against the Wasmtime library and use its API to execute WebAssembly modules. This is common for applications requiring plugin functionality or embedding WebAssembly for specific tasks.
2.  **As a standalone CLI tool:** Wasmtime CLI can be used to execute WebAssembly modules directly from the command line. This is useful for development, testing, and scripting scenarios.
3.  **As part of a larger platform or service:** Wasmtime can be integrated into cloud platforms, serverless functions, or other services to provide WebAssembly execution capabilities.

For detailed description, let's consider deployment scenario **1. As a library embedded in host applications**.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical business processes:
  - Secure execution of WebAssembly code is the primary critical process. Failure to ensure security could lead to vulnerabilities in applications embedding Wasmtime.
  - Reliable and performant execution of WebAssembly code is also critical for adoption and usability.

- Data being protected and sensitivity:
  - WebAssembly modules themselves are code and potentially contain sensitive logic or algorithms. Intellectual property within modules needs protection.
  - Data processed by WebAssembly modules within the runtime. Sensitivity depends on the application context. Wasmtime aims to provide isolation, but data confidentiality and integrity within modules are application's responsibility.
  - Wasmtime codebase itself. Integrity and confidentiality of the source code are important to prevent malicious modifications and maintain trust.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What are the specific resource limits enforced by Wasmtime (CPU, memory, execution time)? Are these configurable?
  - What SAST/DAST tools are currently used in the Wasmtime CI pipeline?
  - Is there a formal vulnerability disclosure and response process in place for Wasmtime?
  - What are the guidelines and best practices for users embedding Wasmtime securely?
  - Are there specific security certifications or compliance standards that Wasmtime aims to achieve?

- Assumptions:
  - Wasmtime prioritizes security as a core design principle.
  - The development team follows secure coding practices.
  - The project has some form of automated security testing in place.
  - Users embedding Wasmtime are responsible for application-level security controls and configuration.
  - WASI capability-based security is a key mechanism for authorization in Wasmtime.
