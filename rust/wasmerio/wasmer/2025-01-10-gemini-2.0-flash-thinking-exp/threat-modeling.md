# Threat Model Analysis for wasmerio/wasmer

## Threat: [Sandbox Escape via Memory Corruption](./threats/sandbox_escape_via_memory_corruption.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious WebAssembly module that exploits a memory corruption vulnerability within the Wasmer runtime (e.g., buffer overflow, use-after-free). This allows them to overwrite memory outside the module's allocated sandbox, potentially gaining control of the host process or executing arbitrary code on the host system.

**Impact:** Critical. Complete compromise of the host system, including data breaches, malware installation, and denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Wasmer Runtime Core - Memory Management, JIT Compiler (if used).

**Risk Severity:** Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep Wasmer updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
* Utilize Wasmer's security features and configurations to strengthen the sandbox.
* Employ memory-safe languages for host application components interacting with Wasmer.
* Consider using a more restrictive Wasmer configuration if possible.

## Threat: [Abuse of Imported Host Functions](./threats/abuse_of_imported_host_functions.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a WebAssembly module that calls imported host functions in a way that was not intended or validated by the host application. This could involve providing unexpected arguments, calling functions in an incorrect sequence, or exceeding resource limits imposed by the host functions, leading to unintended side effects or vulnerabilities in the host application.

**Impact:** High. Potential for data manipulation, unauthorized actions within the host application, or denial of service of specific host functionalities.

**Affected Component:** Wasmer API - Function Imports, Host Application Code.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly validate all inputs received from WebAssembly modules before processing them in host functions.
* Implement robust error handling in host functions to gracefully handle unexpected input or behavior from modules.
* Apply the principle of least privilege when defining and exposing host functions to WebAssembly modules. Only expose necessary functionality.
* Carefully design the API between the host and WebAssembly modules to prevent misuse.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Wasmer Compiler Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_wasmer_compiler_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a specific WebAssembly module that exploits a vulnerability in Wasmer's JIT compiler (if used). This could lead to the compiler generating incorrect or insecure machine code, potentially allowing for sandbox escape or other malicious actions.

**Impact:** Critical. Potential for arbitrary code execution on the host system, sandbox escape.

**Affected Component:** Wasmer JIT Compiler.

**Risk Severity:** Critical (if JIT is enabled).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep Wasmer updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches for the compiler.
* Consider using the Wasmer interpreter instead of the JIT compiler if security is a primary concern and performance is less critical (trade-off).
* Implement additional security layers around Wasmer execution.

## Threat: [Type Confusion at Import/Export Boundary](./threats/type_confusion_at_importexport_boundary.md)

**Description:** The host application incorrectly handles data types when passing data to or receiving data from WebAssembly modules through imports and exports. This can lead to type confusion vulnerabilities, where the WebAssembly module interprets data in a way that is different from the host application's intention, potentially leading to security flaws.

**Impact:** High. Potential for data corruption, unexpected behavior, or exploitation leading to further vulnerabilities.

**Affected Component:** Wasmer API - Function Imports and Exports, Host Application Code.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enforce strict type checking and validation at the import/export boundary.
* Use well-defined and consistent data structures for communication between the host and WebAssembly modules.
* Employ code generation or serialization libraries to ensure type safety.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Excessive Instantiation](./threats/denial_of_service_via_excessive_instantiation.md)

**Description:** An attacker repeatedly triggers the instantiation of new Wasmer instances or WebAssembly modules, potentially overwhelming the host system's resources (memory, CPU) and leading to a denial of service.

**Impact:** High. Denial of service for the application or even the host system.

**Affected Component:** Wasmer API - Module Instantiation.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement rate limiting on the instantiation of Wasmer instances or modules.
* Monitor resource usage and set appropriate limits.
* Implement authentication and authorization to prevent unauthorized instantiation.
