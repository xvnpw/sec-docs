# Attack Surface Analysis for wasmerio/wasmer

## Attack Surface: [WebAssembly Module Memory Safety Issues](./attack_surfaces/webassembly_module_memory_safety_issues.md)

**Description:** Malicious or buggy Wasm modules can exploit memory safety vulnerabilities within the Wasm sandbox, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or sandbox escapes.

**How Wasmer Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Wasmer is responsible for enforcing the Wasm sandbox. Implementation flaws in Wasmer's memory management or instruction execution could allow these vulnerabilities to be exploited.

**Example:** A Wasm module performs an out-of-bounds write to memory, and a bug in Wasmer's bounds checking allows this write to corrupt memory outside the intended Wasm instance.

**Impact:** Sandbox escape, potential code execution on the host system, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep Wasmer updated to the latest version with security patches.
* Utilize Wasmer's security features and configurations to strengthen the sandbox.
* Isolate Wasmer instances with strong operating system-level sandboxing if possible.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Imported Host Functions](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_imported_host_functions.md)

**Description:** Malicious Wasm modules can exploit vulnerabilities in host functions provided by the application, potentially gaining unauthorized access or control.

**How Wasmer Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Wasmer facilitates the interaction between Wasm modules and host functions. The security of this interaction depends on how Wasmer marshals data and enforces access control.

**Example:** A host function that handles file paths doesn't properly sanitize input, allowing a malicious Wasm module to access arbitrary files on the host system.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, arbitrary file access, remote code execution on the host (depending on the host function's capabilities).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly audit and validate all host functions exposed to Wasm modules.
* Implement robust input validation and sanitization within host functions.
* Follow the principle of least privilege when designing host functions, granting them only the necessary permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Wasmer's JIT Compiler](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_wasmer's_jit_compiler.md)

**Description:** Bugs or vulnerabilities in Wasmer's Just-in-Time (JIT) compiler could be exploited by a malicious Wasm module to execute arbitrary code on the host system.

**How Wasmer Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Wasmer's JIT compiler directly translates Wasm bytecode into native machine code. Vulnerabilities in this process can bypass the Wasm sandbox.

**Example:** A specially crafted Wasm module triggers a bug in the JIT compiler, allowing it to write arbitrary data to memory outside the Wasmer process.

**Impact:** Sandbox escape, remote code execution on the host system.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep Wasmer updated to the latest version, as JIT compiler vulnerabilities are often targeted by security patches.
* Consider using Wasmer's AOT (Ahead-of-Time) compilation if the performance trade-off is acceptable, as it reduces the runtime JIT compilation attack surface.
* Isolate Wasmer instances with strong operating system-level sandboxing.
