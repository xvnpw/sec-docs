## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Wasm Module Handling](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_wasm_module_handling.md)

**1. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Wasm Module Handling (High-Risk Path):**

*   This path encompasses the core functionality of Wasmer: loading and executing WebAssembly modules. If an attacker can manipulate this process, they can achieve significant compromise.
*   **Supply Malicious Wasm Module (Critical Node):**
    *   This is the foundational step for many attacks. The attacker's goal is to get Wasmer to load and execute code they control.
    *   Attack vectors include:
        *   Uploading a malicious module directly (if the application allows it).
        *   Tricking the application into loading a malicious module from a remote source.
        *   Tampering with a legitimate module before it's loaded.
*   **Bypass Module Validation (Critical Node):**
    *   Wasmer performs validation checks on Wasm modules before compilation and execution. Bypassing these checks allows attackers to introduce modules with malicious code or structures that would otherwise be rejected.
    *   Attack vectors include:
        *   Exploiting bugs in Wasmer's validation logic.
        *   Crafting modules with unexpected but technically valid structures that the validator doesn't handle correctly.
*   **Exploit Vulnerabilities During Compilation (High-Risk Path):**
    *   The process of compiling Wasm bytecode to native code can introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   Attack vectors include:
        *   Triggering bugs in Wasmer's compiler (Cranelift or LLVM) that lead to arbitrary code execution on the host system during compilation.
        *   Crafting modules that exploit compiler inefficiencies, leading to excessive resource consumption (Denial of Service).
*   **Exploit Vulnerabilities During Execution (High-Risk Path):**
    *   Even after successful compilation, vulnerabilities can arise during the execution of the Wasm module.
    *   Attack vectors include:
        *   **Achieving Sandbox Escape:** Exploiting flaws in Wasmer's isolation mechanisms to break out of the Wasm sandbox and gain access to the host system's resources. This can involve:
            *   Exploiting bugs in how Wasmer isolates the Wasm module's memory.
            *   Exploiting bugs in Wasmer's emulation of system calls (WASI).
        *   **Triggering Undefined Behavior leading to Exploitable State:** Crafting Wasm code that triggers undefined behavior in the Wasm specification, which can be exploited by Wasmer's runtime. This can involve:
            *   Integer overflows or underflows that lead to memory corruption.
            *   Out-of-bounds memory access within the Wasm linear memory.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Host Function Imports](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_host_function_imports.md)

**2. Exploit Host Function Imports (High-Risk Path, Critical Node):**

*   WebAssembly modules can import functions provided by the host application. This interaction point is a critical area for potential vulnerabilities.
*   Attack vectors include:
    *   **Supplying a Malicious Wasm Module with Crafted Imports:**
        *   Importing host functions with unexpected side effects, allowing the attacker to manipulate the application's state in unintended ways.
        *   Importing host functions that themselves have vulnerabilities, allowing the attacker to trigger those vulnerabilities from within the Wasm module.
    *   **Exploiting Type Confusion or Mismatches in Import Handling:**
        *   Crafting a Wasm module that declares imports with incorrect types compared to the actual host function signatures. This can lead to Wasmer misinterpreting data passed between the Wasm module and the host, potentially causing crashes or exploitable behavior.
