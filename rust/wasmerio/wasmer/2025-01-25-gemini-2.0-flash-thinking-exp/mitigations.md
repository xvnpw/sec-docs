# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for wasmerio/wasmer

## Mitigation Strategy: [Module Source Verification (Wasmer Integration)](./mitigation_strategies/module_source_verification__wasmer_integration_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Digital Signature Generation:** Developers sign WebAssembly modules using a private key before distribution. This process is independent of Wasmer but crucial for this strategy.
    2.  **Public Key Distribution to Wasmer Application:** The corresponding public key is securely embedded within the application code that uses Wasmer, or loaded via secure configuration accessible to the Wasmer application.
    3.  **Signature Verification using Wasmer API:**  Before instantiating a WebAssembly module using Wasmer's API (e.g., `Instance::new`), access the raw byte representation of the module (e.g., from loaded file or memory).
    4.  **External Verification Library/Function:** Utilize an external cryptographic library or implement a custom function *outside* of Wasmer itself to perform the digital signature verification against the module bytes and the distributed public key.
    5.  **Conditional Module Instantiation:** Based on the result of the signature verification, conditionally proceed with instantiating the module using Wasmer. If verification fails, halt module loading and log the error.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Supply Chain Attacks (High Severity)
    *   Module Tampering (High Severity)
*   **Impact:** Significantly reduces the risk of executing malicious WebAssembly code by ensuring modules originate from trusted sources and haven't been altered, leveraging external verification mechanisms alongside Wasmer loading process.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We use HTTPS for module download, but lack cryptographic signature verification integrated with Wasmer loading.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Integration of digital signature verification *before* Wasmer module instantiation. This requires implementing the verification logic and hooking it into our module loading process before calling Wasmer's `Instance::new`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Capability-Based Security Model (Wasmer Imports Control)](./mitigation_strategies/capability-based_security_model__wasmer_imports_control_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Import Review and Minimization:**  When defining imports for Wasmer modules (using `Imports::new()` and related Wasmer API), meticulously review each import.  Minimize the number of imported functions, memories, tables, and globals to the bare minimum required for the module's functionality.
    2.  **Restrict Import Scope via Wasmer API:** Utilize Wasmer's API to precisely define the scope of each import. For example, when importing memory, specify the exact memory object instead of allowing module to access all memory.  For functions, carefully consider the function signature and potential side effects.
    3.  **Secure Host Function Implementation (External to Wasmer, but relevant to Imports):**  While host function implementation is outside Wasmer, ensure that host functions called by Wasmer modules are designed with security in mind. Validate inputs from modules within host functions.
    4.  **Principle of Least Privilege in Wasmer Imports:**  Apply the principle of least privilege when configuring Wasmer imports. Only grant modules the *necessary* capabilities through imports, and nothing more.
    5.  **Regular Import Audit (Application Code Review):** Periodically audit the import definitions in the application code that uses Wasmer to ensure they remain minimal and secure as the application evolves.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Privilege Escalation (High Severity)
    *   Sandbox Escape (High Severity)
    *   Data Leakage (Medium Severity)
*   **Impact:** Significantly reduces the potential impact of a compromised WebAssembly module by strictly limiting its capabilities and access to the host environment *through Wasmer's import mechanism*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We are generally cautious with imports, but lack a formal, systematic review process specifically focused on minimizing Wasmer imports.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Formalize a process for reviewing and minimizing Wasmer imports. This includes documenting the rationale for each import and regularly auditing import definitions in our Wasmer application code.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Runtime Sandboxing and Isolation (Wasmer Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/runtime_sandboxing_and_isolation__wasmer_configuration_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Resource Limit Configuration via Wasmer Store:**  Utilize Wasmer's `Store` configuration options to set resource limits for WebAssembly module execution. This includes setting limits for memory allocation (`Config::memory_allocation_strategy`), stack size, and potentially future Wasmer features for CPU time or other resource limits.
    2.  **Engine Selection for Security (Wasmer Engine Choice):**  Choose a Wasmer engine (e.g., Cranelift, LLVM) that is known for its security and sandboxing capabilities. Research and select the engine that provides the strongest isolation guarantees for your security requirements. Configure engine-specific settings if available through Wasmer's API.
    3.  **Virtual File System (Wasmer-provided, if needed):** If file system access is required, leverage Wasmer's virtual file system features (if implemented and suitable for your use case) to restrict module access to a sandboxed virtual file system instead of the host file system. Configure this through Wasmer's API when setting up imports or module instantiation.
    4.  **Instance-Level Isolation (Wasmer Instance Management):**  Consider creating separate `Instance` objects in Wasmer for different modules or tenants to enhance isolation between modules running within the same Wasmer runtime. Manage these instances appropriately to maintain isolation.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) (High Severity)
    *   Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity)
    *   Cross-Module Interference (Medium Severity)
*   **Impact:** Significantly reduces the risk of resource-based attacks and improves the overall stability and resilience of the application *by leveraging Wasmer's sandboxing and isolation features*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We have basic memory limits configured using Wasmer's `Store`, but engine selection for security and virtual file system usage are not fully explored or implemented.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Comprehensive configuration of Wasmer's `Store` for resource limits beyond basic memory.  Research and selection of the most secure Wasmer engine for our needs.  Exploration and potential implementation of Wasmer's virtual file system if file access is required.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limits and Quotas (Wasmer API Enforcement)](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limits_and_quotas__wasmer_api_enforcement_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Limitable Resources (Wasmer Capabilities):**  Determine which resources can be limited using Wasmer's API and configuration. Currently, this primarily includes memory. Future Wasmer versions may offer more granular control over CPU time, network, etc.
    2.  **Define Default Limits in Wasmer Configuration:** Set default resource limits within the Wasmer `Store` configuration. These defaults should be conservative and apply to all modules unless overridden.
    3.  **Granular Limit Overrides (Application Logic):**  Implement application logic to potentially override default Wasmer resource limits on a per-module or per-instance basis if needed. Use Wasmer's API to adjust limits dynamically based on module requirements or application context.
    4.  **Wasmer API Enforcement:** Rely on Wasmer's runtime to enforce the configured resource limits. Wasmer will automatically terminate or restrict modules that exceed their allocated resources.
    5.  **Monitoring and Logging (Application Level):**  Implement monitoring and logging *within the application* to track resource usage by Wasmer modules. While Wasmer enforces limits, application-level monitoring can provide insights into module behavior and potential resource issues.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) (High Severity)
    *   Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity)
    *   Performance Degradation (Medium Severity)
*   **Impact:** Significantly reduces the risk of resource-based attacks and improves application stability, performance, and resilience *by directly utilizing Wasmer's resource limiting capabilities*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We use basic Wasmer memory limits.  More granular and comprehensive resource limit configuration using Wasmer API is missing.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Expanding resource limits beyond memory using Wasmer's API as features become available. Implementing application-level monitoring of Wasmer module resource usage.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Wasmer Updates (Runtime Maintenance)](./mitigation_strategies/regular_wasmer_updates__runtime_maintenance_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Wasmer Version Tracking:**  Maintain a clear record of the specific Wasmer version integrated into the application.
    2.  **Wasmer Release Monitoring:**  Actively monitor Wasmer's official release channels (GitHub releases, security advisories, mailing lists) for new versions, bug fixes, and security patches.
    3.  **Staging Environment Update and Testing (CI/CD Integration):**  Integrate Wasmer updates into the CI/CD pipeline. Before deploying to production, update Wasmer in a staging environment and perform thorough testing to ensure application compatibility and stability with the new Wasmer version.
    4.  **Automated Update Process (Dependency Management):**  Utilize dependency management tools (e.g., Cargo for Rust, package managers for other languages) to automate the process of updating the Wasmer dependency in the application.
    5.  **Rollback Plan (Version Control and Deployment Strategy):**  Maintain version control of the application and Wasmer dependencies. Have a clear rollback plan in case a Wasmer update introduces unforeseen issues. This might involve reverting to a previous application version with the older Wasmer runtime.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Known Vulnerabilities in Wasmer Runtime (High Severity)
    *   Zero-Day Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity - reduces window of exposure)
*   **Impact:** Significantly reduces the risk of runtime-level vulnerabilities *by ensuring the application uses a patched and up-to-date Wasmer runtime*. This is a direct maintenance strategy for the Wasmer dependency.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We are generally aware of Wasmer updates, but the update process is manual and not fully integrated into CI/CD. Staging testing is sometimes skipped.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Formalize and automate the Wasmer update process within our CI/CD pipeline. Implement consistent staging environment testing for Wasmer updates.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Security Audits and Vulnerability Scanning of Wasmer Runtime (External Assessment)](./mitigation_strategies/security_audits_and_vulnerability_scanning_of_wasmer_runtime__external_assessment_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Leverage Public Wasmer Audits:**  Actively search for and review publicly available security audit reports or vulnerability assessments of the Wasmer runtime conducted by reputable third-party security firms or organizations.  Utilize these reports to understand potential weaknesses in Wasmer.
    2.  **Binary Vulnerability Scanning (Tool-based):**  Employ vulnerability scanning tools to scan the Wasmer runtime binaries (especially if using pre-compiled binaries) for known vulnerabilities in its dependencies or compiled code. This is a tool-based assessment of the Wasmer runtime itself.
    3.  **Consider Commissioning Dedicated Wasmer Audit:**  For high-security applications, consider commissioning a dedicated security audit of the specific Wasmer version and configuration used in your application by a specialized security firm. This provides a tailored and in-depth security assessment of Wasmer in your context.
    4.  **Community Security Monitoring (Information Gathering):**  Actively monitor Wasmer's community channels, security forums, and issue trackers for discussions related to Wasmer runtime security. Stay informed about reported vulnerabilities and security-related discussions within the Wasmer ecosystem.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Undiscovered Vulnerabilities in Wasmer Runtime (High Severity)
    *   Configuration Errors in Wasmer Runtime (Medium Severity)
*   **Impact:** Moderately reduces the risk of runtime-level vulnerabilities *by proactively seeking external assessments and information about Wasmer runtime security*. This is about understanding and addressing potential weaknesses in Wasmer itself.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Minimally implemented. We passively rely on public information and community discussions. Dedicated audits or vulnerability scans of Wasmer are not performed.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Proactive and regular security assessments of the Wasmer runtime. This includes leveraging public audits, performing binary scans, and potentially commissioning dedicated audits for high-security scenarios.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Bug Bounty Programs and Community Engagement (Wasmer Ecosystem Participation)](./mitigation_strategies/bug_bounty_programs_and_community_engagement__wasmer_ecosystem_participation_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Participate in Wasmer Bug Bounties (If Available):**  If Wasmer or related organizations offer bug bounty programs, actively participate by reporting any security vulnerabilities discovered in the Wasmer runtime or related tools.
    2.  **Community Vulnerability Reporting (Responsible Disclosure):**  Establish a clear and responsible process for reporting any security vulnerabilities found in Wasmer to the Wasmer maintainers through their designated security channels (e.g., security mailing list, private issue reporting).
    3.  **Community Security Discussions (Knowledge Sharing):**  Engage in security-related discussions within the Wasmer community. Share security knowledge, ask questions, and contribute to improving the overall security awareness within the Wasmer ecosystem.
    4.  **Support Wasmer Security Initiatives (Community Contribution):**  Consider supporting Wasmer security initiatives, such as contributing to security audits, documentation improvements related to security, or developing security-focused tools for Wasmer.
    5.  **Promote Security Awareness (Internal Team and Community):**  Promote security awareness within your development team regarding Wasmer and WebAssembly security best practices. Encourage developers to be vigilant and report potential security issues.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Undiscovered Vulnerabilities in Wasmer Runtime (High Severity)
    *   Slow Vulnerability Disclosure (Medium Severity)
*   **Impact:** Minimally to Moderately reduces the risk of runtime-level vulnerabilities *by leveraging the collective security expertise of the community and incentivizing vulnerability discovery within the Wasmer ecosystem*. This is about contributing to and benefiting from the broader Wasmer security community.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Minimally implemented. We passively monitor the Wasmer community. Active participation in bug bounties or formal vulnerability reporting processes for Wasmer are lacking.
