## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 JIT Compiler Bugs (Incorrect Code Generation) [CRITICAL] [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_jit_compiler_bugs__incorrect_code_generation___critical___high-risk_.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploiting flaws in the JIT compilation process where the compiler generates incorrect machine code due to bugs in its logic. This can lead to memory corruption vulnerabilities.
*   **Attack Steps:**
    *   **1.1.1.1.1 Craft Malicious WASM Module Triggering the Bug:** The attacker creates a specially crafted WASM module that, when compiled by the JIT, triggers a bug in the compiler, leading to incorrect code generation. This often involves exploiting edge cases, complex control flow, or specific instruction sequences.
    *   **1.1.1.1.2 Exploit Memory Corruption for Code Execution (ROP, etc.):**  The attacker leverages the memory corruption caused by the incorrect code generation to gain control of the program's execution flow. This typically involves techniques like Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) or other exploit methods to redirect execution to attacker-controlled code.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** High
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced/Expert
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.3 Integer Overflow/Underflow in JIT [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_3_integer_overflowunderflow_in_jit__high-risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting integer overflow or underflow vulnerabilities within the JIT compiler's handling of arithmetic operations.  These can lead to incorrect calculations and, consequently, memory corruption.
*   **Attack Steps:**
    *   **1.1.1.3.1 Craft WASM Module with Overflow/Underflow Conditions:** The attacker designs a WASM module that contains arithmetic operations that, when compiled and executed, cause integer overflows or underflows within the JIT compiler itself.
    *   **1.1.1.3.2 Exploit Overflow/Underflow for Memory Corruption:** The attacker uses the resulting incorrect calculations from the overflow/underflow to cause memory corruption, potentially overwriting critical data or control flow structures.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Medium/High
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate/Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium/Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2.1 Buffer Overflows in WASI API Functions [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2_1_buffer_overflows_in_wasi_api_functions__high-risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the implementation of WASI API functions.  These functions are the interface between the WASM module and the host system, and vulnerabilities here can allow the WASM module to escape the sandbox.
*   **Attack Steps:**
    *   **1.2.2.1.1 Craft WASM Module with Malicious Input to WASI Functions:** The attacker creates a WASM module that calls WASI functions with specially crafted input that exceeds the allocated buffer size for those functions.
    *   **1.2.2.1.2 Exploit Buffer Overflow for Code Execution or Memory Corruption:** The attacker leverages the buffer overflow to overwrite adjacent memory, potentially including return addresses or function pointers, to gain control of the program's execution flow.
*   **Likelihood:** Low/Medium
*   **Impact:** High/Very High
*   **Effort:** Medium/High
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate/Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3 Vulnerabilities in Wasmer's Memory Management [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_vulnerabilities_in_wasmer's_memory_management__critical_.md)

* **Description:** This encompasses various memory safety issues *within Wasmer itself*, such as Use-After-Free, Double-Free, and Out-of-Bounds Read/Write errors. These are critical because they can be exploited regardless of the WASM module's intended behavior.  While Rust mitigates many of these, they are still possible due to unsafe code blocks, FFI interactions, or logic errors.
* **Likelihood:** Low (due to Rust)
* **Impact:** Very High
* **Effort:** High
* **Skill Level:** Advanced/Expert
* **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [1.4.2 Incorrect Handling of Untrusted WASM Modules [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_4_2_incorrect_handling_of_untrusted_wasm_modules__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the overarching category for how Wasmer handles potentially malicious WASM modules.  It's the entry point for exploiting vulnerabilities within Wasmer itself.
*   **Attack Steps:**
    *   **1.4.2.1 Load Malicious WASM Module via API:** The attacker uses the Wasmer API to load a malicious WASM module into the Wasmer runtime.
    *   **1.4.2.2 Malicious Module Exploits Wasmer Internals:** The loaded WASM module then proceeds to exploit one or more of the vulnerabilities described in sections 1.1, 1.2, or 1.3.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Low (to load the module; effort for exploitation depends on the specific vulnerability)
*   **Skill Level:** Variable (depends on the vulnerability being exploited)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (requires analyzing the WASM module)

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.2 Compromised Legitimate Dependency [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_2_compromised_legitimate_dependency__high-risk_.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker compromises a legitimate, trusted dependency that Wasmer uses. This introduces a vulnerability into Wasmer through its dependency chain.
*   **Attack Steps:**
    *   **2.1.2.1 Attacker Compromises Upstream Dependency:** The attacker gains control of a library or package that Wasmer depends on, either directly or through another compromised dependency.
    *   **2.1.2.2 Wasmer Pulls Compromised Dependency, Introducing Vulnerability:**  When Wasmer is built or updated, it pulls in the compromised dependency, unknowingly incorporating the attacker's malicious code.
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** High/Very High
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced/Expert
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2 Compromised Wasmer Build Process [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_compromised_wasmer_build_process__critical_.md)

* **Description:** An attacker gains access to the Wasmer build infrastructure and injects malicious code directly into the Wasmer binaries during the build process. This is a highly impactful but also very difficult attack.
* **Likelihood:** Very Low
* **Impact:** Very High
* **Effort:** Very High
* **Skill Level:** Expert
* **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard
