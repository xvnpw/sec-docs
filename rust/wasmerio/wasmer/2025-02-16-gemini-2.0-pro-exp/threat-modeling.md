# Threat Model Analysis for wasmerio/wasmer

## Threat: [Sandbox Escape](./threats/sandbox_escape.md)

*   **Threat:** Sandbox Escape
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious WebAssembly module that exploits a vulnerability in Wasmer's sandboxing implementation (e.g., a bug in the memory management, instruction validation, or system call handling). The attacker's goal is to gain unauthorized access to the host system. This is a flaw *within Wasmer*.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise. The attacker could read, write, or execute arbitrary code on the host, potentially gaining full control over the machine running Wasmer.
    *   **Affected Wasmer Component:** Core runtime, memory management, sandboxing mechanisms (e.g., `wasmer-compiler`, `wasmer-engine`, `wasmer-wasi` if WASI is enabled).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Update Wasmer:** Immediately apply security updates released by the Wasmer project. This is the *primary* mitigation.
        *   **Disable Unnecessary Features:** If WASI or other optional features are not required, disable them to reduce the attack surface.
        *   **Host-Level Security:** Implement strong host-level security measures (e.g., process isolation, least privilege, SELinux/AppArmor) to limit the damage even if an escape occurs.  This is a *secondary* mitigation, as it doesn't prevent the escape itself.
        *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Regularly check for Wasmer security advisories and CVEs.

## Threat: [Wasmer Runtime Denial of Service (DoS)](./threats/wasmer_runtime_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Threat:** Wasmer Runtime Denial of Service (DoS)
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a WebAssembly module that exploits a vulnerability *in Wasmer itself* (e.g., a bug that causes excessive memory allocation or an infinite loop *within the runtime*) to cause the Wasmer runtime to crash or become unresponsive. This is distinct from a module simply consuming its allowed resources.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service for the host application. The application embedding Wasmer becomes unavailable.
    *   **Affected Wasmer Component:** Core runtime, compiler, potentially specific engine implementations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Update Wasmer:** Apply security updates. This is the *primary* mitigation.
        *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Check for Wasmer-specific DoS vulnerabilities.
        *   **Resource Limits (Runtime):**  If possible (and supported by the specific Wasmer configuration), configure Wasmer to limit its *own* resource usage. This is distinct from limiting the resources of individual modules.
        *   **Host-Level Monitoring:** Monitor the resource usage of the Wasmer process itself.

## Threat: [Compromised Wasmer Build](./threats/compromised_wasmer_build.md)

*   **Threat:** Compromised Wasmer Build
    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises the Wasmer build process and injects malicious code into the Wasmer runtime itself. This is a supply chain attack *targeting Wasmer directly*.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise. The attacker could control any application using the compromised Wasmer build.
    *   **Affected Wasmer Component:** The entire Wasmer runtime.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Official Sources:** Download Wasmer *only* from official sources (e.g., the official GitHub repository, official releases).
        *   **Checksum Verification:** Verify the integrity of downloaded binaries using checksums (e.g., SHA-256) provided by the Wasmer project.  This is *crucial*.
        *   **Build from Source (Advanced):** Consider building Wasmer from source after careful code review. This is a more advanced mitigation for experienced developers.
