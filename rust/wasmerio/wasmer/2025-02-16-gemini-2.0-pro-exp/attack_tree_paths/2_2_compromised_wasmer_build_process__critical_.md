# Deep Analysis: Compromised Wasmer Build Process (Attack Tree Path 2.2)

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the attack path "Compromised Wasmer Build Process," identify specific vulnerabilities and attack vectors within that path, evaluate existing mitigations, and propose concrete recommendations to enhance the security of the Wasmer build infrastructure.  We aim to reduce the likelihood and impact of this critical attack scenario.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the build process of the Wasmer project (https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer).  It encompasses:

*   **Source Code Repositories:**  The main Wasmer repository and any related repositories involved in the build process (e.g., dependencies, build scripts).
*   **Build Servers/Infrastructure:**  The CI/CD pipelines, build servers (physical or virtual), and any cloud services used for building Wasmer releases.  This includes GitHub Actions, potentially other CI systems, and any custom build scripts.
*   **Build Tools and Dependencies:**  Compilers (Rust, C/C++), linkers, package managers (Cargo, etc.), and any other tools used during the build.  This includes the integrity and provenance of these tools.
*   **Artifact Signing and Verification:**  The process of signing released Wasmer binaries and the mechanisms for verifying those signatures.
*   **Access Control and Authentication:**  The mechanisms controlling access to all components within the scope, including repository access, build server access, and signing key management.
* **Supply Chain Security:** The security of the dependencies used by Wasmer, and the process of updating and verifying those dependencies.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Runtime exploitation of Wasmer after a successful build compromise (that would be a separate attack path).
*   Attacks targeting individual developer machines (unless those machines are directly part of the official build process).
*   Attacks on the Wasmer website or other non-build-related infrastructure.

### 1.3. Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methodologies:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  We will systematically identify potential threats and vulnerabilities within the build process, considering attacker capabilities and motivations.
2.  **Code Review (Targeted):**  We will review relevant parts of the Wasmer codebase, build scripts, and CI/CD configurations, focusing on security-sensitive areas.  This is *not* a full code audit, but a targeted review based on the threat model.
3.  **Infrastructure Review:**  We will examine the configuration and security posture of the build servers and CI/CD pipelines.
4.  **Dependency Analysis:**  We will analyze the dependencies of Wasmer and their build processes to identify potential supply chain risks.
5.  **Best Practices Review:**  We will compare the Wasmer build process against industry best practices for secure software development and CI/CD.
6.  **Documentation Review:** We will review any existing documentation related to the Wasmer build process, security policies, and incident response plans.
7. **Interviews:** If possible, conduct interviews with Wasmer developers and maintainers to gain a deeper understanding of the build process and security considerations.

    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Vulnerabilities:**
        *   Downloading build tools from untrusted sources.
        *   Lack of verification of the integrity of downloaded build tools (e.g., checksum verification).
        *   Vulnerabilities in the build process of the build tools themselves (a supply chain attack on the tools).
        *   Using outdated or vulnerable versions of build tools.

4.  **Compromised Dependencies (Supply Chain Attack):**
    *   **Description:**  An attacker compromises a dependency of Wasmer (a Rust crate, a C/C++ library, etc.).  The malicious code is then pulled into the Wasmer build process when the dependency is built or linked.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low

        *   Lack of dependency integrity checks (e.g., verifying checksums or signatures of dependencies).
        *   Using dependencies from untrusted sources.
        *   Lack of regular dependency audits.

5.  **Compromised Signing Keys:**
    *   **Description:**  An attacker gains access to the private keys used to sign Wasmer releases. This allows them to sign malicious binaries that will appear legitimate to users.
    *   **Likelihood:** Very Low

    *   **Likelihood:** Very Low
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Vulnerabilities:**
        *   Lack of strong access controls and least privilege principles.
        *   Insufficient code review and approval processes.
        *   Lack of background checks for individuals with access to the build infrastructure.
        *   Lack of security awareness training for developers and maintainers.

### 2.2. Existing Mitigations (Hypothetical - Needs Verification)

This section lists *potential* mitigations that *might* be in place.  These need to be verified against the actual Wasmer build process.

*   **GitHub Actions:**  Likely used for CI/CD.  Hopefully configured with security best practices (e.g., using secrets, restricting permissions).
*   **Rust's Security Features:**  Rust's memory safety features help prevent certain types of vulnerabilities, but they don't protect against build-time compromises.
*   **Dependency Management (Cargo):**  Cargo provides some level of dependency management, but it needs to be used correctly (e.g., pinning versions, verifying checksums).
*   **Code Review:**  Presumably, code reviews are performed before merging changes into the main branch.
*   **Artifact Signing:**  It's highly likely that Wasmer releases are digitally signed.  The security of this depends on the key management practices.

### 2.3. Proposed Recommendations

These recommendations are based on the identified vulnerabilities and attack vectors. They are prioritized based on their potential impact and feasibility.

1.  **Strengthen CI/CD Security (High Priority):**
    *   **Implement Least Privilege:**  Ensure that CI/CD workflows and service accounts have only the minimum necessary permissions.
    *   **Use Secrets Management:**  Store all sensitive credentials (API keys, tokens, etc.) securely using GitHub Secrets or a dedicated secrets management solution.  Never hardcode secrets in workflow files or scripts.
    *   **Review and Harden Workflow Files:**  Regularly review workflow files for potential security issues.  Consider using a linter or security scanner for workflow files.
    *   **Use Third-Party Action Pinning:** Pin third-party actions to specific commit SHAs to prevent unexpected changes.
    *   **Implement Workflow Integrity Checks:**  Consider using mechanisms to verify the integrity of workflow files (e.g., checksums or signatures).
    *   **Monitor CI/CD Activity:**  Implement logging and monitoring of CI/CD activity to detect suspicious behavior.

2.  **Harden Build Servers (High Priority):**
    *   **Regularly Patch and Update:**  Keep the operating system and all software on build servers up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    *   **Implement Strong Authentication:**  Use strong passwords and SSH keys.  Disable password-based SSH access if possible.
    *   **Use a Firewall:**  Configure a firewall to restrict network access to the build server.
    *   **Implement Intrusion Detection/Prevention:**  Use intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to monitor for and block malicious activity.
    *   **Implement Logging and Monitoring:**  Enable comprehensive logging and monitoring of build server activity.
    *   **Consider Ephemeral Build Environments:** Use ephemeral build environments (e.g., containers or virtual machines that are created and destroyed for each build) to minimize the impact of a compromised build server.

3.  **Secure Build Tools and Dependencies (High Priority):**
    *   **Verify Tool Integrity:**  Verify the integrity of downloaded build tools using checksums or signatures.
    *   **Use Trusted Sources:**  Download build tools and dependencies from trusted sources (e.g., official websites, package repositories).
    *   **Pin Dependency Versions:**  Pin dependencies to specific versions to prevent unexpected updates.
    *   **Regularly Audit Dependencies:**  Perform regular dependency audits to identify and address known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Use Dependency Scanning Tools:**  Use tools like `cargo audit` or other dependency scanning tools to automatically identify vulnerable dependencies.
    *   **Consider Software Bill of Materials (SBOM):** Generate and maintain an SBOM for Wasmer to track all dependencies and their versions.

4.  **Secure Signing Key Management (High Priority):**
    *   **Use a Hardware Security Module (HSM):**  Store signing keys in an HSM or other secure key storage mechanism.
    *   **Implement Strong Access Controls:**  Restrict access to signing keys to a limited number of authorized individuals.
    *   **Use Multi-Factor Authentication:**  Require multi-factor authentication for accessing signing keys.
    *   **Implement Key Rotation:**  Regularly rotate signing keys.
    *   **Offline Signing:** If possible, perform signing operations on an offline, air-gapped machine.

5.  **Mitigate Insider Threats (Medium Priority):**
    *   **Implement Strong Access Controls and Least Privilege:**  Ensure that all users have only the minimum necessary access to the build infrastructure.
    *   **Require Code Review and Approval:**  Require code review and approval from multiple individuals before merging changes into the main branch.
    *   **Security Awareness Training:**  Provide regular security awareness training to all developers and maintainers.
    *   **Background Checks:** Consider background checks for individuals with access to sensitive systems.

6.  **Continuous Monitoring and Improvement (Ongoing):**
    *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of the entire build process.
    *   **Penetration Testing:**  Perform periodic penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities that might be missed by other security measures.
    *   **Incident Response Plan:**  Develop and maintain an incident response plan for handling security incidents related to the build process.
    * **Stay Informed:** Keep up-to-date with the latest security threats and vulnerabilities related to the tools and technologies used in the Wasmer build process.

### 2.4. Re-evaluation of Likelihood

Based on this deeper analysis, and *assuming* that some basic security measures are already in place (like code review and artifact signing), the likelihood of a successful attack remains **Low**. However, it's crucial to emphasize that the "Very Low" initial assessment should be treated with caution.  The complexity and sophistication of supply chain attacks are increasing, and the potential impact of a compromised Wasmer build is extremely high.  Therefore, continuous vigilance and proactive security measures are essential. The recommendations above are crucial to *maintain* that low likelihood.

This deep analysis provides a framework for assessing and improving the security of the Wasmer build process. The next steps would involve verifying the existing mitigations, implementing the proposed recommendations, and continuously monitoring and improving the security posture of the build infrastructure.
