# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for wasmerio/wasmer

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege for Wasm Modules (Wasmer-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_for_wasm_modules__wasmer-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **`WasiCtxBuilder` Configuration:** Use `wasmer::WasiCtxBuilder` to meticulously control the WASI environment provided to the Wasm module.
    2.  **Restrict Filesystem Access:**
        *   Use `preopen_dir()` to grant access *only* to specific, pre-approved directories.  *Never* grant access to the root directory (`/`) or sensitive system directories.
        *   Example: `builder.preopen_dir("/path/to/wasm_data")?;`
    3.  **Control Environment Variables:**
        *   Use `env()` to explicitly set only the necessary environment variables.  Avoid passing through all host environment variables.
        *   Example: `builder.env("CONFIG_PATH", "/data/config.json")?;`
    4.  **Limit Arguments:**
        *   If the Wasm module accepts command-line arguments, validate them thoroughly on the host side *before* passing them to the module using `args()`.
        *   Example: `builder.args(&["validated_arg1", "validated_arg2"])?;`
    5.  **Restrict Standard I/O:**
        *   If the Wasm module doesn't require interactive input/output, redirect stdin, stdout, and stderr to null devices or in-memory buffers using methods on `WasiCtxBuilder`.
        *   Example: `builder.stdin(Box::new(wasmer_wasi::Pipe::new()));` (for an in-memory pipe)
    6.  **Auditing Host Functions (Wasmer Interaction):**  When defining custom host functions (functions callable from the Wasm module), ensure they are minimal, perform thorough input validation, and do not expose unnecessary system functionality.  This is a *Wasmer-specific* concern because it involves the interaction between the host and the Wasm sandbox.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Arbitrary File System Access (High Severity):**
    *   **Information Disclosure (High Severity):**
    *   **Code Injection via Host Functions (High Severity):**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** (Indirectly)
    *   **Command Injection (High Severity):**

*   **Impact:** (Same as before, as the core mitigation is the same)
    *   **Arbitrary File System Access:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Code Injection via Host Functions:** Risk reduced.
    *   **Denial of Service:** Risk partially reduced.
    *   **Command Injection:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: `src/host/wasi_context.rs`

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: Host functions in `src/host/functions.rs` need further auditing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Memory Safety and Sandboxing (Wasmer-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/memory_safety_and_sandboxing__wasmer-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Keep Wasmer Updated:** Regularly update the Wasmer runtime to the latest stable version.
    2.  **Isolate Wasm Instances:** Use a separate `wasmer::Store` for each Wasm module.
    3.  **Set Resource Limits:**
        *   Use `wasmer::Config` to set limits on memory and instructions.
        *   `config.max_memory_pages(100);`
        *   `config.max_instructions(1_000_000_000);`
    4.  **Compiler Choice (with caution):** Consider `wasmer-compiler-cranelift` vs. `wasmer-compiler-singlepass`, evaluating the security/performance trade-off. This is a *Wasmer-specific* choice.
    5. **Minimize `unsafe` in Host-Wasm Interaction:** Be extremely cautious with `unsafe` Rust code when interacting with Wasm memory from the host. This is *Wasmer-specific* because it involves the low-level interaction with the Wasmer API.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Wasmer Runtime Vulnerabilities (High Severity):**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):**
    *   **Cross-Module Interference (Medium Severity):**
    *   **Memory Corruption (High Severity):**
    *   **Information Leaks via Uninitialized Memory (Medium Severity):**

*   **Impact:** (Same as before)
    *   **Wasmer Runtime Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced.
    *   **Denial of Service:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Cross-Module Interference:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Memory Corruption:** Risk reduced.
    *   **Information Leaks:** Risk reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: `src/host/runtime.rs`

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: Review uses of `unsafe` in `src/host/memory.rs`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Unnecessary WASI Features (Wasmer-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/disable_unnecessary_wasi_features__wasmer-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review WASI:** Understand the WASI specification.
    2.  **Identify Unnecessary Features:** Determine which WASI features are *not* needed.
    3.  **Explicitly Disable:** Use the `WasiCtxBuilder` to disable unnecessary features. This is *entirely Wasmer-specific* as it directly uses the Wasmer API to configure WASI.
    4.  **Document Disabled Features:** Clearly document the disabled features.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Unnecessary WASI Features (Medium Severity):**
    *   **Accidental Misuse of WASI Features (Low Severity):**

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Unnecessary WASI Features:** Risk reduced.
    *   **Accidental Misuse of WASI Features:** Risk reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: `src/host/wasi_config.rs`

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: Review and disable additional WASI features; document in `src/host/wasi_config.rs`.
