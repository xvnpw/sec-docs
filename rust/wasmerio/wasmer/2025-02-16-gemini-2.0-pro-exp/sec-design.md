# BUSINESS POSTURE

Wasmer is a fast and secure WebAssembly runtime that enables lightweight containers to run anywhere: from desktop to the cloud, Edge and IoT devices.

Business Priorities:

*   Enable developers to run WebAssembly modules in various environments.
*   Provide a secure and performant runtime for WebAssembly.
*   Support a wide range of programming languages that can be compiled to WebAssembly.
*   Foster a vibrant community and ecosystem around WebAssembly.
*   Offer commercial support and services for enterprise users.

Business Goals:

*   Become the leading WebAssembly runtime.
*   Drive the adoption of WebAssembly as a universal runtime.
*   Generate revenue through commercial offerings.

Business Risks:

*   Security vulnerabilities in the runtime could compromise user applications and data.
*   Performance issues could hinder the adoption of Wasmer.
*   Lack of compatibility with certain WebAssembly modules or features could limit its usefulness.
*   Competition from other WebAssembly runtimes could erode market share.
*   Failure to attract and retain a strong community could slow down development and adoption.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Sandboxed execution of WebAssembly modules. (Implemented in the Wasmer runtime)
*   security control: Memory safety guarantees provided by WebAssembly. (Enforced by the WebAssembly specification and implemented in the runtime)
*   security control: Regular security audits and code reviews. (Mentioned in the repository and assumed to be part of the development process)
*   security control: Use of Rust, a memory-safe language, for the majority of the runtime's codebase. (Visible in the repository's code)
*   security control: Support for WASI (WebAssembly System Interface), which provides a secure and portable way for WebAssembly modules to interact with the operating system. (Implemented in the Wasmer runtime)

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Potential for unknown vulnerabilities in the runtime or its dependencies.
*   accepted risk: Reliance on the security of the underlying operating system and hardware.
*   accepted risk: The possibility of side-channel attacks, although mitigated by design.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement a comprehensive fuzzing strategy to identify potential vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Integrate with security vulnerability scanners to automatically detect known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
*   security control: Provide a clear and accessible security reporting process.
*   security control: Offer a bug bounty program to incentivize security researchers to find and report vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Develop and maintain a detailed threat model for the runtime.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Not directly applicable to the runtime itself, but Wasmer should support secure authentication mechanisms for applications running within it. This might involve integrating with existing identity providers or supporting standard authentication protocols.
*   Authorization:
    *   Wasmer should provide mechanisms for controlling access to resources and capabilities within the runtime. This could involve implementing role-based access control (RBAC) or other authorization models. WASI provides a capability-based security model.
*   Input Validation:
    *   Wasmer should validate all inputs from WebAssembly modules to prevent malicious code from exploiting vulnerabilities in the runtime. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of the host system.
*   Cryptography:
    *   Wasmer should provide access to cryptographic primitives for WebAssembly modules, allowing them to perform secure operations such as encryption, decryption, and digital signatures. This could be achieved through WASI or custom extensions.

```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developers write code and push it to the GitHub repository.
2.  GitHub Actions workflows are triggered on push and pull requests.
3.  The workflows perform the following steps:
    *   Linting: Code style and formatting checks using tools like `rustfmt` and `clippy`.
    *   Static Analysis (SAST): Security scanners are run to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code.
    *   Testing: Unit tests, integration tests, and potentially fuzzing are executed.
    *   Building: The Wasmer runtime is compiled for various target platforms using Cargo.
4.  Build artifacts (Wasmer binaries) are produced and potentially published.

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   security control: Use of a memory-safe language (Rust) minimizes memory safety vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Automated build process ensures consistency and repeatability.
*   security control: Linting tools enforce code style and identify potential errors.
*   security control: SAST scanners detect known vulnerabilities in the code.
*   security control: Comprehensive testing helps ensure the correctness and security of the runtime.
*   security control: GitHub Actions provide a secure and auditable build environment.
