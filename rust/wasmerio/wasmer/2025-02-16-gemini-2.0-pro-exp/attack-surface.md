# Attack Surface Analysis for wasmerio/wasmer

## Attack Surface: [1. Sandbox Escape (Wasmer Runtime Vulnerability)](./attack_surfaces/1__sandbox_escape__wasmer_runtime_vulnerability_.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability in the Wasmer runtime itself that allows a compromised Wasm module to break out of the sandbox and gain access to the host system.  This is a failure of Wasmer's core security mechanism.
*   **Wasmer Contribution:** This is a direct vulnerability *within* Wasmer's core functionality â€“ its ability to isolate the Wasm module.  The bug could be in the JIT compiler, memory management, WASI implementation, or other core components.
*   **Example:** A bug in Wasmer's handling of WASI `fd_write` allows a specially crafted Wasm module to write to arbitrary file descriptors, including those belonging to the host process, leading to code execution.  Or, a flaw in the JIT compiler allows generation of native code that bypasses memory protection.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Complete system compromise. The attacker gains the privileges of the process running Wasmer.
    *   Arbitrary code execution on the host.
    *   Data theft and manipulation on the host.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Wasmer Updated:** The *most crucial* mitigation is to keep Wasmer updated to the latest version. Security patches are regularly released to address vulnerabilities.  This is a *continuous* process.
    *   **Security Audits (Wasmer):** Be aware of the results of security audits performed on the Wasmer project.
    *   **Minimize WASI Capabilities:** Grant the Wasm module only the absolute minimum necessary WASI capabilities.  This reduces the *attack surface* available to a compromised module, even if a Wasmer vulnerability exists.  This is a defense-in-depth measure.
    *   **Run Wasmer with Least Privilege:** Run the host application that uses Wasmer with the lowest possible privileges on the operating system. This limits the damage an attacker can do *after* a successful sandbox escape.
    *   **Additional Sandboxing:** Consider running the entire Wasmer-using application within a container (e.g., Docker) or a virtual machine for an additional layer of isolation.  This provides containment *even if* Wasmer's sandbox is breached.

## Attack Surface: [2. Overly Permissive WASI Capabilities (Misconfiguration within Wasmer)](./attack_surfaces/2__overly_permissive_wasi_capabilities__misconfiguration_within_wasmer_.md)

*   **Description:** While technically a configuration issue, it directly impacts Wasmer's security enforcement.  Granting excessive WASI capabilities to a Wasm module allows it to interact with the host system in ways that are not strictly necessary, increasing the impact of *any* vulnerability (either in the Wasm module or in Wasmer itself).
*   **Wasmer Contribution:** Wasmer is responsible for enforcing the WASI capabilities.  A misconfiguration means Wasmer is *not* enforcing the intended restrictions, making it a Wasmer-related issue.
*   **Example:** A Wasm module is granted the ability to open arbitrary network connections, even though it only needs to read a local configuration file.  A vulnerability in the module (or a Wasmer vulnerability) could then be used to exfiltrate data or connect to malicious servers.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Significantly increases the risk and impact of other vulnerabilities.  Makes sandbox escapes easier and more damaging.
    *   Facilitates data breaches, system corruption, or denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (Potentially Critical, as it amplifies other risks).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant *only* the minimum necessary WASI capabilities to the Wasm module.  Carefully review and justify each capability.  This is the primary mitigation.
    *   **Configuration Review:** Regularly review the Wasmer configuration (how WASI capabilities are granted) to ensure they are not overly permissive.  Automate this review if possible.
    *   **Documentation:** Clearly document the required WASI capabilities for each Wasm module and the rationale behind them.
    *   **Auditing:** Audit the configuration and usage of WASI capabilities to detect any deviations from the principle of least privilege.

## Attack Surface: [3. Denial of Service (Resource Exhaustion *due to Wasmer Bugs*)](./attack_surfaces/3__denial_of_service__resource_exhaustion_due_to_wasmer_bugs_.md)

*   **Description:** A bug *within Wasmer* that allows a wasm module to consume excessive resources. This is different from a malicious module intentionally exhausting resources; this is about Wasmer failing to *enforce* limits correctly.
*   **Wasmer Contribution:** Wasmer is responsible for enforcing resource limits (memory, CPU, etc.). A bug in this enforcement mechanism is a direct Wasmer vulnerability.
*   **Example:** A bug in Wasmer's memory limit enforcement allows a Wasm module to allocate significantly more memory than configured, leading to the host process being killed by the operating system's OOM killer. Or, a bug in the execution timeout mechanism allows a Wasm module to run indefinitely, despite a configured timeout.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of service for the host application.
    *   Potential instability of the host system.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Wasmer Updated:** As with all Wasmer vulnerabilities, keeping Wasmer updated is crucial.
    *   **Test Resource Limits:** Thoroughly test the configured resource limits to ensure they are being enforced correctly by Wasmer. This includes testing edge cases and potential bypasses.
    *   **Monitoring:** Monitor the resource usage of Wasmer itself (not just the Wasm modules) to detect any anomalies that might indicate a bug in resource limit enforcement.
    * **Report Bugs:** If you discover a bug in Wasmer's resource limit enforcement, report it to the Wasmer developers.
