## Attack Tree Path: [Craft malicious WASM module to trigger buffer overflow during execution due to parsing or handling of specific WASM instructions or data structures.](./attack_tree_paths/craft_malicious_wasm_module_to_trigger_buffer_overflow_during_execution_due_to_parsing_or_handling_o_080935e3.md)

**Attack Vector:**  An attacker crafts a specially designed WebAssembly module. This module contains instructions or data structures that, when parsed or processed by Wasmer's runtime, cause a buffer overflow. This overflow can overwrite adjacent memory regions, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the host system.
*   **Likelihood:** Likely
*   **Impact:** Critical
*   **Effort:** Moderate to High
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate to Difficult

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft malicious WASM module to trigger use-after-free condition in Wasmer's memory management during WASM execution, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.](./attack_tree_paths/craft_malicious_wasm_module_to_trigger_use-after-free_condition_in_wasmer's_memory_management_during_6bf7eb2f.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts a malicious WASM module that exploits flaws in Wasmer's memory management. This module triggers a "use-after-free" vulnerability, where memory that has been freed is accessed again. This can corrupt memory, lead to crashes, or, more critically, enable arbitrary code execution by manipulating the freed memory.
*   **Likelihood:** Likely
*   **Impact:** Critical
*   **Effort:** Moderate to High
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate to Difficult

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft malicious WASM module to trigger out-of-bounds memory access during WASM execution due to incorrect bounds checking or index calculations in Wasmer's runtime.](./attack_tree_paths/craft_malicious_wasm_module_to_trigger_out-of-bounds_memory_access_during_wasm_execution_due_to_inco_00157a6b.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker creates a WASM module that attempts to access memory outside of the allocated bounds. This could be due to errors in Wasmer's bounds checking mechanisms or incorrect index calculations during WASM execution. Successful out-of-bounds access can lead to information leaks, memory corruption, or arbitrary code execution.
*   **Likelihood:** Likely
*   **Impact:** Significant to Critical
*   **Effort:** Moderate to High
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate to Difficult

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft malicious WASM module that consumes excessive resources (CPU, memory, file handles, etc.) within Wasmer, leading to denial of service for the application or the host system.](./attack_tree_paths/craft_malicious_wasm_module_that_consumes_excessive_resources__cpu__memory__file_handles__etc___with_4502ef46.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts a WASM module designed to consume excessive system resources. This module might contain infinite loops, allocate large amounts of memory, or excessively open file handles. When executed by Wasmer, it can overwhelm the host system, leading to a denial of service for the application and potentially other services on the same host.
*   **Likelihood:** Likely to Very Likely
*   **Impact:** Moderate to Significant
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Moderate

## Attack Tree Path: [Application developers incorrectly use Wasmer's API, leading to insecure configurations or vulnerabilities. Examples: Improperly configured sandboxing, insecure module loading, exposing vulnerable API endpoints.](./attack_tree_paths/application_developers_incorrectly_use_wasmer's_api__leading_to_insecure_configurations_or_vulnerabi_33657ec9.md)

**Attack Vector:** Application developers, due to lack of understanding or oversight, misuse Wasmer's API. This can result in weakened security configurations, such as disabling sandboxing features, loading WASM modules from untrusted sources without proper validation, or exposing vulnerable Wasmer API endpoints to external access. This misuse can create openings for various attacks, depending on the specific misconfiguration.
*   **Likelihood:** Likely to Very Likely
*   **Impact:** Minor to Critical (depending on misuse)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice to Beginner
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Moderate

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit vulnerabilities in Wasmer's dependencies (e.g., libraries used for compilation, networking, etc.) that could be leveraged to compromise Wasmer or the application.](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_wasmer's_dependencies__e_g___libraries_used_for_compilation__networking___03c3dcec.md)

**Attack Vector:** Wasmer, like most software, relies on third-party libraries (dependencies). If these dependencies contain known vulnerabilities, an attacker can exploit them to compromise Wasmer itself or the application using Wasmer. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in libraries used for compilation (like Cranelift or LLVM), networking, or other functionalities.
*   **Likelihood:** Likely
*   **Impact:** Minor to Critical (depending on dependency)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice to Beginner
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Easy to Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [Attacker compromises the Wasmer distribution channels (e.g., package registries, GitHub releases) to distribute a backdoored or vulnerable version of Wasmer, which is then used by the application.](./attack_tree_paths/attacker_compromises_the_wasmer_distribution_channels__e_g___package_registries__github_releases__to_11c88d9e.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker targets the supply chain by compromising Wasmer's distribution channels. This could involve injecting malicious code into the official Wasmer packages hosted on package registries (like npm, crates.io, PyPI) or GitHub releases. If successful, developers unknowingly download and integrate a backdoored version of Wasmer into their applications, leading to widespread compromise.
*   **Likelihood:** Rare to Possible
*   **Impact:** Critical
*   **Effort:** High to Very High
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced to Expert
