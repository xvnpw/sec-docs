## Attack Surface: [Malicious WebAssembly Module - Parser Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/malicious_webassembly_module_-_parser_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities within **Wasmer's** WebAssembly parser can be exploited by maliciously crafted modules. These modules, when loaded by Wasmer, can trigger parser flaws leading to crashes or memory corruption during the parsing stage itself.
*   **Wasmer Contribution:** **Wasmer's** parser is the component responsible for interpreting and validating WebAssembly module bytecode. Any security vulnerabilities present in this parser directly expose applications using Wasmer.
*   **Example:** A specially crafted WebAssembly module with deeply nested structures or oversized data triggers a buffer overflow vulnerability in **Wasmer's** parsing logic. This overflow allows an attacker to overwrite memory and potentially gain control of the host process.
*   **Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution on the host system, Denial of Service, potential for data breaches if the exploit leads to further compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Wasmer Updated:**  Immediately apply updates and security patches released by the Wasmer team. Parser vulnerabilities are often addressed in newer versions.
    *   **Input Validation (Module Source):**  While not directly mitigating parser bugs, ensure WebAssembly modules are loaded from trusted and verified sources to reduce the likelihood of encountering malicious modules.
    *   **Sandboxing Host Environment:** Deploy Wasmer within a robust sandbox environment (like containers or virtual machines). This limits the potential damage if a parser exploit is successful, as the attacker's access will be confined to the sandbox.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious WebAssembly Module - JIT Compiler Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/malicious_webassembly_module_-_jit_compiler_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  **Wasmer's** Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler, responsible for translating WebAssembly bytecode into optimized native machine code, may contain vulnerabilities. Malicious WebAssembly modules can be crafted to trigger these JIT compiler bugs during the compilation process.
*   **Wasmer Contribution:** **Wasmer's** JIT compiler is a core component for performance optimization. However, the complexity of JIT compilation can introduce security vulnerabilities within **Wasmer** itself.
*   **Example:** A carefully designed WebAssembly module exploits a vulnerability in **Wasmer's** JIT compiler during the code generation phase. This exploit allows the module to escape the WebAssembly sandbox and execute arbitrary machine code on the host system, bypassing intended security boundaries.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the host system, complete sandbox escape, potential for full system compromise depending on the privileges of the Wasmer process.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Wasmer Updated:**  Prioritize updating Wasmer to the latest versions. JIT compiler vulnerabilities are critical and are often addressed with high priority by the Wasmer team.
    *   **Disable JIT Compilation (If Feasible and Secure):** If performance is not the absolute top priority and if **Wasmer** offers a secure interpreted execution mode, consider disabling JIT compilation. *Note: Verify Wasmer documentation to confirm the availability and security implications of interpreter mode.*
    *   **Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR):** Ensure ASLR is enabled on the host operating system. ASLR makes it significantly harder for exploits that rely on memory corruption to reliably execute arbitrary code, even if a JIT vulnerability is triggered.
    *   **Sandboxing Host Environment:**  Run Wasmer in a sandboxed environment. This adds an extra layer of security, limiting the impact of a successful JIT exploit by restricting the attacker's capabilities even after sandbox escape.
