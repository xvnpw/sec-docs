    - **Principle of Least Privilege**: Design the API to operate on the principle of least privilege, granting only necessary permissions to host applications interacting with the runtime.

## 4. Data Flow

The typical data flow for executing a WebAssembly module in Wasmer is as follows:

1. **Module Loading Phase**:
    - The host application initiates module loading via the **Wasmer API**.
    - The API forwards the module data to the **Loader**.
    - The **Loader** parses and validates the WebAssembly module.
    - The validated module representation is passed to the **Compiler**.

2. **Compilation Phase**:
    - The **Compiler** receives the validated module from the Loader.
    - It translates the WebAssembly bytecode into optimized native machine code.
    - The compiled code is stored and associated with the module within the **Store**.

3. **Instance Instantiation Phase**:
    - The host application requests module instantiation through the **Wasmer API**.
    - The API interacts with the **Store** to create a new instance of the module.
    - The **Runtime Core** is initialized for the new instance, setting up its memory space and execution context.

4. **Function Execution Phase**:
    - The host application calls an exported function of a WebAssembly instance using the **Wasmer API**.
    - The API invokes the **Runtime Core** to execute the compiled code corresponding to the function.
    - The **Runtime Core** manages the execution, interacting with the **Store** for memory access, function calls, and resource management.
    - Results of the function execution are returned to the host application via the API.

## 5. Execution Modes

Wasmer's Engine abstraction enables different execution modes, each with its own security and performance characteristics:

- **JIT (Just-In-Time) Compilation Engine**:
    - **Description**: Compiles WebAssembly code to native machine code dynamically at runtime, immediately before execution.
    - **Pros**: High performance due to native code execution, potential for runtime optimizations based on execution patterns.
    - **Cons**: Compilation overhead at startup, increased memory usage for compiled code, potential security risks associated with runtime code generation if not carefully managed.
    - **Security Considerations**:
        - **JIT Spraying**: Mitigation against JIT spraying attacks where attackers attempt to place malicious code in memory regions used by the JIT engine.
        - **Code Generation Vulnerabilities**: Prevention of vulnerabilities in the JIT compiler itself that could lead to the generation of unsafe or exploitable native code.
        - **Memory Protection**: Robust memory protection mechanisms to isolate JIT-generated code and prevent unauthorized access or modification.
        - **Code Caching Security**: Secure management of JIT code caches to prevent tampering or injection of malicious code.

- **AOT (Ahead-Of-Time) Compilation Engine**:
    - **Description**: Compiles WebAssembly code to native machine code offline, typically during module loading or build time, before runtime execution.
    - **Pros**: Faster startup time as compilation is done upfront, potentially simpler runtime environment, reduced runtime compilation overhead.
    - **Cons**: Less flexibility for runtime optimizations, potentially larger binary size due to pre-compiled code, compilation process itself needs to be secure.
    - **Security Considerations**:
        - **Compilation Process Security**: Securing the AOT compilation pipeline to prevent injection of malicious code during the compilation phase.
        - **Pre-compiled Code Integrity**: Ensuring the integrity and authenticity of pre-compiled code to prevent tampering or substitution with malicious versions.
        - **Static Analysis for Security**: Opportunity for more extensive static analysis and security checks during the AOT compilation phase.

- **Interpreter Engine (Potential Future Engine)**:
    - **Description**: Executes WebAssembly bytecode directly, instruction by instruction, without compiling to native code.
    - **Pros**: Simpler implementation, potentially easier to audit for security vulnerabilities, eliminates runtime code generation complexities.
    - **Cons**: Significantly lower performance compared to JIT or AOT, may not be suitable for performance-critical applications.
    - **Security Considerations**:
        - **Interpreter Vulnerabilities**: Prevention of vulnerabilities in the interpreter implementation itself, such as instruction handling errors or boundary condition issues.
        - **Reduced Attack Surface from Code Generation**: Eliminates the attack surface associated with runtime code generation present in JIT engines.
        - **Performance vs. Security Trade-off**:  Accepting the performance penalty in exchange for potentially enhanced security and auditability.

## 6. Host System Interaction

WebAssembly modules within Wasmer interact with the host system through well-defined mechanisms:

- **Imports**:
    - WebAssembly modules declare imports, representing functions, memories, tables, or globals provided by the host environment.
    - Host applications, via the Wasmer API, supply concrete implementations for these imports during instance instantiation.
    - **Security Considerations**:
        - **Import Validation and Sandboxing**: Rigorously validate and sandbox imported functions to prevent WebAssembly code from gaining unauthorized access to host resources or performing malicious actions.
        - **Principle of Least Privilege for Imports**: Provide only the necessary imports to WebAssembly modules, adhering to the principle of least privilege to minimize potential attack surface.
        - **Secure Import Implementation**: Ensure that the host-provided implementations of imported functions are themselves secure and do not introduce vulnerabilities.

- **Exports**:
    - WebAssembly modules can export functions, memories, tables, or globals, making them accessible to the host application through the Wasmer API.
    - **Security Considerations**:
        - **Export Access Control**: Implement access control mechanisms for exports to prevent unintended information leakage or unauthorized access to WebAssembly module internals by the host application.
        - **Secure Export Handling**: Ensure that the host application handles exported entities securely and does not introduce vulnerabilities when interacting with them.

- **System Calls (Indirect via Imports)**:
    - WebAssembly itself does not directly invoke system calls. System calls are mediated exclusively through imported functions provided by the host.
    - **Security Considerations**:
        - **Secure System Call Mediation**: The security of system calls is entirely dependent on the security and sandboxing of the imported functions provided by the host application.
        - **Auditing and Monitoring System Call Usage**: Implement auditing and monitoring mechanisms to track system call usage by WebAssembly modules (via imports) for security analysis and anomaly detection.
