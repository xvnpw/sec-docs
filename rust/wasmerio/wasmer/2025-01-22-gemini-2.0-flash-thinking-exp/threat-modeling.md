# Threat Model Analysis for wasmerio/wasmer

## Threat: [Malicious Module Execution](./threats/malicious_module_execution.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Module Execution
*   **Description:** An attacker provides a crafted WebAssembly module to the application. This module, when executed by Wasmer, performs malicious actions. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the host application through WASI calls, attempting to escape the sandbox, or simply performing actions harmful to the application's intended functionality (e.g., data corruption, denial of service). The attacker might achieve this by compromising an upload endpoint, injecting the module through a vulnerable API, or through social engineering.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the host system, data exfiltration, data corruption, denial of service, complete application compromise.
*   **Affected Wasmer Component:** Module Loading, Module Execution, WASI implementation.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strict Source Control: Only load modules from trusted and verified sources.
    *   Input Validation: Implement rigorous validation and sanitization of WebAssembly modules before loading and execution. This could include static analysis, signature verification, and sandboxing during initial analysis.
    *   Principle of Least Privilege: Run Wasmer with minimal necessary permissions.
    *   Resource Limits: Enforce strict resource limits (CPU, memory, I/O) on executed modules to limit the impact of malicious or resource-intensive code.
    *   Code Signing: Implement code signing and verification for WebAssembly modules to ensure authenticity and integrity.

## Threat: [Wasmer Runtime Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/wasmer_runtime_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Threat:** Wasmer Runtime Vulnerability Exploitation
*   **Description:** An attacker leverages a known or zero-day vulnerability within the Wasmer runtime itself. This could involve crafting a specific WebAssembly module or input that triggers a bug in Wasmer's parsing, compilation, JIT, or WASI implementation. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to bypass the sandbox, gain control over the host process, or cause a denial of service. The attacker might discover vulnerabilities through public disclosures, reverse engineering, or fuzzing.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the host system, sandbox escape, denial of service, privilege escalation.
*   **Affected Wasmer Component:** Wasmer Core Runtime (Parser, Compiler, JIT, WASI implementation, Memory Management).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regular Updates: Keep Wasmer runtime updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
    *   Vulnerability Monitoring: Subscribe to Wasmer security advisories and monitor public vulnerability databases for reported issues.
    *   Security Audits: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the application and its Wasmer integration.
    *   Sandboxing and Isolation: Run Wasmer in a sandboxed environment with restricted system access to limit the impact of a runtime vulnerability exploitation.
    *   Bug Bounty Program: Consider participating in or establishing a bug bounty program to encourage responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Module](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_module.md)

*   **Threat:** Resource Exhaustion via Module
*   **Description:** An attacker provides a WebAssembly module designed to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, I/O) on the host system. This module might contain computationally intensive loops, memory allocation patterns, or excessive I/O operations. By executing this module, the attacker can cause a denial of service by overloading the host system and making the application unresponsive or unavailable. The attacker might exploit an application feature that allows user-provided modules or control module execution parameters.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), performance degradation, application instability, resource starvation for other processes.
*   **Affected Wasmer Component:** Module Execution, Resource Management.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Resource Limits: Implement and enforce strict resource limits (CPU time, memory usage, I/O operations) for each executed WebAssembly module.
    *   Monitoring and Throttling: Monitor resource usage of running modules and implement mechanisms to throttle or terminate modules exceeding predefined limits.
    *   Execution Timeouts: Set timeouts for module execution to prevent runaway processes from consuming resources indefinitely.
    *   Quality of Service (QoS): Implement QoS mechanisms to prioritize critical application processes over WebAssembly module execution.

## Threat: [WASI Sandbox Escape](./threats/wasi_sandbox_escape.md)

*   **Threat:** WASI Sandbox Escape
*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities or weaknesses in Wasmer's WASI implementation to bypass the intended sandbox restrictions. This could involve manipulating WASI function calls, exploiting edge cases in file system or network access controls, or leveraging bugs in WASI API implementations. A successful escape allows the module to access resources or perform actions outside of its intended sandbox, potentially compromising the host system. The attacker might achieve this by carefully crafting WASI calls within a malicious module.
*   **Impact:** Sandbox escape, unauthorized access to host resources (filesystem, network, environment variables), privilege escalation, potentially leading to RCE.
*   **Affected Wasmer Component:** WASI implementation, System Call Interception.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   WASI Security Reviews: Conduct thorough security reviews of the application's WASI usage and the specific WASI functions exposed to modules.
    *   Minimal WASI Exposure: Only expose the necessary WASI functionalities to WebAssembly modules, following the principle of least privilege.
    *   Input Validation for WASI Calls: Validate and sanitize all inputs to WASI function calls from WebAssembly modules to prevent unexpected behavior or exploits.
    *   Regular Wasmer Updates: Keep Wasmer updated to benefit from fixes and improvements in WASI implementation security.
    *   Consider Alternative Sandboxing: If WASI sandbox is insufficient, explore alternative sandboxing mechanisms or containerization for running Wasmer.
