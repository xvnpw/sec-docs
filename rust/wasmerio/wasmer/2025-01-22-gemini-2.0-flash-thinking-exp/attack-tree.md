*   **Description:** Attacker crafts a WASM module that exploits flaws in Wasmer's bounds checking or index calculations during memory access operations. This allows the WASM module to read or write memory outside of its allocated boundaries, potentially leading to information leaks, crashes, or arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Likelihood:** Likely
    *   **Impact:** Significant to Critical
    *   **Effort:** Moderate to High
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft malicious WASM module that triggers a bug in Wasmer's compiler (e.g., Cranelift, LLVM) during compilation, leading to unexpected behavior, crashes, or potentially arbitrary code execution during compilation or later execution of the compiled code. [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/craft_malicious_wasm_module_that_triggers_a_bug_in_wasmer's_compiler__e_g___cranelift__llvm__during__d8faabf8.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker crafts a WASM module specifically designed to trigger a bug in Wasmer's compiler component. This bug could manifest during the compilation process itself, causing crashes or unexpected behavior, or it could introduce vulnerabilities into the compiled native code that are exploitable during runtime.
    *   **Likelihood:** Possible
    *   **Impact:** Significant to Critical
    *   **Effort:** High
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced to Expert
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Difficult

*   **Description:** Attacker identifies and exploits a vulnerability in Wasmer's compiler that allows them to inject malicious code directly into the native machine code generated during compilation of a WASM module. When this compiled module is executed, the injected malicious code runs with the privileges of the application.
    *   **Likelihood:** Rare to Possible
    *   **Impact:** Critical
    *   **Effort:** Very High
    *   **Skill Level:** Expert
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Difficult

## Attack Tree Path: [Application developers incorrectly use Wasmer's API, leading to insecure configurations or vulnerabilities. Examples: Improperly configured sandboxing, insecure module loading, exposing vulnerable API endpoints. [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/application_developers_incorrectly_use_wasmer's_api__leading_to_insecure_configurations_or_vulnerabi_cadedaf5.md)

*   **Description:** Application developers, through misunderstanding or negligence, misuse Wasmer's API in a way that introduces security vulnerabilities. This could include disabling or weakening sandboxing, loading WASM modules from untrusted sources without proper validation, or exposing vulnerable Wasmer API endpoints to external attackers.
    *   **Likelihood:** Likely to Very Likely
    *   **Impact:** Minor to Critical (depending on misuse)
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Beginner

[HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_wasmer's_dependencies__e_g___libraries_used_for_compilation__networking___15444c51.md)

*   **Description:** Wasmer, like most software, relies on third-party libraries and dependencies. If vulnerabilities exist in these dependencies, attackers can exploit them to compromise Wasmer itself or the application using Wasmer. This could involve exploiting known vulnerabilities in libraries used for compilation, networking, or other functionalities.
    *   **Likelihood:** Likely
    *   **Impact:** Minor to Critical (depending on dependency)
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Beginner
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Easy to Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [Attacker compromises the Wasmer distribution channels (e.g., package registries, GitHub releases) to distribute a backdoored or vulnerable version of Wasmer, which is then used by the application. [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/attacker_compromises_the_wasmer_distribution_channels__e_g___package_registries__github_releases__to_c17ac6e3.md)

*   **Description:** In a supply chain attack, an attacker compromises the channels through which Wasmer is distributed to users. This could involve compromising package registries, GitHub release mechanisms, or other distribution points. The attacker then replaces legitimate Wasmer packages with backdoored or vulnerable versions. Applications that download and use these compromised packages become vulnerable.
    *   **Likelihood:** Rare to Possible
    *   **Impact:** Critical
    *   **Effort:** High to Very High
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced to Expert
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Difficult
