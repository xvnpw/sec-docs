    * **Attack Vector:** Attackers intercept communication between the application and TikV, or within the TikV cluster, potentially reading or modifying data in transit.
    * **Potential Impact:** Data breaches, data corruption, and unauthorized actions.

* **[HIGH-RISK PATH] 2. Exploit Client Library Interaction:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities or weaknesses in how the application interacts with the TikV client library. This can involve injecting malicious data or exploiting logical flaws in the application's code.

    * **Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to overwhelm TikV with requests or exploit vulnerabilities to make it unavailable, disrupting the application's functionality.
    * **Potential Impact:** Application downtime and service disruption.

* **[HIGH-RISK PATH] 5.1. Resource Exhaustion:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Attackers send a large number of requests to TikV, consuming its resources (CPU, memory, network) and making it unresponsive.
