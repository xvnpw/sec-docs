### High and Critical TiKV Threats

*   **Threat:** Raft Leader Election Manipulation
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the Raft consensus protocol or network to influence the leader election process. This could involve injecting malicious messages, disrupting communication between nodes, or exploiting timing vulnerabilities to force the election of a compromised node. Once a compromised node becomes the leader, the attacker can control data replication, potentially introduce inconsistencies, or even halt the cluster.
    *   **Impact:** Data inconsistencies across the cluster, potential data corruption, denial of service if the compromised leader halts operations, loss of data integrity.
    *   **Affected Component:** Raft module (specifically the leader election process and message handling).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for inter-node communication (e.g., using TLS with mutual authentication).
        *   Harden the network infrastructure to prevent unauthorized access and network disruptions.
        *   Regularly review and update TiKV to patch known vulnerabilities in the Raft implementation.
        *   Implement monitoring and alerting for unexpected leader elections or anomalies in Raft communication patterns.

*   **Threat:** Raft Log Corruption
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the underlying storage of a TiKV node and directly manipulates the Raft log files. This could involve modifying existing entries, deleting entries, or injecting malicious entries. Corrupted Raft logs can disrupt the consensus process, leading to data divergence and potential data loss.
    *   **Impact:** Data inconsistencies, data loss, cluster instability, potential for permanent data corruption requiring manual intervention or recovery from backups.
    *   **Affected Component:** Raft module (specifically the log storage and replay mechanisms), Storage layer (where Raft logs are persisted).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong access controls and file system permissions on the storage directories used by TiKV.
        *   Encrypt the data at rest, including the Raft logs, to prevent unauthorized modification.
        *   Regularly perform integrity checks on the Raft logs to detect tampering.
        *   Implement monitoring and alerting for unexpected changes or corruption in the Raft log files.

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Access to Underlying Storage (RocksDB)
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the file system where TiKV stores its data using RocksDB. This could be through compromised server credentials, vulnerabilities in the operating system, or physical access to the storage devices. Once accessed, the attacker can read, modify, or delete the underlying data files, bypassing TiKV's access control mechanisms.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data modification, data deletion, complete loss of data integrity and availability.
    *   **Affected Component:** Storage layer (specifically the RocksDB data files and directories).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong access controls and file system permissions on the storage directories used by TiKV.
        *   Encrypt the data at rest to protect it even if the storage is accessed without authorization.
        *   Regularly audit access to the storage systems.
        *   Harden the operating system and underlying infrastructure to prevent unauthorized access.

*   **Threat:** Exploiting RocksDB Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the underlying RocksDB library used by TiKV. This could allow them to gain unauthorized access to data, cause denial of service, or even execute arbitrary code on the TiKV server.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data corruption, denial of service, potential for remote code execution.
    *   **Affected Component:** Storage layer (specifically the RocksDB library).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep TiKV and its dependencies, including RocksDB, up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Monitor security advisories for vulnerabilities in RocksDB and apply patches promptly.
        *   Consider using vulnerability scanning tools to identify potential weaknesses.

*   **Threat:** Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Inter-Node Communication
    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between TiKV nodes. If this communication is not properly encrypted, the attacker can eavesdrop on sensitive data being exchanged, including data being replicated and Raft messages. They could also potentially modify the messages in transit, compromising data integrity and the consensus process.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data corruption, disruption of the consensus process, potential for unauthorized data modification.
    *   **Affected Component:** Network communication layer (specifically the gRPC communication between TiKV nodes).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce TLS encryption for all inter-node communication, including data replication and Raft messages.
        *   Implement mutual authentication (mTLS) to verify the identity of each TiKV node participating in the communication.
        *   Secure the network infrastructure to prevent unauthorized access and eavesdropping.

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service on Client-Server Communication
    *   **Description:** An attacker floods the TiKV server with a large number of requests, overwhelming its resources and preventing legitimate clients from accessing the data. This could be achieved through various methods, such as sending a high volume of read or write requests, or exploiting inefficient query patterns.
    *   **Impact:** Temporary unavailability of the data, performance degradation for legitimate clients.
    *   **Affected Component:** Client-facing API (gRPC interface), Request processing logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting on client requests to prevent individual clients from overwhelming the server.
        *   Implement connection limits to restrict the number of concurrent connections from a single client or IP address.
        *   Optimize query processing and resource allocation to handle a high volume of legitimate requests.
        *   Implement monitoring and alerting for excessive request rates or resource utilization.
