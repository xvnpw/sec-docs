## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using TiKV [CRITICAL NODE - ROOT GOAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_tikv__critical_node_-_root_goal_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker's ultimate objective is to compromise the application that relies on TiKV. This could involve data breaches, service disruption, or gaining unauthorized control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit TiKV Weaknesses [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_tikv_weaknesses__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** To achieve the root goal, the attacker aims to exploit weaknesses or vulnerabilities specifically within the TiKV system, rather than generic web application vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Network-Based Attacks [HIGH-RISK PATH START]](./attack_tree_paths/network-based_attacks__high-risk_path_start_.md)

*   **Description:** Attacks originating from the network layer targeting TiKV's communication channels and network services.

    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Description:** Intercepting and potentially manipulating communication between the application and TiKV, or between TiKV components.
            *   **Lack of Encryption [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:**
                    *   **TiKV Communication Channels Not Encrypted (Default gRPC might be unencrypted) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** If TLS encryption is not enabled for TiKV's gRPC communication, attackers on the network can eavesdrop on sensitive data transmitted between components and clients.
                *   **Impact:** Data interception, potential data modification, loss of confidentiality and integrity.
                *   **Mitigation:** Enforce TLS encryption for all TiKV communication channels (client-to-TiKV, TiKV-to-PD, TiKV-to-TiKV).
            *   **Compromised Certificates/Keys [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:**
                    *   **Stolen or Mismanaged TLS Certificates/Keys [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** If TLS certificates or private keys used for encryption are stolen, leaked, or improperly managed, attackers can impersonate legitimate parties and decrypt communication.
                *   **Impact:** Bypass encryption, data interception, impersonation, loss of confidentiality and integrity.
                *   **Mitigation:** Implement robust certificate and key management practices, including secure storage, access control, and rotation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Authentication and Authorization Bypass [HIGH-RISK PATH START, CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/authentication_and_authorization_bypass__high-risk_path_start__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** Circumventing TiKV's authentication and authorization mechanisms to gain unauthorized access.

    *   **Weak or Missing Authentication Mechanisms [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:**
            *   **Weak or Missing Authentication Mechanisms (Depending on deployment configuration) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** If TiKV is deployed without proper authentication enabled or with weak authentication methods, attackers can directly access TiKV without valid credentials.
        *   **Impact:** Full unauthorized access to TiKV data and management functions, data breaches, data manipulation.
        *   **Mitigation:** Implement strong authentication mechanisms for all TiKV access points. Consider using mutual TLS or other robust authentication methods.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Manipulation and Corruption [HIGH-RISK PATH START]](./attack_tree_paths/data_manipulation_and_corruption__high-risk_path_start_.md)

*   **Description:**  Attacks focused on directly altering or corrupting data stored within TiKV.

    *   **Direct Data Access (After Authentication Bypass) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:**
            *   **Read, Modify, or Delete Data Directly in TiKV after bypassing authentication [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Once authentication is bypassed, attackers can directly interact with TiKV's API to read, modify, or delete data, leading to data breaches or application disruption.
        *   **Impact:** Data breach, data loss, data corruption, application malfunction, loss of data integrity and availability.
        *   **Mitigation:** Primarily focus on preventing Authentication Bypass (see point 4). Implement strong authorization controls to limit actions even after authentication.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting TiKV Specific Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH START]](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_tikv_specific_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_start_.md)

*   **Description:** Targeting known or unknown vulnerabilities specific to the TiKV software itself.

    *   **Known Vulnerabilities (CVEs) [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:**
            *   **Exploiting Publicly Disclosed Vulnerabilities in TiKV (Check CVE databases and TiKV security advisories) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Attackers can exploit publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in outdated versions of TiKV for which patches are available.
        *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, can range from DoS to remote code execution and full system compromise, data breaches.
        *   **Mitigation:** Implement a robust patch management process. Regularly monitor CVE databases and TiKV security advisories and apply updates promptly.

## Attack Tree Path: [Misconfiguration Exploitation [HIGH-RISK PATH START, CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/misconfiguration_exploitation__high-risk_path_start__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting insecure configurations or deployment practices of TiKV.

    *   **Insecure Deployment Configuration [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:**
            *   **Exposing TiKV Ports to Public Networks without Proper Firewalling [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**  If TiKV ports (e.g., gRPC ports) are exposed to the public internet without proper firewall restrictions, attackers can directly attempt to connect and exploit any vulnerabilities.
        *   **Impact:** Exposes TiKV to all network-based attacks, potential unauthorized access, DoS.
        *   **Mitigation:** Isolate TiKV within a private network. Use firewalls to restrict access to authorized clients only.
    *   **Weak Security Settings [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:**
            *   **Disabling or Weakening Security Features (e.g., Encryption, Authentication) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Intentionally or unintentionally disabling or weakening security features like encryption or authentication significantly increases the attack surface.
        *   **Impact:** Increased attack surface, exposure to various attacks, data breaches, unauthorized access.
        *   **Mitigation:** Enable and properly configure all relevant security features. Avoid disabling security features unless absolutely necessary and with careful consideration.
    *   **Outdated TiKV Version [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:**
            *   **Running an Outdated Version of TiKV with Known Security Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Using an outdated version of TiKV leaves the system vulnerable to known security flaws that have been patched in newer versions.
        *   **Impact:** Exposure to known vulnerabilities, potential full compromise, data breaches, service disruption.
        *   **Mitigation:** Maintain a regular update schedule for TiKV. Implement a process for testing and deploying updates promptly.
