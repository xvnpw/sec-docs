# Threat Model Analysis for tikv/tikv

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Data via PD API](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_data_via_pd_api.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit missing or weak authentication and authorization on the Placement Driver (PD) API. They might use publicly exposed or weakly protected PD API endpoints to gain administrative privileges. This allows them to query cluster metadata, potentially revealing sensitive information about data layout, schema (if stored in TiKV), and cluster configuration.
*   **Impact:** Confidential data about the application's data storage and potentially the data itself could be exposed. This could lead to further attacks or direct data breaches if schema or data location information is sensitive.
*   **Affected Component:** Placement Driver (PD) API
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong authentication (e.g., mutual TLS, username/password with strong password policies) for all PD API access.
    *   Enforce role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict PD API access to only authorized users and services.
    *   Use TLS encryption for all communication with the PD API to protect credentials and metadata in transit.

## Threat: [Data Leakage through Unencrypted Network Communication](./threats/data_leakage_through_unencrypted_network_communication.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker positioned on the network could eavesdrop on communication channels between TiKV components (TiKV servers, PD, TiDB if used) or between client applications and TiKV. If TLS encryption is not enabled, they can intercept and read sensitive data transmitted in plaintext, including application data and internal TiKV communication.
*   **Impact:** Confidential application data and potentially internal TiKV operational data could be exposed to unauthorized parties. This is a direct confidentiality breach.
*   **Affected Component:** Network Communication (gRPC channels between TiKV components and clients)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable TLS encryption for all inter-component communication within the TiKV cluster (TiKV to TiKV, TiKV to PD, TiDB to TiKV, etc.).
    *   Enforce TLS encryption for client connections to TiKV.
    *   Use mutual TLS (mTLS) for enhanced authentication and authorization between components.

## Threat: [Data Exposure due to Insufficient Access Control within TiKV](./threats/data_exposure_due_to_insufficient_access_control_within_tikv.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker, potentially an insider or someone who has gained access to a TiKV server host, could exploit weaknesses or misconfigurations in TiKV's internal access control mechanisms. This could allow them to bypass intended data access restrictions and read data they are not authorized to access within the TiKV cluster.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to application data stored in TiKV. This is a direct confidentiality breach and could lead to data theft or misuse.
*   **Affected Component:** TiKV Server (Access Control Mechanisms)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize TiKV's built-in access control features (if available and applicable to your TiKV version and use case).
    *   Implement application-level access control on top of TiKV to enforce fine-grained permissions based on application logic and user roles.

## Threat: [Data Exposure from Underlying Storage (RocksDB) Vulnerabilities](./threats/data_exposure_from_underlying_storage__rocksdb__vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit known or zero-day vulnerabilities in RocksDB, the underlying storage engine used by TiKV. By targeting RocksDB directly, they might bypass TiKV's security layers and gain direct access to the data files stored by RocksDB, potentially leading to data leakage.
*   **Impact:** Direct access to and potential leakage of all data stored in TiKV, as RocksDB manages the persistent storage. This is a critical confidentiality breach.
*   **Affected Component:** RocksDB (Storage Engine - integrated within TiKV)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep TiKV and its bundled RocksDB version up-to-date with the latest security patches and stable releases.
    *   Monitor security advisories related to RocksDB and TiKV and promptly apply necessary updates.

## Threat: [Confidentiality Breach through TiKV Server Compromise](./threats/confidentiality_breach_through_tikv_server_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could compromise a TiKV server through vulnerabilities in the TiKV software, the underlying operating system, or misconfigurations. Once compromised, they gain full access to the server's resources, including the data stored on that TiKV instance.
*   **Impact:** Complete confidentiality breach of data stored on the compromised TiKV server. This could lead to large-scale data theft and exposure.
*   **Affected Component:** TiKV Server (Overall Server Security)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [Data Corruption due to Raft Consensus Vulnerabilities](./threats/data_corruption_due_to_raft_consensus_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** While Raft consensus is designed to ensure data consistency and integrity, undiscovered vulnerabilities in the Raft implementation within TiKV could be exploited by a sophisticated attacker. This could potentially lead to data corruption or inconsistencies across replicas, violating data integrity.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption and inconsistencies within the TiKV cluster. This can lead to application errors, data loss, and unreliable data retrieval.
*   **Affected Component:** Raft Consensus Algorithm Implementation (within TiKV)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep TiKV updated to benefit from bug fixes and security improvements in the Raft implementation.
    *   Thoroughly test TiKV upgrades and configurations in a non-production environment before deploying to production.

## Threat: [Data Manipulation via PD Compromise](./threats/data_manipulation_via_pd_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** If the Placement Driver (PD) is compromised, an attacker gains control over cluster metadata management. They could manipulate this metadata to redirect write operations to incorrect locations, alter data replication strategies, or even cause data loss by instructing the cluster to remove data. This can severely compromise data integrity.
*   **Impact:** Data manipulation, corruption, or loss due to malicious changes to cluster metadata. This can lead to application malfunction and data integrity violations.
*   **Affected Component:** Placement Driver (PD) (Metadata Management)
*   **Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Data Integrity Issues from TiKV Server Bugs](./threats/data_integrity_issues_from_tikv_server_bugs.md)

*   **Description:** Bugs within the TiKV server software itself, outside of the Raft implementation, could potentially lead to data corruption during write operations, data retrieval, or internal data management processes. These bugs might be triggered by specific data patterns, workloads, or edge cases.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption within TiKV. This can lead to application errors, data loss, and unreliable data retrieval.
*   **Affected Component:** TiKV Server (General Software Bugs)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use stable and well-tested versions of TiKV to minimize the risk of encountering bugs.
    *   Thoroughly test application interactions with TiKV, including data validation after writes and reads.

## Threat: [Data Modification through TiKV Server Compromise](./threats/data_modification_through_tikv_server_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** If a TiKV server is compromised, an attacker can not only read data but also directly modify or delete data stored on that server. This bypasses application-level access controls and directly alters the data within the TiKV storage layer.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized modification or deletion of application data. This is a severe integrity violation and can lead to data loss, application malfunction, and business disruption.
*   **Affected Component:** TiKV Server (Data Access and Modification)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust security hardening for TiKV server operating systems (as described in Confidentiality Threats).
    *   Regularly back up TiKV data to allow for recovery from data modification incidents.

## Threat: [Replay Attacks on gRPC Interface](./threats/replay_attacks_on_grpc_interface.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could intercept valid gRPC requests sent to TiKV and replay them later to perform unauthorized actions, such as modifying or deleting data. If the gRPC interface lacks sufficient protection against replay attacks, this can be a viable attack vector.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data modification or actions due to replayed requests. This can lead to data integrity violations and application malfunction.
*   **Affected Component:** gRPC Interface (Client-TiKV Communication)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement mechanisms to prevent replay attacks on the gRPC interface, such as including unique request IDs and timestamps in requests and validating them on the server side.
    *   Use mutual TLS (mTLS) for gRPC communication.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks on PD](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__attacks_on_pd.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could flood the Placement Driver (PD) with a large volume of requests, overwhelming its resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth). This can cause the PD to become unresponsive or crash, disrupting cluster management operations and potentially leading to service unavailability.
*   **Impact:** Disruption of TiKV cluster management, potential service unavailability, and inability to scale or recover from failures.
*   **Affected Component:** Placement Driver (PD) (Request Handling)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement rate limiting and traffic shaping for PD API requests.
    *   Deploy PD instances in a highly available configuration (e.g., multiple PD nodes behind a load balancer).

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks on TiKV Servers](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__attacks_on_tikv_servers.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could flood TiKV servers with a large volume of read or write requests, overwhelming their resources. This can cause TiKV servers to become unresponsive or crash, directly impacting application availability as data becomes inaccessible or write operations fail.
*   **Impact:** Application unavailability due to TiKV server overload. This can lead to service disruption and business impact.
*   **Affected Component:** TiKV Server (Request Handling)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement rate limiting and request prioritization at the application level.
    *   Deploy TiKV servers with sufficient resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth, disk I/O) to handle expected load and potential traffic spikes.
    *   Use load balancing to distribute traffic across multiple TiKV servers.

## Threat: [Availability Impact from Raft Quorum Loss](./threats/availability_impact_from_raft_quorum_loss.md)

*   **Description:** If a sufficient number of TiKV server replicas fail simultaneously (more than the allowed fault tolerance based on the replication factor, e.g., more than one replica in a 3-replica setup), the Raft quorum can be lost. This prevents the cluster from reaching consensus on data writes and can lead to data unavailability and write failures until the quorum is restored.
*   **Impact:** Data unavailability and inability to perform write operations. This can lead to application downtime and data access disruption.
*   **Affected Component:** Raft Consensus Algorithm (Quorum Management - within TiKV)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Deploy TiKV with a sufficient replication factor (e.g., 3 replicas) to tolerate node failures.
    *   Implement robust monitoring and alerting for TiKV server health and Raft replication status.

## Threat: [Availability Disruption due to Misconfiguration](./threats/availability_disruption_due_to_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrect configuration of TiKV components, especially PD and TiKV servers, can lead to performance degradation, instability, and ultimately service unavailability. Misconfigurations can include incorrect resource limits, network settings, or Raft parameters, leading to cluster instability or failure.
*   **Impact:** Service disruption, performance degradation, and potential cluster instability or failure due to misconfiguration.
*   **Affected Component:** TiKV Cluster (Configuration Management)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
