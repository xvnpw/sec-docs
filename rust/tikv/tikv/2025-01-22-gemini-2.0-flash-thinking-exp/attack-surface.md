# Attack Surface Analysis for tikv/tikv

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated gRPC API Access](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_grpc_api_access.md)

*   **Description:** TiKV's gRPC API, used for client communication and cluster management, is exposed without proper authentication.
*   **TiKV Contribution:** TiKV, by default, does not enforce authentication on its gRPC endpoints. This relies on external configuration or plugins for security, making it a direct TiKV configuration issue.
*   **Example:** An attacker on the same network as a TiKV cluster can directly connect to the gRPC port and issue commands to read, write, or delete data without any credentials.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data manipulation, data deletion, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enable TLS Encryption:**  Encrypt all gRPC communication using TLS to prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **Implement Authentication Plugins:** Utilize TiKV's authentication plugin framework to enforce strong authentication for gRPC clients. Consider using plugins like JWT, mTLS, or integration with external authentication providers.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate TiKV clusters within private networks and restrict access using firewalls to only authorized clients and components.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only necessary permissions to users and applications accessing TiKV.

## Attack Surface: [Placement Driver (PD) API Exposure](./attack_surfaces/placement_driver__pd__api_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** The PD gRPC API, responsible for cluster management, is accessible without sufficient authorization.
*   **TiKV Contribution:** PD is a core component of TiKV and its security is directly managed within the TiKV ecosystem. Unsecured PD access grants control over the entire TiKV cluster.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the PD gRPC port and uses it to manipulate cluster metadata, add rogue TiKV nodes, or shut down the cluster.
*   **Impact:** Cluster instability, data loss, denial of service, complete cluster compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure PD gRPC API:** Apply the same security measures as for TiKV gRPC API: TLS encryption and strong authentication plugins.
    *   **Restrict PD Access:** Limit access to the PD API to only authorized cluster administrators and internal TiKV components. Use network segmentation and firewalls to enforce access control.
    *   **Regular Auditing:** Monitor PD API access logs for suspicious activities and unauthorized attempts.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in RocksDB](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_rocksdb.md)

*   **Description:** TiKV relies on RocksDB as its storage engine, and vulnerabilities in RocksDB can directly impact TiKV's security.
*   **TiKV Contribution:** TiKV directly integrates and depends on RocksDB. RocksDB's security is a critical part of TiKV's overall security posture.
*   **Example:** A known buffer overflow vulnerability in the version of RocksDB used by TiKV is exploited by sending specially crafted data, leading to arbitrary code execution on the TiKV server.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, data loss, denial of service, arbitrary code execution on the TiKV server, potential data exfiltration.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the specific vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep RocksDB Updated:** Regularly update TiKV to versions that include the latest stable and patched versions of RocksDB. Monitor security advisories for both TiKV and RocksDB.
    *   **Secure File System Permissions:** Ensure proper file system permissions for RocksDB data directories to prevent unauthorized access or modification of data files at the OS level.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct security audits and penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities in the TiKV and RocksDB deployment.

## Attack Surface: [Raft Implementation Flaws](./attack_surfaces/raft_implementation_flaws.md)

*   **Description:** Bugs or weaknesses in TiKV's Raft consensus protocol implementation can lead to data inconsistencies or cluster instability.
*   **TiKV Contribution:** TiKV's core functionality relies on its Raft implementation, which is part of the TiKV codebase. Flaws in this implementation directly impact data consistency and cluster reliability, making it a direct TiKV issue.
*   **Example:** A bug in the Raft implementation is triggered during a network partition, causing data to be written inconsistently across replicas, leading to data corruption or loss.
*   **Impact:** Data inconsistency, data corruption, data loss, cluster instability, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use Stable TiKV Versions:** Deploy and operate TiKV using stable, well-tested versions. Avoid using nightly builds or experimental versions in production environments.
    *   **Thorough Testing:** Conduct rigorous testing, including fault injection and network partition simulations, to identify potential issues in the Raft implementation under various conditions.
    *   **Monitor Cluster Health:** Implement robust monitoring and alerting to detect anomalies or inconsistencies in Raft replication and cluster health.
    *   **Stay Updated with Security Patches:** Apply security patches and updates released by the TiKV development team promptly.
