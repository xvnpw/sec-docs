# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for tikv/tikv

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable TLS Encryption (TiKV-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/enable_tls_encryption__tikv-specific_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Enable TLS Encryption for all TiKV communication channels.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Generate Certificates:** Use a trusted CA or a self-signed CA (dev/test only). Generate key pairs and certificates for *each* TiKV server instance.
    2.  **Configure TiKV:** Modify the TiKV configuration file (`tikv.toml` or similar):
        *   `security.ca-path`: Path to the CA certificate.
        *   `security.cert-path`: Path to the TiKV server's certificate.
        *   `security.key-path`: Path to the TiKV server's private key.
        *   `security.cipher-suites`: List of strong, allowed cipher suites (e.g., `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`).  *Crucially*, this must be consistent across all TiKV, PD, and client configurations.
    3.  **Configure Inter-node Communication:** Ensure the above `security` settings are applied consistently for *both* client-to-server *and* inter-node (TiKV-to-TiKV, TiKV-to-PD) communication. This often requires configuring how TiKV instances discover each other (e.g., through PD) to use TLS.
    4.  **Restart TiKV Instances:** Restart all TiKV instances for the changes to take effect.
    5.  **Verify Connection:** Use tools like `openssl s_client` (connecting to a TiKV port) or TiKV client with verbose logging to verify TLS is active and certificates are valid.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Exposure (High Severity):** Prevents eavesdropping on data transmitted between TiKV nodes and between clients and TiKV.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from intercepting/modifying data in transit between TiKV nodes or between clients and TiKV.
    *   **Unauthorized Access (Medium Severity):** Makes unauthorized connections more difficult (especially with mTLS).

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Exposure:** Risk significantly reduced (almost eliminated with proper configuration).
    *   **MitM Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced (almost eliminated with proper configuration).
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduced, further mitigated by mTLS.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic TLS (server-side only) is configured for TiKV inter-node communication.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Cipher suite configuration is not explicitly defined, relying on defaults.
    *   TLS is not enforced for all internal communication; some diagnostic tools still use unencrypted connections.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Mutual TLS (mTLS) (TiKV-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_mutual_tls__mtls___tikv-specific_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Mutual TLS (mTLS) for TiKV client-server and inter-component authentication.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Generate Client Certificates:**  Generate key pairs and certificates for *each* client that will connect to TiKV.
    2.  **Configure TiKV for Client Authentication:** In the TiKV configuration file (`tikv.toml`), add:
        *   `security.verify-client-cert`: Set to `true` to *require* client certificates.
        *   `security.client-ca-path`: Path to the CA certificate used to verify client certificates.
    3.  **Configure Inter-node mTLS:** Ensure that TiKV-to-TiKV and TiKV-to-PD communication *also* uses mTLS. This requires configuring the discovery mechanism (usually PD) to support and enforce mTLS.  This is often the most complex part.
    4.  **Restart and Verify:** Restart all TiKV instances and verify that clients *without* valid certificates are rejected, and that inter-node communication is also using mTLS.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized clients from connecting to TiKV, even with network access.
    *   **Spoofing Attacks (Medium Severity):** Makes it harder to impersonate legitimate clients or TiKV nodes.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk significantly reduced (almost eliminated with proper configuration and key management).
    *   **Spoofing Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   mTLS is not configured on TiKV for either client connections or inter-node communication.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Connection Limits (TiKV Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/connection_limits__tikv_configuration_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Configure TiKV's `max-connections` setting appropriately.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Assess Capacity:** Determine the maximum number of concurrent connections your TiKV instances can handle based on hardware resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) and expected workload.
    2.  **Configure `max-connections`:** In the TiKV configuration file (`tikv.toml`), set the `server.max-connections` parameter to a reasonable value.  This is a *global* limit for each TiKV instance.
    3.  **Monitor and Tune:** Monitor connection counts and system performance. Adjust `max-connections` as needed.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Limits the total number of concurrent connections, preventing connection exhaustion.  This is a basic, but important, defense.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Risk partially reduced.  It prevents one type of DoS, but other DoS attacks are still possible.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `max-connections` is set to a default value.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   The value has not been tuned based on the specific hardware and workload.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Stay Updated (TiKV)](./mitigation_strategies/stay_updated__tikv_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Keep TiKV up-to-date with the latest stable releases.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor Release Notes:** Regularly check the TiKV release notes on GitHub for security patches and bug fixes.
    2.  **Test Updates:** Before deploying updates to production, thoroughly test them in a staging environment that mirrors production as closely as possible.
    3.  **Rollback Plan:** Have a documented rollback plan in case an update causes problems.
    4. **Update Procedure:** Follow the official TiKV upgrade documentation carefully.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities (Variable Severity):** Patches address known security vulnerabilities in TiKV itself.
    *   **Bugs (Variable Severity):** Updates often include bug fixes that can improve stability and prevent data corruption specific to TiKV's internal operations.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities/Bugs:** Risk reduced, depending on the severity of the patched issues.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   The project aims to stay on the latest stable releases, but updates are not always applied immediately.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A formal process for testing and deploying TiKV updates is not in place.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Replication Factor (TiKV Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/replication_factor__tikv_configuration_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Ensure an appropriate replication factor is configured for the TiKV cluster.

* **Description:**
    1. **Understand Requirements:** Determine the level of data redundancy and fault tolerance needed. A replication factor of 3 is generally recommended for production environments.
    2. **Configure `max-replicas`:** In the PD configuration file (which controls TiKV's replication), set the `replication.max-replicas` parameter to the desired value (e.g., 3). This setting dictates how many copies of each data region TiKV will maintain.
    3. **Monitor Region Health:** Use TiKV's monitoring tools (or PD's dashboard) to ensure that all regions have the expected number of replicas and that they are healthy.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Data Loss (High Severity):** Provides redundancy in case of node failures. With a replication factor of 3, the cluster can tolerate the loss of one or two nodes without data loss.
    * **Data Corruption (Medium Severity):** Helps mitigate data corruption on a single node, as the healthy replicas can be used to recover the data.

* **Impact:**
    * **Data Loss:** Risk significantly reduced.
    * **Data Corruption:** Risk reduced.

* **Currently Implemented:**
    * `max-replicas` is set to 3.

* **Missing Implementation:**
     *  No specific monitoring alerts are configured for region health issues related to replication.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Checksum Verification (TiKV Configuration - Usually Default)](./mitigation_strategies/checksum_verification__tikv_configuration_-_usually_default_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Ensure checksum verification is enabled in TiKV (usually on by default).

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Verify Configuration:** Check the TiKV configuration file (`tikv.toml`) for settings related to checksums (e.g., `storage.enable-ttl-check`, `raftstore.check-leader-lease`).  While usually enabled by default, it's crucial to confirm.
    2.  **Monitor Logs:** Monitor TiKV logs for any checksum errors. These errors could indicate hardware problems, data corruption, or other issues.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Corruption (Medium Severity):** Detects data corruption caused by hardware failures, software bugs, or other issues.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Corruption:** Risk of *undetected* data corruption is reduced.  Checksums provide early warning.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Checksum verification is enabled by default.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No specific monitoring or alerting is configured to proactively detect checksum errors reported in logs.
