Okay, let's create a design document for the TiKV project, focusing on aspects relevant for threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

TiKV is a distributed, transactional key-value database.  It's designed to provide high availability, strong consistency, and horizontal scalability.  It's often used as the storage layer for systems that require these properties, such as distributed SQL databases (like TiDB), financial systems, and other mission-critical applications.

Business Priorities:

*   Reliability:  Data must not be lost or corrupted.  The system must remain operational even in the face of hardware failures, network partitions, and other adverse conditions.
*   Consistency:  Transactions must be ACID-compliant.  Clients should always see a consistent view of the data.
*   Scalability:  The system must be able to handle increasing amounts of data and traffic by adding more nodes.
*   Performance:  The system should provide low latency and high throughput for key-value operations.
*   Maintainability: The project should be easy to maintain, update and debug.
*   Open Source: The project should be easy to contribute to.

Business Goals:

*   Provide a robust and reliable storage engine for distributed systems.
*   Become a leading key-value database solution in the cloud-native ecosystem.
*   Attract a large and active community of users and contributors.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Data Loss or Corruption:  This is the most critical risk.  Any bug or failure that leads to data loss or corruption would severely damage the reputation and viability of the project.
*   Service Unavailability:  Extended periods of downtime would disrupt the applications that rely on TiKV.
*   Security Breach:  Unauthorized access to data or control of the system could have severe consequences, especially for sensitive data.
*   Performance Degradation:  Significant performance issues could make TiKV unusable for its intended purpose.
*   Inability to Scale: If TiKV cannot scale to meet the demands of its users, it will limit its adoption and usefulness.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Network Security: TiKV uses gRPC for communication between nodes and with clients. This communication can be secured using TLS. (Described in TiKV documentation and configuration options).
*   security control: Authentication: TiKV supports client authentication using TLS certificates. (Described in TiKV documentation).
*   security control: Authorization: TiKV has a basic authorization model based on user roles and permissions, although it's less granular than some other database systems. (Described in TiKV documentation).
*   security control: Data Encryption at Rest: TiKV supports encryption at rest using various encryption methods, including transparent data encryption (TDE). (Described in TiKV documentation).
*   security control: Auditing: TiKV provides some auditing capabilities, logging important events. (Described in TiKV documentation).
*   security control: Code Reviews: The TiKV project uses a rigorous code review process on GitHub to ensure code quality and security. (Visible in the GitHub repository).
*   security control: Static Analysis: The project uses static analysis tools (like linters and code analyzers) to identify potential bugs and vulnerabilities. (Visible in the CI workflows on GitHub).
*   security control: Fuzz Testing: TiKV employs fuzz testing to find edge cases and vulnerabilities that might be missed by traditional testing methods. (Visible in the codebase and CI workflows).
*   security control: Dependency Management: The project uses dependency management tools (like Cargo for Rust) to manage external libraries and keep them up-to-date. (Visible in the `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock` files).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Limited Granularity of Authorization: The current authorization model may not be sufficient for all use cases, particularly those requiring fine-grained access control.
*   accepted risk: Complexity of Distributed Systems: The inherent complexity of distributed systems introduces a larger attack surface and makes it more challenging to reason about security.
*   accepted risk: Reliance on External Libraries: Like all software, TiKV relies on external libraries, which could potentially contain vulnerabilities.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   Implement more granular authorization: Consider integrating with a more robust authorization system or extending the existing model to support finer-grained permissions.
*   Enhance auditing capabilities: Provide more comprehensive audit logs, including detailed information about data access and modifications.
*   Implement regular security assessments: Conduct penetration testing and vulnerability scanning on a regular basis.
*   Improve documentation on security best practices: Provide clear and comprehensive documentation on how to securely deploy and operate TiKV.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   All client connections must be authenticated.
    *   Support for strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., mutual TLS).
    *   Protection against brute-force attacks.

*   Authorization:
    *   Implement role-based access control (RBAC) with sufficient granularity.
    *   Enforce the principle of least privilege.
    *   Ability to define custom roles and permissions.

*   Input Validation:
    *   Validate all input from clients and other nodes.
    *   Protect against common injection attacks (e.g., key injection).

*   Cryptography:
    *   Use strong, well-vetted cryptographic algorithms and libraries.
    *   Securely manage cryptographic keys.
    *   Protect data in transit and at rest using encryption.
    *   Regularly review and update cryptographic practices.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Data Storage and Retrieval: The core function of TiKV is to reliably store and retrieve data.
*   Transaction Processing: TiKV must ensure the ACID properties of transactions.
*   Cluster Management: PD must maintain the health and availability of the TiKV cluster.

Data Sensitivity:

*   TiKV can store data of varying sensitivity levels, depending on the application using it. This could range from non-sensitive data to highly sensitive data (e.g., financial records, personal information). The sensitivity of the data being stored should be a primary consideration when configuring and deploying TiKV.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   What specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS) must TiKV deployments adhere to? This will influence the necessary security controls and configurations.
*   What is the expected threat model? Are there specific attackers or attack vectors that are of particular concern?
*   What level of performance is required? This will impact the choice of hardware and configuration options.
*   What is the expected data volume and growth rate? This will influence the scalability requirements.
*   Are there any specific integration requirements with other systems?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: We assume a high need for reliability, consistency, and scalability, typical of a distributed database. We assume a moderate to high risk aversion, given the potential for data loss or corruption.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: We assume that basic security controls (TLS, authentication) are in place, but there's room for improvement in areas like authorization and auditing. We assume a reliance on the security of underlying infrastructure (e.g., Kubernetes, cloud provider).
*   DESIGN: We assume a Kubernetes-based deployment is the primary target environment. We assume that the TiKV project is actively maintained and that security vulnerabilities are addressed promptly. We assume that users of TiKV have some understanding of distributed systems and security best practices.
