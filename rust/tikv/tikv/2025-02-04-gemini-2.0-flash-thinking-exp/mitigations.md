# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for tikv/tikv

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable TiKV Authentication](./mitigation_strategies/enable_tikv_authentication.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Generate Certificates:** Use TiKV's `pd-ctl` or `tikv-ctl` tools to generate necessary certificates for authentication (e.g., CA certificate, server certificate, client certificate).
    2.  **Configure PD Server:** Modify the PD server configuration file (`pd.toml`) to enable authentication by setting `security.auth.enable = true` and specifying paths to the generated certificates (`security.auth.cert-path`, `security.auth.key-path`, `security.auth.ca-path`).
    3.  **Configure TiKV Server:** Modify the TiKV server configuration file (`tikv.toml`) to enable authentication by setting `security.auth.enable = true` and specifying paths to the generated certificates (`security.auth.cert-path`, `security.auth.key-path`, `security.auth.ca-path`).
    4.  **Create Users:** Use `pd-ctl` or `tikv-ctl` to create users with specific permissions. Define users with the principle of least privilege, granting only necessary access. For example, create a user for application access with read/write permissions on specific keyspaces, and separate users for administrative tasks.
    5.  **Configure Clients:** When connecting to TiKV from applications or tools, configure the client to use the generated client certificate and authenticate with the created user credentials. This typically involves providing the certificate paths and username/password (if applicable) in the client connection string or configuration.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized clients from connecting to the TiKV cluster and accessing sensitive data. Without authentication, anyone with network access to the TiKV ports could potentially read or modify data.
        *   **Data Breach (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of data breaches by limiting access to authorized users and applications only.
        *   **Insider Threats (Medium Severity):** Mitigates risks from malicious insiders or compromised accounts by enforcing access control and auditing user actions.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access:** High reduction. Authentication effectively blocks unauthorized connections at the network level.
        *   **Data Breach:** High reduction. Significantly reduces the attack surface by limiting potential access points to the data.
        *   **Insider Threats:** Medium reduction.  Limits the potential damage from compromised accounts by enforcing granular permissions.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Authentication is enabled for internal TiKV cluster components (PD to TiKV, TiKV to TiKV) using default configurations and certificates generated during initial deployment. However, application clients are currently connecting without explicit authentication using client certificates and user management is not fully utilized.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Full implementation of TiKV authentication for all client connections, including application clients.  Missing granular user management and role-based access control to enforce the principle of least privilege.  Missing integration with application's authentication system for seamless user management.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable TLS Encryption for Client Connections](./mitigation_strategies/enable_tls_encryption_for_client_connections.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Generate TLS Certificates:** Generate TLS certificates for TiKV servers and clients. This can be done using tools like `openssl` or TiKV's certificate generation utilities. Ensure certificates are properly signed by a Certificate Authority (CA).
    2.  **Configure TiKV Server for TLS:** Modify the TiKV server configuration file (`tikv.toml`) to enable TLS for client connections. Configure the `[security]` section to specify paths to the server certificate, private key, and CA certificate. Set `security.transport-security.client-ssl-enabled = true`.
    3.  **Configure Clients for TLS:** When connecting to TiKV from applications, configure the client to use TLS. This typically involves specifying the CA certificate path in the client connection configuration to verify the TiKV server's certificate. For example, in TiDB, configure the `security.ssl-ca` parameter. For direct TiKV clients, consult the client library documentation for TLS configuration options.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Eavesdropping (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from intercepting and reading sensitive data transmitted between the application and TiKV. Without TLS, data is transmitted in plaintext, making it vulnerable to network sniffing.
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (High Severity):** Protects against man-in-the-middle attacks where an attacker intercepts communication and potentially modifies data or impersonates either the client or the server. TLS provides encryption and authentication, making such attacks significantly harder.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Eavesdropping:** High reduction. TLS encryption renders intercepted data unreadable without the decryption keys.
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** High reduction. TLS certificate verification and encryption make it extremely difficult for attackers to successfully perform man-in-the-middle attacks.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. TLS is enabled for internal communication within the TiKV cluster (peer-to-peer, PD-to-TiKV). However, client-facing connections from the application to TiKV are currently not using TLS.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Enable TLS encryption for all client connections from the application to the TiKV cluster. Configure application clients to properly use and verify TLS certificates when connecting to TiKV.  Establish a robust certificate management process for generating, distributing, and rotating TLS certificates.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure TiKV-Level Resource Control (If Available)](./mitigation_strategies/configure_tikv-level_resource_control__if_available_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Explore TiKV Resource Control Features:**  Thoroughly review the TiKV documentation for the specific version being used to identify any built-in resource control or quota mechanisms. Look for configuration options related to limiting resource consumption by clients or operations.
    2.  **Implement TiKV Resource Limits:** If TiKV provides resource control features, configure them according to your application's requirements and security considerations. This might involve setting limits on:
        *   **Request Rate:** Limit the number of requests per second from specific clients or users.
        *   **Query Complexity:** Limit the complexity or resource consumption of individual queries.
        *   **Storage Quotas:** Limit the amount of storage space that can be used by specific tenants or applications (if applicable).
    3.  **Monitor Resource Usage:**  Monitor TiKV resource usage metrics to ensure that configured resource limits are effective and to identify potential resource contention or denial-of-service attempts.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Resource Exhaustion (High Severity):** Prevents denial-of-service attacks caused by resource exhaustion at the TiKV level. Attackers might try to overload TiKV with requests or exploit resource-intensive operations.
        *   **Noisy Neighbor Problem (Medium Severity):** In multi-tenant or shared environments, TiKV-level resource control can help prevent a "noisy neighbor" application or tenant from consuming excessive TiKV resources and impacting other applications.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Resource Exhaustion:** Medium to High reduction (depending on the granularity and effectiveness of TiKV's resource control features). TiKV-level controls provide a direct defense against resource exhaustion within the database system itself.
        *   **Noisy Neighbor Problem:** Medium reduction. Helps ensure fair resource allocation within the TiKV cluster.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. TiKV-level resource control features have not been actively explored or configured. Reliance is primarily on OS-level resource limits and application-level rate limiting.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Investigate and implement available TiKV-level resource control features to enhance protection against resource exhaustion DoS attacks and improve resource management within the TiKV cluster.  Specifically, explore if TiKV offers any mechanisms to limit request rate, query complexity, or storage usage at the TiKV level.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Configuration Management for TiKV](./mitigation_strategies/secure_configuration_management_for_tikv.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Follow Security Hardening Guides:**  Actively seek out and follow official TiKV security hardening guides and best practices documentation provided by the TiKV project or community.
    2.  **Review Default Configurations:**  Thoroughly review all default TiKV configuration files (e.g., `tikv.toml`, `pd.toml`). Identify and modify any default settings that pose security risks or are not aligned with security best practices.  Pay particular attention to settings related to networking, authentication, authorization, logging, and resource limits.
    3.  **Automate Configuration Management:**  Use configuration management tools (e.g., Ansible, Puppet, Chef) to automate the deployment and management of TiKV configurations. This ensures consistent and secure configurations across the cluster and prevents configuration drift. Store configurations in version control to track changes and facilitate rollbacks.
    4.  **Regular Configuration Audits:**  Periodically audit TiKV configurations to ensure they remain secure and compliant with security policies. Compare current configurations against a baseline secure configuration and identify any deviations.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Misconfiguration Vulnerabilities (Medium to High Severity):** Prevents vulnerabilities arising from insecure default configurations or misconfigurations of TiKV components. Misconfigurations can inadvertently expose sensitive data, weaken access controls, or create other security weaknesses.
        *   **Configuration Drift (Medium Severity):**  Mitigates risks associated with configuration drift, where configurations deviate from a secure baseline over time, potentially introducing vulnerabilities.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Misconfiguration Vulnerabilities:** Medium to High reduction. Secure configuration practices significantly reduce the likelihood of introducing vulnerabilities through misconfigurations.
        *   **Configuration Drift:** Medium reduction. Automated configuration management and regular audits help maintain a consistent and secure configuration state over time.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic configuration management using Ansible is in place for initial TiKV deployment. Default configurations have been reviewed and some modifications made based on initial security considerations.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  More comprehensive and proactive security hardening based on official TiKV security guides.  Regular and automated configuration audits to detect and remediate configuration drift.  Version control and rollback mechanisms for TiKV configurations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Subscribe to TiKV Security Advisories](./mitigation_strategies/subscribe_to_tikv_security_advisories.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Official Security Channels:**  Locate the official channels for TiKV security advisories. This might include:
        *   TiKV project's GitHub repository (look for security-related issues or announcements).
        *   TiKV mailing lists or forums.
        *   Security advisory databases that track TiKV vulnerabilities (e.g., CVE databases).
    2.  **Subscribe to Security Channels:**  Subscribe to the identified security channels to receive notifications about new security vulnerabilities, patches, and security-related updates for TiKV.
    3.  **Proactive Patching and Updates:**  Establish a process for promptly reviewing and applying security patches and updates released by the TiKV project. Prioritize patching critical vulnerabilities to minimize the window of exposure.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Known Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of exploitation of known vulnerabilities in TiKV. Staying informed about security advisories allows for timely patching and mitigation of identified vulnerabilities.
        *   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities (Indirect Mitigation - Medium Severity):** While not directly preventing zero-day attacks, staying updated on security best practices and applying patches promptly can indirectly reduce the risk by ensuring the system is as secure as possible and reducing the attack surface.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Known Vulnerabilities:** High reduction. Timely patching effectively eliminates the risk associated with known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:** Medium reduction (indirect). Proactive security practices and staying informed improve overall security posture and reduce potential attack vectors.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented.  The team monitors general open-source security news and occasionally checks the TiKV GitHub repository for security-related issues. However, there is no formal subscription to dedicated TiKV security advisory channels.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Establish a formal process for subscribing to and monitoring official TiKV security advisory channels.  Implement a documented procedure for promptly reviewing and applying security patches and updates for TiKV.  Integrate vulnerability monitoring and patching into the regular maintenance schedule.
