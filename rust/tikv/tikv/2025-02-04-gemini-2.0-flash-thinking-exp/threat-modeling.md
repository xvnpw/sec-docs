# Threat Model Analysis for tikv/tikv

## Threat: [PD Node Compromise](./threats/pd_node_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains control of a Placement Driver (PD) node. This allows manipulation of cluster metadata and region placement, potentially achieved by exploiting PD software vulnerabilities or gaining unauthorized access.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Data Loss/Corruption:** Manipulating metadata can lead to data being misplaced or inaccessible, causing data loss or corruption.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Disrupting cluster operations through PD manipulation can lead to a complete outage of the TiKV service.
        *   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Manipulating region placement can direct data access requests to attacker-controlled nodes, enabling unauthorized data access.
    *   **Affected TiKV Component:** Placement Driver (PD)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong access control and authentication for PD nodes.
        *   Harden PD servers and isolate them within secure network segments.
        *   Regularly audit PD node security configurations and access logs.
        *   Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems for PD nodes.
        *   Apply the principle of least privilege for PD access and operations.

## Threat: [TiKV Server Data Breach (Direct File Access)](./threats/tikv_server_data_breach__direct_file_access_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the underlying storage of a TiKV server node at the OS level. This allows direct reading of RocksDB data files, bypassing TiKV's access controls.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Confidentiality Breach:** Direct access to data files allows the attacker to read all data stored on that TiKV node, leading to a complete breach of data confidentiality.
    *   **Affected TiKV Component:** TiKV Server (Storage Engine - RocksDB Files)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement **Encryption at Rest** for TiKV data using RocksDB encryption or underlying storage encryption.
        *   Harden TiKV server operating systems and restrict access using strong access control lists (ACLs) and firewalls.
        *   Regularly patch operating systems and TiKV server software.
        *   Implement robust physical security measures for server infrastructure.

## Threat: [TiKV Server Denial of Service (DoS)](./threats/tikv_server_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker overwhelms a TiKV server node with excessive requests or exploits vulnerabilities in TiKV server software to cause resource exhaustion and prevent processing of legitimate requests.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Service Disruption:** A DoS attack on TiKV servers can lead to application unavailability or severe performance degradation.
        *   **Data Inaccessibility:** If multiple TiKV servers are affected, the entire TiKV cluster's ability to serve data can be compromised.
    *   **Affected TiKV Component:** TiKV Server (gRPC Interface, Request Handling)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting and request throttling at the application and network levels.
        *   Configure resource limits for TiKV server processes.
        *   Implement network-level security controls to filter malicious traffic.
        *   Regularly monitor TiKV server resource utilization and performance metrics.
        *   Patch TiKV server software to address DoS vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack on gRPC Communication](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_grpc_communication.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between application clients and TiKV servers, or between TiKV components, when TLS encryption is not properly enforced. This allows eavesdropping and potential modification of data in transit.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Confidentiality Breach:** Eavesdropping allows reading sensitive data transmitted between clients and TiKV or within the cluster.
        *   **Data Integrity Compromise:** Modifying data in transit can lead to data corruption or manipulation.
    *   **Affected TiKV Component:** gRPC Communication Channels (Client-TiKV, TiKV-TiKV, TiKV-PD)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enforce TLS encryption for all TiKV communication channels.**
        *   Properly configure TLS certificates and key management for all TiKV components.
        *   Regularly audit TLS configurations.

## Threat: [PD API Abuse](./threats/pd_api_abuse.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Placement Driver (PD) API, potentially due to weak authentication or exposed endpoints. This allows triggering administrative operations via the API.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Cluster Instability:** Triggering unnecessary rebalancing or administrative tasks can degrade cluster performance and stability.
        *   **Information Disclosure:** Retrieving cluster metadata via the API can reveal sensitive configuration details.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Flooding the PD API with requests can cause resource exhaustion and DoS for PD operations.
    *   **Affected TiKV Component:** Placement Driver (PD) API
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust authentication and authorization for all PD API endpoints.
        *   Enforce network segmentation to restrict access to the PD API.
        *   Implement rate limiting and input validation on PD API requests.
        *   Regularly audit PD API access logs.
