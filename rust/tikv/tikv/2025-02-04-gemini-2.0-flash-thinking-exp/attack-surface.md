# Attack Surface Analysis for tikv/tikv

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured gRPC Channels](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_grpc_channels.md)

### 1. Unsecured gRPC Channels

*   **Description:** Communication channels between clients and TiKV, and between TiKV components (TiKV, PD, etc.), are not encrypted.
*   **TiKV Contribution:** TiKV *directly* uses gRPC for all communication and *defaults* to unencrypted channels if TLS is not explicitly configured. This makes it a primary contributor to this attack surface.
*   **Example:** An attacker eavesdrops on network traffic between an application and TiKV, capturing sensitive data being stored or retrieved, such as user credentials or financial information.
*   **Impact:** Data confidentiality breach, potential data manipulation if combined with other attacks, compliance violations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enable TLS for all gRPC channels:** Configure TiKV and clients to use TLS encryption for all communication. This includes client-to-TiKV, TiKV-to-PD, and TiKV-to-TiKV communication within the cluster.
    *   **Use strong TLS configurations:**  Employ strong cipher suites and ensure proper certificate management.
    *   **Regularly update TLS libraries:** Keep the underlying TLS libraries (e.g., OpenSSL) up to date to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated API Access](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_api_access.md)

### 2. Unauthenticated API Access

*   **Description:** TiKV's gRPC API is accessible without proper authentication, allowing unauthorized clients to interact with the data store.
*   **TiKV Contribution:** TiKV's gRPC API, if not configured with authentication, *directly* allows connections and requests from any source that can reach its network port. TiKV's access control is configurable and requires explicit enabling.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains network access to the TiKV port and uses gRPC tools to directly connect and issue commands to read, write, or delete data without any authorization checks.
*   **Impact:** Data integrity compromise, data confidentiality breach, denial of service through malicious operations, potential complete system compromise if coupled with other vulnerabilities.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enable Authentication:** Configure TiKV to require authentication for all API requests. TiKV supports various authentication mechanisms; choose a strong and appropriate method for your environment.
    *   **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  Utilize TiKV's RBAC features to define granular permissions and restrict access based on user roles and privileges.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the necessary permissions to applications and users interacting with TiKV.

## Attack Surface: [RocksDB Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/rocksdb_vulnerabilities.md)

### 3. RocksDB Vulnerabilities

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities present in the underlying RocksDB storage engine used by TiKV can be exploited to compromise TiKV's security.
*   **TiKV Contribution:** TiKV *directly* and fundamentally relies on RocksDB for persistent data storage.  Therefore, any vulnerability in RocksDB *directly* impacts TiKV's security and data integrity.
*   **Example:** A known vulnerability in a specific version of RocksDB allows an attacker to craft a malicious data write operation that corrupts the database or allows for data exfiltration.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, data loss, data confidentiality breach, denial of service, potential for privilege escalation if vulnerabilities allow escaping the RocksDB sandbox (less likely).
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the specific RocksDB vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regularly Update RocksDB:**  Keep RocksDB updated to the latest stable version provided by TiKV or directly from the RocksDB project. TiKV usually bundles tested and compatible RocksDB versions.
    *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Subscribe to security advisories for both TiKV and RocksDB to stay informed about newly discovered vulnerabilities and apply patches promptly.
    *   **Consider Data at Rest Encryption:** While not directly mitigating RocksDB vulnerabilities, data at rest encryption can limit the impact of data breaches if storage media is compromised due to a RocksDB vulnerability.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfiguration of Security Features](./attack_surfaces/misconfiguration_of_security_features.md)

### 4. Misconfiguration of Security Features

*   **Description:** Incorrect or insecure configuration of TiKV's security features can weaken the overall security posture and introduce vulnerabilities.
*   **TiKV Contribution:** TiKV *provides* various security features (TLS, authentication, RBAC, encryption at rest). However, the responsibility for *correctly configuring and enabling* these features lies with the user, making misconfiguration a direct TiKV-related attack surface when these features are not properly utilized.
*   **Example:**  Administrators deploy TiKV without enabling TLS or authentication, leaving the cluster open to unauthorized access and eavesdropping. Or, they use default, weak passwords for administrative interfaces (if any are exposed).
*   **Impact:** Data confidentiality breach, data integrity compromise, denial of service, unauthorized access and control of the TiKV cluster.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Follow Security Best Practices:** Adhere to TiKV's security best practices documentation and guidelines during deployment and configuration.
    *   **Use Configuration Management Tools:** Employ configuration management tools (e.g., Ansible, Terraform) to ensure consistent and secure configuration across all TiKV components.
    *   **Regular Security Configuration Reviews:** Periodically review TiKV configurations to identify and rectify any misconfigurations or deviations from security best practices.
    *   **Principle of Secure Defaults:** Advocate for and utilize secure default configurations for TiKV whenever possible.
