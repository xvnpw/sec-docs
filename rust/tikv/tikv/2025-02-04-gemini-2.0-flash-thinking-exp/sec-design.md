# BUSINESS POSTURE

TiKV is a distributed transactional key-value database. It is designed to provide high scalability, strong consistency, and high availability.  It is often used as the storage layer for distributed SQL databases like TiDB, but can also be used independently for applications requiring a robust key-value store.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Provide a reliable, scalable, and performant distributed key-value storage solution.
- Ensure data consistency and durability even in the face of failures.
- Offer a robust and feature-rich database that can be used in demanding production environments.
- Support a wide range of use cases requiring distributed key-value storage.
- Maintain and grow a strong open-source community around the project.

Business Risks:
- Data loss or corruption due to software bugs, hardware failures, or operational errors.
- Unavailability of the database service, leading to application downtime.
- Performance degradation under heavy load, impacting application performance.
- Security vulnerabilities that could lead to data breaches or unauthorized access.
- Lack of adoption or community support, hindering project growth and sustainability.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Code review process for all code changes (inferred from standard open-source development practices).
- security control: Use of Go language, which has built-in memory safety features.
- security control:  Focus on robustness and stability, which indirectly contributes to security by reducing potential for exploitable bugs.
- security control:  Active community and maintainers who address reported issues, including security vulnerabilities.

Accepted Risks:
- accepted risk: As an open-source project, vulnerability disclosure and patching relies on community reporting and contributions. Response time may vary depending on the severity and complexity of the issue.
- accepted risk:  Security features and hardening might be prioritized based on community demand and common use cases, potentially leaving less common security needs less addressed initially.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Implement automated security scanning tools (SAST, DAST, dependency scanning) in the CI/CD pipeline.
- security control:  Establish a clear security vulnerability reporting and response process.
- security control:  Provide documentation and best practices for secure deployment and configuration of TiKV.
- security control:  Consider adding encryption at rest and in transit as configurable options.
- security control:  Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for administrative operations.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication:
    - Requirement:  Mechanisms to authenticate clients connecting to TiKV, especially for administrative operations.
    - Requirement:  Consider authentication for inter-component communication within the TiKV cluster.
- Authorization:
    - Requirement:  Fine-grained authorization to control access to data and administrative functions.
    - Requirement:  Role-based access control for managing users and permissions.
- Input Validation:
    - Requirement:  Strict input validation at all API boundaries to prevent injection attacks and data corruption.
    - Requirement:  Sanitize and validate user-provided data before processing or storing it.
- Cryptography:
    - Requirement:  Consider encryption for data at rest to protect sensitive data stored on disk.
    - Requirement:  Implement encryption in transit (TLS) for all network communication between clients and TiKV servers, and between TiKV components.
    - Requirement:  Securely manage cryptographic keys used for encryption and authentication.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- Data storage and retrieval: Ensuring reliable and performant access to data is the core business process.
- Transaction processing: Maintaining ACID properties for transactions is crucial for data integrity.
- Cluster management and operations:  Efficient and reliable cluster management is essential for availability and scalability.

Data Sensitivity:
- Data stored in TiKV can be highly sensitive depending on the application using it. It can include:
    - Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
    - Financial data
    - Business-critical operational data
    - Intellectual property

Data sensitivity level is highly variable and depends on the specific use case.  For a general-purpose key-value store like TiKV, it should be assumed that it will be used to store sensitive data. Therefore, confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data are all high priorities.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What are the specific compliance requirements for TiKV deployments (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS)?
- What is the expected threat model for TiKV? Are we primarily concerned with external attackers, insider threats, or both?
- What is the organization's risk appetite regarding security vulnerabilities and data breaches?
- Are there specific security features that are considered mandatory for deployment in production environments?
- What are the performance requirements and trade-offs when implementing security controls like encryption?

Assumptions:
- Assumption: TiKV is intended to be used in production environments that require high levels of reliability and security.
- Assumption: Security is a high priority for the TiKV project and its users.
- Assumption:  Users of TiKV will be responsible for configuring and deploying it securely in their own environments.
- Assumption:  The provided GitHub repository represents the current and actively developed version of TiKV.
- Assumption:  Kubernetes is a common deployment environment for TiKV, but other deployment methods are also possible.
