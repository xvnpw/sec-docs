## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit TiKV Configuration Weaknesses (Critical Node & High Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_tikv_configuration_weaknesses__critical_node_&_high_risk_path_.md)

*   **2.1. Weak Authentication/Authorization (Critical Node & High Risk Path):**
    *   **2.1.1. Default or Weak Credentials (Critical Node & High Risk Path):**
        *   **2.1.1.1. Attempt Default TiKV User/Password (High Risk Path):**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Trying commonly known default usernames and passwords for TiKV components (if any exist and are not changed) to gain unauthorized access.
            *   **Example:**  Attempting to log in to management interfaces or APIs using credentials like "admin/password", "root/root", or other common default combinations.
        *   **2.1.1.2. Brute-Force Weak Passwords (High Risk Path):**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Using password cracking tools to systematically try a large number of password combinations against TiKV authentication mechanisms to guess weak passwords.
            *   **Example:** Employing tools like `Hydra` or `Medusa` to brute-force login forms or APIs if weak password policies are in place.
    *   **2.1.2. Missing or Misconfigured Authentication Mechanisms (Critical Node & High Risk Path):**
        *   **2.1.2.1. Check for Disabled Authentication (High Risk Path):**
            *   **Attack Vector:**  Identifying if authentication mechanisms are completely disabled or bypassed in TiKV configurations, allowing unauthenticated access.
            *   **Example:**  Checking configuration files, API endpoints, or network traffic to see if authentication is enforced or if access is granted without any credentials.
        *   **2.1.2.2. Bypass Misconfigured Authentication Rules (High Risk Path):**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting flaws or loopholes in the implementation or configuration of authentication rules to bypass intended security controls.
            *   **Example:**  Finding logical errors in access control lists, exploiting vulnerabilities in authentication protocols, or manipulating request parameters to circumvent authentication checks.
    *   **2.1.3. Insufficient Authorization Controls (Critical Node & High Risk Path):**
        *   **2.1.3.1. Exploit Lack of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) (High Risk Path):**
            *   **Attack Vector:**  Taking advantage of a lack of RBAC or poorly implemented RBAC to gain access to resources or operations that should be restricted based on user roles or permissions.
            *   **Example:**  If RBAC is not enforced, a user with limited privileges might be able to access administrative functions or sensitive data.
        *   **2.1.3.2. Access Data Outside Authorized Scope (High Risk Path):**
            *   **Attack Vector:**  Exploiting overly permissive authorization rules or vulnerabilities in authorization checks to access data or perform actions beyond the intended scope of a user's permissions.
            *   **Example:**  A user authorized to read data from one table might be able to access data from other tables due to insufficient authorization granularity.

*   **2.2. Insecure Network Configuration (Critical Node & High Risk Path):**
    *   **2.2.1. Unencrypted Communication (No TLS/SSL) (Critical Node & High Risk Path):**
        *   **2.2.1.1. Sniff Network Traffic for Sensitive Data (High Risk Path):**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Intercepting network traffic between TiKV components or between clients and TiKV when communication is not encrypted using TLS/SSL, allowing the attacker to read sensitive data in transit.
            *   **Example:** Using network sniffing tools like `Wireshark` or `tcpdump` to capture unencrypted traffic and extract sensitive information like keys, values, or application data.
        *   **2.2.1.2. Perform Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks (High Risk Path):**
            *   **Attack Vector:**  Positioning themselves between communicating parties (e.g., client and TiKV server) and intercepting and potentially manipulating network traffic when encryption is not enforced or improperly configured.
            *   **Example:** Using ARP poisoning or DNS spoofing to redirect traffic through the attacker's machine and then intercept or modify data exchanged between the client and TiKV.
    *   **2.2.2. Exposed Management Ports/APIs (Critical Node & High Risk Path):**
        *   **2.2.2.1. Access PD (Placement Driver) API without Authentication (High Risk Path):**
            *   **Attack Vector:**  Accessing the Placement Driver (PD) API, which is responsible for cluster management, if it's exposed to the network without proper authentication, allowing attackers to control the TiKV cluster.
            *   **Example:**  Scanning for open ports associated with PD API (e.g., port 2379) and directly interacting with the API endpoints without providing credentials to perform administrative actions.
        *   **2.2.2.2. Access TiKV Server gRPC API directly (High Risk Path):**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Directly accessing the TiKV server's gRPC API, which is used for data operations, if it's exposed to the network without proper authentication, allowing attackers to read and manipulate data.
            *   **Example:**  Scanning for open gRPC ports on TiKV servers (e.g., port 20160) and using gRPC client tools to send requests directly to the TiKV API to access or modify data.
    *   **2.2.3. Weak Network Segmentation (High Risk Path):**
        *   **2.2.3.1. Lateral Movement from Compromised Application Server (High Risk Path):**
            *   **Attack Vector:** If an application server connected to TiKV is compromised, weak network segmentation allows the attacker to easily move laterally within the network to access the TiKV cluster and other internal systems.
            *   **Example:**  Exploiting a vulnerability in a web application server and then using that compromised server as a stepping stone to access the TiKV network segment if firewalls or network policies are not properly configured to restrict traffic.
        *   **2.2.3.2. Access TiKV Cluster from Untrusted Network (High Risk Path):**
            *   **Attack Vector:**  Firewall misconfigurations or VPN bypasses might allow direct access to the TiKV cluster from untrusted networks (e.g., the internet), bypassing intended network security boundaries.
            *   **Example:**  Exploiting firewall rules that are too permissive or finding ways to circumvent VPN access controls to directly connect to the TiKV cluster from an external, untrusted network.

*   **2.4. Backup and Recovery Weaknesses (Critical Node & High Risk Path):**
    *   **2.4.1. Insecure Backup Storage (Critical Node & High Risk Path):**
        *   **2.4.1.1. Access Unencrypted Backups (High Risk Path):**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Gaining access to backup files of TiKV data if they are stored without encryption, exposing all the backed-up sensitive information.
            *   **Example:**  Compromising the storage location where TiKV backups are saved (e.g., cloud storage, network shares) and accessing the backup files directly if they are not encrypted at rest.
        *   **2.4.1.2. Compromise Backup Credentials (High Risk Path):**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Stealing or compromising the credentials used to access backup storage or backup systems, allowing the attacker to access, download, or manipulate backups.
            *   **Example:**  Phishing for backup storage credentials, exploiting vulnerabilities in backup management systems, or finding hardcoded credentials in scripts or configuration files related to backups.
