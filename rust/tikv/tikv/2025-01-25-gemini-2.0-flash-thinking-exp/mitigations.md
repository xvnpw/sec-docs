# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for tikv/tikv

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable Encryption at Rest](./mitigation_strategies/enable_encryption_at_rest.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure TiKV:** Modify the TiKV configuration file (`tikv.toml`) to enable Encryption at Rest. Set `security.encryption.enabled = true` and choose an encryption method (e.g., AES-CTR).
    2.  **Key Management:** Configure key management within TiKV.  For production, integrate with a Key Management System (KMS) by providing KMS endpoint details, authentication, and the encryption key. For less secure environments, file-based key management can be used by specifying a path to a key file in `tikv.toml`.
    3.  **Restart TiKV:** Restart all TiKV instances for the configuration to take effect.
    4.  **Verification:** Check TiKV logs for successful encryption initialization and monitor relevant metrics to confirm encryption is active.
    5.  **Key Rotation:** Implement key rotation according to security best practices, especially when using KMS.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Data Breach due to physical media theft (High Severity)
    *   Unauthorized access to data at rest on disk (High Severity)

*   **Impact:** Significantly reduces the risk of data breaches related to physical media compromise and unauthorized access to stored data directly on disk.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Potentially partially implemented in production environments, but KMS integration and key rotation might be missing.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Full KMS integration for production key management, automated key rotation procedures, and consistent implementation across all environments.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce TLS for All Communication](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_tls_for_all_communication.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Certificate Generation:** Generate TLS certificates and private keys for TiKV components (TiKV server, PD server). Use a CA for production.
    2.  **Configure TiKV Servers:** In `tikv.toml`, enable TLS and specify paths to server certificate, private key, and CA certificate. Configure TLS for both client and peer communication.
    3.  **Configure PD Servers:** In `pd.toml`, enable TLS and configure certificate paths for PD servers, enabling TLS for client and peer communication.
    4.  **Restart Components:** Restart all TiKV and PD instances after TLS configuration.
    5.  **Verification:** Verify TLS is active by checking logs for TLS handshake messages and using network tools.
    6.  **Cipher Suite Selection:** Configure strong TLS cipher suites and disable weak ones in TiKV and PD configurations.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks (High Severity)
    *   Data Breach in transit (High Severity)
    *   Spoofing and Impersonation (Medium Severity)

*   **Impact:** Significantly reduces the risk of data breaches and MITM attacks by securing all communication channels within the TiKV cluster and between clients and TiKV.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Likely partially implemented for client-to-server communication in production. Inter-component TLS and strong cipher suite configuration might be missing.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Full TLS enforcement for all inter-component communication, consistent TLS configuration across environments, and strong cipher suite configuration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_role-based_access_control__rbac_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable RBAC:** Enable RBAC in TiKV by configuring settings in `tikv.toml` and PD configuration.
    2.  **Define Roles:** Define roles based on least privilege, identifying user types and applications and their minimum required permissions.
    3.  **Grant Permissions to Roles:** Grant specific permissions on TiKV resources (tables, keyspaces, operations) to each role.
    4.  **Create Users/Applications:** Create user accounts or application identities for TiKV access.
    5.  **Assign Roles:** Assign defined roles to users/applications based on their access needs.
    6.  **Regular Review and Update:** Periodically review and update RBAC policies and audit configurations.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Data Access (High Severity)
    *   Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity)
    *   Insider Threats (Medium Severity)

*   **Impact:** Significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized data access, privilege escalation, and insider threats by enforcing access control policies within TiKV.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Potentially partially implemented in production. Basic RBAC might be enabled, but fine-grained roles and least privilege enforcement might be lacking.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Fine-grained role definitions, comprehensive RBAC policies, consistent enforcement across environments, and regular RBAC policy reviews and audits.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Quotas and Limits](./mitigation_strategies/resource_quotas_and_limits.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure TiKV Quotas:** Use TiKV configuration to set resource quotas and limits for CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network bandwidth.
    2.  **Tenant-Based Quotas (If Applicable):** For multi-tenant environments, configure tenant-specific quotas to isolate tenants and prevent resource contention.
    3.  **Monitoring and Alerting:** Monitor TiKV resource utilization and set up alerts for when usage approaches limits.
    4.  **Regular Review and Adjustment:** Regularly review and adjust quotas based on workload patterns and capacity planning.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) due to resource exhaustion (High Severity)
    *   Resource Starvation (Medium Severity)
    *   "Noisy Neighbor" Problems (Medium Severity)

*   **Impact:** Moderately reduces the risk of DoS attacks and resource exhaustion by controlling resource consumption within TiKV.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Potentially partially implemented. Basic resource limits might be configured, but tenant-based quotas and comprehensive monitoring/alerting might be missing.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Comprehensive resource quota configuration, tenant-based quotas, robust monitoring and alerting for resource utilization, and regular quota reviews.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Configuration Management](./mitigation_strategies/secure_configuration_management.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Follow Best Practices:** Adhere to TiKV's security best practices for configuration and deployment.
    2.  **Secure Configuration Files:** Securely manage TiKV configuration files (`tikv.toml`, `pd.toml`) and prevent unauthorized modifications using file system permissions and access control.
    3.  **Configuration Management Tools:** Use configuration management tools (e.g., Ansible, Chef, Puppet) to ensure consistent and secure configurations across the TiKV cluster.
    4.  **Version Control:** Store TiKV configuration files in version control systems to track changes and facilitate rollbacks if needed.
    5.  **Regular Audits:** Regularly audit TiKV configurations to ensure they align with security policies and best practices.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Misconfiguration Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity) - Prevents security weaknesses arising from incorrect or insecure TiKV configurations.
    *   Unauthorized Configuration Changes (Medium Severity) - Protects against malicious or accidental modifications to TiKV configurations that could weaken security.

*   **Impact:** Moderately reduces the risk of security vulnerabilities due to misconfiguration and unauthorized changes by ensuring consistent and secure TiKV configurations.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Potentially partially implemented. Version control for configuration files might be in place, but comprehensive configuration management tools and regular audits might be missing.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Full adoption of configuration management tools for consistent and secure deployments, regular security audits of TiKV configurations, and potentially missing best practice adherence in all environments.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Security Updates and Patching](./mitigation_strategies/regular_security_updates_and_patching.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Stay Informed:** Monitor TiKV release notes, security advisories, and community channels for security vulnerabilities and updates.
    2.  **Prompt Patching:** Apply security patches and updates for TiKV and its dependencies promptly upon release to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
    3.  **Update Process:** Establish a process for regularly updating TiKV to the latest stable versions, including testing in non-production environments before production deployment.
    4.  **Dependency Management:** Keep track of TiKV dependencies and ensure they are also updated and patched regularly.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (High Severity) - Prevents attackers from exploiting publicly known security vulnerabilities in TiKV or its dependencies.

*   **Impact:** Significantly reduces the risk of exploitation of known vulnerabilities by maintaining up-to-date and patched TiKV deployments.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Potentially partially implemented. A process for updating TiKV might exist, but prompt patching of security vulnerabilities and proactive dependency management might be lacking.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Formal process for prompt security patching, proactive dependency management and updates, and potentially missing consistent update practices across all environments.
