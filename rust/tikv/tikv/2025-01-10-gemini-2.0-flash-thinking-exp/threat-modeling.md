# Threat Model Analysis for tikv/tikv

## Threat: [Data Corruption via Malicious Node](./threats/data_corruption_via_malicious_node.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises a TiKV node and uses their access to directly manipulate data stored on that node's local storage (RocksDB) or within the Raft log before it's replicated. The attacker might modify existing data, introduce incorrect data, or delete data.
    *   **Impact:** Loss of data integrity, leading to incorrect application behavior, financial losses, or reputational damage. Data inconsistencies could be difficult to detect and rectify.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Storage Engine (RocksDB)`, `Raft`, `gRPC Server`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong OS-level security on all TiKV nodes.
        *   Enforce strict access control and authentication for accessing TiKV nodes.
        *   Utilize encryption at rest for the underlying storage (RocksDB).
        *   Implement regular data integrity checks and validation mechanisms within the application layer.
        *   Monitor TiKV logs and metrics for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Data Leakage via Unencrypted Communication](./threats/data_leakage_via_unencrypted_communication.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between application clients and TiKV servers, or between TiKV nodes themselves, because TLS encryption is not enabled or is improperly configured. The attacker can then eavesdrop on sensitive data being transmitted.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of confidential data, potentially leading to privacy violations, regulatory breaches, or financial losses.
    *   **Affected Component:** `gRPC Server`, `gRPC Client`, `Network Layer`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mandatory TLS:** Enforce TLS encryption for all client-to-server and server-to-server communication within the TiKV cluster.
        *   **Certificate Management:** Implement proper certificate management practices.
        *   Network segmentation to limit potential eavesdropping points.

## Threat: [Availability Disruption via PD Leader Compromise](./threats/availability_disruption_via_pd_leader_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises the leader node of the Placement Driver (PD) and manipulates the cluster's metadata, scheduling, and region management, leading to service disruption or denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Significant service downtime, inability to write new data, potential read unavailability, and administrative overhead for recovery.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Placement Driver (PD) Leader Election`, `Placement Scheduling`, `Metadata Storage`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure PD nodes with the same rigor as TiKV nodes.
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing the PD control plane.
        *   Monitor PD leader elections and cluster health closely.
        *   Consider running PD in a highly available configuration.
        *   Regularly back up PD metadata.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a large volume of malicious or malformed requests to TiKV servers, overwhelming their resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O). This can cause the servers to become unresponsive or crash.
    *   **Impact:** Service disruption, impacting application availability and potentially leading to data loss if writes are interrupted.
    *   **Affected Component:** `gRPC Server`, `Storage Engine (RocksDB)`, `Raft`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting and request throttling.
        *   Configure appropriate resource limits and quotas within TiKV.
        *   Monitor TiKV resource utilization and set up alerts.
        *   Review and optimize application queries.
        *   Implement network-level DoS protection mechanisms.

## Threat: [Data Corruption via Raft Log Manipulation (Advanced)](./threats/data_corruption_via_raft_log_manipulation__advanced_.md)

*   **Description:** A sophisticated attacker, having compromised multiple TiKV nodes within a Raft group, attempts to manipulate the Raft consensus process by injecting or altering entries in the Raft log before they are committed.
    *   **Impact:** Severe data corruption and inconsistencies across the cluster, potentially leading to irreversible data loss or application failure.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Raft`, `Raft Log Storage`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Maintain a strong security posture across all TiKV nodes.
        *   Utilize features like Raft Learner nodes.
        *   Implement strong integrity checks and checksums for Raft log entries.
        *   Regularly audit TiKV configurations and security practices.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Data Access via Weak Authentication](./threats/unauthorized_data_access_via_weak_authentication.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits weak or default authentication credentials for accessing TiKV's administrative interfaces or client connections, allowing them to read or modify data without authorization.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, potentially leading to data breaches, manipulation, or deletion.
    *   **Affected Component:** `gRPC Authentication`, `PD Authentication`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong password policies for all TiKV users and administrative accounts.
        *   Utilize certificate-based authentication for client connections.
        *   Disable or remove default credentials.
        *   Regularly review and update access control lists and permissions.
