## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit TikV Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_tikv_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Critical Node: Exploit TikV Vulnerabilities**
    * This represents the broad category of exploiting weaknesses within the TikV codebase or its configuration. Success here often grants significant access or control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Critical Node: Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities**
    * This focuses on weaknesses arising from improper setup or insecure defaults in TiKV.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Weak or Default Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_weak_or_default_credentials.md)

        * **High-Risk Path: Leverage Weak or Default Credentials**
            * **Attack Vector:** An attacker attempts to log in to TiKV components (like PD or TiKV servers) using commonly known default passwords or easily guessable credentials.
            * **Impact:** Successful login grants full administrative control over the respective component, potentially leading to data access, modification, or cluster disruption.
            * **Mitigation:** Enforce strong password policies, disable or change default credentials immediately upon deployment, use key-based authentication where possible.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Network Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_network_configuration.md)

        * **High-Risk Path: Exploit Insecure Network Configuration**
            * **Attack Vector:**  The network configuration surrounding the TiKV cluster is flawed, allowing unauthorized access or interception of communication.
            * **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, potential for MITM attacks, unauthorized access to management interfaces.
            * **Mitigation:** Implement network segmentation, use firewalls to restrict access, ensure proper security group configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Intercept unencrypted communication between application and TiKV (if TLS is not enforced)](./attack_tree_paths/intercept_unencrypted_communication_between_application_and_tikv__if_tls_is_not_enforced_.md)

            * **High-Risk Path: Intercept unencrypted communication between application and TiKV (if TLS is not enforced)**
                * **Attack Vector:** Communication between the application and TiKV is not encrypted using TLS. An attacker on the network can intercept this traffic.
                * **Impact:** Stealing authentication credentials, sensitive data being transmitted, or manipulating requests in transit.
                * **Mitigation:** **Mandatory enforcement of TLS for all communication with TiKV.** Use mutual TLS for enhanced security.

## Attack Tree Path: [Intercept or Manipulate Communication with TiKV](./attack_tree_paths/intercept_or_manipulate_communication_with_tikv.md)

* **Critical Node: Intercept or Manipulate Communication with TiKV**
    * This focuses on attacks targeting the communication channels between the application and TiKV.

## Attack Tree Path: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks](./attack_tree_paths/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks.md)

        * **High-Risk Path: Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks**
            * **Attack Vector:** An attacker positions themselves between the application and the TiKV server, intercepting and potentially modifying communication. This is especially feasible if TLS is not enforced.
            * **Impact:** Stealing credentials, reading or modifying data in transit, impersonating either the application or the TiKV server.
            * **Mitigation:** **Mandatory enforcement of TLS.** Implement certificate pinning on the application side to prevent accepting rogue certificates. Secure the network infrastructure to prevent attackers from positioning themselves for MITM attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication/Authorization Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authenticationauthorization_weaknesses.md)

* **High-Risk Path: Exploit Authentication/Authorization Weaknesses**
    * **Attack Vector:**  Flaws in how the application authenticates to TiKV allow an attacker to bypass these checks or escalate privileges. This could involve insecure token generation, lack of proper credential validation, or missing authorization checks.
    * **Impact:** Gaining unauthorized access to data or functionality within TiKV, potentially leading to data breaches or manipulation of application state.
    * **Mitigation:** Implement robust authentication mechanisms (e.g., strong API keys, OAuth 2.0), enforce proper authorization checks before granting access to data or operations, consider using mutual TLS for authentication between the application and TiKV. Regularly review and audit authentication and authorization logic.
