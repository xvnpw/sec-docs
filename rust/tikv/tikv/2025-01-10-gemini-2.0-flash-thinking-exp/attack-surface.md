# Attack Surface Analysis for tikv/tikv

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated gRPC Endpoint Access](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_grpc_endpoint_access.md)

**Description:** TiKV's gRPC interface allows clients to interact with the database. If not properly secured, these endpoints might be accessible without authentication.
*   **How TiKV Contributes:** TiKV exposes its core functionality through gRPC. A misconfiguration or lack of enforced authentication on these endpoints directly exposes TiKV to unauthorized access.
*   **Example:** An attacker discovers the IP address and port of a TiKV node and can directly send gRPC requests to read or modify data without providing any credentials.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized data modification or deletion, denial of service by overwhelming the node with requests.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable and Enforce Authentication: Utilize TiKV's built-in authentication mechanisms (e.g., TLS client certificates).
    *   Network Segmentation: Isolate TiKV nodes within a private network, restricting access from untrusted sources.
    *   Firewall Rules: Configure firewalls to only allow connections from authorized clients or application servers.

## Attack Surface: [gRPC Authorization Bypass](./attack_surfaces/grpc_authorization_bypass.md)

**Description:** Even with authentication, flaws in TiKV's authorization logic could allow authenticated users to perform actions they are not permitted to.
*   **How TiKV Contributes:** TiKV is responsible for enforcing access control policies on its data and operations based on user identity. Vulnerabilities in this enforcement mechanism are specific to TiKV.
*   **Example:** A user with read-only permissions exploits a bug in TiKV's authorization to execute write operations or access data belonging to other tenants.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized data modification or deletion, privilege escalation within the TiKV cluster.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regular Security Audits: Conduct thorough audits of TiKV's authorization code and configuration.
    *   Principle of Least Privilege: Grant only the necessary permissions to users and applications interacting with TiKV.
    *   Input Validation:  Ensure robust validation of all incoming gRPC requests to prevent manipulation of authorization checks.

## Attack Surface: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) on Inter-Node Communication](./attack_surfaces/man-in-the-middle__mitm__on_inter-node_communication.md)

**Description:** Communication between TiKV nodes for replication and consensus might be intercepted if not properly encrypted.
*   **How TiKV Contributes:** TiKV's distributed nature necessitates inter-node communication. The security of this communication channel is a direct concern for TiKV deployments.
*   **Example:** An attacker on the same network as the TiKV cluster intercepts communication between two nodes and is able to read sensitive data being replicated or even inject malicious messages to disrupt the consensus process.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, data corruption, disruption of the Raft consensus leading to data inconsistencies or unavailability.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable TLS for Inter-Node Communication: Configure TiKV to use TLS encryption for all communication between nodes.
    *   Mutual Authentication:  Implement mutual authentication between nodes to ensure only authorized nodes can participate in the cluster.
    *   Secure Network Infrastructure: Deploy TiKV within a secure and isolated network environment.

## Attack Surface: [Raft Protocol Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/raft_protocol_exploitation.md)

**Description:** Theoretical or implementation flaws in the Raft consensus algorithm used by TiKV could be exploited.
*   **How TiKV Contributes:** TiKV relies on Raft for data consistency and fault tolerance. Vulnerabilities within its Raft implementation or the protocol itself are specific to TiKV's architecture.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in a specific Raft implementation to manipulate leader elections, causing the cluster to become unstable or enter a split-brain scenario.
*   **Impact:** Data inconsistencies, data loss, denial of service due to the cluster being unable to reach consensus.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep TiKV Up-to-Date: Regularly update TiKV to benefit from security patches and bug fixes in the Raft implementation.
    *   Follow Security Best Practices for Raft: Adhere to recommended security guidelines for deploying and operating Raft-based systems.
    *   Monitor Cluster Health: Implement robust monitoring to detect anomalies in the Raft consensus process.

## Attack Surface: [Placement Driver (PD) Compromise](./attack_surfaces/placement_driver__pd__compromise.md)

**Description:** The Placement Driver (PD) manages metadata and scheduling. If compromised, it can have significant impact.
*   **How TiKV Contributes:** PD is a core component of the TiKV architecture, responsible for critical cluster management functions. Its security is paramount to the overall security of the TiKV deployment.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the PD and manipulates metadata, causing data to be routed incorrectly, leading to data loss or access to unauthorized data.
*   **Impact:** Data loss, data corruption, denial of service, potential for complete cluster compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure Access to PD: Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing the PD.
    *   Isolate PD Nodes: Deploy PD nodes in a secure and isolated environment.
    *   Monitor PD Activity:  Closely monitor PD logs and metrics for suspicious activity.
    *   Regular Backups of PD Metadata:  Implement regular backups of PD metadata to facilitate recovery in case of compromise.

## Attack Surface: [Storage Engine Vulnerabilities (RocksDB)](./attack_surfaces/storage_engine_vulnerabilities__rocksdb_.md)

**Description:** TiKV uses RocksDB as its underlying storage engine. Vulnerabilities in RocksDB can directly impact TiKV.
*   **How TiKV Contributes:** TiKV directly relies on RocksDB for storing and retrieving data. Security vulnerabilities within RocksDB are inherited by TiKV.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in RocksDB, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the TiKV server.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, denial of service, potential for arbitrary code execution on TiKV nodes, leading to full system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep TiKV Up-to-Date: Updating TiKV often includes updates to the bundled RocksDB version, addressing known vulnerabilities.
    *   Monitor RocksDB Security Advisories: Stay informed about security vulnerabilities reported in RocksDB.
    *   Follow RocksDB Security Best Practices:  Adhere to recommended security practices for configuring and operating RocksDB.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) on gRPC Endpoints](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__on_grpc_endpoints.md)

**Description:** Attackers can flood TiKV's gRPC endpoints with requests, overwhelming the service and making it unavailable.
*   **How TiKV Contributes:** TiKV exposes its functionality through network accessible gRPC endpoints, making it a target for network-based DoS attacks.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a large volume of requests to a TiKV gRPC endpoint, consuming all available resources and preventing legitimate clients from accessing the database.
*   **Impact:** Service unavailability, impacting applications relying on TiKV.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting on gRPC endpoints to restrict the number of requests from a single source.
    *   Connection Limits: Configure limits on the number of concurrent connections to TiKV nodes.
    *   Load Balancing: Distribute traffic across multiple TiKV nodes to mitigate the impact of a DoS attack on a single node.
    *   Network Security Measures: Employ network firewalls and intrusion detection/prevention systems to filter malicious traffic.
