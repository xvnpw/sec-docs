## Deep Analysis: Access Host Filesystem via VM Configuration [HIGH-RISK PATH]

This analysis delves into the attack path "Access Host Filesystem via VM Configuration" within the context of a Firecracker microVM environment. This is a critical vulnerability as successful exploitation can lead to complete compromise of the host system, negating the isolation benefits of virtualization.

**Understanding the Attack Path:**

The core idea of this attack path is to manipulate the Firecracker VM configuration in a way that allows the microVM to access or interact with the host filesystem beyond its intended boundaries. This typically involves exploiting vulnerabilities related to how file paths are handled and interpreted during VM creation and operation.

**Breakdown of the Attack Mechanism:**

The attack relies on the attacker's ability to influence the configuration parameters provided to the Firecracker API when creating or updating a microVM. Specifically, it targets parameters that specify file paths on the host system, such as:

* **`block-device` configuration:**  Specifying the path to the root filesystem or additional block devices for the microVM.
* **`kernel` configuration:**  Specifying the path to the kernel image.
* **`initrd` configuration:** Specifying the path to the initial RAM disk image.
* **Potentially other resource paths:** Depending on future Firecracker features, other configuration options might involve host file paths.

The vulnerability lies in the potential for **path traversal**. This occurs when the application (in this case, Firecracker's API handler) doesn't properly sanitize or validate the provided file paths. Attackers can leverage special characters like `../` (parent directory) or absolute paths to escape the intended directory and access files or directories elsewhere on the host filesystem.

**Technical Deep Dive & Potential Exploitation Scenarios:**

Let's examine specific scenarios where this vulnerability could be exploited:

1. **Manipulating Block Device Paths:**

   * **Scenario:** An attacker gains control over the process responsible for creating Firecracker VMs (e.g., through a compromised management interface or a vulnerable orchestration layer).
   * **Exploitation:** The attacker crafts a malicious API request to create a new microVM. In the `block-device` configuration, instead of providing a path to a legitimate virtual disk image, they inject a path traversal sequence:
     ```json
     {
       "action_type": "CreateVm",
       "config": {
         "block_devices": [
           {
             "block_device_id": "rootfs",
             "path_on_host": "/../../../../../../../../etc/shadow",
             "read_only": false
           }
         ],
         // ... other configurations
       }
     }
     ```
   * **Outcome:** If Firecracker doesn't properly validate the `path_on_host`, it might attempt to mount the host's `/etc/shadow` file as the root filesystem of the microVM. This would grant the attacker within the VM access to sensitive user credentials.

2. **Exploiting Kernel or Initrd Paths:**

   * **Scenario:** Similar to the block device scenario, an attacker manipulates the API request.
   * **Exploitation:** The attacker provides a malicious path in the `kernel` or `initrd` configuration:
     ```json
     {
       "action_type": "CreateVm",
       "config": {
         "kernel_image_path": "/../../../../../../../../bin/bash",
         // ... other configurations
       }
     }
     ```
   * **Outcome:**  While directly executing `/bin/bash` as the kernel is unlikely to succeed, an attacker might try to point to a specially crafted malicious kernel or initrd image located elsewhere on the host. This image could contain backdoors or exploit other vulnerabilities to gain control of the host.

3. **Leveraging Symbolic Links (Symlinks):**

   * **Scenario:** An attacker might not be able to directly write to sensitive files but might be able to create symlinks within the intended configuration directory.
   * **Exploitation:** The attacker creates a symlink within a directory accessible to the VM creation process, pointing to a sensitive host file. Then, they configure the VM to use this symlink.
   * **Outcome:** When the microVM starts, Firecracker might follow the symlink, granting the VM access to the targeted host file.

**Risk Assessment (HIGH-RISK):**

This attack path is categorized as HIGH-RISK due to the potential for severe consequences:

* **Complete Host Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to read sensitive host files (credentials, configuration files), modify host system settings, and potentially execute arbitrary code on the host.
* **Data Breach:** Access to the host filesystem can lead to the exfiltration of sensitive data residing on the host, even if the microVM itself doesn't directly store that data.
* **Lateral Movement:** Compromising the host can provide a stepping stone for attackers to access other systems and resources within the infrastructure.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Attackers could potentially manipulate configurations to cause instability or crashes on the host system.
* **Circumvention of Security Controls:**  The isolation provided by the microVM is completely bypassed, rendering other security measures less effective.

**Mitigation Strategies for Development Team:**

To prevent this attack path, the development team should implement the following security measures:

* **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    * **Whitelisting:**  Define a strict whitelist of allowed characters and patterns for file paths. Reject any input that doesn't conform to the whitelist.
    * **Path Canonicalization:**  Convert all provided paths to their canonical (absolute and resolved) form to eliminate ambiguity and prevent traversal attempts.
    * **Regular Expression Matching:** Use robust regular expressions to validate path formats and prevent the inclusion of `../` or other potentially malicious sequences.
    * **Reject Absolute Paths:** Consider rejecting absolute paths altogether, forcing users to specify paths relative to a predefined base directory.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    * **Limit Firecracker's Access:** Ensure the Firecracker process itself runs with the minimum necessary privileges to access only the required host resources.
    * **Restrict Configuration Access:** Control who can create and modify Firecracker VM configurations. Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.
* **Chroot/Jail Environments:**
    * **Confine Firecracker:** Run the Firecracker process within a chroot jail or similar environment to limit its access to the host filesystem.
* **Secure Configuration Practices:**
    * **Immutable Configurations:**  Where possible, make VM configurations immutable after creation to prevent unauthorized modifications.
    * **Secure Storage of Configurations:** Store VM configurations securely and protect them from unauthorized access.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    * **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews to identify potential path traversal vulnerabilities in the API handling logic.
    * **Penetration Testing:**  Engage security experts to perform penetration testing specifically targeting this attack path.
* **Utilize Firecracker's Security Features:**
    * **Review Firecracker's Security Documentation:** Stay updated on Firecracker's security recommendations and best practices.
    * **Leverage Security-Focused API Design:** If possible, design the API in a way that minimizes the need for users to directly specify host file paths. Consider using resource identifiers instead.

**Detection Strategies:**

Even with robust mitigation, it's crucial to have detection mechanisms in place:

* **Anomaly Detection:** Monitor API calls for unusual patterns, such as attempts to specify paths outside expected directories.
* **Log Analysis:**  Carefully analyze Firecracker logs for any errors or warnings related to file access or path resolution.
* **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Monitor critical host files and directories for unexpected modifications that might indicate successful exploitation.
* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Integrate Firecracker logs with a SIEM system to correlate events and detect suspicious activity.

**Conclusion:**

The "Access Host Filesystem via VM Configuration" attack path represents a significant security risk in Firecracker environments. By exploiting path traversal vulnerabilities, attackers can bypass the intended isolation and gain control over the host system. A layered security approach, combining robust input validation, the principle of least privilege, secure configuration practices, and continuous monitoring, is essential to effectively mitigate this threat. The development team must prioritize these security measures to ensure the integrity and security of the overall system.
