# Attack Surface Analysis for firecracker-microvm/firecracker

## Attack Surface: [Firecracker API Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/firecracker_api_vulnerabilities.md)

- **Description:** Flaws in the Firecracker API (e.g., RESTful interface) that allow attackers to manipulate or gain unauthorized access to microVMs or the host.
- **How Firecracker Contributes:** Firecracker exposes an API as the primary control plane for managing microVMs. Vulnerabilities here directly expose the virtualization layer.
- **Example:** A malformed API request to create a microVM with excessive resources, leading to resource exhaustion on the host.
- **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) on the host, unauthorized control of microVMs, potential for privilege escalation on the host if vulnerabilities allow it.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all API requests.
    - Enforce strict authentication and authorization for API access.
    - Follow the principle of least privilege when granting API permissions.
    - Regularly update Firecracker to patch known API vulnerabilities.
    - Implement rate limiting and request throttling to prevent API abuse.
    - Secure the API endpoint using HTTPS and strong TLS configurations.
    - Consider using a dedicated network for the Firecracker API, isolated from public networks.

## Attack Surface: [Guest VM Escape](./attack_surfaces/guest_vm_escape.md)

- **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities within the virtualized environment provided by Firecracker to gain code execution on the host operating system.
- **How Firecracker Contributes:** Firecracker provides a minimal set of virtual devices and emulates hardware. Bugs in this emulation or the interaction between the guest and virtual hardware can be exploited.
- **Example:** A vulnerability in the virtual network device driver within the guest OS allows an attacker to send crafted packets that trigger a buffer overflow in the Firecracker process, leading to code execution on the host.
- **Impact:** Full compromise of the host system, including access to sensitive data and control over other microVMs.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Keep Firecracker updated to benefit from security fixes that address potential escape vulnerabilities.
    - Implement strong security boundaries and isolation between the guest and host.
    - Consider using hardware virtualization extensions (if available and enabled) for enhanced isolation.
    - Regularly review and audit the security of the guest operating system and its interaction with the virtualized environment.

## Attack Surface: [Host Kernel Exploitation via Firecracker](./attack_surfaces/host_kernel_exploitation_via_firecracker.md)

- **Description:** Leveraging Firecracker's interaction with the host kernel (primarily through KVM) to exploit vulnerabilities in the kernel itself.
- **How Firecracker Contributes:** Firecracker relies on the host kernel's KVM module for virtualization. Bugs in KVM or related kernel subsystems can be exploited through Firecracker's interactions.
- **Example:** A vulnerability in the KVM implementation related to memory management is triggered by specific actions within a Firecracker guest, allowing an attacker to gain kernel-level privileges on the host.
- **Impact:** Full compromise of the host system, potentially affecting all running processes and microVMs.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Ensure the host kernel is up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    - Follow kernel hardening best practices.
    - Carefully review and configure kernel parameters related to virtualization.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion Attacks](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_attacks.md)

- **Description:**  Consuming excessive host resources (CPU, memory, I/O) through malicious actions within a microVM or by exploiting Firecracker's resource management.
- **How Firecracker Contributes:** Firecracker manages resource allocation for microVMs. Vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in this management can be exploited to exhaust host resources.
- **Example:** An attacker creates a microVM and utilizes a process within it to consume all available CPU or memory on the host, causing denial of service for other microVMs and potentially the host itself.
- **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) affecting other microVMs and potentially the host.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Implement strict resource limits (CPU, memory, I/O) for each microVM.
    - Monitor resource usage of microVMs and the host.
    - Implement rate limiting on microVM creation and resource allocation requests.
    - Utilize control groups (cgroups) on the host to enforce resource limits.

## Attack Surface: [Shared Memory Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/shared_memory_vulnerabilities.md)

- **Description:** If shared memory is configured between the host and guest or between guests, vulnerabilities in how this shared memory is managed can lead to information leaks or unauthorized access.
- **How Firecracker Contributes:** Firecracker allows configuration of shared memory regions. If not handled securely, this can become an attack vector.
- **Example:** A vulnerability in how shared memory is accessed within the guest allows an attacker to read or write to memory regions belonging to the host process.
- **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential for privilege escalation if host memory is compromised.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Avoid using shared memory if possible.
    - If shared memory is necessary, carefully design and implement access controls.
    - Validate data received from shared memory.

## Attack Surface: [Virtual Device Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/virtual_device_vulnerabilities.md)

- **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the virtual devices provided by Firecracker (e.g., network, block storage, serial console).
- **How Firecracker Contributes:** Firecracker emulates hardware devices. Bugs in this emulation can be exploited by malicious guests.
- **Example:** A vulnerability in the virtual network device allows an attacker to send specially crafted network packets from the guest that cause a buffer overflow in the Firecracker process.
- **Impact:** Guest VM escape, denial of service of the Firecracker process.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Keep Firecracker updated to benefit from security fixes for virtual device vulnerabilities.
    - Limit the number of virtual devices exposed to the guest.
    - Implement strong input validation for data received from virtual devices within the Firecracker process.

## Attack Surface: [Supply Chain Attacks on Firecracker](./attack_surfaces/supply_chain_attacks_on_firecracker.md)

- **Description:** Compromise of the Firecracker build process or dependencies, leading to the distribution of a malicious or vulnerable Firecracker binary.
- **How Firecracker Contributes:**  Using a compromised Firecracker binary directly introduces vulnerabilities into the system.
- **Example:** A malicious actor injects a backdoor into the Firecracker codebase or a dependency, allowing them to remotely control microVMs or the host.
- **Impact:** Full compromise of the host and all running microVMs.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Obtain Firecracker binaries from trusted sources.
    - Verify the integrity of downloaded binaries using cryptographic signatures.
    - Implement secure software development practices for any custom modifications to Firecracker.
    - Regularly scan the Firecracker binary for known vulnerabilities.
