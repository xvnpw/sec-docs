# Threat Model Analysis for firecracker-microvm/firecracker

## Threat: [Guest-to-Host Escape via Firecracker Process Vulnerability](./threats/guest-to-host_escape_via_firecracker_process_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker within a guest VM exploits a vulnerability (e.g., buffer overflow, use-after-free) in the Firecracker process itself. This allows them to execute arbitrary code within the context of the Firecracker process, potentially escalating to host privileges.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of the host system, similar to KVM vulnerability exploitation, potentially leading to data breaches, control over other VMs, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Firecracker process (`firecracker`)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the Firecracker binary updated with the latest security releases.
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization within the Firecracker codebase.
        *   Utilize memory safety techniques and tools during Firecracker development (e.g., address space layout randomization (ASLR), stack canaries).
        *   Run the Firecracker process with minimal necessary privileges.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion Attack from Guest](./threats/resource_exhaustion_attack_from_guest.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious guest VM consumes excessive host resources (CPU, memory, I/O) beyond its allocated limits, potentially causing denial of service for other guest VMs or the host system itself, due to insufficient resource enforcement by Firecracker.
    *   **Impact:** Performance degradation or complete unavailability of other guest VMs or the host system.
    *   **Affected Component:** Resource management within the Firecracker process, cgroups integration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully configure resource limits (CPU shares, memory limits, I/O bandwidth) for each guest VM using Firecracker's configuration options.
        *   Implement monitoring and alerting for resource usage by guest VMs.
        *   Consider using quality-of-service (QoS) mechanisms on the host to prioritize critical workloads.
        *   Implement mechanisms to detect and isolate or terminate runaway guest VMs.

## Threat: [Firecracker API Authentication Bypass](./threats/firecracker_api_authentication_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Firecracker API, allowing them to perform privileged operations such as creating, starting, stopping, or deleting microVMs without proper authentication. This is due to vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in the Firecracker API server.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized control over microVMs, potentially leading to data breaches, denial of service, or the deployment of malicious VMs.
    *   **Affected Component:** Firecracker API server, authentication mechanisms.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication mechanisms for the Firecracker API (e.g., API keys, mutual TLS).
        *   Ensure proper authorization checks are in place to restrict API access based on roles or permissions.
        *   Secure the communication channel to the Firecracker API (e.g., using HTTPS).
        *   Regularly review and audit API access logs.

## Threat: [Firecracker API Injection Vulnerability](./threats/firecracker_api_injection_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious commands or data into API requests, which are then executed by the Firecracker process, leading to unintended actions or information disclosure due to insufficient input validation within the Firecracker API.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for arbitrary code execution within the Firecracker process, manipulation of VM configurations, or access to sensitive information.
    *   **Affected Component:** Firecracker API server, request parsing and handling logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all API requests.
        *   Avoid constructing commands dynamically based on user-provided input without proper escaping.
        *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with any underlying data stores.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Compromise of Firecracker Binaries](./threats/supply_chain_compromise_of_firecracker_binaries.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises the build or distribution process of Firecracker, injecting malicious code into the binaries.
    *   **Impact:** Widespread compromise of systems using the affected Firecracker version, potentially leading to complete system takeover.
    *   **Affected Component:** Firecracker build system, distribution channels.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Download Firecracker binaries from trusted sources and verify their integrity using cryptographic signatures.
        *   Implement secure software development practices for building and releasing Firecracker.
        *   Consider using a trusted and verified build environment.
