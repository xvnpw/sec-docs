# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for firecracker-microvm/firecracker

## Mitigation Strategy: [1. API Input Validation and Sanitization](./mitigation_strategies/1__api_input_validation_and_sanitization.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** API Input Validation and Sanitization
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Input Schema:** Clearly define the expected schema and data types for all inputs to the Firecracker API.
    2.  **Validation at API Entry Points:** Implement validation logic at every API endpoint to check if incoming requests conform to the defined schema. This includes:
        *   Data type validation (e.g., ensuring integers are integers, strings are strings).
        *   Format validation (e.g., checking for valid UUIDs, IP addresses).
        *   Range validation (e.g., ensuring values are within acceptable limits).
        *   Length validation (e.g., limiting string lengths).
    3.  **Sanitization:** Sanitize input data to remove or escape potentially harmful characters or sequences before processing it. This is especially important for string inputs that might be used in commands or file paths.
    4.  **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for invalid input, providing informative error messages and rejecting the request.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **API Injection Attacks (High Severity):** Prevents injection attacks such as command injection, path traversal, and other vulnerabilities that arise from processing unsanitized input to the Firecracker API.
    *   **Denial of Service (Medium Severity):**  Reduces the risk of DoS attacks caused by malformed or excessively large API requests to the Firecracker API.
    *   **Unexpected Behavior (Medium Severity):** Prevents unexpected behavior and crashes in Firecracker or the management plane due to invalid API input data.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **API Injection Attacks:** High reduction in risk.  Effectively blocks common injection attack vectors targeting the Firecracker API.
    *   **Denial of Service:** Medium reduction in risk.  Mitigates some DoS vectors against the Firecracker API but might not prevent all.
    *   **Unexpected Behavior:** High reduction in risk.  Improves stability and predictability of the Firecracker control plane.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We have basic input validation in place for some API parameters, primarily data type checks.
*   **Missing Implementation:** We need to implement comprehensive input validation and sanitization for all Firecracker API endpoints, including format, range, and length validation. Sanitization logic needs to be added, especially for string inputs to the Firecracker API.

## Mitigation Strategy: [2. Principle of Least Privilege for API Access](./mitigation_strategies/2__principle_of_least_privilege_for_api_access.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Principle of Least Privilege for API Access
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify API Consumers:** Determine which components or services need to interact with the Firecracker API.
    2.  **Define Roles and Permissions:** Define specific roles with granular permissions for different Firecracker API operations. For example:
        *   A "MicroVM Creator" role might only be allowed to use the `/vms` endpoint for creation.
        *   A "MicroVM Operator" role might be allowed to use `/vms/{vm_id}/actions` for start/stop and `/vms/{vm_id}/state` for monitoring.
        *   A "Read-Only Monitor" role might only be allowed to use `/vms/{vm_id}/state` for retrieving microVM status.
    3.  **Implement Access Control:** Implement an access control mechanism that enforces these roles and permissions for the Firecracker API. This could involve:
        *   Using API keys or tokens associated with specific roles.
        *   Integrating with an existing authorization service (e.g., OAuth 2.0, IAM).
        *   Using operating system-level access controls if API access is local.
    4.  **Regularly Review Access:** Periodically review and audit Firecracker API access permissions to ensure they remain aligned with the principle of least privilege and remove unnecessary permissions.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized API Access (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized entities from accessing and manipulating the Firecracker environment through its API, reducing the risk of malicious microVM creation, modification, or deletion.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity):** Limits the potential damage from compromised components by restricting their Firecracker API access to only what is necessary.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized API Access:** High reduction in risk.  Significantly reduces the likelihood of unauthorized actions via the Firecracker API.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Medium reduction in risk.  Limits the blast radius of a compromise affecting components interacting with the Firecracker API.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We use API keys for authentication, but currently, all API keys have full access to all Firecracker API operations.
*   **Missing Implementation:** We need to implement role-based access control for the Firecracker API. This involves defining roles, assigning permissions to roles, and modifying our API access logic to enforce these roles for Firecracker API calls.

## Mitigation Strategy: [3. Regular Firecracker Updates](./mitigation_strategies/3__regular_firecracker_updates.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regular Firecracker Updates
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish Update Pipeline:** Set up an automated pipeline for regularly checking for and applying security updates to Firecracker. This could involve:
        *   Subscribing to Firecracker security advisories and release announcements.
        *   Using automated tools to check for new Firecracker releases.
        *   Integrating update checks into CI/CD pipelines.
    2.  **Testing Updates:** Before deploying Firecracker updates to production, thoroughly test them in a staging environment to ensure compatibility and stability with our application and infrastructure.
    3.  **Rapid Deployment:** Implement a process for quickly deploying Firecracker security updates to production hosts after successful testing. This might involve automated deployments and rolling updates of host systems.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Known Firecracker Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Addresses publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in Firecracker itself that attackers could exploit for guest escape, host compromise, or denial of service of the Firecracker service.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Known Firecracker Vulnerabilities:** High reduction in risk. Timely patching closes known security holes in Firecracker.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We have a process for periodically updating Firecracker, but it's not fully automated and integrated into a CI/CD pipeline.
*   **Missing Implementation:** We need to fully automate the Firecracker update process, including automated testing in a staging environment and a streamlined deployment process for production updates.

## Mitigation Strategy: [4. Secure Communication Channels for API](./mitigation_strategies/4__secure_communication_channels_for_api.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Communication Channels for API
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use TLS/HTTPS for Networked API:** If the Firecracker API is accessed over a network (even a private network), always use TLS/HTTPS to encrypt communication channels. Configure Firecracker and API clients to enforce TLS.
    2.  **Unix Domain Sockets for Local API:** When possible and appropriate for the deployment architecture, use local Unix domain sockets for Firecracker API communication instead of network sockets. This avoids network exposure and simplifies security.
    3.  **Authentication and Authorization over Secure Channels:** Ensure that authentication and authorization mechanisms for the Firecracker API are also enforced over these secure communication channels.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from eavesdropping on or tampering with Firecracker API communication when transmitted over a network.
    *   **Credential Theft (Medium Severity):** Protects API credentials (if transmitted) from being intercepted during API communication.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** High reduction in risk.  Encrypting communication effectively prevents eavesdropping and tampering.
    *   **Credential Theft:** Medium reduction in risk.  Reduces the risk of credential compromise during API interactions.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented. We are using HTTPS for communication with the Firecracker API over the network.
*   **Missing Implementation:** We could explore using Unix domain sockets for local API communication in scenarios where network access is not required to further reduce network exposure.

## Mitigation Strategy: [5. Enforce Resource Limits for MicroVMs](./mitigation_strategies/5__enforce_resource_limits_for_microvms.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce Resource Limits for MicroVMs
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Resource Profiles:** Create resource profiles that specify limits for CPU, memory, and I/O resources for different types of microVM workloads, utilizing Firecracker's resource control features.
    2.  **Apply Limits at MicroVM Creation (Firecracker API):** When creating new microVMs via the Firecracker API, apply the appropriate resource profile using Firecracker's API parameters:
        *   `vcpu_count`: Limit the number of vCPUs.
        *   `mem_size_mib`: Limit the memory size.
        *   `rate_limiter`: Limit network and block device I/O rates using `network_interfaces` and `drives` configurations in the Firecracker API.
    3.  **Monitoring Resource Usage (Firecracker Metrics):** Monitor resource usage of microVMs using Firecracker's metrics API to ensure they are operating within the defined limits and to detect potential resource exhaustion or anomalies.
    4.  **Dynamic Adjustment (Optional, via Firecracker API):** Consider implementing dynamic resource adjustment based on workload demands, using the Firecracker API to update resource limits while still respecting predefined maximum limits.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (High Severity):** Prevents a single malicious or misbehaving microVM from consuming excessive host resources (CPU, memory, I/O) managed by Firecracker, leading to denial of service for other microVMs or the host itself.
    *   **Noisy Neighbor Effect (Medium Severity):** Reduces the "noisy neighbor" effect where one microVM's resource usage, controlled by Firecracker, negatively impacts the performance of other microVMs on the same host.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** High reduction in risk.  Effectively prevents resource exhaustion attacks at the Firecracker level.
    *   **Noisy Neighbor Effect:** Medium reduction in risk.  Improves performance isolation and predictability enforced by Firecracker.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We set memory and vCPU limits for microVMs during creation using Firecracker API, but I/O rate limiting via Firecracker's `rate_limiter` is not consistently applied.
*   **Missing Implementation:** We need to fully implement I/O rate limiting for microVMs using Firecracker's `rate_limiter` feature in the API. We also need to define and enforce resource profiles for different workload types and improve our resource monitoring capabilities using Firecracker's metrics API.

## Mitigation Strategy: [6. CPU Pinning for MicroVMs](./mitigation_strategies/6__cpu_pinning_for_microvms.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** CPU Pinning for MicroVMs
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Dedicated Cores:** Determine which physical CPU cores on the host system can be dedicated to microVMs.
    2.  **Configure CPU Affinity (Firecracker Configuration):** When creating microVMs via the Firecracker API, configure CPU affinity to pin vCPUs to specific physical CPU cores. This is typically done through host OS mechanisms (like `taskset` or cgroups) used in conjunction with Firecracker's process management. While Firecracker doesn't directly manage CPU pinning, it's crucial to configure the host environment to achieve this for Firecracker-managed VMs.
    3.  **Resource Monitoring (Host Level):** Monitor CPU core utilization at the host level to ensure proper pinning and resource allocation.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cache-Based Side-Channel Attacks (Medium Severity):** While not a complete mitigation, CPU pinning can reduce the risk of cache-based side-channel attacks between microVMs by limiting cache sharing when vCPUs are pinned to dedicated cores.
    *   **Performance Interference (Medium Severity):** Reduces performance interference between microVMs by ensuring dedicated CPU resources, minimizing context switching overhead and improving performance predictability.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cache-Based Side-Channel Attacks:** Low to Medium reduction in risk.  Reduces but doesn't eliminate the risk of these attacks.
    *   **Performance Interference:** Medium reduction in risk. Improves performance isolation and predictability for microVMs.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. CPU pinning for microVMs is not currently configured in our deployment.
*   **Missing Implementation:** We need to implement CPU pinning for microVMs. This involves configuring the host environment and potentially modifying our microVM creation process to set CPU affinity for Firecracker processes.
