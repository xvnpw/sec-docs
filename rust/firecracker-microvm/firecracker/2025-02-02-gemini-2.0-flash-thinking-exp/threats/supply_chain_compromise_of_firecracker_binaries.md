2. **Persistence and Privilege Escalation:** Attackers establish persistence on the build server and escalate privileges to gain administrative access.
3. **Malicious Code Injection:** Attackers modify the Firecracker build scripts to inject malicious code into the `firecracker` binary during the compilation process. This code could be designed to establish a backdoor, exfiltrate data, or perform other malicious actions when the compromised binary is executed.
4. **Binary Distribution:** The compromised build server produces infected `firecracker` binaries, which are then released through official channels (GitHub releases, package repositories) as seemingly legitimate versions.
5. **Widespread Deployment:** Users download and deploy the compromised Firecracker binaries, unknowingly introducing malware into their infrastructure.

**Scenario 2: Dependency Confusion Attack**

1. **Identify Internal Dependency:** Attackers identify an internal or private dependency used by the Firecracker build process that is not publicly available on standard package repositories.
2. **Create Malicious Package:** Attackers create a malicious package with the same name as the internal dependency and upload it to a public package repository (e.g., PyPI, npm, crates.io if relevant to Firecracker's build process).
3. **Build System Vulnerability:** The Firecracker build system is misconfigured or vulnerable to dependency confusion, causing it to prioritize the malicious package from the public repository over the legitimate internal dependency.
4. **Malicious Code Inclusion:** The malicious package contains code that injects malware into the Firecracker binaries during the build process.
5. **Binary Distribution and Deployment:**  Similar to Scenario 1, compromised binaries are distributed and deployed, leading to widespread compromise.
