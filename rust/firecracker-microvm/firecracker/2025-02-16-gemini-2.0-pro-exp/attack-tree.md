## Attack Tree Path: [1. Escape the MicroVM Sandbox [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__escape_the_microvm_sandbox__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the overarching goal of breaking out of the Firecracker microVM's isolation.  Success here means the attacker has gained code execution *outside* the intended sandbox.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Exploit Firecracker VMM Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_exploit_firecracker_vmm_vulnerabilities__high_risk_.md)

*   **1.1 Exploit Firecracker VMM Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]:** Attacking the Firecracker Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) directly.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Device Emulation Bugs (e.g., virtio) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_device_emulation_bugs__e_g___virtio___critical_.md)

*   **1.1.1 Device Emulation Bugs (e.g., virtio) [CRITICAL]:**
    *   **Description:**  Firecracker emulates hardware devices (like network and block devices) using the `virtio` standard.  Bugs in this emulation code are a prime target for attackers.
    *   **Specific Examples:**

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.1 Buffer Overflow in virtio-net](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_1_buffer_overflow_in_virtio-net.md)

*   **1.1.1.1 Buffer Overflow in virtio-net:**  Sending malformed network packets that cause a buffer overflow in the VMM's handling of the `virtio-net` device.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.2 Use-After-Free in virtio-blk](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_2_use-after-free_in_virtio-blk.md)

*   **1.1.1.2 Use-After-Free in virtio-blk:**  Triggering a use-after-free condition in the `virtio-blk` device emulation by manipulating block device requests.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.3 Integer Overflow in virtio ring](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_3_integer_overflow_in_virtio_ring.md)

*   **1.1.1.3 Integer Overflow in virtio ring:**  Causing an integer overflow in the data structures used for communication between the guest and the VMM (the virtio ring).

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.4 Race Condition in virtio device access](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_4_race_condition_in_virtio_device_access.md)

*   **1.1.1.4 Race Condition in virtio device access:**  Exploiting a race condition in how the VMM handles concurrent access to the emulated devices.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2.1 Incorrect Seccomp Filter Configuration [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_1_incorrect_seccomp_filter_configuration__critical_.md)

*   **1.1.2.1 Incorrect Seccomp Filter Configuration [CRITICAL]:**
    *   **Description:** Firecracker uses `seccomp` to restrict the system calls that the microVM can make.  If the seccomp profile is too permissive (or has a flaw), it allows the attacker to make dangerous system calls that could lead to an escape.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Exploit Kernel Vulnerabilities (via System Calls) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_exploit_kernel_vulnerabilities__via_system_calls___high_risk_.md)

*   **1.2 Exploit Kernel Vulnerabilities (via System Calls) [HIGH RISK]:**  Even if Firecracker itself is secure, the underlying kernel can still be vulnerable.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1 Bypass Seccomp Filters](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_bypass_seccomp_filters.md)

*   **1.2.1 Bypass Seccomp Filters:** If seccomp is misconfigured or a kernel bug allows bypassing it, the attacker can make arbitrary system calls.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2 Exploit a 0-day Kernel Vulnerability [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2_exploit_a_0-day_kernel_vulnerability__critical_.md)

*   **1.2.2 Exploit a 0-day Kernel Vulnerability [CRITICAL]:**  A previously unknown kernel vulnerability.  This is the most dangerous but also the least likely scenario.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3 Exploit Misconfigured Firecracker API [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_exploit_misconfigured_firecracker_api__high_risk_.md)

*   **1.3 Exploit Misconfigured Firecracker API [HIGH RISK]:**  Attacking the API used to manage Firecracker microVMs.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.1 Insufficient Authentication/Authorization on API Socket [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_1_insufficient_authenticationauthorization_on_api_socket__critical_.md)

*   **1.3.1 Insufficient Authentication/Authorization on API Socket [CRITICAL]:**  If the API socket (used for communication with the Firecracker process) lacks proper authentication or authorization, an attacker could gain control over Firecracker and create, modify, or delete microVMs.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Lateral Movement (After Escaping One MicroVM) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2__lateral_movement__after_escaping_one_microvm___high_risk_.md)

*   **2. Lateral Movement (After Escaping One MicroVM) [HIGH RISK]**

    *   **Description:**  After successfully escaping one microVM, the attacker attempts to compromise other microVMs or the host system.
    *   **Sub-Vectors:**

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1 Exploit Shared Resources (if any) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_exploit_shared_resources__if_any___high_risk_.md)

*   **2.1 Exploit Shared Resources (if any) [HIGH RISK]:**  Taking advantage of any resources shared between microVMs or between a microVM and the host.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1 Shared Filesystem (if configured) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1_shared_filesystem__if_configured___critical_.md)

*   **2.1.1 Shared Filesystem (if configured) [CRITICAL]:**  If a filesystem is mounted in multiple microVMs (or the host), an attacker can use it to read or write data, potentially compromising other systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.2 Shared Memory (if explicitly configured) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_2_shared_memory__if_explicitly_configured___critical_.md)

*   **2.1.2 Shared Memory (if explicitly configured) [CRITICAL]:**  Similar to shared filesystems, shared memory regions can be used for inter-process communication and, if misconfigured, can be exploited for lateral movement.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.3 Shared Network Namespace (if misconfigured) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_3_shared_network_namespace__if_misconfigured___critical_.md)

*   **2.1.3 Shared Network Namespace (if misconfigured) [CRITICAL]:**  If microVMs share a network namespace, they can directly communicate with each other, bypassing network isolation.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2 Exploit Host Vulnerabilities (from Escaped MicroVM)](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_exploit_host_vulnerabilities__from_escaped_microvm_.md)

*   **2.2 Exploit Host Vulnerabilities (from Escaped MicroVM)**

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.1 Kernel Vulnerabilities (same as 1.2) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_1_kernel_vulnerabilities__same_as_1_2___high_risk_.md)

*    **2.2.1 Kernel Vulnerabilities (same as 1.2) [HIGH RISK]:** After escaping a microVM, the attacker is essentially running code on the host, and can then attempt to exploit kernel vulnerabilities to gain root privileges.
