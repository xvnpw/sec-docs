# Deep Analysis of Firecracker Attack Tree Path: 2.1.1 - Shared Filesystem

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the risks associated with shared filesystems in Firecracker deployments, specifically focusing on attack path 2.1.1.  We aim to identify potential attack vectors, assess the likelihood and impact of successful exploitation, and propose concrete mitigation strategies to reduce the attack surface.  This analysis will inform development decisions and security best practices for our application.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the scenario where a filesystem is shared between:

*   Multiple Firecracker microVMs.
*   A Firecracker microVM and the host system.
*   A Firecracker microVM and other containers or processes on the host.

We will *not* cover scenarios where filesystems are *not* shared (i.e., each microVM has its own dedicated, isolated filesystem).  We will also limit the scope to the direct implications of shared filesystem access, excluding secondary attacks that might be launched *after* initial compromise via this vector (e.g., privilege escalation *within* a compromised microVM).  We will consider both read and write access to the shared filesystem.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Threat Modeling:** We will identify potential attackers, their motivations, and their capabilities.
2.  **Vulnerability Analysis:** We will examine the specific vulnerabilities introduced by shared filesystems in the context of Firecracker.
3.  **Exploit Scenario Development:** We will construct realistic attack scenarios that demonstrate how an attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities.
4.  **Impact Assessment:** We will evaluate the potential damage resulting from successful exploitation, considering confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
5.  **Mitigation Recommendation:** We will propose specific, actionable mitigation strategies to reduce the risk, categorized by prevention, detection, and response.
6. **Code Review Guidance:** We will provide specific guidance for code reviews related to filesystem sharing configurations.

### 4.1 Threat Modeling

*   **Attacker Profiles:**
    *   **Malicious Guest:** An attacker who has compromised one of the microVMs sharing the filesystem.  Their motivation is to escalate privileges, access data in other microVMs, or disrupt the host system.
    *   **Compromised Host Process:**  A non-Firecracker process on the host system that has been compromised and has access to the shared filesystem.  The attacker's motivation is similar to the malicious guest.
    *   **Insider Threat:** A malicious or negligent user with legitimate access to the host system or configuration files.  Their motivation might be data theft, sabotage, or unauthorized access.

*   **Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   **Malicious Guest:**  Limited by the guest OS and Firecracker's security mechanisms, but potentially able to exploit guest OS vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
    *   **Compromised Host Process:**  Potentially has higher privileges than a guest, depending on the compromised process.
    *   **Insider Threat:**  May have full administrative access to the host and Firecracker configuration.

### 4.2 Vulnerability Analysis

Shared filesystems, by their nature, break the isolation guarantees that Firecracker aims to provide.  The core vulnerabilities introduced are:

*   **Data Leakage (Confidentiality):**  A compromised microVM can read data from the shared filesystem that belongs to other microVMs or the host, violating confidentiality.  This includes sensitive data, configuration files, and potentially even cryptographic keys.
*   **Data Modification (Integrity):** A compromised microVM can modify data on the shared filesystem, corrupting data used by other microVMs or the host.  This could lead to application instability, denial of service, or even execution of malicious code if configuration files or binaries are modified.
*   **Denial of Service (Availability):** A compromised microVM can consume excessive resources on the shared filesystem (e.g., filling it up, creating excessive numbers of files, or locking files), impacting the availability of the filesystem for other microVMs or the host.
*   **Escape to Host (Indirect):** While not a direct escape, a compromised microVM could potentially modify files used by the host (e.g., configuration files loaded by a host process) to indirectly influence the host's behavior or even achieve code execution on the host. This is a higher-risk, lower-probability scenario.
* **Race Conditions:** If multiple microVMs or the host are accessing and modifying the same files concurrently without proper synchronization mechanisms, race conditions can occur, leading to data corruption or unpredictable behavior.

### 4.3 Exploit Scenario Development

**Scenario 1: Data Exfiltration**

1.  **Compromise:** An attacker compromises microVM A through a vulnerability in a web application running within it.
2.  **Reconnaissance:** The attacker discovers that microVM A shares a filesystem with microVM B, which stores sensitive customer data.
3.  **Exfiltration:** The attacker uses standard file system commands (e.g., `cat`, `cp`) within microVM A to read the customer data from the shared filesystem and exfiltrate it to an external server.

**Scenario 2: Data Corruption**

1.  **Compromise:** An attacker compromises microVM A.
2.  **Target Identification:** The attacker identifies a critical configuration file used by microVM B on the shared filesystem.
3.  **Modification:** The attacker modifies the configuration file, injecting malicious settings that will cause microVM B to malfunction or expose vulnerabilities.
4. **Impact:** When microVM B reloads the configuration file, it becomes unstable or vulnerable, leading to a denial of service or further compromise.

**Scenario 3: Denial of Service (Disk Full)**

1.  **Compromise:** An attacker compromises microVM A.
2.  **Resource Exhaustion:** The attacker writes a large amount of data to the shared filesystem, filling it up completely.
3.  **Impact:** Other microVMs and the host system are unable to write to the filesystem, causing applications to fail and potentially leading to system instability.

**Scenario 4: Indirect Host Compromise (Configuration Tampering)**

1. **Compromise:** An attacker compromises microVM A.
2. **Target Identification:** The attacker identifies a configuration file on the shared filesystem that is read by a host process at startup (e.g., a systemd unit file or a script executed by cron).
3. **Modification:** The attacker carefully modifies the configuration file to include a malicious command that will be executed by the host process with its privileges.
4. **Trigger:** The host process restarts (e.g., due to a system reboot or service restart).
5. **Host Compromise:** The malicious command is executed, granting the attacker control over the host system.

### 4.4 Impact Assessment

The impact of successful exploitation of shared filesystem vulnerabilities can be severe:

*   **Confidentiality:** Loss of sensitive data, including customer information, intellectual property, and cryptographic keys.  This can lead to financial losses, reputational damage, and legal liabilities.
*   **Integrity:** Corruption of data, leading to application malfunctions, data loss, and potential system instability.  This can disrupt business operations and require costly recovery efforts.
*   **Availability:** Denial of service, preventing legitimate users from accessing applications and services.  This can lead to financial losses, customer dissatisfaction, and reputational damage.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** In the worst-case scenario (indirect host compromise), the attacker could gain full control over the host system, potentially compromising all microVMs and other resources on the host.

### 4.5 Mitigation Recommendations

**Prevention:**

*   **Avoid Shared Filesystems:**  This is the most effective mitigation.  If possible, design your application so that each microVM has its own dedicated, isolated filesystem.  Use alternative data sharing mechanisms (see below) when necessary.
*   **Read-Only Mounts:** If sharing is unavoidable, mount the filesystem read-only in as many microVMs as possible.  This prevents compromised microVMs from modifying the data.  Use the `ro` option in the Firecracker configuration.
*   **Minimal Sharing:** Share only the *absolute minimum* necessary data.  Avoid sharing entire directories if only a few specific files are needed.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the user within the microVM has the *minimum* necessary permissions on the shared filesystem.  Avoid granting unnecessary read or write access.
*   **Secure Configuration:**  Carefully review and validate the Firecracker configuration related to filesystem sharing.  Ensure that the `path_on_host` and `mount_point` settings are correct and that the `is_read_only` flag is set appropriately.
*   **Filesystem Choice:** Consider using a filesystem that supports features like quotas and access control lists (ACLs) to further restrict access and resource usage.
* **Use of Virtio-FS (if applicable):** If the guest kernel supports it, consider using Virtio-FS instead of a traditional shared filesystem. Virtio-FS is designed for VM-host file sharing and can offer better performance and security features compared to generic shared filesystems. It enforces stricter access controls and can be configured with more granular permissions.

**Detection:**

*   **Filesystem Monitoring:** Implement monitoring tools to detect unusual activity on the shared filesystem, such as excessive read/write operations, creation of unexpected files, or modification of critical files.  Tools like `inotify` (on Linux) can be used to monitor file changes.
*   **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):** Deploy IDS within the microVMs and on the host to detect malicious activity, including attempts to access or modify the shared filesystem.
*   **Security Auditing:** Regularly audit the Firecracker configuration and the permissions on the shared filesystem to identify potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Log Analysis:**  Analyze system logs (both within the microVMs and on the host) for suspicious events related to filesystem access.

**Response:**

*   **Isolation:** If a microVM is compromised, immediately isolate it from the network and the shared filesystem to prevent further damage.
*   **Snapshotting/Rollback:**  If possible, use snapshots to revert the shared filesystem to a known good state after a compromise.
*   **Incident Response Plan:**  Develop a comprehensive incident response plan that outlines the steps to take in the event of a security breach involving the shared filesystem.

**Alternative Data Sharing Mechanisms (Instead of Shared Filesystems):**

*   **Network Communication:** Use network sockets (TCP/UDP) or message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) for inter-microVM communication and data exchange. This provides a more controlled and secure way to share data.
*   **API-Based Access:**  Expose data through well-defined APIs, rather than direct filesystem access.  This allows for fine-grained access control and auditing.
*   **Object Storage:**  Use a separate object storage service (e.g., AWS S3, MinIO) to store and share data between microVMs.
* **Dedicated Data Transfer MicroVM:** Create a dedicated microVM that acts as a secure intermediary for data transfer between other microVMs. This microVM can enforce strict access controls and auditing.

### 4.6 Code Review Guidance

When reviewing code related to Firecracker and filesystem sharing, pay close attention to the following:

*   **Firecracker Configuration:**
    *   Verify that the `drives` section in the Firecracker configuration is correct and minimizes shared filesystem usage.
    *   Ensure that the `is_read_only` flag is set to `true` whenever possible.
    *   Check that the `path_on_host` points to the intended directory and that the `mount_point` is appropriate.
    *   Avoid hardcoding paths; use configuration variables or environment variables instead.
*   **Guest OS Configuration:**
    *   Verify that the guest OS is configured to mount the shared filesystem with the correct permissions (e.g., read-only, noexec).
    *   Ensure that unnecessary users or groups do not have access to the shared filesystem.
*   **Application Code:**
    *   Avoid direct filesystem access if possible; use alternative data sharing mechanisms.
    *   If filesystem access is necessary, use secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities like path traversal and race conditions.
    *   Implement proper error handling and input validation to prevent unexpected behavior.
    *   Sanitize any user-provided input that is used to construct file paths.
* **Synchronization:** If multiple microVMs or processes are writing to the same files, ensure that proper synchronization mechanisms (e.g., file locks, mutexes) are used to prevent race conditions and data corruption.

This deep analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the risks associated with shared filesystems in Firecracker deployments and offers actionable recommendations to mitigate those risks. By implementing these recommendations, the development team can significantly enhance the security of the application and protect it from potential attacks.
