# Threat Model Analysis for firecracker-microvm/firecracker

## Threat: [Threat: KVM Escape via CPU Vulnerability](./threats/threat_kvm_escape_via_cpu_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker in a guest VM exploits a vulnerability in the KVM hypervisor (e.g., a CPU flaw like Spectre, Meltdown, or a newly discovered KVM bug) to execute arbitrary code on the host system. The attacker crafts malicious input or code within the guest that triggers the vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Complete host system compromise. The attacker gains full control of the host, including access to all data, other VMs, and the ability to execute arbitrary commands.
*   **Firecracker Component Affected:** KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) â€“ the underlying virtualization technology used by Firecracker. Specifically, the CPU virtualization extensions (Intel VT-x or AMD-V) and the KVM kernel module.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Host Kernel Updates:** *Immediately* apply security patches to the host operating system's kernel. This is the primary defense against known KVM vulnerabilities.
    *   **Microcode Updates:** Ensure the host CPU's microcode is up-to-date to mitigate CPU-level vulnerabilities.
    *   **Guest OS Hardening:** Use a hardened guest OS with minimal attack surface.
    *   **Monitor for CVEs:** Continuously monitor for CVEs related to KVM and the host CPU.

## Threat: [Threat: Virtio Device Escape (e.g., virtio-net)](./threats/threat_virtio_device_escape__e_g___virtio-net_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker in a guest VM exploits a vulnerability in the Firecracker implementation of a virtio device (e.g., `virtio-net`, `virtio-blk`, `virtio-vsock`). The attacker sends crafted network packets, block device requests, or vsock messages that trigger a bug in the device emulation code, leading to host code execution.
*   **Impact:** Host system compromise. The attacker gains control of the host, similar to a KVM escape.
*   **Firecracker Component Affected:** Specific virtio device implementations within Firecracker.  For example, the `net` module (for `virtio-net`), the `block` module (for `virtio-blk`), or the `vsock` module.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Firecracker Updates:** Apply security updates to Firecracker promptly.  Virtio device vulnerabilities are often patched in Firecracker releases.
    *   **Minimize Device Usage:** Only enable the virtio devices that are absolutely necessary.  Disable unused devices.
    *   **Input Validation (Guest Side):** If possible, implement input validation *within* the guest OS (defense-in-depth).
    *   **Rate Limiting (Network):** For `virtio-net`, use Firecracker's rate limiting features.

## Threat: [Threat: Seccomp Filter Bypass](./threats/threat_seccomp_filter_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker in a guest VM crafts a sequence of system calls that bypasses the intended restrictions of the Firecracker seccomp filter. This could be due to a logic flaw in the filter configuration or a vulnerability in the seccomp implementation itself.
*   **Impact:** Increased attack surface on the host. The attacker gains access to system calls that should have been blocked, potentially enabling further exploitation. The severity depends on *which* system calls become available.
*   **Firecracker Component Affected:** Firecracker's seccomp filter implementation and the specific seccomp profile used. This is primarily within the `jailer` process and the interaction with the `libseccomp` library.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical if the bypass allows critical system calls)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Seccomp Profiles:** Use the *most restrictive* seccomp profile possible.
    *   **Regular Profile Review:** Regularly review and audit the seccomp profile.
    *   **Testing:** Thoroughly test the seccomp profile.
    *   **Firecracker Updates:** Keep Firecracker updated.

## Threat: [Threat: Resource Exhaustion (CPU/Memory)](./threats/threat_resource_exhaustion__cpumemory_.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious guest VM consumes all available CPU cycles or memory on the host, causing a denial-of-service (DoS) condition for other VMs and potentially the host itself.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service for other VMs and potentially the host.
*   **Firecracker Component Affected:** Firecracker's resource management features (cgroups integration). Specifically, the configuration of CPU and memory limits for each microVM.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Resource Limits:** Configure strict CPU and memory limits for each Firecracker microVM using the API.
    *   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement monitoring to track CPU and memory usage.
    *   **Automatic Remediation:** Consider automatically terminating or throttling VMs that exceed their limits.

## Threat: [Threat: Network DoS via virtio-net](./threats/threat_network_dos_via_virtio-net.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious guest VM floods the network, consuming all available bandwidth and preventing other VMs or the host from communicating effectively.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service for network communication.
*   **Firecracker Component Affected:** `virtio-net` device implementation and Firecracker's network configuration.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Use Firecracker's built-in rate limiting features for `virtio-net`.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** If possible, isolate VMs on separate networks.
    *   **External Firewall:** Use a firewall on the host or network.

## Threat: [Threat: Jailer Configuration Error (Chroot Escape)](./threats/threat_jailer_configuration_error__chroot_escape_.md)

*   **Description:** A misconfiguration in the Firecracker jailer allows a process within the microVM to escape the chroot environment and access files or resources on the host filesystem.
*   **Impact:** Potential host file system access. The severity depends on *what* files become accessible.
*   **Firecracker Component Affected:** The `jailer` process and its configuration. Specifically, the chroot directory setup, UID/GID mapping, and cgroup settings.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Minimal Chroot:** Ensure the chroot directory contains *only* the absolutely necessary files and directories.
    *   **Correct Permissions:** Set appropriate file permissions within the chroot.
    *   **UID/GID Mapping:** Carefully configure UID/GID mapping.
    *   **Jailer Updates:** Keep the `jailer` (and Firecracker) updated.
    *   **Regular Audits:** Regularly audit the jailer configuration.
