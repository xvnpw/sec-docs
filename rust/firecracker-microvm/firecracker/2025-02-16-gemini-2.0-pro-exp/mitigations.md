# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for firecracker-microvm/firecracker

## Mitigation Strategy: [Seccomp Filtering (System Call Filtering)](./mitigation_strategies/seccomp_filtering__system_call_filtering_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Restrict the system calls the Firecracker VMM process can make.
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Identify Allowed System Calls:** Analyze the Firecracker source code and documentation (and potentially use `strace`) to determine the minimum set of system calls required for Firecracker's operation.
        2.  **Create Seccomp Profile:**  Create a JSON file that defines the seccomp-bpf filter.  This file will specify a whitelist of allowed system calls and a default action (e.g., `SCMP_ACT_ERRNO(EPERM)`) for all other system calls.
        3.  **Apply Seccomp Filter:**  Use the `--seccomp-filter` option when launching Firecracker, providing the path to the JSON file.
        4.  **Test Extensively:**  Thoroughly test the application with the seccomp filter.  Monitor for errors, adjusting the filter as needed.
        5.  **Regular Review:**  Periodically review the seccomp profile for updates and improvements.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **VMM Exploits (Severity: High):** Limits exploitation of vulnerabilities in the Firecracker VMM.
        *   **MicroVM Escape (Severity: Critical):** Reduces the risk of VM escape by restricting VMM access to the host kernel.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **VMM Exploits:** Significantly reduces the risk (High impact).
        *   **MicroVM Escape:** Significantly reduces the risk (High impact).
    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Example: Not implemented.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Example:  Create and apply a seccomp profile to all Firecracker instances.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Reduced Device Exposure](./mitigation_strategies/reduced_device_exposure.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Minimize the number of devices exposed to the guest VM *via Firecracker's configuration*.
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Identify Essential Devices:** Determine the absolute minimum devices needed (usually virtio-net and virtio-block).
        2.  **Configure Firecracker:**  When launching Firecracker, use command-line options or API calls to specify *only* the essential devices.  Do *not* add unnecessary devices.
        3.  **Test:**  Thoroughly test the guest application.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Device Driver Exploits (Severity: High):** Reduces exploitable device drivers within the guest.
        *   **MicroVM Escape (Severity: Critical):** Limits the attack surface for escaping via device driver vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Device Driver Exploits:** Significantly reduces the risk (High impact).
        *   **MicroVM Escape:** Significantly reduces the risk (High impact).
    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Example: Partially implemented. Only virtio-net and virtio-block are exposed, but further investigation is needed.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Example:  Review Firecracker configuration and startup scripts.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Firecracker Updates](./mitigation_strategies/regular_firecracker_updates.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Keep Firecracker itself up-to-date.
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Subscribe to Notifications:** Subscribe to the Firecracker security mailing list and vulnerability databases.
        2.  **Monitor for Updates:** Regularly check for new Firecracker releases.
        3.  **Automated Updates (Ideal):** Integrate Firecracker updates into your CI/CD pipeline.
        4.  **Manual Updates (If Necessary):** Establish a process for manually updating Firecracker instances.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Known Vulnerabilities (Severity: Variable, often High or Critical):** Protects against known Firecracker vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Known Vulnerabilities:** Eliminates the risk from known, patched vulnerabilities (High impact).
    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Example: Partially implemented. Manual checks are performed, but no automation.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Example:  Implement automated updates.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limits (via Firecracker's cgroup integration)](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limits__via_firecracker's_cgroup_integration_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Limit resources available to each Firecracker *instance* using Firecracker's cgroup features.
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Define Resource Limits:** Determine appropriate limits for CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network bandwidth.
        2.  **Configure cgroups (via Firecracker):** Use Firecracker's built-in cgroup support (command-line options).
        3.  **Test and Monitor:** Test with limits and monitor resource usage.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: High):** Prevents resource exhaustion impacting other VMs or the host.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion (Severity: Medium):** Protects against resource exhaustion within a VM.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Significantly reduces the risk (High impact).
        *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Significantly reduces the risk (High impact).
    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Example: Basic memory limits via `--memory-size`. No limits on CPU, disk I/O, or network.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Example: Implement comprehensive limits using cgroups for CPU, disk I/O, and network.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Unnecessary Firecracker Features](./mitigation_strategies/disable_unnecessary_firecracker_features.md)
