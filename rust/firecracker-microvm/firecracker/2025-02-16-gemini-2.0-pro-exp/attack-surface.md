# Attack Surface Analysis for firecracker-microvm/firecracker

## Attack Surface: [Host Kernel Interaction Exploits (vhost-net, vsock, seccomp bypass)](./attack_surfaces/host_kernel_interaction_exploits__vhost-net__vsock__seccomp_bypass_.md)

*Description:* Exploitation of vulnerabilities in the host kernel's interaction with Firecracker, specifically through `vhost-net`, `vsock`, or by bypassing seccomp restrictions.
*Firecracker Contribution:* Firecracker *directly* relies on the host kernel for these functionalities, making kernel vulnerabilities directly exploitable through Firecracker.
*Example:* A compromised guest sends crafted network packets to exploit a `vhost-net` vulnerability, or uses a seccomp bypass to execute arbitrary system calls on the host.
*Impact:* Host system compromise, denial of service, data leakage.
*Risk Severity:* Critical to High.
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Developers:** Minimize guest interaction with vulnerable kernel features. Contribute to upstream kernel security.
    *   **Users:** Keep the host kernel updated. Use a hardened kernel. Employ strict network isolation (namespaces, firewalls). Audit and refine seccomp profiles rigorously. Monitor kernel events.

## Attack Surface: [Firecracker API and MMDS Attacks](./attack_surfaces/firecracker_api_and_mmds_attacks.md)

*Description:* Attacks targeting the Firecracker API server or the Metadata Service (MMDS) to gain unauthorized control or inject malicious data.
*Firecracker Contribution:* The API and MMDS are *core components* of Firecracker, providing essential management and configuration capabilities.  Vulnerabilities here directly impact Firecracker's security.
*Example:* An attacker exploits a command injection in the API to launch a privileged microVM, or compromises the MMDS to inject malicious boot scripts.
*Impact:* Complete control over Firecracker instances, guest VM compromise, data exfiltration, denial of service.
*Risk Severity:* Critical.
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Developers:** Implement robust authentication/authorization for the API. Use secure coding practices. Validate all MMDS data within the guest.
    *   **Users:** Secure the API server (strong authentication, TLS). Restrict network access to the API and MMDS. Use a reverse proxy. Monitor API access logs.

## Attack Surface: [Virtio Device Emulation Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/virtio_device_emulation_vulnerabilities.md)

*Description:* Exploitation of bugs in Firecracker's *own* implementation of virtio device emulation.
*Firecracker Contribution:* Firecracker *directly implements* virtio device emulation. This is not a reliance on an external component (like the kernel for networking), but an internal code path.
*Example:* A compromised guest sends a malformed request to the virtio block device, causing a denial-of-service or potentially triggering a more severe vulnerability within Firecracker.
*Impact:* Denial of service, potential host code execution (rare but possible), data corruption.
*Risk Severity:* High to Critical.
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Developers:** Thoroughly fuzz test and audit the virtio device emulation code. Follow secure coding practices.
    *   **Users:** Keep Firecracker updated. Monitor Firecracker's resource usage and logs. Minimize exposed virtio devices.

## Attack Surface: [Jailer Misconfiguration/Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/jailer_misconfigurationvulnerabilities.md)

*Description:* Weaknesses or misconfigurations in the Jailer process, which Firecracker uses for its own containment.
*Firecracker Contribution:* Firecracker *integrates and depends on* Jailer for its security model. A flaw in Jailer directly weakens Firecracker's isolation.
*Example:* A misconfigured Jailer allows Firecracker to access files outside its intended chroot, leading to information disclosure or potential privilege escalation.
*Impact:* Weakened isolation, potential host compromise, information disclosure.
*Risk Severity:* High.
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Developers:** Test and audit Jailer configurations. Contribute to Jailer security.
    *   **Users:** Carefully review and validate Jailer configurations. Keep Jailer updated. Monitor Jailer-related behavior. Use minimal capabilities.
