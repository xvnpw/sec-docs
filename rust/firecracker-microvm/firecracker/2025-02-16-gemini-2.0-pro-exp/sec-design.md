# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) alternative to QEMU, optimized for security and minimal overhead.
*   Enable the creation of lightweight microVMs for serverless computing and container workloads.
*   Offer fast boot times and minimal memory footprint to maximize resource utilization.
*   Ensure strong isolation between microVMs and the host system.
*   Support a high density of microVMs per host.
*   Provide a simple and easy-to-use API for managing microVMs.
*   Maintain compatibility with existing container tooling and workflows.
*   Be open source and community-driven.

Business Risks:

*   Vulnerabilities in the VMM could lead to VM escapes, compromising the host system and other microVMs. This is the most critical risk.
*   Performance bottlenecks could limit the density of microVMs and impact application performance.
*   Compatibility issues with specific kernels or container runtimes could limit adoption.
*   Lack of features compared to more mature VMMs could hinder adoption in certain use cases.
*   Complexity of the codebase could make it difficult to maintain and contribute to.
*   Insufficient security auditing and penetration testing could leave undiscovered vulnerabilities.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Minimal attack surface: Firecracker is designed with a minimal feature set, reducing the potential attack surface. (Described in Firecracker's design philosophy and documentation).
*   security control: Seccomp filtering: Firecracker uses seccomp filters to restrict the system calls that can be made by the guest kernel. (Described in Firecracker's documentation and source code).
*   security control: KVM isolation: Firecracker leverages the Linux Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM) for hardware-assisted virtualization, providing strong isolation between the guest and host. (Described in Firecracker's documentation and source code).
*   security control: Jailer: Firecracker uses a jailer process to further confine the VMM process, limiting its access to system resources. (Described in Firecracker's documentation and source code).
*   security control: Static linking: Firecracker is statically linked, reducing dependencies and potential vulnerabilities from shared libraries. (Described in Firecracker's build process).
*   security control: Regular security audits: Firecracker undergoes regular security audits and penetration testing. (Mentioned in community discussions and documentation).
*   security control: Minimal device emulation: Only a minimal set of devices (virtio-net, virtio-block, virtio-vsock, serial console) are emulated, reducing the attack surface related to device drivers. (Described in Firecracker's documentation and source code).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Reliance on KVM: Firecracker's security is inherently tied to the security of the KVM hypervisor. Any vulnerabilities in KVM could potentially impact Firecracker.
*   accepted risk: Limited feature set: The focus on minimalism means that some features available in other VMMs are not present in Firecracker. This is a trade-off for security and performance.
*   accepted risk: Potential for unknown vulnerabilities: As with any software, there is always the potential for undiscovered vulnerabilities.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement a comprehensive fuzzing framework to continuously test Firecracker for vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Integrate with a vulnerability management system to track and remediate identified vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Provide detailed documentation on security best practices for using Firecracker, including network configuration and guest image security.
*   security control: Explore the use of memory-safe languages (e.g., Rust) for future development to reduce the risk of memory corruption vulnerabilities.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Firecracker API should support authentication mechanisms to restrict access to authorized users and services.
    *   Consider using API keys or other token-based authentication.

*   Authorization:
    *   Firecracker API should implement role-based access control (RBAC) to limit the actions that users and services can perform.
    *   Define granular permissions for managing microVMs, networks, and storage.

*   Input Validation:
    *   All input to the Firecracker API should be strictly validated to prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities.
    *   Validate parameters such as kernel image paths, root filesystem paths, network configurations, and device specifications.

*   Cryptography:
    *   If sensitive data is transmitted between the host and guest, use secure communication channels (e.g., TLS).
    *   Consider using encrypted disk images for guest VMs to protect data at rest.
