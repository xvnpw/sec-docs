# Threat Model Analysis for firecracker-microvm/firecracker

## Threat: [VM Escape via VMM Vulnerability](./threats/vm_escape_via_vmm_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** An attacker within a guest VM exploits a vulnerability in the core Firecracker VMM process (written in Rust) to break out of the virtualized environment. This could involve exploiting memory corruption bugs, logic errors in instruction emulation, or flaws in the KVM interface handling. The attacker could gain code execution on the host operating system.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the host machine, potentially affecting other guest VMs running on the same host. Access to sensitive data and resources on the host.

**Affected Component:** `firecracker` VMM process (specifically the core virtualization logic, memory management, and KVM interaction).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep Firecracker updated to the latest stable version with security patches.
* Utilize memory safety features of Rust and perform rigorous code reviews.
* Employ fuzzing and static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in the VMM code.
* Leverage hardware virtualization features (like Intel VT-x or AMD-V) securely.

## Threat: [Unauthorized VM Control via API Abuse](./threats/unauthorized_vm_control_via_api_abuse.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Firecracker API (e.g., due to weak authentication or authorization) and uses it to manipulate guest VMs. This could involve actions like stopping VMs, modifying their configuration, attaching malicious devices, or accessing VM console output.

**Impact:** Denial of service to guest VMs, potential data breaches if VM configurations are altered to expose sensitive information, launching of rogue VMs consuming resources.

**Affected Component:** Firecracker API (specifically the API endpoints for VM management, device configuration, and control).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for the Firecracker API (e.g., using secure tokens or mutual TLS).
* Restrict access to the API to only authorized processes on the host.
* Carefully validate all input to the Firecracker API to prevent injection attacks.
* Follow the principle of least privilege when granting API access.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attacks on Firecracker Binaries or Dependencies](./threats/supply_chain_attacks_on_firecracker_binaries_or_dependencies.md)

**Description:** An attacker compromises the build or distribution process of Firecracker or its dependencies, injecting malicious code into the binaries. Users who download and run these compromised binaries would be vulnerable.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the host machine, access to sensitive data of all tenants.

**Affected Component:** Entire `firecracker` VMM process and its dependencies.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Download Firecracker binaries from official and trusted sources.
* Verify the integrity of downloaded binaries using cryptographic signatures.
* Be aware of the security posture of Firecracker's dependencies.
* Consider using software composition analysis tools to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
