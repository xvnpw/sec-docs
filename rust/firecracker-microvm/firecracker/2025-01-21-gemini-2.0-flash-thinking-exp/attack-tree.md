## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Firecracker API Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_firecracker_api_vulnerabilities.md)

This node represents a broad category of attacks targeting the Firecracker API. Success here allows attackers to interact with and manipulate the Firecracker instance.

## Attack Tree Path: [Authentication Bypass](./attack_tree_paths/authentication_bypass.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting missing or weak authentication mechanisms in the Firecracker API.
*   **Details:** Attackers attempt to bypass the login or authentication process to gain unauthorized access to API endpoints. This could involve exploiting default credentials, using known vulnerabilities in authentication protocols, or leveraging flaws in custom authentication implementations.
*   **Impact:** Grants the attacker full control over the Firecracker instance, allowing them to manage VMs, access resources, and potentially compromise the host.

## Attack Tree Path: [Authorization Bypass](./attack_tree_paths/authorization_bypass.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting flaws in the authorization logic to perform actions beyond permitted scope.
*   **Details:** Even if authenticated, attackers try to circumvent authorization checks to perform actions they are not supposed to. This could involve manipulating API parameters, exploiting logic errors in the authorization code, or leveraging misconfigurations in access control policies.
*   **Impact:** Allows attackers to manage VMs, access sensitive information, or disrupt services beyond their intended privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [Input Validation Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/input_validation_vulnerabilities.md)

This category encompasses vulnerabilities arising from improper handling of user-supplied input to the Firecracker API.

## Attack Tree Path: [Command Injection](./attack_tree_paths/command_injection.md)

**Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious commands through API parameters that are executed on the host operating system.
*   **Details:** Attackers craft API requests containing shell commands that are then executed by the Firecracker process on the host. This often occurs when user input is directly incorporated into system calls without proper sanitization.
*   **Impact:** Leads to direct and complete compromise of the host machine, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code, access data, and control the system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve VM Escape](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_vm_escape.md)

This node represents the goal of breaking out of the guest VM's isolation and gaining access to the host operating system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Virtual Devices (Virtio)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_virtual_devices__virtio_.md)

This path focuses on exploiting weaknesses in the virtual devices provided by Firecracker (using the Virtio standard).

## Attack Tree Path: [Memory Corruption in Virtio Drivers](./attack_tree_paths/memory_corruption_in_virtio_drivers.md)

**Attack Vector:** Triggering memory corruption within the guest OS kernel by exploiting vulnerabilities in the virtual device drivers (e.g., network, block).
*   **Details:** Attackers send specially crafted data through the virtual devices that exploit bugs in the guest OS's Virtio drivers. This can lead to overwriting critical kernel data structures, potentially allowing for code execution within the guest kernel and, subsequently, a VM escape.
*   **Impact:** Allows the attacker to break out of the guest VM and gain control over the host operating system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in the Hypervisor (Firecracker Itself)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_the_hypervisor__firecracker_itself_.md)

This path involves directly targeting vulnerabilities within the Firecracker hypervisor code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Memory Corruption in Hypervisor Code](./attack_tree_paths/memory_corruption_in_hypervisor_code.md)

**Attack Vector:** Triggering memory corruption within the Firecracker hypervisor, potentially leading to code execution on the host.
*   **Details:** Attackers find and exploit memory safety bugs (like buffer overflows or use-after-free vulnerabilities) in the Firecracker hypervisor code. This often involves sending carefully crafted inputs through the API or virtual devices that trigger these vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** Directly compromises the host machine, granting the attacker the highest level of control.
