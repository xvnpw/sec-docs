# Attack Surface Analysis for firecracker-microvm/firecracker

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated or Improperly Authenticated Firecracker API Access](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_or_improperly_authenticated_firecracker_api_access.md)

* **Description:** The Firecracker API, used to control microVMs, is exposed without proper authentication or authorization mechanisms.
    * **How Firecracker Contributes:** Firecracker provides an HTTP API for managing microVM lifecycle, configuration, and resources. If this API is accessible without proper security, it becomes a direct entry point for malicious actors.
    * **Example:** An attacker gains network access to the machine running Firecracker and can send API requests to start, stop, or delete microVMs without providing any credentials.
    * **Impact:** Complete loss of control over the microVM environment, potential data loss, denial of service, and the ability to manipulate or exfiltrate data from running microVMs.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strong authentication mechanisms for the Firecracker API (e.g., API keys, mutual TLS).
        * Enforce strict authorization policies to control which users or processes can perform specific API actions.
        * Ensure the API endpoint is not publicly accessible and is protected by network firewalls or access control lists.
        * Use the principle of least privilege when granting API access.

## Attack Surface: [Guest VM Escape via Virtualization Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/guest_vm_escape_via_virtualization_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** A malicious or compromised guest VM exploits vulnerabilities in Firecracker's virtualization implementation to break out of the virtual machine and gain access to the host operating system.
    * **How Firecracker Contributes:** Firecracker, like any virtualization technology, relies on complex software to emulate hardware. Bugs or vulnerabilities in this emulation layer (CPU, memory management, I/O devices) can be exploited by a carefully crafted guest workload.
    * **Example:** A vulnerability in Firecracker's handling of a specific CPU instruction allows a malicious guest to overwrite memory outside of its allocated space, potentially gaining code execution on the host.
    * **Impact:** Full compromise of the host operating system, potentially affecting other microVMs running on the same host, and access to sensitive host resources.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep Firecracker updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        * Utilize seccomp filtering within the guest VMs to restrict the system calls they can make, limiting the potential attack surface.
        * Implement resource limits and quotas for guest VMs to prevent them from consuming excessive resources that could be used in an attack.
        * Employ memory randomization techniques within the guest to make memory exploitation more difficult.

## Attack Surface: [Host OS Compromise via Firecracker Process Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/host_os_compromise_via_firecracker_process_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Vulnerabilities within the Firecracker process itself are exploited by an attacker with local access to gain elevated privileges or execute arbitrary code on the host operating system.
    * **How Firecracker Contributes:** Firecracker is a user-space process that interacts with the host kernel. Bugs within its code, such as buffer overflows or integer overflows, could be exploited by a local attacker.
    * **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability in Firecracker's handling of a specific configuration option allows a local attacker to overwrite memory and execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Firecracker process.
    * **Impact:** Full compromise of the host operating system, potentially affecting all services and data on the host.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep Firecracker updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        * Follow secure coding practices during the development and maintenance of applications interacting with Firecracker.
        * Limit local access to the machine running Firecracker.
        * Implement robust system security measures on the host operating system.
