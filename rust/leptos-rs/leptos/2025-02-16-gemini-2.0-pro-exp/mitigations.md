## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation and Sanitization for Server Functions](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation_and_sanitization_for_server_functions.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Strict Input Validation and Sanitization for Server Functions.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Data Structures:** Create Rust structs or enums that precisely define the expected data types and constraints for *each* server function input. Use descriptive field names and appropriate types (e.g., `String`, `u32`, `Option<String>`).  This leverages Rust's type system, which is fundamental to how Leptos server functions operate.
    2.  **Validation Library (Recommended):** Integrate a validation library like `validator` to add declarative validation rules to your data structures. This is a common pattern used with `serde` in Leptos. Example:
        ```rust
        #[derive(Validate, Serialize, Deserialize)]
        struct UserInput {
            #[validate(length(min = 3, max = 20))]
            username: String,
            #[validate(email)]
            email: String,
        }
        ```
    3.  **Server Function Validation:** At the *very beginning* of each server function, deserialize the input into your defined data structure using `serde`.  Immediately after deserialization, call the validation function (e.g., `input.validate()?`).  If validation fails, return an appropriate error.  *Do not proceed* if validation fails. This is a direct interaction with Leptos's server function mechanism.
    4.  **Sanitization (Context-Specific):** After validation, perform context-specific sanitization.
        *   **HTML Sanitization:** If the input will be rendered as HTML *within a Leptos component*, use `ammonia` to sanitize it. Example: `let sanitized_html = ammonia::clean(&input.comment);`. This is relevant because the output will be used within Leptos's rendering system.
        *   **SQL Sanitization:** If interacting with a database *from a Leptos server function*, use the database driver's escaping or parameterized queries.
    5.  **Error Handling:** Handle validation and sanitization errors gracefully, returning informative errors (without sensitive details) and logging detailed errors on the server.  This uses Leptos's `Result` handling within server functions.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** (Severity: Critical)
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** (Severity: High) - Specifically within Leptos-rendered content.
    *   **SQL Injection:** (Severity: Critical) - When database interaction is within a Leptos server function.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** (Severity: High)
    *   **Other Injection Attacks:** (Severity: Variable)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **RCE:** Risk reduced from Critical to Negligible.
    *   **XSS:** Risk reduced from High to Low (within Leptos components).
    *   **SQL Injection:** Risk reduced from Critical to Negligible.
    *   **DoS:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Other Injection Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: `src/api/user.rs` - `create_user` uses `UserInput` and `validator`.
    *   Example: `src/api/comments.rs` - `add_comment` uses `ammonia`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: `src/api/search.rs` - `search_products` lacks a struct and `validator`.
    *   Example: `src/api/admin.rs` - Server functions lack consistent validation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Comprehensive XSS Protection within Leptos Components](./mitigation_strategies/comprehensive_xss_protection_within_leptos_components.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Comprehensive XSS Protection in Leptos Components.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Prefer Leptos Templating:** Use Leptos's built-in templating features (e.g., `view!`, component properties) for rendering data.  This is the *core* of how Leptos handles safe rendering.
    2.  **Avoid `inner_html` (Generally):** Minimize `inner_html`. If unavoidable, go to step 3.
    3.  **`inner_html` Sanitization:** If `inner_html` is *absolutely* necessary, *always* sanitize the input using `ammonia` *before* inserting it. This is crucial because `inner_html` bypasses Leptos's built-in escaping. Example:
        ```rust
        let unsafe_html = "<script>alert('XSS')</script><p>Some content</p>";
        let safe_html = ammonia::clean(unsafe_html);
        view! { <div inner_html=safe_html></div> }
        ```
    4.  **Contextual Escaping:** When manually constructing HTML attributes or inline JavaScript *within a Leptos component*, use appropriate escaping.
    5.  **Component Review:** Before using third-party Leptos components, review their source for `inner_html` usage and ensure proper escaping. This is specific to the Leptos component ecosystem.
    6.  **`web-sys` Caution:** When using `web-sys` *within a Leptos component* to interact with JavaScript, be extremely careful about passing data to JavaScript functions that might modify the DOM. Sanitize or escape data, treating it as untrusted. This is relevant because it's within the context of Leptos's frontend.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** (Severity: High) - Specifically within Leptos-rendered content.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Risk reduced from High to Low.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: Most components in `src/components/` use Leptos templating.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: `src/components/markdown_viewer.rs` uses `inner_html` *without* `ammonia`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Safe Reactivity Practices](./mitigation_strategies/safe_reactivity_practices.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Debouncing, Throttling, and Careful Signal Graph Design *within Leptos*.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify High-Frequency Signals:** Analyze your Leptos application's reactive graph and identify signals updated frequently, especially those from user input or network events *within Leptos components*.
    2.  **Debouncing:** For signals triggered by user input that don't need immediate processing, use Leptos's `create_debounce`. Example:
        ```rust
        let (input, set_input) = create_signal(String::new());
        let debounced_input = create_debounce(
            move || input.get(),
            Duration::from_millis(300),
        );
        // Use debounced_input in your effects or views
        ```
    3.  **Throttling:** For signals needing regular but not *too* frequent updates, use Leptos's `create_throttle`. Example:
        ```rust
        let (scroll_position, set_scroll_position) = create_signal(0);
        let throttled_scroll = create_throttle(
            move || scroll_position.get(),
            Duration::from_millis(100),
        );
        // Use throttled_scroll to update UI elements
        ```
    4.  **Signal Graph Design:**
        *   **Minimize Signal Dependencies:** Avoid unnecessary dependencies between Leptos signals.
        *   **Avoid Cycles:** Ensure your Leptos reactive graph doesn't contain cycles.
        *   **Use Derived Signals:** Use Leptos's `create_memo` for derived values.
        *   **Consider `create_resource`:** For asynchronous operations *within Leptos*, use `create_resource`.
    5.  **Testing:** Thoroughly test your Leptos application's reactive logic.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Client-Side):** (Severity: Medium) - Within the Leptos frontend.
    *   **Performance Issues:** (Severity: Low) - Within the Leptos frontend.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS (Client-Side):** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
    *   **Performance Issues:** Significantly improves performance.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: `src/components/search_bar.rs` uses debouncing.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: `src/components/live_chat.rs` needs throttling.
    *   Example: General review of the reactive graph is needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure `web-sys` Usage within Leptos Components](./mitigation_strategies/secure__web-sys__usage_within_leptos_components.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Careful handling of untrusted data when using `web-sys` within Leptos components.

* **Description:**
    1. **Identify `web-sys` Interactions:** Locate all instances where your Leptos components use `web-sys` to interact with JavaScript APIs, *especially* those that involve:
        *   Manipulating the DOM (e.g., setting `innerHTML`, adding event listeners).
        *   Accessing browser APIs that could be security-sensitive (e.g., `fetch`, `localStorage`, `WebSockets`).
    2. **Treat Data as Untrusted:** Assume that any data passed from Rust to JavaScript (via `web-sys`) could be manipulated by an attacker.
    3. **Sanitize/Escape:** Before passing data to JavaScript functions that modify the DOM, sanitize or escape the data appropriately for the context. Use `ammonia` for HTML sanitization if the data will be rendered as HTML.
    4. **Validate Input to Callbacks:** If you're using `web-sys` to set up JavaScript callbacks that pass data back to Rust, validate the data received in the callback *before* using it. Treat this data as untrusted, just like input to server functions.
    5. **Avoid Sensitive Operations:** Be extremely cautious about using `web-sys` to perform security-sensitive operations directly from the client-side. If possible, move these operations to server functions.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** (Severity: High) - If `web-sys` is used to manipulate the DOM with untrusted data.
    * **Other JavaScript-Related Vulnerabilities:** (Severity: Variable) - Depending on the specific `web-sys` calls used.

* **Impact:**
    * **XSS:** Risk significantly reduced when combined with other XSS mitigations.
    * **Other Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced depending on the specific vulnerability.

* **Currently Implemented:**
    * (This section needs a review of the codebase to identify specific `web-sys` usage and assess the current implementation.)

* **Missing Implementation:**
    * (This section needs a review of the codebase to identify specific `web-sys` usage and determine where mitigation is missing.)

## Mitigation Strategy: [Server Function Error Handling (Leptos-Specific Aspects)](./mitigation_strategies/server_function_error_handling__leptos-specific_aspects_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:**  Use Leptos's `Result` and error handling mechanisms within server functions to prevent data leakage.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use `Result`:**  Structure all server functions to return a `Result<T, E>`, where `T` is the success type and `E` is a custom error type (often an enum). This is fundamental to Leptos server function design.
    2.  **Custom Error Types:** Define custom error enums that represent the different types of errors that can occur within your server functions.  These enums should *not* contain sensitive data.
    3.  **Map Errors to HTTP Status Codes:**  Use Leptos's mechanisms (or your own logic) to map your custom error types to appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 403 Forbidden, 500 Internal Server Error).
    4.  **Generic Error Messages (Client-Facing):**  When returning an error to the client, provide a generic, user-friendly error message that does *not* reveal any internal details.  This message should be derived from your custom error type, but should not include any sensitive information.
    5.  **Detailed Logging (Server-Side):**  Log detailed error information on the server, including the specific error type, stack trace (if available), and relevant context.  This is *separate* from the message sent to the client.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents leaking sensitive information through detailed error messages returned by server functions.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: Server functions in `src/api/` use `Result` and return custom error types.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: A consistent approach to error handling and mapping to HTTP status codes needs to be enforced across all server functions.
