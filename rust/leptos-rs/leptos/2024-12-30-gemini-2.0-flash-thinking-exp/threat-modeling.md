### High and Critical Leptos-Specific Threats

Here's an updated list of high and critical security threats that directly involve the Leptos framework:

*   **Threat:** Insecure Hydration leading to DOM Clobbering or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    *   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate data that is rendered on the server-side by Leptos. If this data is not properly sanitized and is used during Leptos's client-side hydration process to create DOM elements, the attacker could inject malicious HTML or JavaScript. This injected code would then execute in the user's browser after Leptos hydrates the application.
    *   **Impact:**  Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, or defacement of the application.
    *   **Affected Component:** `leptos::ssr::render_to_string` (server-side rendering within Leptos), `leptos::hydrate` (client-side hydration process in Leptos), `view!` macro (Leptos's templating system).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always sanitize user-provided data before rendering it on the server-side using Leptos's rendering functions.
        *   Utilize Leptos's built-in escaping mechanisms within the `view!` macro to prevent the interpretation of HTML entities.
        *   Avoid directly embedding complex data structures or executable code in the initial server-rendered HTML that Leptos will hydrate.
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to mitigate the impact of XSS vulnerabilities, even if they bypass initial sanitization.

*   **Threat:** Sensitive Data Exposure during Server-Side Rendering (SSR) by Leptos
    *   **Description:** An attacker could potentially access sensitive information if it's inadvertently included in the HTML source code rendered by Leptos on the server. This could happen if sensitive data is passed to Leptos's rendering functions but is not intended to be visible on the client-side after hydration.
    *   **Impact:** Disclosure of confidential information to unauthorized users, potentially leading to account compromise, data breaches, or reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Component:** `leptos::ssr::render_to_string` (Leptos's server-side rendering function), server-side logic that provides data to Leptos for rendering.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully review the data being passed to Leptos's server-side rendering functions.
        *   Avoid including sensitive information in the initial render performed by Leptos unless absolutely necessary and ensure it's handled securely on the client-side.
        *   Implement proper access control mechanisms on the server-side before providing data to Leptos for rendering.
        *   Consider using techniques like placeholders or fetching sensitive data on the client-side after authentication, rather than including it in the initial Leptos SSR output.

*   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Unsanitized Input in Leptos Templates
    *   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts through user input that is not properly sanitized before being rendered in the DOM using Leptos's `view!` macro and templating features. If Leptos renders this unsanitized input directly, it can lead to XSS.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, or defacement of the application.
    *   **Affected Component:** `view!` macro (Leptos's templating system), any logic within Leptos components that dynamically renders user-provided data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always sanitize user input before rendering it in the DOM using Leptos's templating features.
        *   Utilize Leptos's built-in escaping mechanisms within the `view!` macro to automatically escape HTML entities.
        *   Be particularly careful when rendering HTML directly from user input within Leptos components. Consider using safe HTML rendering methods if necessary and with extreme caution.
