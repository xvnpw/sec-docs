*   **Attack Surface:** Server-Side Rendering (SSR) HTML Injection
    *   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities arise when data dynamically inserted into the HTML during server-side rendering is not properly sanitized. This allows attackers to inject malicious scripts that execute when the initial HTML is loaded in the user's browser.
    *   **How Leptos Contributes:** Leptos's ability to perform server-side rendering means that components and their data are rendered into HTML on the server. If developers directly embed unsanitized user input or external data into the HTML structure within Leptos components during SSR, it creates an injection point.
    *   **Example:** A Leptos component displays a user's name fetched from a database. If the name contains a malicious `<script>` tag and is directly rendered without sanitization during SSR, this script will execute in the user's browser.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), leading to potential session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, and other client-side attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Server-Side Sanitization:**  Always sanitize user-provided or external data before embedding it into the HTML during server-side rendering. Use libraries specifically designed for HTML sanitization in Rust.
        *   **Context-Aware Output Encoding:** Ensure data is encoded appropriately for the HTML context where it's being used.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of successful XSS attacks.

*   **Attack Surface:** Server Function Argument Injection
    *   **Description:** When using Leptos's `#[server]` macro to define server functions, vulnerabilities can occur if input arguments are not properly validated and sanitized on the server-side before being used in database queries, system commands, or other sensitive operations.
    *   **How Leptos Contributes:** Leptos simplifies the creation of server-side logic callable from the client through the `#[server]` macro. This direct exposure of backend logic to client-provided arguments necessitates careful validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks.
    *   **Example:** A server function, defined with `#[server]`, takes a `user_id` as an argument to fetch user data from a database. If this `user_id` is directly used in a SQL query without sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious SQL code (SQL injection) to access or modify unauthorized data.
    *   **Impact:**  SQL injection, command injection, or other forms of code injection, leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, and potential system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Server-Side Input Validation:** Implement robust validation on all input parameters to server functions, checking data types, formats, and ranges.
        *   **Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements:** Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases to prevent SQL injection.
        *   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize input data to remove or escape potentially harmful characters before using it in sensitive operations.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure server functions operate with the minimum necessary privileges.

*   **Attack Surface:** Server Function Authorization Bypass
    *   **Description:**  If server functions defined with `#[server]` are not properly protected with authentication and authorization checks, attackers can potentially invoke them directly, bypassing intended access controls.
    *   **How Leptos Contributes:** The `#[server]` macro in Leptos provides a mechanism to expose server-side functions for client-side invocation. The framework itself does not enforce authorization, making it the developer's responsibility to implement these checks within the server function logic.
    *   **Example:** A server function, defined with `#[server]`, allows users to delete their account. If this function lacks proper authorization checks, any authenticated user (or even an unauthenticated attacker if the function is exposed without authentication) could potentially delete other users' accounts by directly calling the function with a different user ID.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data or functionality, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, and privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Implement Authentication:** Ensure users are properly authenticated before allowing access to server functions.
        *   **Implement Authorization:**  Within server functions, verify that the authenticated user has the necessary permissions to perform the requested action.
        *   **Use Leptos Context for Authentication State:** Leverage Leptos's context API to manage and access authentication state within server functions.
        *   **Consider Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement RBAC to manage user permissions effectively.
