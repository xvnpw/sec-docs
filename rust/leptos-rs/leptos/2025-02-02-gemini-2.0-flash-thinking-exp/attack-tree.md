## Attack Tree Path: [Attack Goal: [CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Leptos Application [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/attack_goal__critical_node__compromise_leptos_application__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the ultimate objective of the attacker. Success means achieving unauthorized access, data manipulation, service disruption, or other forms of compromise within the Leptos application and potentially its underlying systems.
*   **Why Critical:**  Represents the complete failure of security measures, leading to potentially severe consequences for the application, its users, and the organization.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Client-Side Vulnerabilities (Browser-Based Attacks) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node___high_risk_path__exploit_client-side_vulnerabilities__browser-based_attacks___critic_f516a078.md)

*   **Description:** This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities that reside within the client-side code of the Leptos application, executed in the user's web browser. These attacks target the user's browser environment directly.
*   **Why High-Risk and Critical:** Client-side vulnerabilities, especially XSS, are consistently ranked among the most prevalent and impactful web application security risks. They are often easier to exploit compared to server-side or build process attacks and can directly compromise user sessions and data.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH] Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node___high_risk_path__cross-site_scripting__xss___critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** XSS vulnerabilities allow attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code into web pages viewed by other users. This injected script executes in the user's browser within the application's context.
*   **Why High-Risk and Critical:** XSS is a highly versatile attack vector. It can be used for:
    *   Session hijacking (stealing cookies and session tokens).
    *   Account takeover (performing actions as the victim user).
    *   Data theft (accessing sensitive information displayed on the page).
    *   Malware distribution (redirecting users to malicious sites).
    *   Defacement (altering the appearance of the web page).

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH] Inject Malicious Script [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node___high_risk_path__inject_malicious_script__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the core action required to exploit an XSS vulnerability. The attacker needs to find a way to insert their malicious JavaScript code into the application's output.
*   **Why Critical:** Successful script injection is the prerequisite for all XSS-based attacks. Without injecting the script, the XSS vulnerability cannot be exploited.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Stored XSS (Backend Interaction via Leptos)](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__stored_xss__backend_interaction_via_leptos_.md)

*   **Description:** Stored XSS occurs when the malicious script is permanently stored on the server (e.g., in a database, file system) and is served to users when they request the affected page. This often happens when user-provided content is not properly sanitized before being stored and later displayed. In the context of Leptos, this could involve a Leptos application interacting with a backend that stores user data.
*   **Why High-Risk:** Stored XSS is generally considered more dangerous than reflected XSS because:
    *   It affects all users who view the compromised content.
    *   It can persist for a long time, potentially affecting many users over time.
    *   Attackers do not need to trick users into clicking a malicious link; the vulnerability is triggered automatically when users access the page.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH] Script Execution in User Context [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node___high_risk_path__script_execution_in_user_context__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the consequence of successful script injection. Once the malicious script is injected and executed in the user's browser, it runs with the same privileges and context as the application itself and the user currently logged in.
*   **Why Critical:** Script execution in the user's context is the point where the attacker gains control within the user's browser. This allows them to perform malicious actions as described in point 3 (XSS description), leading to critical impacts like account takeover and data theft.
