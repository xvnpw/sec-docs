# Attack Surface Analysis for leptos-rs/leptos

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Client-Side Rendering](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_client-side_rendering.md)

*   **Description:** Injecting malicious scripts into web pages, executed by other users' browsers, due to improper handling of user-provided data during client-side rendering.
*   **Leptos Contribution:** If Leptos components dynamically render user input on the client-side without proper sanitization, XSS vulnerabilities can occur. Leptos's reactivity system and component model can lead to client-side DOM manipulation based on user data if not handled carefully.
*   **Example:** A user submits a comment containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`. If this comment is rendered directly into the DOM by a Leptos component without escaping, the script will execute in other users' browsers viewing the comment.
*   **Impact:** Account compromise, data theft, malware distribution, website defacement.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Context-Aware Output Encoding:**  Use Leptos's built-in mechanisms or libraries to properly encode user input before rendering it in HTML contexts. Ensure encoding is context-aware (HTML escaping, JavaScript escaping, URL escaping, etc.).
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  CSP can help mitigate the impact of XSS by restricting the sources from which scripts can be executed.
    *   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Identify and fix potential XSS vulnerabilities in client-side rendering logic.

## Attack Surface: [Server Function Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/server_function_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  A broad category encompassing vulnerabilities within Leptos server functions, which expose server-side logic to the client. This is a direct attack surface introduced by Leptos's full-stack capabilities.
*   **Leptos Contribution:** Leptos server functions are a core feature that directly connects client-side interactions to server-side logic, creating a significant attack surface if not secured properly. The ease of defining and calling server functions in Leptos can inadvertently lead to security oversights if developers are not vigilant.

    *   **2.1 Serialization/Deserialization Issues:**
        *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from insecure handling of data serialization and deserialization between client and server functions.
        *   **Leptos Contribution:** Leptos handles serialization and deserialization for server function arguments and return values. If not implemented securely within Leptos or if user code introduces vulnerabilities during custom serialization, issues can arise.
        *   **Example:** Deserializing untrusted data in a server function without proper validation could lead to code execution or other vulnerabilities if the deserialization process is flawed.
        *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), data corruption, denial of service.
        *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
            *   **Input Validation:** Thoroughly validate all data received by server functions *before* deserialization and processing.
            *   **Secure Serialization Libraries:** Use secure and well-vetted serialization libraries if custom serialization is needed. Rely on Leptos's built-in serialization where possible and understand its security implications.
            *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Minimize the privileges of the server function execution environment.

    *   **2.2 Authentication and Authorization Bypass:**
        *   **Description:** Lack of or flawed authentication and authorization checks in server functions, allowing unauthorized access.
        *   **Leptos Contribution:** Leptos provides the mechanism for server functions, but *enforcing* authentication and authorization is the developer's responsibility.  If developers fail to implement these checks within server functions, it becomes a direct Leptos-related vulnerability due to the framework's encouragement of this client-server interaction pattern.
        *   **Example:** A server function intended for administrators lacks authentication. An attacker can directly call this function from the client and perform administrative actions.
        *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, data breaches, unauthorized actions, privilege escalation.
        *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
            *   **Implement Authentication:**  Use robust authentication mechanisms *within* server functions to verify user identity before allowing access. Leptos provides context and tools to facilitate this, but developers must implement the logic.
            *   **Implement Authorization:** Enforce authorization checks *within* server functions to ensure users only access resources and actions they are permitted to.
            *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant server functions only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks.

    *   **2.3 Injection Attacks in Server Functions:**
        *   **Description:**  Injection vulnerabilities (SQL injection, command injection, etc.) in server functions due to improper handling of user-provided data when interacting with backend systems.
        *   **Leptos Contribution:** Leptos server functions facilitate direct interaction with backend systems. If developers don't sanitize user input within these functions, the framework's ease of backend access contributes to the attack surface.
        *   **Example:** A server function constructs a SQL query using user input without proper sanitization. An attacker can inject malicious SQL code to manipulate the database.
        *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, unauthorized access to backend systems, potential for remote code execution on the server.
        *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
            *   **Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements:** Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for database interactions to prevent SQL injection.
            *   **Input Sanitization and Validation:** Sanitize and validate all user input received by server functions *before* using it in backend system interactions.
            *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Minimize the privileges of the database user or system account used by server functions.
