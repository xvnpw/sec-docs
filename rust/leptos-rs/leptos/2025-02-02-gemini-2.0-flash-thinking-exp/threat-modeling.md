# Threat Model Analysis for leptos-rs/leptos

## Threat: [Client-Side Logic Bugs Leading to Data Exposure](./threats/client-side_logic_bugs_leading_to_data_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker exploits logic flaws within Leptos component's Rust/WASM code. By manipulating client-side state or interactions, they can trigger unintended component behavior, revealing sensitive data meant to be client-side only or bypassing intended access controls.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive user data or application secrets stored or processed client-side by Leptos components.
*   **Affected Leptos Component:** Leptos Components (logic and state management), WASM module.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Intensive testing of Leptos components, focusing on state transitions and data handling logic.
    *   Security-focused code reviews of client-side Leptos components, especially those managing sensitive data.
    *   Minimize client-side storage of sensitive data within Leptos components.

## Threat: [Server-Side HTML Injection via Unsafe SSR Data Handling](./threats/server-side_html_injection_via_unsafe_ssr_data_handling.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker injects malicious HTML/JavaScript through data rendered server-side by Leptos during SSR. If Leptos SSR logic doesn't properly sanitize data before embedding it in HTML, the injected code executes in user browsers, leading to XSS.
*   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Full compromise of user session, data theft, website defacement possible due to injected JavaScript executing in user context.
*   **Affected Leptos Component:** Leptos Server-Side Rendering (SSR) logic, Leptos Templating system during SSR.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly sanitize and escape all dynamic data rendered server-side within Leptos SSR, especially user-provided or external data.
    *   Utilize Leptos's safe HTML rendering mechanisms and avoid manual string manipulation for HTML in SSR contexts.
    *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to limit the impact of potential XSS.

## Threat: [Server-Side Resource Exhaustion during SSR](./threats/server-side_resource_exhaustion_during_ssr.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker sends crafted requests to trigger resource-intensive Leptos SSR operations. By exploiting inefficient rendering paths or causing excessive server-side computations during SSR, they can exhaust server resources, leading to Denial of Service.
*   **Impact:** Server-side Denial of Service (DoS). Application unavailability for all users due to server overload caused by malicious SSR requests targeting Leptos rendering.
*   **Affected Leptos Component:** Leptos Server-Side Rendering (SSR) engine, Server infrastructure handling Leptos SSR requests.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement rate limiting and request throttling specifically for Leptos SSR endpoints.
    *   Optimize Leptos server-side rendering code for performance and resource efficiency.
    *   Monitor server resources during SSR and implement alerts for unusual resource consumption.
    *   Consider caching strategies for rendered content to reduce SSR load on repeated requests.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Leptos Framework Code](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_leptos_framework_code.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker exploits undiscovered security vulnerabilities within the core Leptos framework itself. Bugs in Leptos's reactive system, routing, or component handling could be exploited for various attacks, potentially including remote code execution or significant application compromise.
*   **Impact:** Critical security vulnerabilities affecting all applications using the vulnerable Leptos version. Potential for remote code execution, data breaches, or widespread application compromise depending on the specific framework vulnerability.
*   **Affected Leptos Component:** Leptos Framework Core (reactive system, routing, component lifecycle, etc.).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Stay vigilant for Leptos security advisories and promptly update to patched versions.
    *   Monitor Leptos project's security channels and community discussions for vulnerability reports.
    *   Contribute to Leptos security by reporting any potential vulnerabilities discovered.

## Threat: [Insecure Defaults or Misconfigurations in Leptos Applications (High Severity)](./threats/insecure_defaults_or_misconfigurations_in_leptos_applications__high_severity_.md)

*   **Description:** Developers introduce high-severity security flaws by misconfiguring Leptos features or failing to secure Leptos-specific functionalities. Examples include insecure server-side action handling leading to authorization bypasses, or exposing sensitive server-side endpoints due to incorrect Leptos routing setup.
*   **Impact:** High impact vulnerabilities like authorization bypass, access control failures, or exposure of sensitive server-side functionality due to misconfiguration of Leptos features.
*   **Affected Leptos Component:** Leptos Application Configuration, Server-side Actions, Leptos Routing, Security middleware integration with Leptos.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly review Leptos documentation and security best practices for all Leptos features used.
    *   Implement security configuration reviews specifically focused on Leptos application setup and feature usage.
    *   Use static analysis and linters to detect potential misconfigurations in Leptos application code and configuration.
    *   Follow least privilege principles when configuring server-side actions and routing within Leptos.
