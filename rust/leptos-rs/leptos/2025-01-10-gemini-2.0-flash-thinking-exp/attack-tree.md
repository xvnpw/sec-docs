## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Exploit Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Vulnerabilities -> SSR Injection -> Inject Malicious Code via Unsanitized Input in SSR Context -> Leverage Leptos's HTML macro without proper escaping -> Inject script tags or HTML attributes leading to XSS](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_exploit_server-side_rendering__ssr__vulnerabilities_-_ssr_injection_-_inject_malici_693a7ede.md)

- Attack Vector: Server-Side Rendering Injection leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- Description: An attacker exploits the server-side rendering process by injecting malicious code through unsanitized user input. Leptos's `view!` macro, if used to directly embed unsanitized input into the HTML structure, becomes a prime target. By injecting script tags or HTML attributes containing JavaScript, the attacker can execute arbitrary code in the victim's browser when the page is rendered.
- Impact: Account takeover, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, data theft, defacement.
- Mitigation:
    - Always sanitize user input before embedding it into HTML during SSR.
    - Utilize Leptos's built-in escaping mechanisms within the `view!` macro.
    - Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to further restrict the execution of inline scripts.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Exploit SSR and Client-Side Communication Vulnerabilities -> Data Tampering during Transfer](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_exploit_ssr_and_client-side_communication_vulnerabilities_-_data_tampering_during_t_3880b362.md)

- Attack Vector: Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack leading to data manipulation.
- Description: An attacker intercepts communication between the client and the server. If HTTPS is not used, the attacker can read and modify data being transmitted. This allows the attacker to tamper with data sent from the server to the client, potentially altering application state, displaying false information, or bypassing security checks.
- Impact: Data manipulation, information disclosure, bypassing security controls, application malfunction.
- Mitigation:
    - Enforce HTTPS for all communication between the client and the server.
    - Implement certificate pinning for enhanced security against certificate-based attacks.
    - Use secure cookies with the `Secure` and `HttpOnly` flags.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node 1: Exploit Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_1_exploit_server-side_rendering__ssr__vulnerabilities.md)

- Attack Vector: Exploiting weaknesses in the server-side rendering process.
- Description: This node represents a broad category of attacks targeting the server-side rendering functionality of the Leptos application. Successful exploitation can lead to various issues, including code injection, information disclosure, and denial of service.
- Impact: Wide range of impacts depending on the specific vulnerability, including XSS, information disclosure, and service disruption.
- Mitigation:
    - Implement robust input validation and output encoding.
    - Regularly audit server-side code for potential vulnerabilities.
    - Keep server-side dependencies updated.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node 2: SSR Injection](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_2_ssr_injection.md)

- Attack Vector: Injecting malicious code into the server-rendered HTML.
- Description: This node specifically targets the injection of malicious code during the server-side rendering phase. Successful injection can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
- Impact: Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser, leading to account takeover, data theft, etc.
- Mitigation:
    - Thoroughly sanitize all user-provided data before including it in the rendered HTML.
    - Utilize Leptos's built-in escaping features.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node 3: Inject Malicious Code via Unsanitized Input in SSR Context](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_3_inject_malicious_code_via_unsanitized_input_in_ssr_context.md)

- Attack Vector: Failure to sanitize user input during server-side rendering.
- Description: This node highlights the critical step where unsanitized user input is incorporated into the server-rendered HTML, making the application vulnerable to injection attacks.
- Impact: Enables various injection attacks, primarily XSS.
- Mitigation:
    - Implement strict input validation and sanitization on the server-side.
    - Use output encoding to prevent the interpretation of user input as code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node 4: Leverage Leptos's HTML macro without proper escaping](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_4_leverage_leptos's_html_macro_without_proper_escaping.md)

- Attack Vector: Misuse of Leptos's `view!` macro for embedding unsanitized input.
- Description: This node focuses on the specific Leptos feature that can introduce vulnerabilities if not used correctly. Directly embedding unsanitized data within the `view!` macro can lead to XSS.
- Impact: XSS vulnerabilities.
- Mitigation:
    - Always use Leptos's escaping mechanisms when embedding dynamic content within the `view!` macro.
    - Educate developers on the secure usage of Leptos's templating features.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node 5: Inject script tags or HTML attributes leading to XSS](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_5_inject_script_tags_or_html_attributes_leading_to_xss.md)

- Attack Vector: The direct consequence of successful SSR injection.
- Description: This node represents the successful injection of malicious script tags or HTML attributes containing JavaScript, leading to the execution of arbitrary code in the user's browser.
- Impact: Account takeover, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, data theft.
- Mitigation:
    - Prevent SSR injection through proper input sanitization and output encoding at previous stages.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node 6: Insecure Handling of Server-Side Data on Client](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_6_insecure_handling_of_server-side_data_on_client.md)

- Attack Vector: Exposing sensitive data on the client-side.
- Description: This node highlights the risk of exposing sensitive information in the initial HTML payload (during SSR) or in subsequent API responses without proper protection.
- Impact: Information disclosure, potential for further attacks if exposed data is sensitive (e.g., API keys).
- Mitigation:
    - Avoid including sensitive data in the initial HTML payload if possible.
    - Ensure API responses containing sensitive data are protected by authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    - Implement proper sanitization and encoding of data before sending it to the client to prevent interpretation as code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node 7: Sensitive data exposed in the initial HTML payload or subsequent API responses](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_7_sensitive_data_exposed_in_the_initial_html_payload_or_subsequent_api_responses.md)

- Attack Vector: Direct exposure of sensitive information.
- Description: This node represents the state where sensitive data is present in the client-side source code or network responses, making it accessible to attackers.
- Impact: Information disclosure, potential compromise of user accounts or the application itself.
- Mitigation:
    - Review server-side code to identify and eliminate unnecessary inclusion of sensitive data in client-side responses.
    - Implement appropriate access controls and authentication for API endpoints.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node 8: Exploit lack of proper sanitization or encoding of server-side data before sending to the client](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_8_exploit_lack_of_proper_sanitization_or_encoding_of_server-side_data_before_sending_t_e4f1eda1.md)

- Attack Vector: Failure to protect data before sending it to the client.
- Description: This node highlights the lack of proper security measures when transmitting data from the server to the client, potentially leading to vulnerabilities like XSS if data is rendered without proper encoding.
- Impact: Information disclosure, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- Mitigation:
    - Always sanitize and encode data on the server-side before sending it to the client, especially if it will be rendered in the browser.
    - Use context-aware output encoding to prevent interpretation of data as executable code.
