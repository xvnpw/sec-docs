# Threat Model Analysis for leptos-rs/leptos

## Threat: [HTML Injection during Server-Side Rendering (SSR)](./threats/html_injection_during_server-side_rendering__ssr_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code into the server-rendered HTML if user-provided data is not properly sanitized *within the Leptos rendering process*. This could be achieved by submitting crafted input that is then used by Leptos components to dynamically generate the initial HTML on the server.
*   **Impact:** Successful injection can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser, steal cookies, redirect users, or deface the website. This occurs during the initial server render, potentially before client-side defenses are active.
*   **Affected Component:** `leptos::ssr` module, specifically the functions and macros used for rendering components to HTML strings on the server (e.g., `view!` macro in SSR context).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly sanitize all user-provided data *before* it is used within Leptos components during server-side rendering.
    *   Utilize Leptos's mechanisms for safe HTML rendering, ensuring proper escaping of user input within the `view!` macro or other rendering functions.
    *   Employ Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of successful XSS.

## Threat: [Exposure of Server-Side Secrets during SSR](./threats/exposure_of_server-side_secrets_during_ssr.md)

*   **Description:**  Developers might unintentionally include sensitive server-side data (API keys, database credentials, internal URLs, etc.) within the HTML rendered during SSR *due to how Leptos components are structured and how data is passed during the SSR process*. This could occur if server-only state or configuration is mistakenly passed as props to components that are rendered on the server, leading to its inclusion in the initial HTML. An attacker could inspect the page source to find these secrets.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of server-side secrets can lead to severe consequences, including unauthorized access to backend systems, data breaches, and the ability for attackers to impersonate the application.
*   **Affected Component:** `leptos::ssr` module and the component model itself, specifically how data is passed and managed during server-side rendering of components.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully manage server-side state and ensure that only necessary, non-sensitive data is passed as props to Leptos components during SSR.
    *   Avoid directly embedding sensitive information within component props or rendering logic used in the SSR context.
    *   Utilize environment variables and secure configuration management practices to handle sensitive data, ensuring it's not directly accessible during the SSR phase.
    *   Regularly review the rendered HTML source code and the component structure to identify any accidental exposure of secrets.

## Threat: [Rehydration Mismatches Leading to Client-Side Vulnerabilities](./threats/rehydration_mismatches_leading_to_client-side_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** If the client-side application state after hydration doesn't perfectly match the server-rendered HTML *due to inconsistencies in how Leptos handles the transition from SSR to CSR*, it can lead to unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities. For example, event listeners might be attached to incorrect elements because Leptos's reconciliation process is flawed, data bindings might be misaligned due to differences in state representation, or client-side logic might operate on outdated information based on the initial server render. An attacker could exploit these mismatches to trigger unintended actions or bypass security checks.
*   **Impact:**  Rehydration mismatches can lead to logic flaws, broken functionality, and potentially even client-side XSS if server-rendered attributes are incorrectly interpreted or manipulated during the Leptos hydration process. This can be difficult to debug and can create unpredictable application behavior.
*   **Affected Component:** The Leptos hydration process, involving the interaction between the `leptos::ssr` module and the client-side rendering engine (`leptos::mount_to_body` and related functions).
*   **Risk Severity:** Medium *(downgraded as direct XSS is less likely, but logic flaws are still a concern)*
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure strict consistency between server-side rendering logic and client-side component definitions within Leptos.
    *   Thoroughly test the hydration process across different browsers and network conditions, paying close attention to any warnings or errors reported by Leptos during hydration.
    *   Leverage Leptos's built-in mechanisms for managing hydration and handling potential inconsistencies.
    *   Implement robust error handling to gracefully manage potential hydration failures and prevent unexpected application behavior.

## Threat: [Manipulation of Signals and Reactive State Leading to Privilege Escalation](./threats/manipulation_of_signals_and_reactive_state_leading_to_privilege_escalation.md)

*   **Description:** While not a direct vulnerability *in Leptos's core*, improper management of Leptos's reactive signals and state *within the application's components* can lead to vulnerabilities. For instance, if a signal representing user roles or permissions is incorrectly updated or manipulated due to a logic error in a Leptos component, it could grant unauthorized access to features or data. An attacker might exploit race conditions or logic flaws in state updates within the reactive system to elevate their privileges.
*   **Impact:** Successful manipulation of reactive state can lead to privilege escalation, allowing attackers to perform actions they are not authorized to perform, access sensitive data, or compromise the integrity of the application.
*   **Affected Component:**  Leptos's reactivity system, including signals created with `create_signal`, derived signals, and the `update` mechanism, as used within application components.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully design and implement state management logic within Leptos components, ensuring that state updates are performed securely and predictably.
    *   Enforce access controls and validation when updating signals that control critical application behavior or user permissions within component logic.
    *   Avoid complex and convoluted state update logic within Leptos components that could introduce race conditions or unexpected side effects.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) on Leptos Actions](./threats/cross-site_request_forgery__csrf__on_leptos_actions.md)

*   **Description:** If Leptos actions (server functions called from the client using the `#[server]` attribute) are not protected against CSRF, an attacker could trick a logged-in user into unknowingly submitting malicious actions on the application. This is typically done by embedding malicious requests that target the Leptos action endpoint in links or images on other websites.
*   **Impact:** Successful CSRF attacks can allow attackers to perform actions on behalf of the victim user, such as changing their profile information, making purchases, or performing other sensitive operations by invoking Leptos actions without the user's direct intent.
*   **Affected Component:** Leptos's action system, including functions defined with the `#[server]` attribute and the underlying mechanisms for handling and routing these action requests.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement CSRF protection mechanisms specifically for Leptos actions, such as using CSRF tokens that are included in action requests and validated on the server.
    *   Leptos provides mechanisms or integration points for CSRF protection middleware; ensure these are properly implemented and configured.
    *   Utilize the `SameSite` attribute for cookies to help mitigate CSRF attacks.
