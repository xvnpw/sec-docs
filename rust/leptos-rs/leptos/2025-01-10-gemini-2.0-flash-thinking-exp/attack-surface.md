# Attack Surface Analysis for leptos-rs/leptos

## Attack Surface: [Server Function Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/server_function_deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting flaws in how the server deserializes data sent from the client to server functions. Maliciously crafted data can lead to code execution or unexpected behavior on the server.
    *   **How Leptos Contributes:** Leptos's architecture heavily relies on server functions for client-server communication. The framework's use of `serde` for serialization and deserialization within these functions introduces this attack surface if not handled securely. Incorrect usage of `serde` or vulnerabilities within `serde` itself can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** A server function expects an integer but receives a complex, nested JSON object designed to exploit a `serde` bug, leading to a server crash or remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the server, denial of service, data corruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use the latest stable version of `serde` and review its security advisories.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization *before* deserialization within Leptos server functions.
        *   Consider using a schema validation library to enforce the expected data structure for data passed to Leptos server functions.
        *   Avoid deserializing untrusted data directly into complex objects within Leptos server functions without careful scrutiny.

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side Rendering (CSR) DOM-Based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_surfaces/client-side_rendering__csr__dom-based_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:** Injecting malicious scripts into the DOM through client-side rendering logic that doesn't properly sanitize data.
    *   **How Leptos Contributes:** Leptos's core mechanism involves dynamically updating the DOM based on reactive signals and component rendering. If developers directly embed unsanitized data (especially from user input or external sources) into the DOM within Leptos components, it creates a pathway for XSS.
    *   **Example:** A Leptos component displays a user's name fetched from an API. If the API returns a name containing a `<script>` tag, and the component directly renders this string, the script will be executed in the user's browser.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, information theft.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize Leptos's built-in mechanisms for escaping HTML content when rendering dynamic data within components.
        *   Sanitize user input on the client-side before it is used to update the DOM in Leptos components.
        *   Employ a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of successful XSS.
        *   Regularly audit Leptos components that handle and display user-generated or external data for potential XSS vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Server Function Input Validation Failures](./attack_surfaces/server_function_input_validation_failures.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting a lack of or insufficient validation of input data passed to server functions.
    *   **How Leptos Contributes:** Leptos server functions are the primary way for client-side code to interact with the server. The framework itself doesn't enforce input validation, making it the developer's responsibility to implement proper checks within these Leptos-defined functions.
    *   **Example:** A Leptos server function to update a user's profile doesn't validate the length of the "bio" field, allowing an attacker to submit an extremely long string, potentially causing database issues or denial of service on the server handling the Leptos application.
    *   **Impact:** Injection attacks (SQL, command), business logic bypass, data corruption, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation within each Leptos server function, checking data types, formats, lengths, and ranges.
        *   Use a validation library within the server-side logic of Leptos applications to streamline the validation process for server function inputs.
        *   Adopt a "deny by default" approach in Leptos server functions, only allowing explicitly validated input to be processed.
        *   Sanitize input within Leptos server functions to remove potentially harmful characters or code before further processing.

## Attack Surface: [Server Function Authorization and Authentication Bypass](./attack_surfaces/server_function_authorization_and_authentication_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Circumventing security checks to access or modify resources or perform actions without proper authorization.
    *   **How Leptos Contributes:**  Leptos provides the structure for defining server functions, but the authorization logic is implemented by the developer. If authorization checks are not correctly implemented or are missing within these Leptos server functions, it creates a direct vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** A Leptos server function to delete a user's account doesn't verify if the requesting user is an administrator or the owner of the account, allowing any authenticated user to delete arbitrary accounts through this Leptos-defined endpoint.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, privilege escalation, data manipulation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement a robust authentication and authorization system that integrates with your Leptos backend.
        *   Enforce authorization checks within each Leptos server function to verify the user's permissions before executing actions.
        *   Use established authorization patterns and libraries within your Leptos application's backend.
        *   Regularly review and audit the authorization logic implemented within your Leptos server functions.

## Attack Surface: [Server Function Data Exposure](./attack_surfaces/server_function_data_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Unintentionally revealing sensitive information through server function responses.
    *   **How Leptos Contributes:** Leptos server functions directly define the data returned to the client. If these functions are designed to return more data than necessary or include sensitive information, Leptos facilitates this exposure.
    *   **Example:** A Leptos server function to fetch user details returns the user's password hash along with their name and email, even though the client only needs the name and email, directly exposing the sensitive hash through the Leptos-defined API.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive personal information, API keys, internal system details.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully design Leptos server function responses to only include the necessary data.
        *   Avoid returning sensitive information in Leptos server function responses.
        *   Implement data transfer objects (DTOs) to explicitly define the data being sent by Leptos server functions.
        *   Review Leptos server function responses to ensure no sensitive data is inadvertently leaked.

## Attack Surface: [Hydration Issues Leading to XSS or State Injection](./attack_surfaces/hydration_issues_leading_to_xss_or_state_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from the process of hydrating server-rendered HTML on the client-side.
    *   **How Leptos Contributes:** Leptos's support for Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and subsequent client-side hydration introduces this attack surface. If the server-rendered HTML (generated by Leptos) contains unsanitized user data, or if the hydration process (managed by Leptos) is flawed, it can lead to XSS or the injection of malicious state.
    *   **Example:** A blog post title containing malicious script tags is rendered on the server by Leptos and sent to the client. During hydration, when Leptos makes the server-rendered content interactive, the script is executed. Alternatively, an attacker manipulates the initial server-rendered HTML (potentially before Leptos hydration) to inject malicious data that influences the client-side state after Leptos takes over.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting, manipulation of application state, potential for further attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure all user-provided data is properly sanitized before being included in server-rendered HTML generated by Leptos.
        *   Be cautious about relying solely on client-side sanitization when using Leptos's SSR features.
        *   Validate the integrity of the hydrated state to detect potential tampering during the Leptos hydration process.
        *   Utilize Leptos's recommended practices for safe SSR and hydration to minimize these risks.
