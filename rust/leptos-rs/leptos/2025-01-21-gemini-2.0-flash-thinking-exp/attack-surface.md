# Attack Surface Analysis for leptos-rs/leptos

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/server-side_rendering__ssr__deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities during server-side deserialization of data used for SSR. This can lead to severe consequences if untrusted, manipulated data is processed without proper validation.

*   **How Leptos Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Leptos's SSR mechanism relies on serializing and deserializing component state. If server-side components deserialize data from client-influenced sources (like cookies or headers) without rigorous validation, it creates a direct pathway for attackers to inject malicious payloads.

*   **Example:** A Leptos application uses SSR and deserializes user session data from a cookie. An attacker modifies their cookie to contain malicious serialized data. If the server-side deserialization process in Leptos components is vulnerable, this could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server.

*   **Impact:** **Critical**. Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server, full server compromise, data breach, denial of service.

*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation Post-Deserialization:**  Immediately after deserializing data on the server, implement *mandatory* and *strict* validation to ensure data integrity and type correctness.
    *   **Avoid Deserializing Untrusted Data Directly:**  Minimize or eliminate deserialization of data directly sourced from client-controlled inputs. If unavoidable, apply robust sanitization *before* deserialization and validation *after*.
    *   **Secure Deserialization Libraries and Practices:**  Utilize secure deserialization practices and libraries. Be extremely cautious with custom deserialization logic, as it is prone to errors.
    *   **Isolate SSR Processes:**  Consider isolating SSR processes to limit the blast radius in case of a deserialization exploit.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct frequent security audits specifically targeting SSR deserialization points in Leptos applications.

## Attack Surface: [Server Action Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/server_action_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting server actions by injecting malicious code or commands through user-provided input that is not adequately sanitized or validated.

*   **How Leptos Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Leptos Server Actions are Rust functions executed on the server to handle client requests. They are designed to process user input. If these actions lack proper input sanitization and validation, they become direct targets for injection attacks, a vulnerability directly related to how Leptos structures server-side logic.

*   **Example:** A Leptos server action takes user input to process a file path. Without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject path traversal characters (e.g., `../../`) to access or manipulate files outside the intended directory, or inject shell commands if the action interacts with the operating system shell.

*   **Impact:** **High** to **Critical**. Depending on the injection type: Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server, unauthorized data access, data modification, privilege escalation, denial of service.

*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory and Comprehensive Input Validation:** Implement *server-side* input validation for *every* server action parameter. Validate data type, format, length, allowed character sets, and business logic constraints. Client-side validation is insufficient.
    *   **Parameterized Queries and Prepared Statements (for Database Actions):**  *Always* use parameterized queries or prepared statements when server actions interact with databases to prevent SQL injection. Never construct SQL queries by directly concatenating user input.
    *   **Command Sanitization and Least Privilege (for System Commands):** If server actions execute system commands, rigorously sanitize all input used in command construction. Ideally, avoid executing system commands based on user input altogether. Run server actions with the minimum necessary privileges.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Actions:** Design server actions to operate with the minimum necessary permissions. Limit their access to system resources and data.
    *   **Regular Penetration Testing:** Conduct penetration testing specifically targeting server actions to identify and remediate injection vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side Logic Vulnerabilities Leading to Authorization Bypass or Data Exposure in Reactive Components](./attack_surfaces/client-side_logic_vulnerabilities_leading_to_authorization_bypass_or_data_exposure_in_reactive_compo_980e45ed.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting flaws in the client-side Rust/WASM logic within Leptos reactive components that can lead to unauthorized access to features or exposure of sensitive data, even if the core vulnerability is client-side.

*   **How Leptos Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Leptos's reactive system manages application state and UI updates on the client-side. Complex logic within components, especially around authorization or data handling, if flawed, can be exploited to bypass intended security measures *within the Leptos application's client-side logic*. This is directly tied to the framework's reactive programming model and component structure.

*   **Example:** A Leptos application uses client-side reactive signals to control access to certain UI elements or features based on user roles. A logic error in how these signals are derived or updated could be exploited to grant unauthorized access to restricted parts of the application, even if server-side authorization is intended to be the primary control. This could expose sensitive data rendered client-side or allow actions that should be restricted.

*   **Impact:** **High**. Authorization bypass, exposure of sensitive data on the client-side (which could then be exfiltrated or misused), unintended application behavior with security implications, potentially paving the way for further server-side exploitation if client-side bypass reveals server-side weaknesses.

*   **Risk Severity:** **High**

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Server-Side Authorization as Primary Control:**  *Never* rely solely on client-side logic for critical authorization decisions. Implement robust server-side authorization checks for all sensitive operations and data access. Client-side checks should be considered purely for UI/UX enhancement, not security.
    *   **Thorough Testing of Reactive Logic:**  Extensively test the reactive logic within Leptos components, particularly around authorization and data handling. Focus on edge cases and unexpected state transitions.
    *   **Formal Verification (where feasible):** For critical security-sensitive components, consider applying formal verification techniques to mathematically prove the correctness of the reactive logic.
    *   **Code Reviews with Security Focus:** Conduct code reviews specifically focused on identifying potential authorization bypass or data exposure vulnerabilities in client-side Leptos component logic.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege in Client-Side Logic:** Design client-side components to operate with the minimum necessary privileges and data access. Avoid exposing sensitive data unnecessarily on the client-side.
