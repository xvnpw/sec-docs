# Threat Model Analysis for leptos-rs/leptos

## Threat: [SSR Injection Vulnerabilities](./threats/ssr_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious code (e.g., JavaScript, HTML) into the server-rendered HTML if user-provided data is not properly sanitized during Server-Side Rendering (SSR). This can be achieved by manipulating inputs to server functions or data used in components rendered on the server. The injected code executes in a user's browser upon page load.
*   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement, or arbitrary code execution within the user's browser context.
*   **Leptos Component Affected:** Server Functions (`#[server]` macro), Components rendered during SSR, `render_to_string` function.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize and escape all user-provided data before incorporating it into server-rendered HTML. Utilize Rust libraries designed for safe HTML escaping.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a restrictive CSP to control resource loading sources, significantly limiting the impact of successful XSS attacks.
    *   **Regular Code Reviews:** Conduct focused code reviews of server-side rendering logic, especially within server functions and component rendering, to proactively identify potential injection points.
    *   **Template Security:** Leverage Leptos' component system for HTML generation and avoid manual string manipulation, which increases the risk of injection vulnerabilities in SSR contexts.

## Threat: [Server Function Injection Attacks](./threats/server_function_injection_attacks.md)

*   **Description:**  If server functions lack proper input validation and sanitization, attackers can inject malicious commands or code through client-supplied data. This can lead to command injection, database injection (if the server function interacts with a database), or other server-side vulnerabilities. Attackers craft malicious requests to server functions, exploiting the absence of robust input validation on the server.
*   **Impact:** Server-Side Code Execution, potentially allowing attackers to gain full control of the server, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, denial of service, or privilege escalation.
*   **Leptos Component Affected:** Server Functions (`#[server]` macro), Function arguments passed from client to server.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory Input Validation:** Implement rigorous input validation for all parameters received by server functions. Validate data types, formats, lengths, and acceptable value ranges on the server-side.
    *   **Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements:**  When server functions interact with databases, use parameterized queries or prepared statements exclusively to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Secure Command Execution (Minimize Use):** If server functions must execute system commands, sanitize and validate all inputs meticulously to prevent command injection. Ideally, avoid executing system commands from server functions altogether.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure server functions operate with the minimum necessary privileges to constrain the potential damage from successful injection attacks.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Consider deploying a WAF to filter and block malicious requests targeting server functions, adding an extra layer of defense.

## Threat: [Server Function Authorization Bypass](./threats/server_function_authorization_bypass.md)

*   **Description:**  If authorization checks are either missing or incorrectly implemented within server functions, unauthorized users can gain access and execute these functions. Attackers can circumvent client-side UI restrictions or directly invoke server functions without proper authentication or authorization, potentially exploiting weaknesses in authorization logic.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Server-Side Logic and Data, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, privilege escalation, or unauthorized actions within the application.
*   **Leptos Component Affected:** Server Functions (`#[server]` macro), Authorization logic within server functions, Leptos Context (for managing authentication/authorization state).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Robust Authorization Checks:** Implement mandatory and robust authorization checks within each server function to strictly verify user permissions before executing any sensitive operations.
    *   **Centralized Authorization Mechanism:** Employ a centralized authorization system or library to enforce consistent authorization policies across all server functions, simplifying management and reducing errors.
    *   **Authentication Middleware:** Implement authentication middleware to verify user identity before requests are routed to server functions, ensuring only authenticated users can access them.
    *   **Regular Security Audits of Authorization Logic:** Conduct frequent security audits specifically focused on server function authorization logic to identify and rectify any weaknesses or potential bypasses.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Authorization):** Grant users only the minimum necessary permissions required to access and execute server functions, minimizing the impact of potential authorization bypass vulnerabilities.
