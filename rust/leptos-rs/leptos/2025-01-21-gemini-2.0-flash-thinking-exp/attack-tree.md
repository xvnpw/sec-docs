## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Vulnerabilities -> SSR Injection Attacks -> Inject Malicious Payload](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploit_server-side_rendering__ssr__vulnerabilities_-_ssr_injection_attacks_-_injec_2d2ecbe1.md)

- **Attack Vector:** Attackers identify and exploit injection points in SSR components where user-controlled data is rendered without proper sanitization. They inject malicious payloads (JavaScript, HTML, or potentially server-side code if applicable).
- **Potential Impact:** Client-Side XSS (allowing client-side code execution, session hijacking, defacement) and potentially Server-Side Code Execution (allowing full server compromise, data breach, data manipulation).
- **Actionable Insights:**
    - Implement strict input sanitization and output encoding for all user-controlled data rendered in SSR components.
    - Utilize Leptos's built-in mechanisms for safe HTML rendering.
    - Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS impact.
    - Conduct regular code reviews and security testing of SSR components.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Vulnerabilities -> SSR Denial of Service (DoS) -> Trigger Resource-Intensive SSR Requests](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploit_server-side_rendering__ssr__vulnerabilities_-_ssr_denial_of_service__dos__-_8cc4b528.md)

- **Attack Vector:** Attackers identify SSR endpoints that are resource-intensive due to complex components or inefficient data fetching. They then flood these endpoints with requests to overload the server.
- **Potential Impact:** Server Overload, Application Unavailability, Denial of Service for legitimate users.
- **Actionable Insights:**
    - Optimize SSR component performance and data fetching.
    - Implement caching mechanisms for SSR output.
    - Implement rate limiting and request throttling to prevent DoS attacks.
    - Monitor server resources during SSR to detect and mitigate DoS attempts.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Leptos Form Handling & Server Actions Vulnerabilities -> Server Action Injection -> Inject Malicious Payload via Form Input](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploit_leptos_form_handling_&_server_actions_vulnerabilities_-_server_action_injec_037db360.md)

- **Attack Vector:** Attackers identify server actions that do not properly sanitize user inputs. They inject malicious payloads (SQL injection, command injection, etc.) via form inputs submitted to these server actions.
- **Potential Impact:** Server-Side Code Execution (allowing full server compromise), Data Breach (access to sensitive database data), Data Manipulation (modifying or deleting data).
- **Actionable Insights:**
    - Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all server action inputs.
    - Use parameterized queries or ORMs to prevent SQL injection.
    - Avoid executing system commands based on user input.
    - Apply the principle of least privilege to server actions.
    - Conduct regular security audits of server actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Leptos Routing Vulnerabilities -> Route Parameter Manipulation -> Manipulate Route Parameters](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploit_leptos_routing_vulnerabilities_-_route_parameter_manipulation_-_manipulate__696921f1.md)

- **Attack Vector:** Attackers identify routes that use parameters to access resources without proper validation and authorization. They manipulate route parameters (e.g., changing IDs, path traversal sequences) to access unauthorized resources.
- **Potential Impact:** Unauthorized Access to Resources (accessing data or functionalities not intended for the user), Data Breach (accessing sensitive data through IDOR or path traversal).
- **Actionable Insights:**
    - Implement robust validation and sanitization for all route parameters.
    - Implement authorization checks to ensure users are allowed to access resources based on route parameters.
    - Avoid direct object references in routes if possible; use opaque identifiers or access control mechanisms.
    - Regularly review route parameter handling logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Leptos Routing Vulnerabilities -> Insecure Route Configuration -> Access Misconfigured Routes](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploit_leptos_routing_vulnerabilities_-_insecure_route_configuration_-_access_misc_dbdcd022.md)

- **Attack Vector:** Attackers discover misconfigured routes that expose sensitive parts of the application (admin panels, debugging endpoints, internal APIs). They directly access these misconfigured routes.
- **Potential Impact:** Unauthorized Access (to admin functionalities, internal data), Privilege Escalation (gaining admin privileges through exposed admin panels).
- **Actionable Insights:**
    - Implement secure route configuration, ensuring only intended endpoints are publicly accessible.
    - Restrict access to sensitive routes using authentication and authorization.
    - Regularly review route configurations for misconfigurations and accidental exposure of sensitive routes.
    - Follow the principle of least privilege for route access.
