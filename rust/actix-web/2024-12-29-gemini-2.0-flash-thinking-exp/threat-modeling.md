### Actix Web High and Critical Threats

This list details high and critical threats that directly involve the Actix Web framework.

*   **Threat:** Large Request Body Denial of Service
    *   **Description:** An attacker sends an extremely large HTTP request body to the server. Actix Web attempts to process this, potentially consuming excessive server resources (memory, CPU).
    *   **Impact:** The server becomes unresponsive, preventing legitimate users from accessing the application. This can lead to service disruption and potential financial loss.
    *   **Affected Component:** `HttpServer` (specifically the request body handling).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure the `HttpServer`'s `max_body_size` limit to restrict the maximum allowed request body size.

*   **Threat:** Header Injection leading to HTTP Response Splitting
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a request containing malicious data that, when used to set response headers by the application, injects newline characters (`\r\n`). This allows the attacker to add arbitrary headers and potentially a new HTTP response.
    *   **Impact:** This can lead to various attacks, including:
        *   **Cache Poisoning:**  The attacker's injected response might be cached by intermediaries, serving malicious content to other users.
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  Injecting headers that force the browser to interpret the subsequent content as HTML, allowing execution of malicious scripts.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Application logic interacting with Actix Web's response header setting mechanisms.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize Actix Web's built-in mechanisms for setting headers safely, which often handle escaping and prevent injection.

*   **Threat:** Path Traversal via Improper Route Handling
    *   **Description:** An attacker manipulates URL path parameters or segments in a way that bypasses intended access controls and allows access to files or resources outside the intended application scope.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Access to Sensitive Files:**  Attackers could read configuration files, source code, or other sensitive data stored on the server.
        *   **Information Disclosure:**  Exposure of confidential information.
    *   **Affected Component:** `actix_web::web::Path` extraction and Actix Web's routing mechanism.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use explicit and restrictive route definitions within Actix Web.

*   **Threat:** Malicious or Vulnerable Middleware
    *   **Description:**  Introducing third-party or custom middleware with security vulnerabilities can expose the application to various attacks.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Information Disclosure:** Middleware might log sensitive data or leak it through error messages.
        *   **Authentication/Authorization Bypass:** Flawed middleware might fail to properly authenticate or authorize requests.
        *   **Denial of Service:** Inefficient or resource-intensive middleware can slow down or crash the application.
    *   **Affected Component:** `actix_web::middleware` and the Actix Web middleware execution pipeline.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly vet and audit all middleware used in the application.
        *   Keep middleware dependencies up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.

*   **Threat:** Middleware Ordering Issues leading to Security Bypass
    *   **Description:** The order in which middleware is applied is crucial. Incorrect ordering can lead to security vulnerabilities by allowing requests to bypass intended security checks.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Authentication/Authorization Bypass:** Applying an authorization middleware after a middleware that modifies the request in a way that bypasses the authorization check.
    *   **Affected Component:** `actix_web::App` middleware registration order.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully plan and document the intended order of middleware execution within Actix Web.

*   **Threat:** WebSocket Frame Injection
    *   **Description:** If the application using Actix Web doesn't properly validate and sanitize data received over WebSocket connections, attackers can inject malicious frames.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Command Injection:** If WebSocket messages are interpreted as commands, attackers could execute arbitrary commands on the server.
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (WebSocket-based):** Injecting malicious scripts that are executed in the context of other connected clients.
        *   **Denial of Service:** Sending malformed or excessively large WebSocket frames to overwhelm the server.
    *   **Affected Component:** `actix_web::web::Payload` (for receiving data in WebSocket handlers).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all data received over WebSockets within Actix Web handlers.

*   **Threat:** Lack of Proper Authentication/Authorization for WebSockets
    *   **Description:** If WebSocket connections managed by Actix Web are not properly authenticated and authorized, unauthorized users could connect and interact with the application.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Data Breach:** Accessing sensitive data transmitted over WebSockets.
        *   **Unauthorized Actions:** Performing actions on behalf of legitimate users.
    *   **Affected Component:** Actix Web's WebSocket handling mechanisms and application-defined authentication/authorization logic.
