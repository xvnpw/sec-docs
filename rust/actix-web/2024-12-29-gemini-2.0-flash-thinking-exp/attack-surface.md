Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving Actix Web, with high or critical risk severity:

*   **Large Request Headers:**
    *   **Description:** An attacker sends HTTP requests with excessively large headers.
    *   **How Actix Web Contributes:** Actix Web needs to parse these headers. If not configured with limits, it can consume excessive memory and processing time during parsing.
    *   **Example:** Sending a request with hundreds or thousands of custom headers, each containing a large amount of data.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to resource exhaustion.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Configure `HttpServer` with appropriate limits for maximum header size using methods like `max_header_size()`.

*   **Path Traversal via Route Parameters:**
    *   **Description:** An attacker manipulates route parameters to access files or resources outside the intended scope.
    *   **How Actix Web Contributes:** If route parameters are directly used to construct file paths or resource identifiers without proper sanitization, it creates an entry point for path traversal.
    *   **Example:** A route like `/files/{filename}` where `filename` is used directly to open a file. An attacker could send a request like `/files/../../etc/passwd`.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files or resources on the server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate all route parameters before using them to access files or resources. Use safe path manipulation techniques provided by the standard library or well-vetted crates. Avoid directly concatenating user input into file paths.

*   **Unsafe Deserialization of Request Bodies:**
    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a malicious payload in the request body that, when deserialized, can lead to code execution or other vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Actix Web Contributes:** Actix Web provides mechanisms to easily deserialize request bodies (e.g., using `Json`, `Form`). If the underlying deserialization library or the application logic doesn't handle untrusted data carefully, it can be exploited.
    *   **Example:**  Using a deserialization library with known vulnerabilities to deserialize a JSON payload containing malicious code.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), data corruption, or Denial of Service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Use safe deserialization libraries and ensure they are up-to-date. Implement strict input validation after deserialization. Consider using data transfer objects (DTOs) to limit the scope of deserialization. Avoid deserializing untrusted data directly into complex application objects.

*   **Multipart Form Handling Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Description:**  Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in how the application handles multipart form data, especially file uploads.
    *   **How Actix Web Contributes:** Actix Web provides tools for handling multipart forms. Improper configuration or usage can lead to issues.
    *   **Example:**
        *   **Arbitrary File Upload:**  Not validating file types or destinations, allowing attackers to upload executable files.
        *   **Path Traversal in Filenames:**  Not sanitizing filenames, allowing attackers to overwrite arbitrary files.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution, data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strict validation of file types, sizes, and content. Sanitize filenames before saving them to the filesystem. Store uploaded files in secure locations with appropriate permissions. Consider using temporary storage and scanning uploaded files for malware.

*   **Middleware Bypass:**
    *   **Description:**  Attackers find ways to bypass security checks or authentication mechanisms implemented in Actix Web middleware.
    *   **How Actix Web Contributes:**  Incorrectly ordered or configured middleware can create vulnerabilities. For example, a middleware that should perform authentication might be placed after a route handler that accesses sensitive data.
    *   **Example:**  A middleware intended to block access based on IP address is configured incorrectly, allowing requests from blocked IPs to reach protected routes.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to protected resources or functionality.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Carefully design and order middleware. Ensure that security-critical middleware is executed before any route handlers that access sensitive resources. Thoroughly test middleware configurations.
