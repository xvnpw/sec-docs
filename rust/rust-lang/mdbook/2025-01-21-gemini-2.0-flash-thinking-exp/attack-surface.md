# Attack Surface Analysis for rust-lang/mdbook

## Attack Surface: [Markdown Parsing Vulnerabilities (XSS)](./attack_surfaces/markdown_parsing_vulnerabilities__xss_.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in the Markdown parsing library used by `mdbook` can allow Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
*   **mdbook Contribution:** `mdbook` directly uses a Markdown parser (`pulldown-cmark`) to process book content.  A flaw in this parser directly translates to an attack surface in `mdbook`-generated books.
*   **Example:**
    *   A malicious author includes Markdown like `[Click me](javascript:alert('XSS'))` in a book chapter. `mdbook`'s parser fails to properly sanitize this, and the generated HTML contains a clickable link that executes JavaScript in the user's browser.
*   **Impact:** User browser compromise, session hijacking, data theft, website defacement.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use a reputable and actively maintained Markdown parsing library:** Ensure `mdbook` uses the latest stable version of `pulldown-cmark` and that it is regularly updated.
    *   **Regularly update `mdbook` and its dependencies:** Patching vulnerabilities in the parser is crucial and is handled by updating `mdbook`.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP in the generated website to mitigate XSS impact by restricting JavaScript execution and other potentially harmful behaviors.

## Attack Surface: [Templating Engine Vulnerabilities (XSS)](./attack_surfaces/templating_engine_vulnerabilities__xss_.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in the Handlebars templating engine used by `mdbook` can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the generated output.
*   **mdbook Contribution:** `mdbook` utilizes Handlebars for theme templating.  Incorrect or insecure theme templates, whether default or custom, directly contribute to this attack surface.
*   **Example:**
    *   A theme template incorrectly handles book content or configuration values, leading to unsanitized HTML being injected into the generated pages. For example, a template might directly insert a configuration value into HTML without proper escaping: `{{{config.unsafe_value}}}`. If `config.unsafe_value` contains `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, it will be directly rendered in the HTML.
*   **Impact:** User browser compromise, session hijacking, data theft, website defacement.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Templating Practices:**  Always escape data properly within Handlebars templates using `{{value}}` for HTML escaping. Use `{{{value}}}` only when intentionally rendering raw HTML from trusted sources.
    *   **Regularly audit custom themes:**  If using custom themes, carefully review the templates for potential injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  As with Markdown XSS, CSP can help mitigate the impact of template-related XSS.

## Attack Surface: [Plugin System Vulnerabilities (Malicious Plugin)](./attack_surfaces/plugin_system_vulnerabilities__malicious_plugin_.md)

*   **Description:**  Malicious `mdbook` plugins can critically compromise the security of the generated book and the build environment.
*   **mdbook Contribution:** `mdbook`'s plugin system is a core feature that allows extending functionality.  However, the ability to execute arbitrary code via plugins directly introduces a significant attack surface if plugins are not trustworthy.
*   **Example:**
    *   A user installs a plugin from an untrusted source that is specifically designed to inject malicious JavaScript into every page of the generated book or steal sensitive data from the build environment during the build process.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** User browser compromise, session hijacking, data theft, website defacement.
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution (Build Machine):**  Complete compromise of the build machine, data theft, supply chain attacks.
    *   **Data Theft (Source Files, Configuration):** Plugins can access book source files and configuration, potentially leaking sensitive information.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Only use trusted plugins:**  Thoroughly vet plugins before installation.  **Strongly prefer** plugins from official `mdbook` repositories or highly reputable developers.  Avoid plugins from unknown or untrusted sources. Check plugin code if possible.
    *   **Minimize plugin usage:**  Only install plugins that are absolutely necessary. Reduce the attack surface by limiting the number of external code components.
    *   **Regularly audit plugins:**  Keep plugins updated and check for known vulnerabilities. If possible, review plugin code for security issues.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the `mdbook` build process with minimal necessary privileges to limit the impact of a compromised plugin.
