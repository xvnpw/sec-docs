# Threat Model Analysis for rust-lang/mdbook

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Markdown Injection](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_markdown_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious Markdown code into book content. When `mdbook` processes this Markdown, it generates HTML that includes the malicious script. When a user views the book, the script executes in their browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookies, redirect to malicious sites, or deface the page. This threat directly involves `mdbook`'s core function of parsing Markdown and generating HTML.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise, data theft, website defacement, redirection to malicious sites.
    *   **Affected Component:** Markdown Parser, HTML Output Generation (mdbook core)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep `mdbook` and plugins up-to-date.
        *   Sanitize user-contributed Markdown content *before* processing with `mdbook`.
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers on the web server serving the book.
        *   Utilize `mdbook` features or plugins (if available) for enhanced Markdown sanitization during the build process.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Generated HTML due to Template Vulnerabilities](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_generated_html_due_to_template_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in `mdbook`'s core templates or theme templates could lead to improper escaping of content. This results in XSS vulnerabilities in the generated HTML output by `mdbook`. An attacker could exploit this by crafting specific book content that triggers the template vulnerability, leading to script execution in users' browsers. This is a direct vulnerability within `mdbook`'s templating system.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise, data theft, website defacement, redirection to malicious sites.
    *   **Affected Component:** HTML Templates (Core or Theme - within mdbook)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use official and well-maintained `mdbook` themes.
        *   If customizing themes, thoroughly audit template code for proper output encoding and escaping.
        *   Keep `mdbook` and themes updated to benefit from security fixes.
        *   Consider using automated security scanning tools to analyze the HTML output generated by `mdbook` for potential XSS vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Malicious or Vulnerable Plugins](./threats/malicious_or_vulnerable_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could create or compromise an `mdbook` plugin and inject malicious code. If a user installs this plugin into their `mdbook` setup, it could execute arbitrary code *during the book building process*, potentially leading to XSS in the generated book, data theft from the build environment, or even compromise of the build server itself. Vulnerable plugins, due to flaws in their code, could also introduce security issues into the generated book or the build process. This threat is directly related to `mdbook`'s plugin system.
    *   **Impact:** XSS in generated book, arbitrary code execution during build, data theft, build environment compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Plugin System, Plugins (mdbook extension mechanism)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strictly** only use plugins from trusted and reputable sources.
        *   **Thoroughly review plugin code** before installation, especially for plugins from unknown authors.
        *   Keep plugins updated to benefit from security patches.
        *   Implement a plugin vetting process if using plugins from external contributors.
        *   Consider using a plugin dependency management system to track and audit plugin dependencies.

## Threat: [Plugin Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/plugin_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** `mdbook` plugins often rely on external libraries (dependencies). If these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, they can be exploited through the plugin within the `mdbook` build context. An attacker could leverage a vulnerable dependency in a plugin to execute malicious code or gain unauthorized access during the book generation. This is a vulnerability introduced via the `mdbook` plugin ecosystem.
    *   **Impact:** Vulnerabilities from plugin dependencies leading to XSS, arbitrary code execution, or other security issues within the context of `mdbook`.
    *   **Affected Component:** Plugin Dependencies, Plugin System (mdbook plugin ecosystem)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly audit plugin dependencies for known vulnerabilities using vulnerability scanning tools.
        *   Keep plugin dependencies updated to the latest secure versions.
        *   Choose plugins with well-maintained and actively updated dependencies.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attacks via Build Dependencies](./threats/supply_chain_attacks_via_build_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises a dependency in the `mdbook` build process itself (e.g., Rust crates used by `mdbook` or its build tools). This compromised dependency could inject malicious code into the `mdbook` binary or plugin artifacts. When developers use this compromised `mdbook` to build books, the malicious code could be included in the generated output or compromise the developer's machine or build infrastructure. This is a threat directly impacting the `mdbook` build pipeline and distribution.
    *   **Impact:** Compromised `mdbook` installations, malicious code in generated books, developer machine/build infrastructure compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Build Process, Build Dependencies (Rust Toolchain, Crates used by mdbook)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use official and trusted sources for `mdbook` and Rust toolchain installations.
        *   Implement dependency verification and checksumming in the build process for `mdbook` itself and its dependencies.
        *   Regularly audit build dependencies of `mdbook` for known vulnerabilities.
        *   Use secure build environments and practices for building and distributing `mdbook`.

## Threat: [Arbitrary Code Execution during Build via Malicious Plugins](./threats/arbitrary_code_execution_during_build_via_malicious_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious plugin could be specifically designed to execute arbitrary code during the `mdbook` build process. This allows an attacker to gain control of the build environment when `mdbook` is run with the malicious plugin. This could lead to compromise of the build server, theft of secrets from the build environment, or injection of malicious code into the generated book *before* it is deployed. This is a direct consequence of using `mdbook`'s plugin system without proper vetting.
    *   **Impact:** Build infrastructure compromise, malicious code injected into generated books, data theft from build environment.
    *   **Affected Component:** Plugin System, Plugins, Build Process (mdbook build execution)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strictly control and vet plugins** used in the build process.
        *   **Run the `mdbook` build process in a sandboxed or isolated environment** to limit the impact of malicious plugins.
        *   Monitor build process logs for suspicious activity.
        *   Implement principle of least privilege for the build process, limiting access to sensitive resources.
