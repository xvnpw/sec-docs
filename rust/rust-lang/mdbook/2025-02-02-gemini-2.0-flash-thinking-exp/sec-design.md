# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a command-line tool for efficiently creating online books from Markdown files.
  - Offer a simple and user-friendly experience for authors to generate documentation.
  - Enable easy sharing and publishing of technical documentation and other book-like content on the web.
  - Support customization and theming of generated books to match different branding and style requirements.
  - Foster an open-source community around documentation tooling and best practices.
- Business Risks:
  - Risk of vulnerabilities in the `mdbook` tool leading to compromised generated documentation or user systems.
  - Risk of data integrity issues in generated books due to parsing or processing errors.
  - Risk of availability issues if the tool becomes unreliable or difficult to maintain.
  - Risk of negative reputation if the tool is perceived as insecure or poorly maintained.
  - Risk of losing user trust if security incidents occur related to the tool or generated documentation.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Memory safety provided by the Rust programming language, reducing the risk of common memory-related vulnerabilities. Implemented in: `mdbook` codebase.
  - security control: Version control and code review process on GitHub, helping to identify and mitigate potential security issues during development. Implemented in: GitHub repository workflow.
  - security control: Issue tracking on GitHub for reporting and addressing bugs and security vulnerabilities. Implemented in: GitHub issue tracker.
  - security control: Open-source nature of the project allows for community review and contribution to security improvements. Implemented in: Open GitHub repository.
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security patches and updates, which may have variable response times.
  - accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities to be discovered in dependencies used by `mdbook`.
  - accepted risk: Risk of user misconfiguration or misuse of `mdbook` leading to insecurely generated or deployed documentation.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated dependency scanning to identify and address vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
  - security control: Integrate static analysis security testing (SAST) tools into the build process to detect potential code-level vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Establish a clear process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities, including a security policy and contact information.
  - security control: Provide security guidelines and best practices for users on how to securely use `mdbook` and deploy generated documentation.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to the core functionality of `mdbook` as it is a static site generator. Authentication would be relevant for systems hosting the generated books, which is outside the scope of `mdbook` itself.
  - Authorization: Access control to the `mdbook` repository on GitHub is managed through GitHub's permissions system. Authorization within generated books is not a feature of `mdbook`.
  - Input Validation: Robust input validation is crucial for Markdown parsing to prevent vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS) if user-provided Markdown is rendered dynamically (though `mdbook` generates static HTML). Input validation should be implemented in: Markdown parsing logic within `mdbook` codebase.
  - Cryptography: Cryptography is not a core requirement for `mdbook` in its current form. However, it could be considered for future features like supporting encrypted books or secure updates.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Generation and distribution of documentation using `mdbook`.
  - Maintaining the integrity and availability of the `mdbook` tool itself.
  - Building and releasing secure and reliable versions of `mdbook`.
- Data Sensitivity:
  - Markdown source files: Low to Medium sensitivity. They are typically text-based documentation, but might contain sensitive information depending on the context.
  - Generated HTML book files: Low to Medium sensitivity. They are the public output of the documentation process.
  - `mdbook` source code: Medium sensitivity. Protecting the source code is important for maintaining the integrity and security of the tool.
  - Build and release infrastructure: Medium to High sensitivity. Compromise could lead to distribution of malicious versions of `mdbook`.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What is the intended audience and use case for the generated documentation? (e.g., internal documentation, public API documentation, etc.) - Assumption: Primarily technical documentation for developers and technical users.
  - Are there any specific compliance requirements or security standards that `mdbook` or generated documentation needs to adhere to? - Assumption: No specific compliance requirements mentioned, focusing on general security best practices.
  - Are there any plans to add features that would require handling more sensitive data or introduce new security considerations (e.g., user accounts, dynamic content, etc.)? - Assumption: Current focus is on static site generation, no immediate plans for features requiring significant changes to security posture.
  - What is the process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities in `mdbook`? - Assumption: Standard GitHub issue reporting process, recommended to establish a more formal security policy.

- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to provide a useful and reliable tool for documentation generation within the open-source community. Security is important for user trust and tool adoption.
  - SECURITY POSTURE: Current security relies heavily on Rust's memory safety and general open-source development practices. There is room for improvement in automated security checks in the build process and formal security vulnerability handling.
  - DESIGN: The design is focused on a command-line tool that generates static HTML output. Deployment of generated books is the responsibility of the user. The build process is automated using GitHub Actions, but could be enhanced with more security-focused steps.
