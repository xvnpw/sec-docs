# Attack Surface Analysis for rust-lang/mdbook

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Markdown Content](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_markdown_content.md)

Description: Malicious JavaScript code injected within Markdown content can be executed in a user's browser when they view the generated book due to insufficient sanitization by `mdbook`.
*   **mdbook Contribution:** `mdbook`'s core function is to convert Markdown to HTML. If this conversion process fails to properly sanitize user-provided Markdown, it directly enables XSS vulnerabilities in the generated output.
*   **Example:** A Markdown file includes an iframe tag with a `src` attribute pointing to a malicious website or containing inline JavaScript: ``<iframe></iframe>``. If `mdbook` doesn't sanitize iframe tags or their `src` attributes, this malicious iframe will be embedded in the generated HTML and executed in the user's browser.
*   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), allowing attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in users' browsers. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, website defacement, redirection to malicious sites, and other malicious actions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) in the HTTP headers of the served book. This significantly reduces the impact of XSS by controlling the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources and execute scripts.
    *   **Keep `mdbook` Updated:** Regularly update `mdbook` to the latest version. Security updates often include improvements to HTML sanitization and output encoding to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Careful Markdown Content Review:**  Especially when using Markdown from untrusted sources, manually review the content for potentially malicious HTML or JavaScript injection attempts before building the book. Focus on HTML tags, attributes like `onerror`, `onload`, and `javascript:` URLs.

## Attack Surface: [Plugin Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

Description: Plugins extend `mdbook`'s functionality but can introduce critical vulnerabilities if they are malicious, poorly written, or have security flaws.
*   **mdbook Contribution:** `mdbook`'s plugin system is a core feature that allows users to extend its capabilities. By design, plugins have significant access to the build process and can manipulate the generated book and potentially the system running `mdbook`. This makes plugin vulnerabilities a direct and significant attack surface introduced by `mdbook`'s architecture.
*   **Example:** A malicious `mdbook` plugin could be designed to execute arbitrary commands on the server during the book build process. A vulnerable plugin might have a command injection flaw, allowing an attacker to inject and execute commands by manipulating plugin configuration or input data.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server running `mdbook`, allowing attackers to completely compromise the system. Information Disclosure, Denial of Service (DoS), and other severe impacts are also possible depending on the plugin's vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Thorough Plugin Auditing:**  Before using any plugin, especially third-party or community plugins, meticulously audit its source code. Understand what the plugin does, what permissions it requires, and look for potential security vulnerabilities like command injection, path traversal, or insecure file handling.
    *   **Use Only Trusted Plugins:**  Prioritize using official plugins or plugins from highly reputable and trusted sources. Check the plugin's maintainers, community feedback, and security track record.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Build Process:** Run the `mdbook` build process with the minimum necessary privileges. This can limit the damage an attacker can do even if a plugin vulnerability is exploited. Consider using containerization or virtual machines to isolate the build environment.
    *   **Plugin Sandboxing (Future Consideration):** Advocate for and consider contributing to `mdbook` or plugin ecosystems to implement sandboxing or permission systems for plugins. This would restrict plugin capabilities and significantly reduce the risk of plugin vulnerabilities.
    *   **Regular Plugin Updates and Security Checks:** Keep plugins updated to their latest versions, as updates often include security fixes. Regularly check for security advisories related to used plugins.
