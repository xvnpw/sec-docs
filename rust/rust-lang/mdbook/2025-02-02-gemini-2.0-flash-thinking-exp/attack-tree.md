## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Compromise mdbook Application](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__compromise_mdbook_application.md)

This is the root goal of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized control or causing significant damage to the application using mdbook.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit mdbook Core Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_mdbook_core_vulnerabilities.md)

Attackers aim to exploit vulnerabilities within the core mdbook software itself, excluding themes and plugins.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Input Manipulation Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__input_manipulation_vulnerabilities.md)

This focuses on vulnerabilities arising from how mdbook processes input, primarily Markdown content and potentially configuration files.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Malicious Markdown Injection](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__malicious_markdown_injection.md)

Attackers inject malicious content directly into Markdown files that are processed by mdbook. This is a high-risk path because Markdown allows embedding raw HTML, which can be exploited if not handled carefully.

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **1. [HIGH RISK PATH] Inject Malicious HTML/JavaScript via Markdown:**
        * Attackers embed HTML tags, including `<script>` tags, within Markdown content.
        * When mdbook generates HTML from this Markdown, the malicious HTML is included in the output.
        * If the application serving the mdbook output does not properly sanitize or use Content Security Policy (CSP), this injected JavaScript can execute in users' browsers.
        * **Result:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

        * **[CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit XSS in Application (if application processes mdbook output unsafely):**
            * Successful exploitation of the injected JavaScript.
            * **Impact:**  Full XSS vulnerability, allowing attackers to:
                * Steal user session cookies and credentials.
                * Deface the application.
                * Redirect users to malicious websites.
                * Perform actions on behalf of the user.
                * Potentially gain further access to backend systems if the application is not properly isolated.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH] Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__high_risk_path__dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

Attackers target vulnerabilities in the external libraries (dependencies) that mdbook relies upon. This is a high-risk path because dependencies are often numerous and can contain undiscovered or unpatched vulnerabilities.

    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **1. [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Vulnerabilities in mdbook's Dependencies (e.g., `pulldown-cmark`, `handlebars`, etc.):**
            * Identify known vulnerabilities in the versions of dependencies used by mdbook.
            * Leverage publicly available exploits or develop custom exploits for these vulnerabilities.
            * **Impact:** Depending on the specific vulnerability, attackers could achieve:
                * **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Gain complete control over the server or build environment.
                * **Denial of Service (DoS):** Crash the application or build process.
                * **Information Disclosure:** Access sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit mdbook Ecosystem Vulnerabilities (Themes & Plugins)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_mdbook_ecosystem_vulnerabilities__themes_&_plugins_.md)

Attackers target vulnerabilities within the mdbook ecosystem, specifically themes and plugins, which are extensions to the core functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH] Theme Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__high_risk_path__theme_vulnerabilities.md)

Themes customize the appearance of mdbook and can include JavaScript and CSS. Vulnerabilities in themes, especially XSS, are a high risk.

    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **1. [HIGH RISK PATH] Malicious Theme Installation:**
            * If the application allows installation of themes from untrusted sources, attackers can provide a malicious theme.
            * The malicious theme contains JavaScript code designed to exploit vulnerabilities.
            * **Impact:** Primarily XSS vulnerabilities, similar to Markdown injection XSS.

        * **2. [HIGH RISK PATH] Theme Vulnerabilities (XSS, etc.) in legitimate themes:**
            * Even themes from seemingly legitimate sources might contain unintentional vulnerabilities, such as XSS flaws in their JavaScript code.
            * Attackers can discover and exploit these existing vulnerabilities.
            * **Impact:** XSS vulnerabilities, as described above.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH] Plugin Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__high_risk_path__plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

Plugins extend mdbook's functionality and can execute arbitrary code during the build process. Vulnerabilities in plugins, especially RCE, are a significant high risk.

    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **1. [HIGH RISK PATH] Malicious Plugin Installation:**
            * If the application allows installation of plugins from untrusted sources, attackers can provide a malicious plugin.
            * The malicious plugin contains code designed to compromise the build environment or the application.
            * **Impact:**
                * **Remote Code Execution (RCE) during build process:** Gain control over the build server.
                * **Data Exfiltration during build process:** Steal sensitive data from the build environment.
                * **Supply Chain Attacks:** Compromise the built mdbook output to affect users.

        * **2. [HIGH RISK PATH] Plugin Vulnerabilities (RCE, XSS, etc.) in legitimate plugins:**
            * Even plugins from seemingly legitimate sources might contain unintentional vulnerabilities, including RCE or XSS flaws in their code.
            * Attackers can discover and exploit these existing vulnerabilities.
            * **Impact:** RCE, XSS, Data Exfiltration, depending on the specific plugin vulnerability.
