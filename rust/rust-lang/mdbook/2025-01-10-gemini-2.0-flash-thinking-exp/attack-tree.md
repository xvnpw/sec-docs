## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Processing Vulnerabilities (HIGH RISK):](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_processing_vulnerabilities__high_risk_.md)

- Exploit Markdown Parsing Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL):
    - Inject Arbitrary HTML via Markdown (HIGH RISK):
        - Attackers leverage flaws in the Markdown parser or its extensions to embed unsanitized HTML, including `<script>` tags, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This can result in session hijacking, cookie theft, and malicious actions performed on behalf of the user.
    - Exploit Specific Markdown Extension Vulnerabilities (HIGH RISK):
        - If custom or third-party Markdown extensions are used, vulnerabilities within their parsing logic can be exploited. This can range from XSS to Remote Code Execution (RCE) depending on the extension's functionality and the vulnerability.
- Exploit `book.toml` Configuration Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL):
    - Inject Malicious Configuration Options (HIGH RISK):
        - If the `book.toml` file is dynamically generated or influenced by user input without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious configurations. This can involve pointing to malicious preprocessors or renderers, leading to RCE during the build process.
    - Modify `book.toml` to Include Malicious Preprocessors/Renderers (HIGH RISK):
        - If an attacker gains write access to the `book.toml` file (through other vulnerabilities), they can directly modify it to include configurations that load and execute malicious preprocessors or renderers, resulting in RCE on the build server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Output Generation Vulnerabilities (HIGH RISK):](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_output_generation_vulnerabilities__high_risk_.md)

- Inject Malicious HTML/JavaScript via Theme/Template (CRITICAL):
    - Compromise Theme Files (HIGH RISK):
        - If the application allows user-defined themes or if theme files are stored in a vulnerable location, attackers can replace legitimate theme files with malicious versions containing JavaScript or other harmful code. This results in persistent XSS on every page of the generated documentation.
    - Exploit Template Injection Vulnerabilities (HIGH RISK):
        - If the templating engine used by `mdbook` has vulnerabilities, attackers can inject malicious code into template directives. This can lead to RCE or the injection of arbitrary content, including malicious scripts, into the generated output.
- Manipulate Build Process/Output (CRITICAL):
    - Inject Malicious Files into Output Directory (HIGH RISK):
        - If an attacker gains write access to the output directory (e.g., through a separate vulnerability), they can inject malicious files like HTML pages with embedded JavaScript or other harmful content, leading to phishing attacks or malware distribution.
    - Modify Existing Output Files (HIGH RISK):
        - With write access to the output directory, attackers can modify existing HTML or JavaScript files generated by `mdbook` to inject malicious scripts or alter the content in a harmful way, leading to XSS or information manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Preprocessor/Renderer Vulnerabilities (HIGH RISK):](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_preprocessorrenderer_vulnerabilities__high_risk_.md)

- Leverage Malicious Preprocessor (CRITICAL):
    - Execute Arbitrary Code via Malicious Preprocessor (CRITICAL):
        - If the application uses preprocessors, and an attacker can introduce a malicious preprocessor (through configuration manipulation) or compromise an existing one, they can execute arbitrary code on the server during the build process, leading to full server compromise.
- Leverage Malicious Renderer (CRITICAL):
    - Execute Arbitrary Code via Malicious Renderer (CRITICAL):
        - If the application uses custom renderers, and an attacker can introduce a malicious renderer or compromise an existing one, they can execute arbitrary code on the server during the build process, leading to full server compromise.
    - Inject Malicious Content via Renderer (HIGH RISK):
        - Even without full code execution, a compromised renderer can inject malicious HTML or JavaScript into the generated output, leading to XSS vulnerabilities for users viewing the documentation.
