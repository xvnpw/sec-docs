# Threat Model Analysis for rust-lang/mdbook

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Markdown](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_malicious_markdown.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a markdown file containing malicious HTML or JavaScript that exploits vulnerabilities in `mdbook`'s markdown parsing or HTML rendering. When `mdbook` processes this file and generates HTML, the malicious script is included in the output. When a user views this generated page, the script executes in their browser.

**Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in users' browsers, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, or defacement of the documentation page.

**Affected Component:** Markdown parsing module, HTML rendering engine.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) for the generated documentation to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded and executed.
* Ensure `mdbook` is up-to-date to benefit from security patches addressing parsing and rendering vulnerabilities.
* Sanitize or escape HTML entities in user-provided content if it's incorporated into the markdown and processed by `mdbook`.
* Review the generated HTML output for any unexpected or suspicious script tags originating from `mdbook`'s processing.

## Threat: [Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Preprocessor](./threats/arbitrary_code_execution_via_malicious_preprocessor.md)

**Description:** An attacker leverages a vulnerability in `mdbook`'s preprocessor interface or execution mechanism to execute arbitrary code on the server during the build process. This could involve a maliciously crafted preprocessor or exploiting a flaw in how `mdbook` handles preprocessor execution.

**Impact:** Full control over the build server, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or deployment of malicious code.

**Affected Component:** Preprocessor interface, command execution mechanism.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Only use trusted and well-vetted preprocessors.
* If using custom preprocessors, implement strict input validation and sanitization within them, and ensure they are securely developed.
* Run preprocessors in a sandboxed environment with limited privileges to mitigate the impact of potential vulnerabilities in `mdbook`'s execution.
* Regularly audit the code of any custom preprocessors.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Unintended File Inclusion](./threats/information_disclosure_via_unintended_file_inclusion.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a markdown file with include directives or links that exploit vulnerabilities in `mdbook`'s file inclusion logic, causing it to expose sensitive files from the server's filesystem in the generated output.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive source code, configuration files, API keys, or other confidential data.

**Affected Component:** File inclusion logic, link resolution.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully review and restrict the directories that `mdbook` is allowed to access for includes through its configuration.
* Ensure that `mdbook` does not follow symbolic links to unintended locations during file inclusion.
* Sanitize and validate file paths used in include directives to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities within `mdbook`.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Vulnerabilities in Default Theme or Renderers](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_vulnerabilities_in_default_theme_or_renderers.md)

**Description:** The default `mdbook` theme or built-in renderers have vulnerabilities that allow for the injection of malicious scripts into the generated HTML.

**Impact:** Similar to XSS via malicious markdown, leading to execution of arbitrary JavaScript in users' browsers.

**Affected Component:** HTML rendering engine, theme templates.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep `mdbook` up-to-date to benefit from security patches in the default theme and renderers.
* If using a custom theme, thoroughly review and audit its code for potential XSS vulnerabilities.
* Implement CSP for the generated documentation.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities Leading to Critical Exploits in `mdbook`](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_leading_to_critical_exploits_in__mdbook_.md)

**Description:** `mdbook` relies on dependencies, and critical vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be directly exploitable through `mdbook`'s functionality.

**Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to remote code execution on the build server or other critical security breaches.

**Affected Component:** All components, as vulnerabilities can exist in any dependency used by `mdbook`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update `mdbook` and all its dependencies to the latest versions.
* Use dependency scanning tools to identify and address known vulnerabilities in `mdbook`'s dependency tree.
* Monitor security advisories for `mdbook` and its dependencies.
