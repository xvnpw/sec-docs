# Attack Surface Analysis for rust-lang/mdbook

## Attack Surface: [Markdown Content Injection leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_surfaces/markdown_content_injection_leading_to_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:** Maliciously crafted Markdown content can be injected into the source files, which `mdbook` then processes and renders into HTML without proper sanitization, allowing execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser.
    *   **How mdbook Contributes:** `mdbook`'s core function is to process and render Markdown. If it doesn't adequately sanitize potentially harmful HTML tags or JavaScript within the Markdown, it directly contributes to this vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** A Markdown file contains the following: `<script>alert("XSS");</script>`. When `mdbook` renders this, the alert box will pop up in the user's browser.
    *   **Impact:**  High. Attackers can steal user credentials, session cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, deface the documentation, or perform other actions on behalf of the user.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Employ a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to limit the sources from which scripts can be loaded and the actions that scripts can perform.
            *   Utilize a robust HTML sanitization library within `mdbook`'s rendering pipeline to strip out or escape potentially dangerous HTML tags and JavaScript. Consider using libraries like `ammonia` in Rust.
            *   Avoid directly embedding user-provided content without careful processing.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Preprocessors or Renderers leading to Code Execution](./attack_surfaces/malicious_preprocessors_or_renderers_leading_to_code_execution.md)

*   **Description:** If `mdbook` is configured to use custom or third-party preprocessors or renderers, a malicious actor could introduce a component that contains malicious code, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.
    *   **How mdbook Contributes:** `mdbook` provides a mechanism to extend its functionality through preprocessors and renderers, and the execution of these components is part of `mdbook`'s build process.
    *   **Example:** A `book.toml` file is modified to include a malicious preprocessor that executes system commands upon invocation by `mdbook`.
    *   **Impact:** Critical. Full control of the server running `mdbook` can be gained.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Thoroughly vet and audit any custom or third-party preprocessors and renderers before using them.
            *   Implement input validation and sanitization within preprocessors and renderers.
            *   Run `mdbook` processes with the least necessary privileges.
            *   Consider using sandboxing or containerization to isolate preprocessors and renderers.
