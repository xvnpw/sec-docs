# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: SSRF via Crafted Links in `mdbook-linkcheck`

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability within the `mdbook-linkcheck` backend, specifically focusing on the attack vector of crafted links.  We aim to understand the precise conditions under which this vulnerability can be exploited, the potential impact, and the effectiveness of proposed mitigations.  This analysis will inform secure configuration and usage guidelines for development teams using `mdbook`.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis is limited to the following:

*   **Target:** The `mdbook-linkcheck` backend as used within the `mdbook` project.
*   **Vulnerability:** SSRF via crafted links.  We will *not* analyze other potential SSRF vectors or other vulnerabilities within `mdbook` or `mdbook-linkcheck`.
*   **Attack Scenario:** An attacker has the ability to inject malicious links into the Markdown content processed by `mdbook`. This could occur through various means, such as compromising a contributor's account, submitting a malicious pull request, or exploiting a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in a comment system integrated with the `mdbook` output.
*   **Environment:** We assume `mdbook` is used to build and potentially host documentation, potentially on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure) or an internal network.
* **Exclusions:** We are not analyzing vulnerabilities in the core `mdbook` functionality itself, only the `mdbook-linkcheck` backend. We are also not analyzing vulnerabilities that might exist in the web server hosting the generated documentation.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Code Review:** Examine the `mdbook-linkcheck` source code (available on GitHub) to understand how it handles link checking, redirects, and network requests.  We will pay close attention to:
    *   HTTP client configuration (redirect policies, timeouts, etc.).
    *   Input validation and sanitization of URLs.
    *   Any existing security measures (e.g., whitelists, blacklists).
    *   Error handling and logging.
2.  **Vulnerability Analysis:** Based on the code review, identify specific code paths and configurations that could lead to SSRF.  We will consider:
    *   Default configurations and their security implications.
    *   How user-configurable options affect the vulnerability.
    *   The types of internal resources that could be targeted (e.g., metadata services, internal APIs).
3.  **Exploit Scenario Development:**  Construct realistic exploit scenarios, including example malicious links and the expected responses from a vulnerable `mdbook-linkcheck` instance.
4.  **Mitigation Effectiveness Assessment:** Evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed mitigations in preventing the identified exploit scenarios.  We will consider:
    *   Completeness: Does the mitigation address all identified vulnerable code paths?
    *   Robustness: Can the mitigation be bypassed with clever techniques?
    *   Usability: Does the mitigation introduce significant usability issues for legitimate users?
5.  **Recommendations:** Provide concrete recommendations for secure configuration and usage of `mdbook-linkcheck`, including any necessary code changes or additional security measures.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.1.1.1. SSRF via crafted links (in `mdbook-linkcheck`)

### 2.1 Code Review Findings

The `mdbook-linkcheck` backend, written in Rust, uses the `reqwest` crate for making HTTP requests.  Key observations from the code review (as of a reasonable point in time - specific versions should be checked):

*   **Redirect Handling:** `reqwest` follows redirects by default.  This is a crucial factor in the SSRF vulnerability.  The number of redirects followed can be configured, but the default is typically a non-zero value (e.g., 10).  Crucially, `reqwest` does *not* inherently restrict redirects based on IP address or hostname.
*   **URL Parsing:** `mdbook-linkcheck` likely uses a URL parsing library to extract the URL from the Markdown link.  This parsing should be robust against URL encoding tricks, but it's a potential area for bypasses if not handled carefully.
*   **Configuration:** `mdbook-linkcheck` allows configuration via a `linkcheck.toml` file (or similar).  This file *may* allow specifying options related to redirect following, timeouts, and potentially whitelists/blacklists (this needs to be verified against the specific version).  The *absence* of secure defaults in this configuration is a significant risk.
*   **Error Handling:**  The way errors are handled (e.g., connection timeouts, invalid URLs) is important.  If errors are not handled gracefully, they could leak information or be used in timing attacks.
* **No inherent IP/Hostname restrictions:** By default, there are no built-in restrictions on what IP addresses or hostnames `reqwest` will connect to. This is the core of the SSRF vulnerability.

### 2.2 Vulnerability Analysis

The primary vulnerability stems from the combination of:

1.  **Default Redirect Following:** `reqwest`'s default behavior of following redirects.
2.  **Lack of Input Validation (by default):**  `mdbook-linkcheck` doesn't inherently restrict the target of the initial request or the subsequent redirects based on IP address or hostname.
3.  **Attacker-Controlled Input:** The attacker can inject arbitrary URLs into the Markdown.

This allows an attacker to craft a link that, when checked by `mdbook-linkcheck`, will cause the server to make requests to internal resources.  For example:

*   **Cloud Metadata Service:** On AWS, an attacker could use a link like `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/`.  On GCP, a similar link to the metadata server could be used.  These services often provide sensitive information, such as instance credentials, network configuration, and custom metadata.
*   **Internal APIs:** An attacker could target internal APIs that are not exposed to the public internet but are accessible from the server running `mdbook-linkcheck`.  This could allow the attacker to read data, modify configurations, or even execute code.
*   **Localhost Services:**  An attacker could target services running on the same machine as `mdbook-linkcheck`, such as databases, monitoring tools, or other applications.
*   **SSRF Chaining:** The attacker could use a public URL that redirects to an internal resource. For example, the attacker could control `http://attacker.com/redirect` which issues a 302 redirect to `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/`.

### 2.3 Exploit Scenario Development

**Scenario 1: AWS Metadata Service Access**

1.  **Attacker's Action:** The attacker inserts the following link into the Markdown:
    ```markdown
    [Click here](http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/)
    ```
2.  **`mdbook-linkcheck` Execution:**  `mdbook-linkcheck` processes the Markdown and encounters the link.  It uses `reqwest` to make a GET request to the URL.
3.  **AWS Response:** The AWS metadata service responds with the IAM security credentials for the instance.
4.  **`mdbook-linkcheck` Behavior:**  `mdbook-linkcheck` receives the response.  Depending on its configuration and error handling, it might:
    *   Log the response (exposing the credentials in the logs).
    *   Report the link as "valid" (since it received a 200 OK response).
    *   Include (part of) the response in an error message.
5.  **Attacker's Gain:** The attacker gains access to the IAM security credentials, which they can then use to access other AWS resources.

**Scenario 2: Internal API Access via Redirect**

1.  **Attacker's Setup:** The attacker sets up a web server at `http://attacker.com` that responds to requests to `/redirect` with a 302 redirect to `http://internal-api.example.com/sensitive-data`.
2.  **Attacker's Action:** The attacker inserts the following link into the Markdown:
    ```markdown
    [Click here](http://attacker.com/redirect)
    ```
3.  **`mdbook-linkcheck` Execution:** `mdbook-linkcheck` makes a GET request to `http://attacker.com/redirect`.
4.  **Attacker's Server Response:** The attacker's server responds with a 302 redirect to `http://internal-api.example.com/sensitive-data`.
5.  **`mdbook-linkcheck` Behavior:** `reqwest`, following redirects by default, makes a GET request to `http://internal-api.example.com/sensitive-data`.
6.  **Internal API Response:** The internal API responds with the sensitive data.
7.  **`mdbook-linkcheck` Behavior:**  Similar to Scenario 1, `mdbook-linkcheck` might log the response, report the link as valid, or include the response in an error message.
8.  **Attacker's Gain:** The attacker gains access to the sensitive data from the internal API.

### 2.4 Mitigation Effectiveness Assessment

Let's analyze the proposed mitigations:

*   **Configure `mdbook-linkcheck` to *not* follow redirects to internal IP addresses or hostnames.**
    *   **Completeness:** This is the most effective mitigation.  If implemented correctly, it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability.  It requires a robust mechanism for identifying internal IP addresses and hostnames, which can be complex (e.g., handling private IP ranges, IPv6, DNS resolution).
    *   **Robustness:**  It's relatively robust, but attackers might try to bypass it using techniques like DNS rebinding or using hostnames that resolve to internal IP addresses only under certain conditions.
    *   **Usability:**  It shouldn't significantly impact usability, as legitimate external links should still work.

*   **Use a whitelist of allowed domains for external links.**
    *   **Completeness:** This is also a strong mitigation, but it requires careful management of the whitelist.  It's less flexible than the previous mitigation, as it requires explicitly allowing every external domain.
    *   **Robustness:**  It's very robust, as only explicitly allowed domains will be checked.
    *   **Usability:**  It can be less usable, as it requires adding new domains to the whitelist whenever new external links are added to the documentation.  It may also break legitimate links if the whitelist is not kept up-to-date.

*   **Run `mdbook-linkcheck` in a restricted network environment.**
    *   **Completeness:** This is a defense-in-depth measure.  It reduces the impact of a successful SSRF attack by limiting the network resources that the `mdbook-linkcheck` process can access.  However, it doesn't prevent the attack itself.
    *   **Robustness:**  It's moderately robust, but it depends on the specific network restrictions.  An attacker might still be able to access some internal resources, depending on the network configuration.
    *   **Usability:**  It shouldn't significantly impact usability, as long as the network environment allows access to the necessary external resources for building the documentation.

### 2.5 Recommendations

1.  **Prioritize Input Validation:** The most crucial recommendation is to implement robust input validation within `mdbook-linkcheck`. This should include:
    *   **Disallow Internal IPs:**  Prevent requests to private IP address ranges (RFC 1918), loopback addresses (127.0.0.0/8, ::1), and link-local addresses (169.254.0.0/16, fe80::/10).
    *   **Disallow Cloud Metadata IPs:** Explicitly block requests to known cloud metadata service IP addresses (e.g., 169.254.169.254).
    *   **Hostname Blacklist/Whitelist:**  Provide configuration options for both a blacklist (disallowed hostnames) and a whitelist (allowed hostnames).  The whitelist is the preferred approach for security, but the blacklist can be useful for blocking specific known-bad hostnames.
    *   **Consider a "safe" redirect policy:**  Implement a redirect policy that *only* allows redirects to the same origin or to domains on the whitelist.

2.  **Secure Configuration Defaults:**  `mdbook-linkcheck` should ship with secure default configurations.  This means:
    *   **Disable Redirects by Default (or use a "safe" redirect policy):**  The default behavior should be to *not* follow redirects, or to follow redirects only to the same origin or whitelisted domains.
    *   **Require Explicit Configuration:**  Force users to explicitly configure the redirect policy and any whitelists/blacklists.  This ensures that users are aware of the security implications.

3.  **Defense in Depth:**
    *   **Network Segmentation:**  Run `mdbook-linkcheck` in a restricted network environment, as suggested in the original mitigation.
    *   **Least Privilege:**  Ensure that the user account running `mdbook-linkcheck` has the minimum necessary privileges.
    *   **Monitoring and Logging:**  Implement robust monitoring and logging to detect and respond to potential SSRF attacks.  Log all attempted requests, including the target URL and the response status code.

4.  **Code Audit and Updates:** Regularly audit the `mdbook-linkcheck` code for security vulnerabilities and apply updates promptly.

5. **Documentation:** Clearly document the security considerations and configuration options for `mdbook-linkcheck`, emphasizing the risks of SSRF and the importance of secure configuration.

By implementing these recommendations, the risk of SSRF attacks via crafted links in `mdbook-linkcheck` can be significantly reduced, protecting sensitive internal resources and maintaining the integrity of the documentation build process.
