# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for rust-lang/mdbook

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Dependency Vetting](./mitigation_strategies/strict_dependency_vetting.md)

1.  **Before adding a preprocessor/plugin:**
    *   Locate the source code repository (e.g., on GitHub, GitLab).
    *   Examine the `Cargo.toml` file for dependencies. Recursively vet *those* dependencies as well.
    *   Browse the source code, focusing on:
        *   Files related to network communication (e.g., using `reqwest`, `hyper`).
        *   Files that write to the filesystem (e.g., using `std::fs`).
        *   Any use of `unsafe` blocks. Understand *why* `unsafe` is used and if it's justified.
        *   Look for any obfuscated or minified code, which is unusual in Rust and a red flag.
    *   Check the project's issue tracker and pull requests for any reported security issues.
    *   Search online for any known vulnerabilities or discussions about the preprocessor/plugin.
    *   Use `cargo crev` (if installed): `cargo crev query <crate_name>` to see community reviews.
2.  **Ongoing Vetting:**
    *   Periodically repeat the above steps, especially before updating the preprocessor/plugin.
    *   Subscribe to the project's release announcements or mailing list (if available) to be notified of updates and security advisories.

    **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Malicious Code Injection (Severity: Critical):** Prevents preprocessors from injecting arbitrary code into the build process or the generated output.
        *   **Data Exfiltration (Severity: High):** Reduces the risk of preprocessors sending sensitive data (from your source files or environment) to external servers.
        *   **Filesystem Manipulation (Severity: High):** Limits the ability of preprocessors to write to unexpected locations on your filesystem.

    **Impact:**
        *   **Malicious Code Injection:** Significantly reduces risk.  Thorough vetting makes it very difficult for malicious code to be introduced unnoticed.
        *   **Data Exfiltration:** Significantly reduces risk.  Checking for network connections helps identify potential exfiltration attempts.
        *   **Filesystem Manipulation:** Significantly reduces risk.  Examining file I/O operations helps prevent unauthorized writes.

    **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Not directly implemented within `mdbook` itself. This is a *process* that developers must follow.  `mdbook`'s documentation could be improved to emphasize this.

    **Missing Implementation:**
        *   `mdbook` could provide a curated list of "trusted" preprocessors, although maintaining this would be a significant effort.
        *   `mdbook` could integrate with tools like `cargo-crev` to display trust information directly within the build process.
        *   `mdbook`'s documentation should have a prominent section dedicated to preprocessor security.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configuration Hardening (Preprocessor-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/configuration_hardening__preprocessor-specific_.md)

1.  **Identify Configuration Options:**
    *   Read the documentation for *each* preprocessor you use *thoroughly*.
    *   Look for any configuration options related to:
        *   Allowed URLs or domains (for preprocessors that fetch data).
        *   File access restrictions.
        *   Input validation or sanitization settings.
        *   Any other security-relevant parameters.
2.  **Apply Restrictive Settings:**
    *   Set the *most restrictive* values possible for all security-related options.
    *   Use whitelists instead of blacklists whenever possible.
    *   Disable any features you don't need.
3.  **Document Configuration:**
    *   Keep a record of the configuration settings you've applied for each preprocessor. This helps with auditing and troubleshooting.

    **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Data Exfiltration (Severity: High):** Limiting allowed URLs reduces the risk of data being sent to unauthorized destinations.
        *   **Filesystem Manipulation (Severity: High):** File access restrictions limit where the preprocessor can write.
        *   **Specific Vulnerabilities (Severity: Variable):** Addresses vulnerabilities that might be exploitable through specific configuration options.

    **Impact:**
        *   Variable, depending on the specific preprocessor and its configuration options.  Can significantly reduce risk for some threats.

    **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Dependent on the individual preprocessor.  `mdbook` itself doesn't provide a general mechanism for this.

    **Missing Implementation:**
        *   `mdbook` could provide a standardized way for preprocessors to declare their security-relevant configuration options, making it easier for users to harden them.  This could be a schema in `book.toml` or a separate configuration file read by `mdbook`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Audits](./mitigation_strategies/regular_audits.md)

1.  **Schedule Audits:**
    *   Establish a regular schedule for auditing preprocessor and plugin code (e.g., monthly, quarterly).
    *   Trigger additional audits whenever a new version of a preprocessor is released.
2.  **Perform Audits:**
    *   Repeat the "Strict Dependency Vetting" steps, focusing on any changes since the last audit.
    *   Use automated code analysis tools (e.g., `cargo audit`, `clippy`) to identify potential vulnerabilities.
3.  **Subscribe to Advisories:**
    *   Subscribe to security advisories for the Rust ecosystem (e.g., the RustSec Advisory Database).
    *   Subscribe to any security-related mailing lists or forums for the specific preprocessors you use.

    **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Zero-Day Exploits (Severity: Critical):** Helps identify and mitigate newly discovered vulnerabilities before they are widely exploited.
        *   **Known Vulnerabilities (Severity: High):** Ensures that you are aware of and address any known vulnerabilities in your preprocessors.

    **Impact:**
        *   Significantly reduces the risk of using vulnerable preprocessors.  The effectiveness depends on the frequency and thoroughness of the audits.

    **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Not implemented within `mdbook`. This is a process that developers must follow.

    **Missing Implementation:**
        *   `mdbook` could provide tooling to help automate vulnerability scanning of preprocessors. This could involve integrating with `cargo audit` or similar tools and providing reports as part of the build process.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dependency Pinning (with caution)](./mitigation_strategies/dependency_pinning__with_caution_.md)

1.  **Identify Known-Good Version:** After thoroughly vetting a preprocessor, note its specific version number.
2.  **Pin in `Cargo.toml`:** In your `book.toml` file, specify the exact version of the preprocessor:
    ```toml
    [preprocessor.my-preprocessor]
    version = "=1.2.3"  # Use the exact version number
    ```
3.  **Monitor for Updates:** *Actively* monitor for security advisories and updates related to the pinned preprocessor.
4.  **Update Pinned Version:** When a security fix is released, update the pinned version in `Cargo.toml` and re-vet the new version.
5. **Update `Cargo.lock`:** Run `cargo update -p <crate_name>` to update the lock file.

    **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Malicious Updates (Severity: High):** Protects against a compromised preprocessor being automatically updated to a malicious version.

    **Impact:**
        *   Reduces the risk of malicious updates, but *increases* the risk of using a vulnerable version if you don't actively monitor for updates.

    **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Supported by Cargo (Rust's package manager), and configuration is done via `book.toml` which `mdbook` reads.

    **Missing Implementation:**
        *   `mdbook` could provide guidance on when and how to use dependency pinning safely, specifically within its documentation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation (within Markdown)](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation__within_markdown_.md)

1. **Identify Input Points:** Determine how your Markdown files interact with preprocessors.  Are there any custom directives or syntax that pass data to the preprocessor?
2. **Treat as Untrusted:** Consider *all* data passed from Markdown to a preprocessor as untrusted, even if it originates from your own files.
3. **Validate/Sanitize:**
    *   If the preprocessor expects a specific data type (e.g., a number, a URL), validate that the input conforms to that type *before* passing it to the preprocessor.  This is ideally done *within* the preprocessor itself, but you may need to add your own validation logic in your Markdown if the preprocessor doesn't provide it.
    *   Sanitize any input that might contain HTML or other potentially dangerous characters.  Use a dedicated sanitization library if necessary.
4. **Avoid Sensitive Data:** Never pass sensitive data (API keys, passwords) directly to preprocessors through Markdown.

    **Threats Mitigated:**
        * **Preprocessor-Specific Vulnerabilities (Severity: Variable):** Reduces the risk of exploiting vulnerabilities that rely on malicious input.
        * **XSS (Severity: High):** If the preprocessor generates HTML based on Markdown input, input validation helps prevent XSS attacks.

    **Impact:**
        * Variable, depending on the specific preprocessor and the type of input it handles. Can be crucial for preventing certain types of attacks.

    **Currently Implemented:**
        * Largely dependent on the individual preprocessor. `mdbook` itself doesn't provide a general input validation mechanism for preprocessors.

    **Missing Implementation:**
        * `mdbook` could provide a framework for preprocessors to define expected input types and validation rules. This could involve a schema that preprocessors adhere to, allowing `mdbook` to perform validation *before* calling the preprocessor.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Understand `mdbook`'s Sanitization](./mitigation_strategies/understand__mdbook_'s_sanitization.md)

1.  **Review `pulldown-cmark` Documentation:** Familiarize yourself with the `pulldown-cmark` Markdown parser (or whichever parser `mdbook` uses) and its HTML sanitization rules. Understand which HTML tags and attributes are allowed and which are stripped.
2.  **Minimize Raw HTML:** Avoid using raw HTML in your Markdown files whenever possible. Use Markdown syntax instead.
3.  **Sanitize User Input (if applicable):** If your `mdbook` site includes any user-generated content (e.g., comments), *always* sanitize this content before displaying it.  Use a robust HTML sanitization library.
4.  **Test with a Scanner:** Use a web vulnerability scanner (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite) to test your generated site for XSS vulnerabilities.

    **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Severity: High):** Reduces the risk of XSS attacks by relying on `mdbook`'s built-in sanitization and minimizing the use of raw HTML.

    **Impact:**
        *   Significant reduction in XSS risk, but not a complete guarantee.  Defense-in-depth (CSP) is still essential.

    **Currently Implemented:**
        *   `mdbook` uses `pulldown-cmark` (or a similar parser) for HTML sanitization.

    **Missing Implementation:**
        *   `mdbook`'s documentation could provide more explicit guidance on its sanitization behavior and limitations.  This should include a clear statement of which HTML tags and attributes are allowed, and any known bypasses.

## Mitigation Strategy: [`mdbook-mermaid` specific](./mitigation_strategies/_mdbook-mermaid__specific.md)

1. **Update Regularly:** Ensure you are using the latest version of `mdbook-mermaid` by checking for updates and updating your `book.toml` file accordingly.
2. **Avoid User Input:** Do not allow users to provide input that is directly rendered into mermaid diagrams. If user input is unavoidable, sanitize it thoroughly before passing it to `mdbook-mermaid`.
3. **Review Generated SVG:** Inspect the generated SVG output from `mdbook-mermaid` to ensure it does not contain any unexpected or malicious code.

    **Threats Mitigated:**
        * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Severity: High):** Reduces the risk of XSS attacks specifically through mermaid diagrams.

    **Impact:**
        * High reduction in XSS risk related to `mdbook-mermaid`.

    **Currently Implemented:**
        * Partially implemented through the use of `mdbook-mermaid`, but relies on the user to keep it updated and avoid user input.

    **Missing Implementation:**
        * `mdbook` could provide specific warnings or guidance regarding the use of `mdbook-mermaid` and its potential security implications within its core documentation. It could also consider integrating more robust SVG sanitization.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Careful Content Management](./mitigation_strategies/careful_content_management.md)

1.  **Review Content:** Before publishing, carefully review *all* Markdown files to ensure they don't contain sensitive information.
2.  **Use `.gitignore`:** Create a `.gitignore` file in your `mdbook` source directory to exclude sensitive files (e.g., configuration files with API keys, drafts containing internal information) from your Git repository.
3.  **Avoid Hardcoding Secrets:** Never hardcode API keys, passwords, or other secrets directly in your Markdown files. Use environment variables or other secure methods to manage secrets.

    **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Information Disclosure (Severity: High):** Prevents accidental exposure of sensitive data.

    **Impact:**
        *   High reduction in information disclosure risk, provided the guidelines are followed consistently.

    **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Not directly implemented within `mdbook`. This is a best practice for content management.

    **Missing Implementation:**
        *   `mdbook`'s documentation could emphasize the importance of careful content management and provide examples of using `.gitignore` effectively, specifically tailored to `mdbook` projects.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Review Generated HTML](./mitigation_strategies/review_generated_html.md)

1.  **Inspect Output:** After running `mdbook build`, manually inspect the generated HTML files in the `book` directory.
2.  **Check for Sensitive Data:** Look for any unexpected data, especially in:
    *   HTML comments.
    *   `<meta>` tags.
    *   Hidden elements (`<div style="display: none;">`).
    *   JavaScript code.
3.  **Use Automated Tools:** Consider using automated tools to scan the generated HTML for potential information disclosure issues.

    **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Information Disclosure (Severity: High):** Helps identify and remove any sensitive data that might have been inadvertently included in the generated output.

    **Impact:**
        *   Moderate to high reduction in information disclosure risk, depending on the thoroughness of the review.

    **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Not implemented within `mdbook`. This is a manual review process.

    **Missing Implementation:**
        *   `mdbook` could potentially provide tools to help automate the detection of sensitive data in the generated output. This could be a plugin or a built-in feature that scans for common patterns (e.g., API keys, email addresses).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Path Traversal](./mitigation_strategies/path_traversal.md)

1. **Identify Custom Links/Includes:** Examine your Markdown files for any custom links or include directives that reference files outside the main content directory.
2. **Validate Input:** If any links or includes are based on user-provided input, validate that input *thoroughly* before using it to construct file paths.
    *   Check for suspicious characters like `..`, `/`, and `\`.
    *   Ensure the input doesn't allow escaping the intended directory.
3. **Sanitize Input:** If validation is not sufficient, sanitize the input by removing or replacing any potentially dangerous characters.
4. **Use Safe Functions:** When constructing file paths, use functions that are designed to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities (e.g., functions that normalize paths and prevent escaping the base directory).

    **Threats Mitigated:**
        * **Path Traversal (Severity: High):** Prevents attackers from accessing files outside the intended directory.
        * **Information Disclosure (Severity: High):** Prevents attackers from reading sensitive files on the server.

    **Impact:**
        * High reduction in path traversal and information disclosure risk if implemented correctly.

    **Currently Implemented:**
        * Not directly implemented within `mdbook`. Relies on careful coding practices when using custom links and includes.

    **Missing Implementation:**
        * `mdbook` could provide helper functions or libraries for safely handling file paths and includes. This could be part of the preprocessor API or a separate module.
        * `mdbook`'s documentation could include a section on preventing path traversal vulnerabilities, with specific examples and best practices.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Bind to Localhost](./mitigation_strategies/bind_to_localhost.md)

1.  **Use `--ip` Option:** When starting the development server, *always* use the `--ip` option to bind it to localhost:
    ```bash
    mdbook serve --ip 127.0.0.1
    ```
2.  **Avoid Default Binding:** Do *not* rely on the default binding behavior, as it might expose the server to other machines on your network.

    **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access (Severity: High):** Prevents unauthorized users on your network from accessing the development server.

    **Impact:**
        *   High reduction in unauthorized access risk.

    **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Supported by `mdbook serve` through the `--ip` option.

    **Missing Implementation:**
        *   `mdbook` could make `127.0.0.1` the *default* binding address, requiring users to explicitly opt-in to wider exposure (e.g., with a `--public` flag).  The documentation should *strongly* emphasize the security implications of binding to other interfaces.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid Running as Root](./mitigation_strategies/avoid_running_as_root.md)

1.  **Use a Regular User Account:** Always run `mdbook serve` (and all other `mdbook` commands) from a regular user account, *not* the root account.
2.  **Avoid `sudo`:** Do *not* use `sudo` to run `mdbook` commands unless absolutely necessary (and then only for specific commands that require elevated privileges, not the entire build process).

    **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **System Compromise (Severity: Critical):** Limits the potential damage if a vulnerability in `mdbook` or a preprocessor is exploited.

    **Impact:**
        *   Very high reduction in the severity of potential exploits.

    **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Not enforced by `mdbook`. This is a general security best practice.

    **Missing Implementation:**
        *   `mdbook` could issue a warning if it detects that it's being run as root.  This would be a simple check within the `mdbook` code.
