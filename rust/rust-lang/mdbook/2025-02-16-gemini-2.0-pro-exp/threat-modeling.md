# Threat Model Analysis for rust-lang/mdbook

## Threat: [Malicious Markdown Injection via Source Repository Compromise (Direct Impact on mdBook)](./threats/malicious_markdown_injection_via_source_repository_compromise__direct_impact_on_mdbook_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized write access to the Git repository.  They directly modify the Markdown source files processed by `mdBook`, injecting malicious content.  Crucially, this includes injecting content *designed to exploit potential vulnerabilities within mdBook's Markdown parser or HTML rendering process*, even if those vulnerabilities are subtle. This goes beyond simply adding malicious links; it involves crafting Markdown that could, for example, trigger unexpected behavior in how `mdBook` handles specific Markdown syntax or interacts with enabled HTML features. The attacker might also modify `book.toml` to point to malicious resources or alter build settings in a way that directly impacts `mdBook`'s operation.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Users visiting the generated website may be redirected to phishing sites, have their data stolen, or have malware installed.
    *   Reputation damage.
    *   Potential for data exfiltration if the injected content can interact with `mdBook`'s internal state or access files during the build process.
    *   Website defacement or rendering it unusable.

*   **Affected mdBook Component:**
    *   **Markdown Parser:** (Specifically, vulnerabilities in the parser's handling of edge cases, complex syntax, or interaction with enabled HTML).
    *   **HTML Sanitization (if applicable):** If `mdBook` performs any HTML sanitization after Markdown parsing, vulnerabilities in this process.
    *   **Configuration File (`book.toml`) Parser:** If malicious configurations are injected that directly affect `mdBook`'s build process.
    *   **File System Interaction:** (Reading source files and writing output files, potentially manipulated by malicious `book.toml` settings).

*   **Risk Severity:** Critical

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Repository Access Control:** Multi-factor authentication, least privilege, branch protection rules (mandatory code reviews).
    *   **Code Reviews:** Mandatory, thorough code reviews for *all* changes, focusing on potentially dangerous Markdown constructs.
    *   **Secure Development Environment:** Secure workstations and secure coding practices for developers.
    *   **Git Hooks:** Pre-commit/pre-receive hooks to scan for suspicious patterns (e.g., unusual HTML tags, complex nested Markdown).
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Of the repository and build process.
    *   **Fuzz Testing of mdBook:** *Directly test mdBook's parser* with a wide range of malformed and edge-case Markdown inputs to identify potential vulnerabilities. This is a mitigation for the *mdBook developers*, not just users.
    * **Input validation:** Validate all input, including markdown files.

## Threat: [Malicious Preprocessor Execution](./threats/malicious_preprocessor_execution.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker modifies the `book.toml` file to include a malicious preprocessor. `mdBook` executes this preprocessor *as part of its build process*. The preprocessor has the full privileges of the user running `mdBook` and can execute arbitrary code on the build system.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Complete compromise of the build system.
    *   Injection of arbitrary content into the generated website *through direct manipulation of mdBook's input*.
    *   Data theft from the build system.
    *   Potential for lateral movement.

*   **Affected mdBook Component:**
    *   **Preprocessor System:** (The core component that loads and executes preprocessors).
    *   **Configuration File (`book.toml`) Parser:**
    *   **File System Interaction:** (Reading and writing files, as controlled by the preprocessor).
    *   **Process Execution:** (Spawning and managing preprocessor processes â€“ this is a *direct* part of `mdBook`).

*   **Risk Severity:** Critical

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Custom Preprocessors:** The strongest mitigation.
    *   **Thorough Preprocessor Vetting:** *Extremely* careful code audit of any custom preprocessors. Treat them as untrusted code.
    *   **Sandboxing:** Run preprocessors in a sandboxed environment (e.g., Docker). This is a *best practice*, not a built-in `mdBook` feature, but it's crucial for mitigating this threat.
    *   **Strict Repository Access Control:** (As above).
    *   **Code Reviews:** (As above).
    * **Input validation:** Validate all input, including data from preprocessors.

## Threat: [Plugin-Related Vulnerabilities (Direct mdBook Execution)](./threats/plugin-related_vulnerabilities__direct_mdbook_execution_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker leverages a malicious or vulnerable mdBook plugin.  Since plugins are executed *directly by mdBook* as part of its build process, a compromised plugin can have significant impact. The plugin could exploit vulnerabilities in `mdBook`'s API or directly manipulate the build process.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Similar to preprocessors: potential for complete compromise of the build system.
    *   Injection of arbitrary content *through direct interaction with mdBook's internal state*.
    *   Data theft or system compromise.

*   **Affected mdBook Component:**
    *   **Plugin System:** (The core component that loads and executes plugins).
    *   **API exposed to plugins:** (Vulnerabilities in the API could be exploited).
    *   **File System Interaction:** (If the plugin interacts with the file system, controlled by `mdBook`).
    *   **Process Execution:** (If the plugin executes external commands, initiated by `mdBook`).

*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the plugin's capabilities and the nature of the vulnerability)

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Unnecessary Plugins:** Only use essential, well-vetted plugins.
    *   **Thorough Plugin Vetting:** *Extremely* careful code audit of *all* plugins. Treat them as untrusted code.
    *   **Sandboxing:** Consider sandboxing plugins (e.g., Docker) if they require significant privileges.
    *   **Use Well-Maintained Plugins:** Prefer reputable, actively maintained plugins.
    *   **Regular Plugin Updates:** Keep plugins up-to-date.
    * **Input validation:** Validate all input, including data from plugins.
