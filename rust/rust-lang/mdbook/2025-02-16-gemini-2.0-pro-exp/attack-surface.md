# Attack Surface Analysis for rust-lang/mdbook

## Attack Surface: [Arbitrary Command Execution via Preprocessors/Plugins](./attack_surfaces/arbitrary_command_execution_via_preprocessorsplugins.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in preprocessors or plugins to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting or building the `mdbook` site.

**How mdbook Contributes:** `mdbook`'s support for preprocessors and plugins, which are external executables, creates this attack vector. This is a *direct* feature of `mdbook`.

**Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious preprocessor (or compromises a legitimate one) that, when invoked by `mdbook build`, executes a shell command to download and run malware.  Or, a plugin configured in `book.toml` is pointed to a malicious executable.

**Impact:** Complete system compromise, data exfiltration, installation of backdoors, lateral movement within the network.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict `book.toml` Validation:** Use a schema validator to ensure only whitelisted preprocessors/plugins with known-safe configurations are allowed.  Treat `book.toml` as untrusted input if it can be externally influenced.
    *   **Trusted Sources Only:**  Only use preprocessors/plugins from reputable, well-maintained sources with a strong security track record. Avoid custom or obscure ones unless thoroughly audited.
    *   **Sandboxing:** Run preprocessors/plugins within a sandboxed environment (e.g., Docker container) with limited privileges and resource access.  This isolates the impact of a compromise.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Run `mdbook build` with a user account that has the absolute minimum necessary permissions. Never run as root.
    *   **Code Review (for custom preprocessors/plugins):**  If developing custom preprocessors/plugins, conduct rigorous code reviews and security testing.
    *   **Input Validation (for preprocessors/plugins):** If the preprocessor/plugin accepts input, rigorously validate and sanitize that input to prevent command injection or other vulnerabilities.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep `mdbook` and all preprocessors/plugins updated to their latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Preprocessors/Plugins](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_preprocessorsplugins.md)

**Description:** Attackers leverage preprocessors or plugins to consume excessive system resources (CPU, memory, disk), rendering the `mdbook` build process or the entire server unresponsive.

**How mdbook Contributes:** `mdbook`'s execution of external preprocessors/plugins opens the door to resource exhaustion attacks. This is a *direct* consequence of `mdbook`'s design.

**Example:** A malicious preprocessor enters an infinite loop or allocates massive amounts of memory, causing the `mdbook build` process to crash or the server to become overloaded.  A plugin might perform computationally expensive operations on every page, slowing down the build significantly.

**Impact:** Disruption of service, inability to update the `mdbook` site, potential server instability.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Resource Limits:** Enforce strict resource limits (CPU time, memory, disk I/O) on preprocessor/plugin execution using tools like `ulimit` (Linux) or container resource constraints.
    *   **Timeouts:** Implement timeouts for preprocessor/plugin execution to prevent indefinite hangs or excessive processing time.
    *   **Input Validation (for preprocessors/plugins):** If the preprocessor/plugin accepts input, validate and sanitize it to prevent triggering resource-intensive operations.
    *   **Rate Limiting (if applicable):** If a preprocessor/plugin is invoked repeatedly, consider rate limiting to prevent abuse.
    *   **Sandboxing:** As with command execution, sandboxing helps contain resource usage.

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure via Preprocessors/Plugins](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_via_preprocessorsplugins.md)

**Description:**  A malicious or compromised preprocessor/plugin leaks sensitive information from the build environment or the server.

**How mdbook Contributes:**  `mdbook` executes these external programs, giving them potential access to the build context. This is a *direct* consequence of using preprocessors/plugins.

**Example:**  A preprocessor reads environment variables containing API keys or database credentials and sends them to an attacker-controlled server. A plugin accesses files outside the intended `mdbook` directory and exfiltrates them.

**Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive data (API keys, credentials, source code, configuration files), potentially leading to further compromise.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Minimize Sensitive Data in Build Environment:**  Avoid storing sensitive information (like API keys or credentials) in environment variables or files accessible to the build process. Use secrets management solutions.
    *   **Sandboxing:**  Sandboxing restricts the preprocessor/plugin's access to the host system, limiting the scope of potential information disclosure.
    *   **Code Review (for custom preprocessors/plugins):**  Thoroughly review the code to ensure it doesn't access or transmit sensitive data.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Ensure the user running `mdbook` has minimal access to sensitive resources.
