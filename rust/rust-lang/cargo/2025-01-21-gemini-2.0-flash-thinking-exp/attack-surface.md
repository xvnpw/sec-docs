# Attack Surface Analysis for rust-lang/cargo

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Confusion/Substitution Attacks](./attack_surfaces/dependency_confusionsubstitution_attacks.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers publish malicious crates with names similar to private or internal dependencies on public registries, hoping `cargo` will download the malicious crate instead of the intended private one.
*   **Cargo Contribution:** Cargo's default dependency resolution logic prioritizes public registries like crates.io. If not explicitly configured to use private registries, Cargo will attempt to resolve dependencies from public sources first. This direct behavior of Cargo's dependency resolution makes it susceptible to confusion attacks.
*   **Example:** A company uses a private crate named `internal-auth-lib` hosted on their internal registry. An attacker publishes a crate also named `internal-auth-lib` on crates.io. If a developer's `Cargo.toml` uses `internal-auth-lib` without explicitly specifying the private registry source, `cargo` might download and use the malicious crate from crates.io.
*   **Impact:** Supply chain compromise leading to the inclusion of malicious code, potential execution of arbitrary code within the application, data breaches, compromise of internal systems, and loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Explicitly Define Private Registries in Configuration:** Configure `Cargo.toml` or `.cargo/config.toml` to clearly specify private registries as the source for internal dependencies using the `[source]` section and registry URLs.
    *   **Prioritize Private Registries:** Ensure that private registries are configured to be checked *before* public registries in Cargo's source configuration.
    *   **Use Unique and Namespaced Crate Names:** Employ unique prefixes or namespaces for private crate names to significantly reduce the probability of naming collisions with crates on public registries.
    *   **Strict Dependency Review Process:** Implement a rigorous dependency review process, especially for newly added dependencies, to verify their source and authenticity.
    *   **Registry Authentication and Authorization:** Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for private registries to control access and prevent unauthorized uploads of malicious crates.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Crates in Public Registries (crates.io)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_crates_in_public_registries__crates_io_.md)

*   **Description:** Public registries like crates.io, while moderated, can still host malicious crates containing vulnerabilities, backdoors, or malware. Cargo directly downloads and integrates these crates into projects if they are listed as dependencies.
*   **Cargo Contribution:** Cargo is designed to fetch and integrate crates from registries like crates.io based on the specifications in `Cargo.toml`. Cargo's core functionality is to manage these dependencies, and it directly facilitates the inclusion of crates from public registries into projects. Cargo itself does not perform in-depth security analysis or sandboxing of crate contents during the download or build process.
*   **Example:** An attacker uploads a crate to crates.io that appears to be a legitimate utility library but contains malicious code that, when included in an application as a dependency, exfiltrates sensitive environment variables or introduces a remote code execution vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Supply chain compromise, execution of malicious code within the application, data breaches, system compromise, potential for widespread impact if the malicious crate is widely used, and significant reputational damage.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Utilize Dependency Auditing Tools:** Regularly employ tools like `cargo audit` to scan project dependencies for known security vulnerabilities and advisories.
    *   **Exercise Due Diligence in Crate Selection:** Carefully evaluate crates before adding them as dependencies. Review crate documentation, source code (when feasible), download statistics, community reputation, and maintainer history.
    *   **Adopt the Principle of Least Privilege for Dependencies:** Minimize the number of external dependencies and prefer well-established, reputable crates with active maintenance and security track records.
    *   **Integrate Security Scanning into CI/CD Pipelines:** Incorporate automated dependency vulnerability scanning into CI/CD pipelines to proactively detect and flag vulnerable dependencies before deployment.
    *   **Consider Professional Crate Audits for Critical Dependencies:** For applications with stringent security requirements, consider commissioning professional security audits of key dependencies to gain a deeper understanding of their security posture.

## Attack Surface: [`build.rs` Script Injection](./attack_surfaces/_build_rs__script_injection.md)

*   **Description:** `build.rs` scripts are powerful Rust scripts executed by Cargo during the build process. Malicious or compromised `build.rs` scripts within dependencies can execute arbitrary code, potentially compromising the build environment and injecting malicious code into the final application artifact.
*   **Cargo Contribution:** Cargo's build process is designed to automatically execute `build.rs` scripts found in dependencies. This is a core feature of Cargo to allow crates to perform necessary build-time actions. However, Cargo provides no inherent sandboxing or restrictions on the actions that `build.rs` scripts can perform. Cargo directly facilitates the execution of these scripts with the same privileges as the user running the `cargo build` command.
*   **Example:** A malicious crate's `build.rs` script, when executed by Cargo during the build process, downloads and runs an executable from an attacker-controlled server. This executable could install malware on the developer's machine, modify the build output to include a backdoor, or steal sensitive build artifacts.
*   **Impact:** Critical build environment compromise, injection of malicious code directly into the application binary, potential for persistent backdoors, data theft from the build environment, full system compromise of build machines, and severe supply chain contamination affecting all builds using the malicious dependency.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory `build.rs` Code Review:** Implement a mandatory and rigorous code review process specifically focused on `build.rs` scripts of all dependencies, especially those from external or less trusted sources. Pay close attention to network requests, file system operations, and process execution within `build.rs` scripts.
    *   **Isolate and Sandbox the Build Environment:** Utilize containerization technologies (like Docker) or virtual machines to isolate the build environment. This limits the potential damage from a malicious `build.rs` script by restricting its access to the host system.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Build Processes:** Run `cargo build` processes with the minimum necessary user privileges to reduce the potential impact of compromised build scripts. Avoid running builds as root or with elevated privileges.
    *   **Static Analysis and Security Scanning of `build.rs`:** Employ static analysis tools and security scanners specifically designed to analyze Rust code, including `build.rs` scripts, for suspicious patterns, potential vulnerabilities, and malicious code indicators.
    *   **Consider Disabling `build.rs` Execution (Where Feasible and Safe):** In specific scenarios where a dependency's `build.rs` script is deemed unnecessary or overly risky, explore options to disable its execution if Cargo allows and if it doesn't break the build process. However, this is often not straightforward and may require patching or forking the dependency.
