# Threat Model Analysis for rust-lang/cargo

## Threat: [Malicious Dependencies](./threats/malicious_dependencies.md)

- **Description:** An attacker compromises a crate on crates.io or a private registry by injecting malicious code. This could be done by compromising a maintainer account, a development environment, or by intentionally publishing a malicious crate. When developers use `cargo add` or `cargo update` and then `cargo build`, the malicious code from the compromised dependency is included in their application.
- **Impact:** Code execution within the application's process, data theft, denial of service, supply chain compromise affecting downstream users.
- **Cargo Component Affected:** `cargo add`, `cargo update`, `cargo build`, crates.io registry, private registries.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Dependency Review: Carefully examine dependencies, especially new ones and updates before using `cargo add` or `cargo update`.
    - Crate Auditing (`cargo audit`): Regularly use `cargo audit` to scan for known vulnerabilities in dependencies managed by Cargo.
    - Dependency Pinning (Exact Versioning): Use exact versions in `Cargo.toml` to prevent unexpected updates during `cargo update` that might introduce malicious versions.
    - Source Code Review (Critical Dependencies): Review source code of sensitive dependencies before including them via `cargo add` or `Cargo.toml`.
    - Registry Security (Private Registries): Secure private registries with access control and monitoring if using them with Cargo.
    - Supply Chain Security Tools: Integrate tools for dependency graph analysis and risk identification to be used with Cargo projects.
    - `Cargo.lock` Verification: Ensure `Cargo.lock` is committed and reviewed to track dependency versions used by `cargo build`.

## Threat: [Dependency Confusion / Substitution Attacks](./threats/dependency_confusion__substitution_attacks.md)

- **Description:** An attacker registers a crate with the same name as a private dependency on a public registry (crates.io). If Cargo is misconfigured or the project is not properly set up, `cargo build` or `cargo add` might download the attacker's malicious public crate instead of the intended private one when resolving dependencies.
- **Impact:** Inclusion of malicious code in the application during `cargo build`, potentially leading to code execution, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Cargo Component Affected:** `cargo add`, `cargo build`, registry resolution logic within Cargo.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Private Registry Configuration: Configure Cargo to prioritize private registries or explicitly specify registry sources in `Cargo.toml` to guide Cargo's dependency resolution.
    - Namespacing/Prefixing (Private Crates): Use unique prefixes for private crate names to avoid naming collisions when Cargo searches registries.
    - Registry Verification: Verify the source of downloaded crates, especially when using a mix of public and private registries with Cargo.
    - Explicit Registry Specification: Use `registry = "my-private-registry"` in `Cargo.toml` for private dependencies to explicitly tell Cargo where to look.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Dependencies](./threats/vulnerable_dependencies.md)

- **Description:** Dependencies used by the application and managed by Cargo contain known security vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities in the application if they are reachable and exploitable in the application's context after `cargo build` creates the application.
- **Impact:** Application compromise, data breaches, denial of service, depending on the nature of the vulnerability in the dependency used by Cargo.
- **Cargo Component Affected:** Dependency resolution, `cargo build`, crates.io registry, private registries (all involved in dependency management by Cargo).
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - `cargo audit` Usage: Regularly run `cargo audit` to detect and report known vulnerabilities in dependencies managed by Cargo.
    - Dependency Updates: Keep dependencies updated to the latest secure versions using `cargo update`, while carefully considering potential breaking changes.
    - Vulnerability Scanning in CI/CD: Integrate vulnerability scanning tools into CI/CD pipelines to automatically detect vulnerabilities in dependencies during `cargo build` processes.
    - Security Advisories Subscription: Subscribe to security advisories for Rust and crates to stay informed about newly discovered vulnerabilities in the ecosystem used by Cargo.

## Threat: [Build Script Injection](./threats/build_script_injection.md)

- **Description:** An attacker injects malicious code into a `build.rs` script within a dependency or the main project. When `cargo build` is executed, the `build.rs` script runs arbitrary code, potentially compromising the build environment or the resulting binary produced by `cargo build`. This could involve downloading malicious payloads, modifying build artifacts, or exfiltrating data during the `cargo build` process.
- **Impact:** Build environment compromise during `cargo build`, malicious code injected into the final binary produced by `cargo build`, data theft from the build environment, supply chain compromise.
- **Cargo Component Affected:** `build.rs` execution by Cargo, `cargo build`.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Build Script Review: Carefully review `build.rs` scripts, especially in dependencies, before running `cargo build`.
    - Sandboxed Builds: Use sandboxed build environments to limit the impact of malicious scripts executed by `cargo build`.
    - Principle of Least Privilege (Build Environment): Run `cargo build` processes with minimal necessary privileges.
    - Static Analysis of `build.rs`: Use static analysis tools to detect suspicious patterns in `build.rs` scripts before running `cargo build`.
    - Dependency Minimization: Reduce the number of dependencies to minimize the attack surface of `build.rs` scripts executed by Cargo.

## Threat: [`Cargo.toml` Manipulation (Source Code Compromise)](./threats/_cargo_toml__manipulation__source_code_compromise_.md)

- **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the source code repository and modifies `Cargo.toml`. They could introduce malicious dependencies, alter build scripts paths, or change build configurations to compromise the application build process managed by Cargo when `cargo build` is executed.
- **Impact:** Full application compromise after `cargo build`, supply chain compromise, malicious code injection into binaries built by `cargo build`, data theft.
- **Cargo Component Affected:** `Cargo.toml` parsing by Cargo, dependency resolution by Cargo, `cargo build`, source code repository integration with Cargo projects.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Access Control (Source Code Repository): Implement strong access control for the repository to prevent unauthorized modifications of `Cargo.toml`.
    - Code Review Process: Mandatory code review for all changes to `Cargo.toml` before they are used in `cargo build`.
    - Integrity Monitoring (Source Code Repository): Monitor for unauthorized changes to `Cargo.toml` and trigger alerts.
    - Branch Protection: Use branch protection rules to prevent direct commits to main branches containing `Cargo.toml`.
    - Two-Factor Authentication (Repository Access): Enforce 2FA for repository access to protect `Cargo.toml`.

## Threat: [Compromised Development Environment](./threats/compromised_development_environment.md)

- **Description:** An attacker compromises a developer's machine. This allows them to manipulate local Cargo configurations, inject malicious code during development that Cargo might use, steal Cargo API tokens used for `cargo publish`, or modify project files before they are committed and used by `cargo build`.
- **Impact:** Introduction of vulnerabilities into the application built by Cargo, supply chain compromise through malicious crates published via `cargo publish`, data theft, credential theft of Cargo API tokens.
- **Cargo Component Affected:** Local Cargo configuration (`~/.cargo/config.toml`), `cargo publish`, `cargo build`, local file system interaction with Cargo projects.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Endpoint Security: Implement robust endpoint security on developer machines (antivirus, firewalls, etc.) to protect against compromise that could affect Cargo usage.
    - Secure Development Practices Training: Train developers on secure coding and security awareness to minimize risks when using Cargo.
    - Credential Management (Cargo API Tokens): Securely manage Cargo API tokens used for `cargo publish`, avoid storing them in code or easily accessible locations.
    - Regular Security Audits (Development Environments): Conduct security audits of developer environments to identify and remediate potential vulnerabilities that could affect Cargo usage.
    - Least Privilege (Developer Machines): Limit privileges on developer machines to reduce the impact of a compromise on Cargo and related activities.
    - Disk Encryption (Developer Machines): Use disk encryption to protect sensitive data and Cargo configurations on developer machines.
