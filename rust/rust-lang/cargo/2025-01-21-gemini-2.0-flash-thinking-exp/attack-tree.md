## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

This path focuses on compromising the application by exploiting vulnerabilities related to its dependencies, either by injecting malicious dependencies or exploiting known vulnerabilities in legitimate ones.

*   **Critical Node: Typosquatting Success**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers register crate names that are very similar to popular, legitimate crates (e.g., slight misspellings). Developers, due to typos or oversight, might mistakenly declare a dependency on the malicious, typosquatted crate in their `Cargo.toml`.
    *   **Impact:** If successful, the application will download and include the malicious crate. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the application's context, potentially leading to data theft, application compromise, or further attacks.

*   **Critical Node: Dependency Confusion Success**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Organizations using internal or private crate registries might have crate names that unintentionally collide with public crate names on crates.io. If Cargo is not correctly configured or prioritized, it might fetch a malicious crate from the public crates.io registry instead of the intended private, internal crate.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to typosquatting, this leads to the inclusion of a malicious crate in the application, enabling arbitrary code execution and potential compromise.

*   **Critical Node: Compromised Maintainer Upload**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers compromise the account of a legitimate maintainer of a popular crate on crates.io. Once in control, they can upload a malicious version of the crate, which will then be distributed to users who update their dependencies.
    *   **Impact:** This can have a wide-reaching impact, as many applications might depend on the compromised crate. The malicious version can contain backdoors, vulnerabilities, or code designed to compromise applications using it.

*   **Critical Node: Direct Dependency Exploit**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Direct dependencies declared in `Cargo.toml` might contain known security vulnerabilities (e.g., memory safety issues, logic flaws). Attackers can identify these vulnerabilities (using tools like `cargo audit` or CVE databases) and exploit them in the context of the target application.
    *   **Impact:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities can lead to various outcomes depending on the vulnerability type, including Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), data breaches, and other forms of application compromise.

*   **Critical Node: Transitive Dependency Exploit**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Similar to direct dependencies, transitive dependencies (dependencies of dependencies) can also contain known vulnerabilities. These are often overlooked as developers primarily focus on their direct dependencies. Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in transitive dependencies to compromise the application.
    *   **Impact:** The impact is similar to exploiting direct dependency vulnerabilities, potentially leading to RCE, DoS, data breaches, etc.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Build Process [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_build_process__high-risk_path_.md)

This path focuses on compromising the application during the build process itself, primarily through malicious `build.rs` scripts.

*   **Critical Node: Dependency-Driven Build Script Injection Success**
    *   **Attack Vector:** A malicious dependency is crafted to include a malicious `build.rs` script. When Cargo builds the dependencies, this malicious `build.rs` script is executed.
    *   **Impact:** `build.rs` scripts have significant power and can execute arbitrary code on the build machine during the `cargo build` process. This can lead to:
        *   Compromise of the build environment.
        *   Injection of malicious code into the build artifacts (binaries, libraries).
        *   Supply chain compromise if the build artifacts are distributed.

*   **Critical Node: Local Build Script Modification Success**
    *   **Attack Vector:** If an attacker gains access to a developer's machine or a CI/CD environment, they can directly modify the `build.rs` file within the project's source code.
    *   **Impact:**  Modifying `build.rs` allows the attacker to inject arbitrary code that will be executed during the next `cargo build`. The impact is similar to dependency-driven build script injection, potentially leading to build environment compromise and malicious build artifacts.

*   **Critical Node: Env Var Build Script Injection Success**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Build scripts can access environment variables. If the `build.rs` script is written in a way that is vulnerable to environment variable manipulation (e.g., directly using environment variables in commands without proper sanitization), an attacker who can control environment variables during the build process can inject malicious commands or manipulate the build logic.
    *   **Impact:** This can lead to build manipulation, potentially arbitrary code execution during the build, and the introduction of vulnerabilities or backdoors into the built application.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Cargo Configuration [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_cargo_configuration__high-risk_path_.md)

This path focuses on manipulating Cargo's configuration files (`Cargo.toml` and `.cargo/config.toml`) to introduce malicious elements or alter the build process.

*   **Critical Node: Cargo.toml Dependency Injection**
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker with write access to the project's repository (e.g., through a compromised developer account or a malicious pull request) can modify the `Cargo.toml` file to add malicious dependencies.
    *   **Impact:** Adding malicious dependencies directly introduces them into the application's build process and runtime environment, leading to potential code execution and compromise.

*   **Critical Node: Cargo.toml Build Config Manipulation**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers with write access to the repository can modify `Cargo.toml` to configure malicious build scripts or inject malicious compiler flags.
    *   **Impact:** Manipulating build scripts or compiler flags in `Cargo.toml` can lead to:
        *   Execution of malicious code during the build.
        *   Generation of vulnerable or backdoored binaries by manipulating compiler behavior.

*   **Critical Node: .cargo/config.toml Registry Redirection**
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker who gains local access to a developer's machine or can modify a shared `.cargo/config.toml` file can redirect Cargo's crate registry setting to a malicious registry they control.
    *   **Impact:** Once the registry is redirected, subsequent `cargo build` commands will fetch crates from the attacker's malicious registry. This allows the attacker to serve malicious versions of dependencies, leading to application compromise.

*   **Critical Node: .cargo/config.toml Build Flag Injection**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers with local access can modify `.cargo/config.toml` to inject malicious compiler flags.
    *   **Impact:** Injecting malicious compiler flags can:
        *   Exploit vulnerabilities in the compiler itself (though less likely).
        *   Introduce subtle vulnerabilities or backdoors into the compiled binary by altering compiler optimizations or behavior in unexpected ways.
