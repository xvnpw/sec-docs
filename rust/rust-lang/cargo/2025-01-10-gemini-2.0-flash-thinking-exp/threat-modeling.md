# Threat Model Analysis for rust-lang/cargo

## Threat: [Malicious Dependency Inclusion](./threats/malicious_dependency_inclusion.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Dependency Inclusion
    *   **Description:** An attacker publishes a crate containing malicious code. Developers include this crate in their `Cargo.toml`. During the build, Cargo fetches and integrates this malicious code, which can execute arbitrary code. *Cargo is the mechanism for fetching and integrating the malicious code.*
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application and potentially the server it runs on, data breaches, reputational damage, and financial loss.
    *   **Affected Component:** Dependency Resolution, Crates.io Interaction, Build Process
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review the code of dependencies.
        *   Utilize tools like `cargo audit`.
        *   Verify the authors and reputation of dependencies.
        *   Consider using private registries.
        *   Implement Software Bill of Materials (SBOM).
        *   Employ dependency scanning tools in CI/CD pipelines.

## Threat: [Typosquatting Attacks](./threats/typosquatting_attacks.md)

*   **Threat:** Typosquatting Attacks
    *   **Description:** An attacker publishes a crate with a similar name to a legitimate one. Developers accidentally misspell the name in `Cargo.toml`, and Cargo downloads the malicious crate. *Cargo's dependency resolution mechanism facilitates this attack.*
    *   **Impact:** Inclusion of malicious code leading to application compromise, data breaches, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Dependency Resolution, Crates.io Interaction
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Double-check the spelling of dependency names in `Cargo.toml`.
        *   Use precise version specifications.
        *   Be cautious when using autocompletion.
        *   Consider using a dependency management tool that flags potential typosquatting attempts.

## Threat: [Dependency Confusion](./threats/dependency_confusion.md)

*   **Threat:** Dependency Confusion
    *   **Description:** An attacker publishes a crate on a public registry with the same name as an internal crate. Cargo might mistakenly download the public, malicious crate. *Cargo's dependency resolution logic, and potentially misconfigured registry settings, are key to this threat.*
    *   **Impact:** Inclusion of unintended and potentially malicious code, leading to application compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Dependency Resolution, Registry Configuration
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize private registries for internal crates.
        *   Configure Cargo to prioritize private registries.
        *   Use unique and namespaced naming conventions for internal crates.
        *   Implement network restrictions to prevent access to public registries when only internal dependencies are expected.

## Threat: [Malicious Build Scripts](./threats/malicious_build_scripts.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Build Scripts
    *   **Description:** A dependency includes a `build.rs` script that executes arbitrary code during the build process orchestrated by Cargo. *Cargo's build process directly executes these scripts.*
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of the build environment, potential secrets leakage, and the possibility of injecting malicious code into the final application binary.
    *   **Affected Component:** Build Process, `build.rs` execution
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully review the `build.rs` scripts of dependencies.
        *   Sandbox the build environment.
        *   Restrict network access during the build process.
        *   Use reproducible builds.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attacks on Build Tools](./threats/supply_chain_attacks_on_build_tools.md)

*   **Threat:** Supply Chain Attacks on Build Tools
    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises tools used by Cargo (e.g., `rustc`). This allows them to inject malicious code into the compiled application. *Cargo relies on these external tools for the build process.*
    *   **Impact:**  Stealthy injection of malicious code into the application, making it difficult to detect through normal code review.
    *   **Affected Component:** Build Process, Toolchain Interaction
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use official and verified Rust toolchains.
        *   Verify the checksums of downloaded Rust toolchain binaries.
        *   Implement secure development practices to protect developer environments.
        *   Consider using reproducible builds.

## Threat: [Leaked Credentials in `.cargo/config.toml`](./threats/leaked_credentials_in___cargoconfig_toml_.md)

*   **Threat:** Leaked Credentials in `.cargo/config.toml`
    *   **Description:** Developers store credentials in `.cargo/config.toml`. If exposed, attackers can gain access. *Cargo uses this configuration file for registry access.*
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to private registries, potentially allowing attackers to publish malicious crates or access sensitive information.
    *   **Affected Component:** Configuration Loading
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid storing credentials directly in `.cargo/config.toml`.
        *   Use environment variables or dedicated secret management solutions.
        *   Ensure `.cargo/config.toml` is included in `.gitignore`.

## Threat: [Registry Compromise](./threats/registry_compromise.md)

*   **Threat:** Registry Compromise
    *   **Description:** A compromise of a crate registry allows attackers to inject malicious code into existing crates or publish malicious crates. *Cargo directly interacts with these registries.*
    *   **Impact:** Widespread distribution of malicious code, potentially affecting a large number of applications.
    *   **Affected Component:** Crates.io Interaction, Dependency Resolution
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   This is primarily the responsibility of the registry operators.
        *   Developers can mitigate risk by carefully vetting dependencies and using dependency pinning.
        *   Consider using signed crates if the registry supports it.

## Threat: [Accidental Inclusion of Sensitive Data in Published Crates](./threats/accidental_inclusion_of_sensitive_data_in_published_crates.md)

*   **Threat:** Accidental Inclusion of Sensitive Data in Published Crates
    *   **Description:** Developers include sensitive data in a crate they publish. *Cargo is the tool used for publishing crates.*
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information, potentially leading to unauthorized access or other security breaches.
    *   **Affected Component:** Crates.io Publishing
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review the contents of a crate before publishing it.
        *   Use tools to scan for sensitive data in the codebase.
        *   Avoid hardcoding sensitive information directly in the code.

## Threat: [Using Insecure or Outdated Cargo Versions](./threats/using_insecure_or_outdated_cargo_versions.md)

*   **Threat:** Using Insecure or Outdated Cargo Versions
    *   **Description:** Using older versions of Cargo with known security vulnerabilities could expose projects to attacks. *The vulnerability lies within the Cargo tool itself.*
    *   **Impact:** Potential for arbitrary code execution or other security breaches depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Affected Component:** Various Cargo components depending on the vulnerability
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Cargo updated to the latest stable version.
        *   Follow security advisories for Rust and Cargo.
        *   Encourage developers to use consistent and up-to-date versions of Cargo within a project.
