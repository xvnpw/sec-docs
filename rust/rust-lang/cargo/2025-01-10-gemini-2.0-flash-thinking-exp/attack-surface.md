# Attack Surface Analysis for rust-lang/cargo

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/malicious_dependencies.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Malicious Dependencies**
    *   **Description:**  A project includes a dependency (crate) that contains malicious code.
    *   **How Cargo Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Cargo is responsible for fetching and integrating dependencies declared in `Cargo.toml`. It trusts the content of crates from configured registries.
    *   **Example:** A seemingly harmless utility crate on crates.io contains code that, upon installation, exfiltrates environment variables or injects a backdoor into the build artifact.
    *   **Impact:**  Compromise of the application, developer's machine, or the build environment. Data breaches, unauthorized access, and supply chain compromise are possible.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Dependency Review: Carefully review the dependencies declared in `Cargo.toml`, especially for new or less well-known crates.
        *   Use `cargo vet`: Employ tools like `cargo vet` to audit and verify the safety of dependencies.
        *   Dependency Pinning:  Pin specific versions of dependencies in `Cargo.toml` to avoid unexpected updates that might introduce malicious code.
        *   Checksum Verification: Verify the checksums of downloaded crates against known good values (though this is often handled automatically by Cargo).
        *   Source Code Auditing: For critical dependencies, consider auditing the source code directly.
        *   Private Registries: For sensitive projects, consider using a private crate registry with stricter control over uploaded packages.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Confusion](./attack_surfaces/dependency_confusion.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Dependency Confusion**
    *   **Description:** An attacker uploads a malicious crate to a public registry with the same name as a private crate used within an organization. Cargo might resolve to the malicious public crate.
    *   **How Cargo Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Cargo, by default, searches public registries like crates.io. If not configured correctly, it might prioritize a public crate over a private one with the same name.
    *   **Example:** An organization uses an internal crate named `internal-auth`. An attacker uploads a malicious crate also named `internal-auth` to crates.io. When a developer runs `cargo build`, Cargo fetches the malicious crate.
    *   **Impact:**  Inclusion of malicious code into the application, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized access.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Explicit Registry Configuration: Configure Cargo to prioritize private registries or explicitly specify the registry for internal dependencies.
        *   Namespacing/Prefixing: Use unique prefixes or namespaces for internal crate names to avoid collisions with public crates.
        *   `.cargo/config.toml` Configuration: Utilize the `[source]` section in `.cargo/config.toml` to define the order and behavior of different registries.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Build Scripts (`build.rs`)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_build_scripts___build_rs__.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Malicious Build Scripts (`build.rs`)**
    *   **Description:** A dependency includes a `build.rs` script that executes arbitrary code during the build process, performing malicious actions.
    *   **How Cargo Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Cargo executes `build.rs` scripts as part of the build process without explicit user confirmation.
    *   **Example:** A crate's `build.rs` script downloads and executes a binary from a remote server, which installs malware on the developer's machine.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of the developer's machine or the build environment. Potential for data exfiltration, installation of malware, or modification of build artifacts.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Review `build.rs` Scripts: Carefully inspect the `build.rs` scripts of dependencies, especially those from untrusted sources.
        *   Sandboxing Build Processes:  Utilize containerization or virtual machines for build processes to limit the impact of malicious build scripts.
        *   Minimize Build Dependencies: Reduce the number of build dependencies to decrease the potential attack surface.
        *   Static Analysis of Build Scripts: Employ static analysis tools to scan `build.rs` scripts for suspicious behavior.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Crates.io (or other registries)](./attack_surfaces/compromised_crates_io__or_other_registries_.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Compromised Crates.io (or other registries)**
    *   **Description:** The central crate registry (like crates.io) is compromised, allowing attackers to inject malicious code into existing or new crates.
    *   **How Cargo Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Cargo trusts the integrity of the crates downloaded from the configured registries. If a registry is compromised, this trust is broken.
    *   **Example:** Attackers gain control of crates.io and inject a backdoor into a widely used crate like `tokio`.
    *   **Impact:** Widespread compromise of applications and systems relying on the affected crates. This is a severe supply chain attack.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Registry Monitoring: While individual developers have limited control, monitoring the security posture and incident reports of crate registries is important.
        *   Vendor Security Practices:  For organizations using private registries, ensure the vendor has robust security practices.
        *   Checksum Verification (Limitations): While checksums can help, a sophisticated attacker might be able to manipulate them during a registry compromise.
        *   Defense in Depth: Rely on multiple layers of security, including dependency vetting and runtime security measures, as a compromise at the registry level is difficult to prevent entirely.
