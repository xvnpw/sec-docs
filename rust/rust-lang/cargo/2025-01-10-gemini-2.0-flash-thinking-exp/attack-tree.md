# Attack Tree Analysis for rust-lang/cargo

Objective: Attacker's Goal: To execute arbitrary code within the application's context by exploiting vulnerabilities or weaknesses introduced by the use of Cargo.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Malicious Dependencies [CRITICAL NODE: Dependency Management]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_malicious_dependencies__critical_node_dependency_management_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **[HIGH-RISK] Direct Dependency Injection:** A developer, either unknowingly or through negligence, adds a crate to the `Cargo.toml` file that contains malicious code. This malicious code is then included in the application's build process and can be executed at runtime.
*   **[HIGH-RISK] Dependency Confusion Attack:** An attacker publishes a malicious crate on a public registry (like crates.io) with the exact same name as a private or internal dependency used by the application. When Cargo resolves dependencies, it might mistakenly download and use the attacker's malicious public crate instead of the intended private one.
*   **[HIGH-RISK] Supply Chain Attack on Legitimate Dependency:** An attacker compromises a legitimate and widely used crate that the application depends on (either directly or indirectly). The attacker injects malicious code into the compromised crate, and when the application updates its dependencies, it unknowingly pulls in and uses the compromised version.
*   **[HIGH-RISK] Build Script Exploitation:** A malicious dependency includes a `build.rs` file. This script is executed during the build process. The attacker embeds malicious code within this build script, allowing them to execute arbitrary commands on the build system, potentially modifying build artifacts or exfiltrating sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Tamper with Project Configuration via Cargo Mechanisms [CRITICAL NODE: Cargo.toml]](./attack_tree_paths/tamper_with_project_configuration_via_cargo_mechanisms__critical_node_cargo_toml_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **[HIGH-RISK] Compromise Developer Environment:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to a developer's machine. Once inside, they can directly modify the `Cargo.toml` file to introduce malicious dependencies or alter build scripts. This can be achieved through various means like phishing, exploiting vulnerabilities on the developer's machine, or social engineering.
*   **[HIGH-RISK] Add Malicious Dependencies (via `Cargo.toml` modification):**  After gaining illegitimate access to modify `Cargo.toml` (through a compromised developer environment or VCS), the attacker adds entries for malicious crates to the `dependencies` section. This forces the application to download and potentially execute code from these malicious crates.
*   **[HIGH-RISK] Modify Build Scripts (via `Cargo.toml` modification):**  After gaining illegitimate access to modify `Cargo.toml`, the attacker can alter the `build-dependencies` section to include malicious crates that will be executed during the build process. Alternatively, they might modify the `build` field in a dependency declaration to point to a malicious `build.rs` script within that dependency.
