## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Malicious Dependency Injection:**
        *   **Typosquatting Success [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Attacker registers crate names similar to popular crates (typos) on crates.io. Developers mistakenly type the malicious crate name in `Cargo.toml`.
            *   **Impact:**  Application pulls in and uses a malicious dependency, leading to code execution, data theft, or other compromises.
        *   **Dependency Confusion Success [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Organization uses internal/private crate registry with names that collide with public crates on crates.io. Cargo, due to misconfiguration or lack of precedence, fetches a malicious public crate instead of the intended private one.
            *   **Impact:** Application uses a malicious public dependency instead of the intended private one, leading to code execution, data theft, or other compromises.
        *   **Compromised Maintainer Upload [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Attacker compromises a legitimate crate maintainer's account on crates.io (e.g., via phishing, credential stuffing). The attacker then uploads a malicious version of the legitimate crate.
            *   **Impact:** Users updating to the compromised crate version unknowingly introduce malicious code into their applications.
    *   **Vulnerable Dependency Exploitation:**
        *   **Direct Dependency Exploit [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** A direct dependency listed in `Cargo.toml` has a known security vulnerability (e.g., listed in CVE databases, identified by `cargo audit`). Attacker exploits this vulnerability in the context of the application.
            *   **Impact:** Application is compromised due to the exploited vulnerability in a direct dependency. Potential impacts include Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), or data breaches.
        *   **Transitive Dependency Exploit [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** A transitive dependency (dependency of a dependency) has a known security vulnerability. Attacker exploits this vulnerability in the context of the application.
            *   **Impact:** Application is compromised due to the exploited vulnerability in a transitive dependency. Impacts are similar to direct dependency exploits (RCE, DoS, data breach).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Build Process](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_build_process.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Build Script Injection (`build.rs`):**
        *   **Dependency-Driven Build Script Injection Success [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** A malicious dependency contains a `build.rs` script with malicious code. When `cargo build` is executed, this malicious `build.rs` is executed.
            *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the build machine. If build artifacts are distributed, this can lead to supply chain compromise.
        *   **Local Build Script Modification Success [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Attacker gains access to a developer's machine or CI/CD environment and directly modifies the `build.rs` file in the project.
            *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the build machine. Potential to compromise build artifacts and the final application.
        *   **Env Var Build Script Injection Success [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Build script (`build.rs`) logic is vulnerable to manipulation via environment variables. Attacker controls environment variables used during the build process to inject malicious code or alter the build process.
            *   **Impact:** Build manipulation, potentially code execution on the build machine, depending on the vulnerability in the build script logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Cargo Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_cargo_configuration.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **`Cargo.toml` Manipulation:**
        *   **Cargo.toml Dependency Injection [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Attacker gains write access to the project repository (e.g., via compromised account, malicious PR) and modifies `Cargo.toml` to add malicious dependencies.
            *   **Impact:** Introduction of malicious dependencies into the application, leading to compromise.
        *   **Cargo.toml Build Config Manipulation [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Attacker gains write access to the project repository and modifies `Cargo.toml` to configure malicious build scripts or inject malicious build flags.
            *   **Impact:** Manipulation of the build process, potentially leading to code execution or the creation of vulnerable binaries.
    *   **`.cargo/config.toml` Manipulation:**
        *   **.cargo/config.toml Registry Redirection [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Attacker gains local access to a developer machine or shared configuration and modifies `.cargo/config.toml` to redirect crate registry URLs to a malicious registry under their control.
            *   **Impact:** Cargo fetches malicious crates from the attacker-controlled registry instead of crates.io or intended private registries, leading to application compromise.
        *   **.cargo/config.toml Build Flag Injection [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Attacker gains local access and modifies `.cargo/config.toml` to inject malicious compiler flags.
            *   **Impact:** Compiler executes malicious code during compilation or produces a vulnerable binary due to the injected flags.

This breakdown provides a focused view of the most critical attack paths and nodes within the Cargo ecosystem, enabling security efforts to be directed towards the highest-risk areas.
