# Threat Model Analysis for rust-lang/cargo

## Threat: [Dependency Confusion/Substitution Attacks](./threats/dependency_confusionsubstitution_attacks.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker registers a crate on a public registry (like crates.io) with a name similar to a private or internal dependency used by the target application. During dependency resolution, Cargo might mistakenly download and use this malicious crate instead of the intended private one.
*   **Impact:**  Execution of arbitrary malicious code within the application, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or complete system compromise.
*   **Cargo Component Affected:** Dependency Resolution, `Cargo.toml`
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use explicit and specific dependency versions in `Cargo.toml`.
    *   Utilize private registries or vendoring for internal dependencies.
    *   Regularly audit dependencies and their sources.
    *   Implement Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation and analysis.

## Threat: [Compromised Crates on Public Registries](./threats/compromised_crates_on_public_registries.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises a legitimate crate on a public registry (like crates.io), potentially through account takeover or supply chain injection. When the target application depends on this compromised crate, Cargo will download and use the malicious version.
*   **Impact:** Injection of malicious code into the application, leading to data breaches, service disruption, or system compromise.
*   **Cargo Component Affected:** Dependency Download, `crates.io` (or other registry)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully review crate maintainers and reputation before using them.
    *   Use tools like `cargo audit` to scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
    *   Pin dependency versions in `Cargo.toml` and regularly update with scrutiny.
    *   Consider using alternative registries with stricter security measures if available and suitable.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Dependencies](./threats/vulnerable_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** The application depends on crates that contain known security vulnerabilities. Cargo is used to download and manage these dependencies, making the application vulnerable if these dependencies are exploited.
*   **Impact:** Application compromise through exploitation of known vulnerabilities in dependencies, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or system takeover.
*   **Cargo Component Affected:** Dependency Management, Dependency Tree
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly use `cargo audit` to identify vulnerable dependencies.
    *   Keep dependencies updated to the latest secure versions.
    *   Monitor security advisories for crates used in the application.
    *   Replace vulnerable dependencies with secure alternatives if updates are unavailable.

## Threat: [Malicious Build Scripts (`build.rs`)](./threats/malicious_build_scripts___build_rs__.md)

*   **Description:** Crates can include `build.rs` files, which are executed as arbitrary Rust code by Cargo during the build process. Attackers can create malicious crates with `build.rs` scripts designed to perform harmful actions on the build machine when Cargo executes them.
*   **Impact:** Compromise of the build environment, potentially leading to data breaches, malware infection of build machines, or injection of malicious code into the final application binaries.
*   **Cargo Component Affected:** Build Process, `build.rs`
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Exercise extreme caution when using crates from untrusted sources.
    *   Review `build.rs` scripts of dependencies before use, especially from less reputable sources.
    *   Sandbox or isolate the build environment to limit the impact of malicious build scripts.
    *   Disable build script execution for untrusted dependencies if feasible (though might break functionality).
