  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: Cargo needs to authenticate users when publishing crates to crates.io. Implemented by crates.io authentication mechanisms (API keys, tokens).
    - Requirement: Securely store and manage authentication credentials used by developers for publishing. Responsibility of developers and their systems.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Crates.io needs to authorize users to publish crates under specific namespaces. Implemented by crates.io authorization system.
    - Requirement: Cargo needs to respect crates.io authorization policies when publishing and accessing crates. Implemented in cargo's interaction with crates.io API.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Cargo must validate all inputs, including command-line arguments, configuration files (Cargo.toml), and responses from crates.io, to prevent injection attacks and unexpected behavior. Implemented throughout cargo's codebase.
    - Requirement: Robust parsing and validation of crate metadata and dependency specifications to prevent malicious crates from exploiting vulnerabilities. Implemented in cargo's dependency resolution and metadata handling logic.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Use cryptography to verify the integrity and authenticity of downloaded crates. Implemented by cargo verifying checksums and signatures provided by crates.io.
    - Requirement: Securely handle cryptographic keys used for signing and verification. Implemented in crates.io infrastructure and cargo's verification process.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Building Rust projects: Cargo is essential for compiling and linking Rust code, which is the core process for any Rust development.
  - Dependency management: Cargo manages project dependencies, ensuring correct versions are downloaded and used, crucial for project stability and reproducibility.
  - Crate publishing and distribution: Cargo enables the Rust ecosystem by allowing developers to publish and share libraries (crates) through crates.io.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Source code of Cargo: High sensitivity. Compromise could lead to vulnerabilities in Cargo itself, affecting the entire Rust ecosystem.
  - Build artifacts of Cargo: High sensitivity. Compromised binaries could be distributed to users, leading to widespread impact.
  - Crates.io API keys and publishing credentials: High sensitivity. Compromise could allow unauthorized publishing of malicious crates.
  - Metadata of crates on crates.io: Medium sensitivity. Integrity of crate metadata is important for dependency resolution and security.
  - User configuration (Cargo.toml, .cargo config): Low to Medium sensitivity. May contain project-specific settings and potentially internal repository URLs.

  - Are there regular penetration tests or security audits conducted for Cargo and crates.io?
  - What is the process for handling and disclosing vulnerabilities found in Cargo or crates.io?
  - Are there specific security training programs for Cargo developers?

- Assumptions:
  - Cargo development follows secure coding practices.
  - The Rust project has a security-conscious culture.
  - Crates.io infrastructure is managed with security in mind.
  - The Rust community actively participates in security vulnerability reporting and mitigation.
  - The primary deployment method for Cargo is through the official Rust toolchain installers.
