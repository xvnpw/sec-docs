# Attack Surface Analysis for rust-lang/cargo

## Attack Surface: [1. Dependency Confusion/Typosquatting](./attack_surfaces/1__dependency_confusiontyposquatting.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers publish malicious crates with names similar to legitimate ones, hoping users will mistakenly depend on them.
*   **How Cargo Contributes to Attack Surface:** Cargo's dependency resolution mechanism relies on crate names specified in `Cargo.toml`. This makes it vulnerable to typosquatting attacks where similar-sounding malicious crate names can be easily substituted for intended legitimate ones.
*   **Example:** A developer intends to use the popular crate `regex` but accidentally types `regrex` in their `Cargo.toml` file. An attacker has published a malicious crate named `regrex` on crates.io. Cargo, following the instructions in `Cargo.toml`, downloads and includes the malicious `regrex` crate instead of the intended `regex` crate.
*   **Impact:** Supply chain compromise, malicious code execution during the build process or runtime, potential data exfiltration, and system compromise depending on the malicious payload within the typosquatted crate.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Careful Crate Name Verification:** Double-check and meticulously verify crate names in `Cargo.toml` to prevent typos.
    *   **Explicit Versioning:** Specify precise and explicit versions for dependencies in `Cargo.toml` to reduce ambiguity and potential for accidental inclusion of unintended crates.
    *   **Dependency Review and Auditing:** Regularly review project dependencies and their sources. Utilize dependency scanning tools to detect potential typosquatting or suspicious crate names.
    *   **Use Fully Qualified Names (where applicable):** If using alternative registries, use fully qualified crate names including the registry source to avoid confusion.

## Attack Surface: [2. Malicious Crates in Registries (Supply Chain Attacks)](./attack_surfaces/2__malicious_crates_in_registries__supply_chain_attacks_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers upload crates containing malicious code to public or private registries like crates.io, aiming to compromise projects that depend on these crates.
*   **How Cargo Contributes to Attack Surface:** Cargo's core functionality is to download and integrate crates from registries. This direct dependency on external code sources makes projects inherently vulnerable if malicious crates are introduced into the dependency chain.
*   **Example:** An attacker uploads a crate named `harmless-logger` to crates.io. This crate appears to be a simple logging utility but contains hidden malicious code in its `build.rs` script or within its library code that exfiltrates sensitive environment variables or injects backdoors into compiled binaries during the build process of projects that depend on it.
*   **Impact:** Supply chain compromise, widespread malicious code execution across projects using the malicious crate, potential data breaches, and system-wide compromise for applications built with the infected dependency.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Auditing and Security Scanning:** Regularly audit project dependencies for known vulnerabilities and suspicious code. Employ security scanning tools that analyze dependencies for vulnerabilities and potentially malicious patterns.
    *   **Crate Source Code Review:** For critical projects or sensitive dependencies, review the source code of dependencies, especially focusing on `build.rs` scripts and any unusual or obfuscated code.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Build Process:** Run the Cargo build process with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the potential damage from malicious code execution during the build.
    *   **Reputable Crate Sources:** Prefer well-known, actively maintained crates with strong community reputations and established trust. Be cautious of newly published or obscure crates, especially from unknown authors.
    *   **Dependency Pinning and `Cargo.lock`:** Utilize `Cargo.lock` to ensure reproducible builds and prevent unexpected dependency version changes that could introduce malicious versions.

## Attack Surface: [3. Compromised Registry Infrastructure (crates.io or Mirrors)](./attack_surfaces/3__compromised_registry_infrastructure__crates_io_or_mirrors_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers compromise the infrastructure of crates.io or its mirrors, enabling them to replace legitimate crates with malicious versions at the source.
*   **How Cargo Contributes to Attack Surface:** Cargo directly relies on the integrity and availability of crates.io and its mirrors to download dependencies. If this infrastructure is compromised, Cargo will unknowingly fetch and integrate malicious crates.
*   **Example:** Attackers successfully compromise a mirror of crates.io. They replace the widely used `serde` crate on this mirror with a modified version containing a backdoor. Developers using this compromised mirror will download the malicious `serde` crate when building their projects, leading to widespread supply chain compromise.
*   **Impact:** Widespread and potentially silent supply chain compromise affecting a large number of projects relying on crates downloaded during the period of infrastructure compromise. This can lead to massive scale malicious code injection and system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use crates.io Directly (HTTPS):** Configure Cargo to primarily use the official crates.io registry over HTTPS, minimizing reliance on potentially less secure mirrors.
    *   **Content Delivery Network (CDN) Security Awareness:** Rely on the security measures implemented by crates.io's CDN provider. While users have limited direct control, understanding that crates.io utilizes CDN security is important.
    *   **Dependency Verification (Future Features):** Stay informed about and utilize any future Cargo features that implement cryptographic verification of downloaded crates to ensure authenticity and integrity.
    *   **Network Security Monitoring:** Implement network security monitoring to detect suspicious activity or anomalies during dependency download processes.

## Attack Surface: [4. `build.rs` Script Execution](./attack_surfaces/4___build_rs__script_execution.md)

*   **Description:** `build.rs` scripts are executed by Cargo during the build process and can perform arbitrary system commands. Malicious crates can leverage `build.rs` to execute malicious code on the developer's machine or build environment.
*   **How Cargo Contributes to Attack Surface:** Cargo's `build.rs` feature, designed for custom build logic, provides a powerful but potentially dangerous mechanism for dependencies to execute code during the build. This introduces a significant attack surface if dependencies are untrusted or compromised.
*   **Example:** A malicious crate includes a `build.rs` script that, when executed by Cargo during `cargo build`, downloads and executes a second-stage payload from a remote server. This payload could be ransomware, a cryptocurrency miner, or any other form of malware, directly compromising the developer's system.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution during the build process, potentially leading to immediate system compromise, data exfiltration, installation of malware, or build-time attacks that modify the resulting binaries.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Thorough Code Review of `build.rs`:**  Carefully and rigorously review the source code of `build.rs` scripts in all dependencies, especially for untrusted or less familiar crates. Look for suspicious commands, network requests, file system manipulations, or any obfuscated code.
    *   **Disable `build.rs` Execution (Where Possible and Safe):** If `build.rs` is not strictly necessary for a dependency, consider disabling its execution. However, be aware that this might break the build process for some crates.
    *   **Sandboxing Build Process:** Run the Cargo build process within a sandboxed environment or container to limit the potential impact of malicious code executed by `build.rs` scripts. This can restrict access to sensitive system resources and isolate the build environment.
    *   **Static Analysis of `build.rs` Scripts:** Utilize static analysis tools to automatically scan `build.rs` scripts for suspicious patterns, potentially malicious code constructs, or known security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Build Environment:** Ensure the build environment has only the necessary permissions and access rights, minimizing the potential damage if a malicious `build.rs` script is executed.
