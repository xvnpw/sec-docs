# Threat Model Analysis for rust-lang/cargo

## Threat: [Malicious Build Script (`build.rs`) Execution](./threats/malicious_build_script___build_rs___execution.md)

**Description:** A dependency includes a `build.rs` file that contains malicious code. This code is executed *by Cargo* during the `cargo build` process with the privileges of the user running the build. The attacker might use this to steal secrets, modify the build output, or install malware. This is a *direct* threat because Cargo is the component executing the untrusted code.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Compromise of the build environment (developer machine or build server).
    *   Theft of secrets (API keys, SSH keys) from the build environment.
    *   Modification of the build output, potentially injecting malicious code into the final binary.
    *   Installation of malware on the build machine.

*   **Affected Cargo Component:**
    *   `build.rs` execution during `cargo build`.
    *   Cargo's build process *itself*.

*   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Sandboxing:** Run `cargo build` within a sandboxed environment (e.g., Docker container, VM) to limit the impact of malicious code. This is the most effective mitigation.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Run `cargo build` with a user account that has minimal privileges.

## Threat: [Compromised crates.io Registry](./threats/compromised_crates_io_registry.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the *crates.io infrastructure* and replaces legitimate packages with malicious versions or modifies package metadata. This is a direct threat to Cargo because crates.io is the *official* and *default* package registry used by Cargo. Cargo *directly* interacts with crates.io to download dependencies.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Widespread distribution of malicious code to Rust developers and applications using Cargo.
    *   Loss of trust in the Rust ecosystem.
    *   Potential for significant damage to many systems.

*   **Affected Cargo Component:**
    *   `crates.io` registry (Cargo's default registry).
    *   Cargo's dependency resolution and download mechanisms *that interact with crates.io*.

*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (but low probability)

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mirroring (Advanced):** Maintain a local mirror of crates.io for greater control. This is a significant undertaking.
    *   **Trust in Rust Security Practices:** Rely on the Rust project's security measures for crates.io. This is a fundamental reliance.
    *   **Crate Signing (Future):** Signed crates will significantly mitigate this threat once fully implemented. This is a future Cargo feature.
