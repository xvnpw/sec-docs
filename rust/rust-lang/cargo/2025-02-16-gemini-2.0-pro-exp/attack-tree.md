[1.1 Typosquatting]***!!!        [1.3 Malicious Package Published]***!!!

## Attack Tree Path: [[1. Compromise Dependencies] !!!](./attack_tree_paths/_1__compromise_dependencies__!!!.md)

*   **Description:** This is the overarching critical node representing the attacker's strategy of introducing malicious code through the application's dependencies. It's the primary attack vector for achieving the overall goal.
    *   **Why Critical:** Compromising dependencies provides a direct path to injecting arbitrary code into the application, making it a highly effective and therefore critical attack vector.

## Attack Tree Path: [[1.1 Typosquatting] ***!!!](./attack_tree_paths/_1_1_typosquatting__!!!.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker publishes a malicious package with a name very similar to a legitimate, popular package (e.g., `reqwest` vs. `reqwests`). A developer mistakenly includes the malicious package due to a typo or oversight.
    *   **Why High-Risk:** This attack is relatively easy to execute and relies on common human error, making it a high-probability threat.
    *   **Why Critical:** Successful execution directly leads to the inclusion of malicious code, granting the attacker significant control over the application.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Careful Dependency Specification: Double-check package names and versions.
        *   Dependency Locking: Use and commit `Cargo.lock`.
        *   Package Auditing: Use `cargo audit`.
        *   Consider Private Registry: Use a private registry to vet packages.
        *   Use `cargo-crev`: Review community trust ratings.

## Attack Tree Path: [[1.3 Malicious Package Published (Compromised Upstream)] ***!!!](./attack_tree_paths/_1_3_malicious_package_published__compromised_upstream___!!!.md)

*   **Description:** A legitimate, previously trusted package is compromised (e.g., maintainer account hacked, malicious contributor). A new version containing malicious code is published.
    *   **Why High-Risk:** While less frequent than typosquatting, the impact can be widespread, affecting many applications that depend on the compromised package.
    *   **Why Critical:** This attack, like typosquatting, directly introduces malicious code into the application.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** Varies Greatly
    *   **Skill Level:** Varies Greatly
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Dependency Locking: Use `Cargo.lock` (but update regularly).
        *   `cargo audit`: Check for known vulnerabilities.
        *   `cargo crev`: Use community trust ratings.
        *   Vendor Dependencies (with caution): For critical dependencies.
        *   Code Review: Review dependency source code, especially after updates.
