## Deep Analysis: Path Traversal via Router Misconfiguration in Actix Web Application

This document provides a deep analysis of the "Path Traversal via Router Misconfiguration" threat within an Actix Web application. We will delve into the technical details, potential attack vectors, impact, and specific mitigation strategies relevant to Actix Web's routing mechanism.

**1. Threat Breakdown:**

* **Core Vulnerability:** The fundamental issue is that the `actix_web::App` router, responsible for mapping incoming HTTP requests to specific handlers, is configured in a way that allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions and access resources outside the designated web application root. This occurs when route definitions are overly permissive or lack proper input validation.

* **Mechanism:** Attackers exploit this by crafting malicious URLs containing path traversal sequences like `../`, `..%2f`, or other encoded variations. If the router doesn't correctly normalize or validate these paths, it might resolve them to locations outside the intended scope.

* **Actix Web Specifics:** Actix Web's routing relies on pattern matching against the incoming request path. The flexibility of its route definition system, while powerful, can be a source of vulnerabilities if not used carefully. Key areas of concern include:
    * **Wildcards (`{}`):**  While useful for capturing path segments, overly broad wildcards (e.g., `/{path:.*}`) can capture traversal sequences.
    * **Order of Route Definitions:**  The order in which routes are defined matters. A more general route defined before a more specific one might inadvertently handle requests it shouldn't.
    * **Lack of Implicit Sanitization:** Actix Web does not automatically sanitize path segments. Developers are responsible for implementing this.

**2. Attack Vectors and Scenarios:**

* **Basic `../` Injection:**  The most common attack vector. An attacker might try URLs like `/static/../../../etc/passwd` to access system files.

* **URL Encoding:** Attackers can use URL encoding (e.g., `%2e%2e%2f` for `../`) to bypass simple string-based filtering. Actix Web will decode these before routing.

* **Double Encoding:** In some cases, double encoding might be attempted, although Actix Web's default behavior might mitigate this. However, it's worth considering in complex scenarios.

* **Case Sensitivity:**  Depending on the underlying operating system and file system, case sensitivity might play a role. Attackers might try variations in case (e.g., `..%2F`) if the server environment is case-insensitive.

* **Exploiting Broad Wildcards:**  Consider a route like `/files/{filepath:.*}` intended to serve files from a specific directory. An attacker could use `/files/../../../etc/passwd` if the handler doesn't validate `filepath`.

* **Vulnerable Static File Serving:** If `actix_files::Files` is used to serve static content without proper restrictions on the root directory, path traversal is highly likely.

**3. Impact Analysis:**

The impact of a successful path traversal attack can be severe:

* **Exposure of Sensitive Data:** Attackers can access configuration files (containing database credentials, API keys), source code, application data, and even system files.

* **Information Disclosure:**  Revealing internal application structure and file paths can aid in further attacks.

* **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** If the attacker can access uploaded files (e.g., through a vulnerable upload mechanism) and then execute them (e.g., by accessing a PHP file), it can lead to full system compromise.

* **Denial of Service (DoS):** In some scenarios, accessing certain system files repeatedly could potentially lead to resource exhaustion and DoS.

* **Reputation Damage:**  A security breach of this nature can severely damage the reputation and trustworthiness of the application and the organization.

* **Compliance Violations:**  Accessing and exposing sensitive data can lead to violations of data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

**4. Root Cause Analysis in Actix Web Context:**

* **Overly Permissive Route Definitions:**  Using broad wildcards without proper validation is a primary cause. For example, `/api/{resource:.*}` could allow access to unintended resources.

* **Lack of Input Sanitization:**  Failing to sanitize and validate path parameters extracted from the URL before using them to access files or directories.

* **Incorrect Use of `actix_files::Files`:**  Specifying an overly broad root directory or not restricting access within the served directory.

* **Misunderstanding Route Matching Order:**  Defining a general route before a specific one can lead to unintended handling of requests.

* **Developer Error:**  Simple mistakes in route configuration or a lack of awareness of path traversal vulnerabilities.

**5. Detailed Mitigation Strategies for Actix Web:**

* **Define Specific and Restrictive Route Patterns:**
    * **Avoid overly broad wildcards:**  Instead of `/files/{path:.*}`, define more specific routes like `/files/{filename}` and handle subdirectories explicitly if needed, with validation.
    * **Use path segment matching:**  If you expect a specific number of path segments, define your routes accordingly (e.g., `/user/{id}`).
    * **Prioritize specific routes over general ones:**  Ensure that more specific routes are defined before more general ones to avoid accidental matching.

* **Avoid Using Overly Broad Wildcards in Route Definitions:**
    * If wildcards are necessary, implement strict validation on the captured path segments. For instance, check if the path starts with the expected base directory and doesn't contain `..`.
    * Consider using regular expressions within route definitions for more granular control over accepted paths.

* **Sanitize and Validate User-Provided Input that Influences Routing:**
    * **Canonicalization:** Convert the input path to its canonical form to resolve any encoding or symbolic links.
    * **Path Normalization:** Remove redundant separators (`//`), resolve `.` and `..` sequences. Be cautious with naive string replacement, as it can be bypassed. Consider using libraries specifically designed for path manipulation.
    * **Whitelist Validation:**  Compare the resolved path against a whitelist of allowed directories or files.
    * **Blacklist Avoidance:**  While blacklisting `..` is a common approach, it's not foolproof as attackers can use encoding or other techniques to bypass it. Whitelisting is generally more secure.
    * **Actix Web Guards:** Leverage Actix Web's guard feature to implement custom logic for validating incoming requests before they reach the handler. This allows for more complex validation based on path segments.

* **Regularly Review Route Configurations:**
    * **Code Reviews:**  Include route definitions in regular code reviews, specifically looking for overly permissive patterns.
    * **Security Audits:**  Conduct periodic security audits, including penetration testing, to identify potential path traversal vulnerabilities.
    * **Automated Scanners:**  Utilize static analysis security testing (SAST) tools that can identify potential issues in route configurations.

* **Secure Static File Serving with `actix_files::Files`:**
    * **Restrict the root directory:**  Carefully choose the root directory for serving static files, ensuring it only contains the intended content and nothing sensitive.
    * **Disable directory listing:**  Prevent attackers from browsing directory contents if they can't directly access a file.
    * **Consider authentication and authorization:**  If the static files contain sensitive information, implement authentication and authorization to control access.

* **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant the application only the necessary file system permissions. Avoid running the application with root privileges.

* **Implement Logging and Monitoring:**
    * Log all requests, including the requested path.
    * Monitor logs for suspicious patterns like repeated attempts to access files outside the expected scope.
    * Set up alerts for potential path traversal attempts.

* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While not a direct mitigation for path traversal, a well-configured CSP can help mitigate the impact if an attacker manages to inject malicious scripts by limiting the sources from which the browser can load resources.

**6. Example of Vulnerable and Secure Code (Illustrative):**

**Vulnerable:**

```rust
use actix_web::{web, App, HttpServer, Responder};

async fn serve_file(path: web::Path<String>) -> impl Responder {
    let file_path = format!("./uploads/{}", path.into_inner()); // Potentially vulnerable
    match std::fs::read_to_string(file_path) {
        Ok(content) => content,
        Err(_) => "File not found".to_string(),
    }
}

#[actix_web::main]
async fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    HttpServer::new(|| {
        App::new()
            .route("/files/{path:.*}", web::get().to(serve_file))
    })
    .bind("127.0.0.1:8080")?
    .run()
    .await
}
```

**Secure (Illustrative):**

```rust
use actix_web::{web, App, HttpServer, Responder};
use std::path::{Path, PathBuf};

async fn serve_file(path: web::Path<String>) -> impl Responder {
    let requested_path = path.into_inner();
    let base_dir = PathBuf::from("./uploads");
    let safe_path = base_dir.join(requested_path);

    // Canonicalize and check if the resolved path is still within the base directory
    if safe_path.canonicalize().ok().and_then(|p| p.starts_with(base_dir.canonicalize().ok()?)).unwrap_or(false) {
        match std::fs::read_to_string(safe_path) {
            Ok(content) => content,
            Err(_) => "File not found".to_string(),
        }
    } else {
        "Access denied".to_string()
    }
}

#[actix_web::main]
async fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    HttpServer::new(|| {
        App::new()
            .route("/files/{path}", web::get().to(serve_file)) // More specific route
    })
    .bind("127.0.0.1:8080")?
    .run()
    .await
}
```
