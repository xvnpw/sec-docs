# Threat Model Analysis for actix/actix-web

## Threat: [Path Traversal via Router Misconfiguration](./threats/path_traversal_via_router_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates the URL path, potentially by injecting `../` sequences or similar patterns, to access files or directories outside the intended web application root. This is possible if route definitions within `actix_web::App` are too broad or don't properly sanitize input before path matching.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files (configuration files, source code, data), potential for arbitrary code execution if uploaded files can be accessed and executed.
*   **Affected Component:** `actix_web::App` (route definition and matching logic).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Define specific and restrictive route patterns.
    *   Avoid using overly broad wildcards in route definitions.
    *   Sanitize and validate user-provided input that influences routing.
    *   Regularly review route configurations.

## Threat: [Data Races in Shared Application State](./threats/data_races_in_shared_application_state.md)

*   **Description:** Multiple asynchronous handlers access and modify shared mutable state (managed via `actix_web::web::Data`) concurrently without proper synchronization mechanisms (e.g., Mutex, RwLock). This can lead to unpredictable behavior, data corruption, and potentially exploitable vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, inconsistent application state, potential for security breaches due to incorrect data handling.
*   **Affected Component:** `actix_web::web::Data`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use appropriate synchronization primitives (e.g., `Mutex`, `RwLock`) to protect shared mutable state.
    *   Minimize the use of mutable shared state if possible. Consider using immutable data structures or message passing.
    *   Thoroughly test concurrent access to shared state.

## Threat: [Middleware Order Bypass](./threats/middleware_order_bypass.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker might craft requests that exploit the order of middleware execution within `actix_web::App`. For example, if an authentication middleware is placed after a middleware that modifies the request in a way that bypasses authentication checks, the attacker can gain unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:** Bypassing security controls, unauthorized access to resources.
*   **Affected Component:** `actix_web::App` (middleware registration order).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully plan and document the order of middleware execution.
    *   Ensure that security-related middleware is executed early in the request processing pipeline.
    *   Thoroughly test middleware interactions.

## Threat: [WebSocket Message Injection](./threats/websocket_message_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends malicious or unexpected data through a WebSocket connection established using `actix_web::web::WebSocket`. If the application doesn't properly validate and sanitize incoming WebSocket messages, it could lead to various vulnerabilities, such as command injection (if the message is interpreted as a command) or data manipulation.
*   **Impact:**  Depending on the application logic, this could lead to data breaches, unauthorized actions, or even remote code execution.
*   **Affected Component:** `actix_web::web::Payload` (for raw messages), custom WebSocket handling logic built on top of Actix-Web's WebSocket support.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all data received through WebSocket connections.
    *   Implement proper authorization and authentication for WebSocket connections.
    *   Use secure protocols (WSS) for WebSocket communication.

## Threat: [Multipart Form Data Bomb (DoS)](./threats/multipart_form_data_bomb__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads a large number of files or excessively large files through a multipart form handled by `actix_multipart::Multipart`. If the application doesn't enforce appropriate limits, this can consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory, disk space), leading to a denial-of-service.
*   **Impact:** Application unavailability, server resource exhaustion.
*   **Affected Component:** `actix_multipart::Multipart`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Set limits on the maximum size of individual files.
    *   Set limits on the total size of the multipart request.
    *   Set limits on the number of files allowed in a single request.
    *   Implement timeouts for file uploads.
