## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Request Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_request_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

*   This is a critical area as it represents the initial interaction point with the application. Weaknesses in how Actix-Web applications process incoming HTTP requests can be easily exploited.
    *   **Malformed Header Injection:**
        *   This attack involves sending requests with specially crafted HTTP headers.
        *   **Send Request with Crafted Headers:** Attackers manipulate header values to bypass security checks, inject malicious content, or cause errors in the application's logic. This can lead to various vulnerabilities depending on how the application processes headers.
    *   **Body Parsing Vulnerabilities:**
        *   These vulnerabilities arise from how the application parses the request body.
        *   **Send Request with Unexpected or Malicious Content-Type:** Attackers send requests with content types that the application is not expecting or that contain malicious data. This can lead to denial of service, resource exhaustion, or even code execution if the parsing library has vulnerabilities.
        *   **Send Oversized Request Body:** Attackers send requests with excessively large bodies to overwhelm the server's resources, leading to denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit State Management Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_state_management_vulnerabilities.md)

*   This critical area focuses on vulnerabilities in how the application manages user sessions and other state information.
    *   **Session Fixation:**
        *   This attack targets the session management mechanism.
        *   **Force User to Use a Known Session ID:** Attackers trick a user into using a session ID that the attacker already knows. Once the user logs in with this fixed session ID, the attacker can hijack their session and gain unauthorized access to their account.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Middleware Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_middleware_vulnerabilities.md)

*   Middleware components in Actix-Web applications often implement crucial security controls like authentication and authorization.
    *   **Middleware Bypass:**
        *   This attack aims to circumvent the logic implemented in middleware.
        *   **Craft Requests to Circumvent Middleware Logic:** Attackers carefully craft requests to bypass the checks and processing performed by middleware components. This can lead to bypassing authentication, authorization, or other security measures, granting unauthorized access or allowing malicious actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Default Configurations or Missing Security Features](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_default_configurations_or_missing_security_features.md)

*   This critical area highlights the importance of proper security configuration.
    *   **Missing Security Headers:**
        *   This vulnerability arises from the application not setting important HTTP security headers.
        *   **Application Does Not Set Important Security Headers (e.g., HSTS, Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options):** The absence of these headers leaves the application vulnerable to various client-side attacks. For example, missing `Content-Security-Policy` makes the application susceptible to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and missing `X-Frame-Options` can lead to Clickjacking attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies.md)

*   While not a direct vulnerability in Actix-Web itself, the dependencies used by the application can introduce significant security risks.
    *   **Vulnerable Dependencies:**
        *   This vulnerability occurs when the application uses outdated or vulnerable third-party libraries.
        *   **Use Actix-Web with Outdated or Vulnerable Dependencies:** If the application uses Actix-Web with dependencies that have known security vulnerabilities, attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the application. This emphasizes the importance of regularly updating dependencies and using security scanning tools.
