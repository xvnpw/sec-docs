# Threat Model Analysis for actix/actix-web

## Threat: [Header Parsing Vulnerabilities](./threats/header_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts and sends HTTP requests with malformed, oversized, or specially crafted headers. This can exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying HTTP parsing library used by Actix Web, potentially leading to a denial-of-service by crashing the server process or causing it to consume excessive resources. The attacker might also be able to trigger unexpected behavior or bypass security checks if the parsing library mishandles certain header values.

**Impact:** Denial of service (application becomes unavailable), resource exhaustion (high CPU/memory usage), potential for bypassing security checks if header parsing is flawed.

**Affected Actix Web Component:** `actix-http` (underlying HTTP implementation), specifically the header parsing logic.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Actix Web and its dependencies, especially `actix-http`, updated to the latest versions to benefit from security patches.
*   Configure web servers or load balancers in front of the Actix Web application to enforce header size limits and reject obviously malformed requests before they reach the application.
*   Consider using a web application firewall (WAF) that can inspect and filter malicious HTTP headers.

## Threat: [Body Parsing Resource Exhaustion](./threats/body_parsing_resource_exhaustion.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends requests with extremely large or deeply nested request bodies (e.g., JSON or form data). If the application doesn't have proper limits configured, Actix Web's body parsing mechanisms might consume excessive memory or CPU resources, leading to a denial-of-service.

**Impact:** Denial of service (application becomes unresponsive), resource exhaustion (high memory usage, CPU spikes).

**Affected Actix Web Component:** `actix-web::web::Json`, `actix-web::web::Form`, `actix-web::web::Bytes` (body extractors).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Configure limits for request body sizes using `App::configure` and the appropriate extractor configurations (e.g., `JsonConfig::limit`).
*   Consider using streaming body processing for very large requests instead of loading the entire body into memory.
*   Implement timeouts for request processing to prevent indefinitely long operations.

## Threat: [Multipart Form Handling Vulnerabilities (File Uploads)](./threats/multipart_form_handling_vulnerabilities__file_uploads_.md)

**Description:** An attacker uploads malicious files (e.g., with dangerous extensions or containing malware) or exploits vulnerabilities in how the application handles multipart form data. This could include bypassing size limits, uploading files to unintended locations, or exploiting vulnerabilities in libraries used for file processing.

**Impact:** Arbitrary file upload, potential for remote code execution if uploaded files are executed, denial of service by filling up disk space, introduction of malware.

**Affected Actix Web Component:** `actix-multipart`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict validation of uploaded file types and extensions. Use allow-lists instead of deny-lists.
*   Enforce strict file size limits for uploads.
*   Store uploaded files in a secure location outside the web server's document root.
*   Generate unique and unpredictable filenames for uploaded files.
*   Scan uploaded files for malware before processing them.
*   Avoid directly executing uploaded files.

## Threat: [Request Guard Logic Errors Leading to Authorization Bypass](./threats/request_guard_logic_errors_leading_to_authorization_bypass.md)

**Description:** Developers implement custom request guards to control access to specific routes. If the logic within these guards is flawed or contains vulnerabilities, an attacker might be able to bypass the intended authorization checks and access protected resources or functionalities.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionalities, privilege escalation.

**Affected Actix Web Component:** `actix-web::guard`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly test and review the logic of custom request guards.
*   Follow secure coding practices when implementing authorization logic.
*   Consider using established authorization libraries or patterns instead of implementing custom logic from scratch.
*   Ensure that guards cover all necessary access control requirements.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Middleware](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_custom_middleware.md)

**Description:** Developers create custom middleware to handle specific request processing tasks. If this middleware contains security vulnerabilities (e.g., improper input validation, logging sensitive information, or flawed authorization logic), it can introduce security risks to the entire application or specific routes it applies to.

**Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability in the middleware, but can include information disclosure, authorization bypass, or denial of service.

**Affected Actix Web Component:** `actix-web::middleware`.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be high or critical depending on the vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Follow secure coding practices when developing custom middleware.
*   Thoroughly test custom middleware for potential vulnerabilities.
*   Avoid performing security-sensitive operations directly within middleware if possible; delegate to well-tested components.
*   Regularly review and update custom middleware.

## Threat: [WebSocket Message Handling Vulnerabilities](./threats/websocket_message_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Similar to HTTP request handling vulnerabilities, improper handling of WebSocket messages can lead to issues like command injection, cross-site scripting (if messages are displayed in a web interface), or denial of service if the application doesn't properly validate or sanitize incoming messages.

**Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but can include remote code execution, cross-site scripting, or denial of service.

**Affected Actix Web Component:** `actix-web-actors::ws` or custom WebSocket handling logic.

**Risk Severity:** Medium to High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all data received via WebSocket messages.
*   Avoid directly executing commands based on WebSocket input without proper sanitization.
*   If displaying WebSocket messages in a web interface, implement proper output encoding to prevent XSS.
*   Implement rate limiting and connection limits for WebSocket connections to prevent abuse.
