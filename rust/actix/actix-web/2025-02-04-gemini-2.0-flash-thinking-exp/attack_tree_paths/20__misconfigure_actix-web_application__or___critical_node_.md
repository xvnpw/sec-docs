    async fn index() -> impl Responder {
        "Hello, world!"
    }

    #[actix_web::main]
    async fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
        HttpServer::new(|| {
            App::new()
                .wrap(middleware::DefaultHeaders::new()
                    .header(header::CONTENT_SECURITY_POLICY, "default-src 'self'")) // Example CSP
                .wrap(middleware::DefaultHeaders::new()
                    .header(header::X_FRAME_OPTIONS, "DENY"))
                .wrap(middleware::DefaultHeaders::new()
                    .header(header::X_CONTENT_TYPE_OPTIONS, "nosniff"))
                .wrap(middleware::DefaultHeaders::new()
                    .header(header::STRICT_TRANSPORT_SECURITY, "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload")) // HSTS
                .wrap(middleware::DefaultHeaders::new()
                    .header(header::REFERRER_POLICY, "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"))
