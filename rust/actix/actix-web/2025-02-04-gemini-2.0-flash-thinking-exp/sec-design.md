# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security Controls:
  - security control: Memory Safety: Rust's core language features provide inherent memory safety, reducing vulnerabilities like buffer overflows and use-after-free errors. Implemented by Rust compiler.
  - security control: Type System: Rust's strong type system helps prevent type-related errors that can lead to security issues. Implemented by Rust compiler.
  - security control: Dependency Management: Cargo, Rust's package manager, facilitates dependency management and versioning, aiding in controlling dependency-related risks. Implemented by Cargo.
  - security control: HTTPS Support: `actix-web` supports HTTPS for secure communication. Implemented within `actix-web` and underlying libraries like `tokio-rustls` or `native-tls`.
  - security control: Middleware: `actix-web` provides middleware functionality that can be used to implement security features like authentication, authorization, and request logging. Implemented within `actix-web`.
  - security control: Community Review: As an open-source project, the code is subject to community review, which can help identify potential security vulnerabilities. Implemented by GitHub and community contribution process.

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Dependency Vulnerabilities: Despite dependency management, vulnerabilities can still exist in dependencies, requiring monitoring and updates.
  - accepted risk: Logic Errors: Application-level logic errors introduced by developers using `actix-web` are outside the scope of the framework's direct control.
  - accepted risk: Denial of Service: Web applications are inherently susceptible to denial-of-service attacks, and `actix-web` applications are no exception.
  - accepted risk: Configuration Errors: Misconfiguration of `actix-web` or the underlying deployment environment can introduce security vulnerabilities.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST): Integrate SAST tools into the development pipeline to automatically scan the `actix-web` codebase for potential vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Dependency Scanning: Implement automated dependency scanning to detect and alert on known vulnerabilities in `actix-web`'s dependencies.
  - security control: Fuzzing: Employ fuzzing techniques to automatically test `actix-web` for unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities by providing invalid or malformed inputs.
  - security control: Security Audits: Conduct periodic security audits by external security experts to identify and address potential security weaknesses in the framework.
  - security control: Security Training for Contributors: Provide security training to contributors to raise awareness of secure coding practices and common web security vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Vulnerability Disclosure Policy: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure policy to guide security researchers and users on how to report potential security issues.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: `actix-web` should provide mechanisms and guidance for implementing various authentication methods (e.g., session-based, token-based) in applications built with it.
  - Authorization: The framework should facilitate the implementation of fine-grained authorization controls to manage access to resources and functionalities within applications.
  - Input Validation: `actix-web` should encourage and provide tools for developers to perform robust input validation to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting). Middleware and request guards are relevant here.
  - Cryptography: `actix-web` should support and recommend best practices for using cryptography for protecting sensitive data in transit and at rest. This includes TLS/HTTPS configuration and guidance on using cryptographic libraries for application-level encryption.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Secure and reliable delivery of web applications built using `actix-web`.
  - Maintaining the reputation and trust of the `actix-web` framework and its community.
  - Ensuring the performance and stability of applications built with `actix-web`.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Source code of `actix-web`: High sensitivity. Confidentiality and integrity are crucial to prevent unauthorized modifications or exposure of vulnerabilities.
  - Framework binaries and libraries: Medium sensitivity. Integrity is important to ensure users are using trusted and unmodified components.
  - User data in applications built with `actix-web`: Sensitivity varies greatly depending on the application. Could range from low (public data) to high (personal identifiable information, financial data). `actix-web` itself does not directly handle user data, but applications built with it do. The framework's security impacts the security of this data indirectly.
