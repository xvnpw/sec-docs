# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for actix/actix-web

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Request Body Size Limits](./mitigation_strategies/implement_request_body_size_limits.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Endpoints:** Analyze your actix-web application and identify endpoints that handle request bodies (e.g., POST, PUT, PATCH).
    2.  **Determine Appropriate Limits:** For each endpoint, determine the maximum expected size of the request body based on its functionality. Consider the data being uploaded or processed.
    3.  **Configure `client_max_body_size`:** In your `HttpServer` configuration within your `main.rs` or server setup file, use the `.client_max_body_size(limit)` method.  The `limit` should be set in bytes.
    4.  **Apply Globally or Per-Service:** You can set a global limit for the entire server or configure different limits for specific services or routes using service factories and configurations.
    5.  **Test and Adjust:** Thoroughly test your application with requests exceeding the configured limits to ensure the server correctly rejects oversized requests with appropriate error responses (e.g., 413 Payload Too Large). Adjust limits as needed based on testing and application requirements.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Large Payloads (High Severity):** Attackers can send extremely large requests to exhaust server memory and processing resources, leading to service unavailability.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (High Severity):**  Uncontrolled request body sizes can lead to excessive memory consumption, potentially crashing the application or impacting performance for legitimate users.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS via Large Payloads (High Impact):** Effectively prevents DoS attacks based on sending oversized requests.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (High Impact):** Significantly reduces the risk of resource exhaustion due to uncontrolled request body sizes.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Yes, globally in `src/main.rs` within the `HttpServer` configuration.
    *   Example: `.client_max_body_size(262144)` (256KB limit).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Per-service or per-route specific limits are not yet implemented.  Different endpoints might require different limits (e.g., image upload vs. text-based API).


## Mitigation Strategy: [Apply Rate Limiting](./mitigation_strategies/apply_rate_limiting.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose Rate Limiting Middleware/Library:** Select a suitable rate limiting middleware for actix-web, such as `actix-web-middleware-rate-limit` or implement custom logic using actix-web's middleware capabilities.
    2.  **Configure Rate Limits:** Define rate limits based on your application's needs. Consider factors like requests per minute/second, burst limits, and different limits for different endpoints or user roles.
    3.  **Integrate Middleware:** Add the chosen rate limiting middleware to your actix-web application using `.wrap()` in your `App` configuration.
    4.  **Customize Configuration:** Configure the middleware with your defined rate limits, key extraction logic (e.g., based on IP address or user ID), and response behavior when limits are exceeded (e.g., 429 Too Many Requests).
    5.  **Test and Monitor:** Test the rate limiting implementation to ensure it functions as expected and doesn't negatively impact legitimate users. Monitor rate limiting metrics to identify potential attacks or adjust limits as needed.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from rapidly attempting password guessing or other brute-force attacks by limiting request frequency.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Request Flooding (High Severity):** Mitigates DoS attacks where attackers flood the server with excessive requests from a single or multiple sources.
    *   **API Abuse (Medium Severity):**  Reduces the risk of API abuse by limiting the number of API calls a user or client can make within a given timeframe.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (High Impact):**  Significantly hinders brute-force attempts, making them impractical.
    *   **DoS via Request Flooding (High Impact):**  Effectively mitigates simple request flooding DoS attacks. More sophisticated distributed DoS attacks might require additional mitigation layers.
    *   **API Abuse (Medium Impact):**  Reduces API abuse, but determined attackers might still find ways around rate limits.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   No, rate limiting middleware is not currently implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Rate limiting is missing across the entire application. No endpoints are currently protected by rate limiting. This should be implemented globally and potentially customized for sensitive endpoints like login or API access.


## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Error Handling](./mitigation_strategies/secure_error_handling.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement Custom Error Handlers:** Create custom error handlers using `actix_web::error::Error` and define custom error types for your application. Leverage actix-web's error handling framework.
    2.  **Generic Error Responses:** In production environments, ensure error handlers return generic, user-friendly error messages to clients (e.g., "An unexpected error occurred"). Avoid exposing detailed error information, stack traces, or internal server paths.
    3.  **Detailed Logging:** Log detailed error information, including stack traces and relevant context, internally for debugging and monitoring purposes. Use a logging framework compatible with actix-web's asynchronous nature.
    4.  **Differentiate Environments:** Implement different error handling behavior for development and production environments. In development, detailed error messages can be helpful for debugging, while in production, generic messages are crucial for security.
    5.  **Test Error Scenarios:** Thoroughly test error handling for various scenarios, including invalid inputs, unexpected exceptions, and server errors, to ensure appropriate error responses and logging within the actix-web context.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Leakage via Error Messages (Medium Severity):**  Detailed error messages can expose sensitive information like internal paths, database schema details, or library versions to attackers, aiding in reconnaissance and vulnerability exploitation.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Leakage via Error Messages (High Impact):**  Effectively prevents information leakage through error messages by providing generic responses to clients.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Custom error types are defined in `src/errors.rs`.
    *   Generic error responses are mostly used in API endpoints.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Consistent generic error responses are not enforced across all parts of the application. Some endpoints might still inadvertently leak detailed error information.
    *   Detailed error logging to a dedicated logging system is not fully implemented. Errors are currently only logged to the console.


## Mitigation Strategy: [HTTPS Enforcement](./mitigation_strategies/https_enforcement.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Obtain TLS/SSL Certificate:** Acquire a valid TLS/SSL certificate from a Certificate Authority (CA) or use a service like Let's Encrypt for free certificates.
    2.  **Configure TLS/SSL in `HttpServer`:** In your `main.rs` or server setup file, configure `HttpServer` to use HTTPS. Use `HttpServer::bind_rustls()` or `HttpServer::bind_openssl()` depending on your TLS/SSL library preference. Provide the paths to your certificate and private key files.
    3.  **Redirect HTTP to HTTPS:** Implement middleware within actix-web or server-level configuration to automatically redirect all HTTP requests (port 80) to HTTPS (port 443). This ensures all communication is encrypted.
    4.  **HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security):** Configure HSTS headers using actix-web's response header manipulation capabilities to instruct browsers to always access your application over HTTPS in the future, even if the user types `http://` in the address bar. This prevents downgrade attacks.
    5.  **Test HTTPS Configuration:** Thoroughly test your HTTPS setup using online tools and browser developer tools to verify certificate validity, proper redirection, and HSTS configuration within the actix-web application.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from intercepting and eavesdropping on communication between clients and the server, protecting sensitive data like login credentials and personal information.
    *   **Data Tampering (High Severity):**  HTTPS ensures data integrity, preventing attackers from modifying data in transit between clients and the server.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (High Impact):**  Effectively prevents eavesdropping and MitM attacks by encrypting all communication.
    *   **Data Tampering (High Impact):**  Guarantees data integrity during transmission.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Yes, HTTPS is enforced in production.
    *   `HttpServer` is configured with `bind_rustls()` in `src/main.rs` using Let's Encrypt certificates.
    *   HTTP to HTTPS redirection is implemented using middleware in `src/main.rs`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   HSTS headers are not currently configured. This should be added to further enhance HTTPS security and prevent downgrade attacks, potentially using actix-web's header manipulation features in middleware.


## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Proper CORS Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/implement_proper_cors_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Allowed Origins:** Determine the legitimate origins (domains) that should be allowed to access your actix-web application's resources.
    2.  **Use `actix_cors::Cors` Middleware:** Integrate the `actix_cors::Cors` middleware into your actix-web application using `.wrap()` in your `App` configuration.
    3.  **Configure Allowed Origins:** Use the `allowed_origin()` method of the `Cors` middleware to specify the allowed origins. Be specific and avoid using wildcard origins (`*`) in production unless absolutely necessary and fully understood.
    4.  **Configure Allowed Headers and Methods:**  Use `allowed_headers()` and `allowed_methods()` to restrict the headers and HTTP methods allowed for cross-origin requests, further limiting potential attack vectors.
    5.  **Test CORS Configuration:** Thoroughly test your CORS configuration from different origins to ensure that legitimate cross-origin requests are allowed and unauthorized requests are blocked. Use browser developer tools to inspect CORS headers and behavior.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via CORS Misconfiguration (Medium to High Severity):**  Improper CORS configuration, especially allowing wildcard origins, can enable attackers to bypass Same-Origin Policy and potentially inject malicious scripts into your application from untrusted origins.
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access (Medium Severity):**  CORS misconfiguration can allow unauthorized origins to access sensitive data or API endpoints that should be restricted to specific domains.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via CORS Misconfiguration (Medium to High Impact):**  Significantly reduces the risk of XSS attacks originating from CORS bypasses by enforcing strict origin policies.
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access (Medium Impact):**  Limits unauthorized data access from unexpected origins.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Yes, `actix_cors::Cors` middleware is implemented in `src/main.rs`.
    *   `allowed_origin()` is configured with specific allowed origins (not wildcard).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `allowed_headers()` and `allowed_methods()` are not explicitly configured and are using defaults. Review and configure these to further restrict CORS policy based on application needs.


## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure Connection Limits](./mitigation_strategies/configure_connection_limits.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Assess Connection Capacity:** Determine the maximum number of concurrent connections your actix-web application and underlying infrastructure can handle without performance degradation or instability.
    2.  **Configure `max_connections`:** In your `HttpServer` configuration within your `main.rs` or server setup file, use the `.max_connections(limit)` method. Set `limit` to a value slightly below your assessed capacity to provide a buffer.
    3.  **Monitor Connection Usage:** Monitor the number of active connections to your actix-web application in production. Adjust the `max_connections` limit based on monitoring data and observed performance.
    4.  **Test Connection Limits:** Simulate high connection load to test the effectiveness of the `max_connections` limit and ensure the server gracefully handles connection limits without crashing or becoming unresponsive.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Connection Flooding (High Severity):** Attackers can open a large number of connections to exhaust server resources (file descriptors, memory, thread capacity), leading to service unavailability.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS via Connection Flooding (High Impact):**  Effectively mitigates connection flooding DoS attacks by limiting the number of concurrent connections the server accepts.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Yes, `max_connections` is configured in `src/main.rs` within the `HttpServer` configuration.
    *   Example: `.max_connections(1000)`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   The configured `max_connections` limit might not be optimally tuned based on thorough performance testing and monitoring.  Regularly review and adjust this limit based on production load and capacity.


## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Timeouts](./mitigation_strategies/implement_timeouts.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Determine Appropriate Timeouts:** Analyze your application's request processing and determine reasonable timeout values for client request timeouts and client disconnect timeouts. Consider the expected processing time for different endpoints and network conditions.
    2.  **Configure `client_request_timeout`:** In your `HttpServer` configuration, use `.client_request_timeout(timeout)` to set a timeout for the entire client request duration.
    3.  **Configure `client_disconnect_timeout`:** Use `.client_disconnect_timeout(timeout)` to set a timeout for client disconnects. This helps release resources held by clients that abruptly disconnect.
    4.  **Test Timeout Behavior:** Test your application with slow clients or requests that take longer than the configured timeouts to ensure the server correctly handles timeouts and releases resources.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Slowloris Attacks (Medium to High Severity):** Slowloris attacks exploit slow HTTP requests to keep connections open for extended periods, eventually exhausting server resources.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion due to Stalled Requests (Medium Severity):**  Slow clients or network issues can lead to stalled requests that hold server resources indefinitely, impacting performance and potentially causing resource exhaustion.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS via Slowloris Attacks (Medium to High Impact):**  Mitigates Slowloris attacks by closing connections from slow clients that don't send data within the configured timeout.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion due to Stalled Requests (Medium Impact):**  Reduces resource exhaustion by releasing resources held by stalled requests.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Yes, both `client_request_timeout` and `client_disconnect_timeout` are configured in `src/main.rs` within the `HttpServer` configuration.
    *   Example: `.client_request_timeout(Duration::from_secs(30))` and `.client_disconnect_timeout(Duration::from_secs(5))).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Timeout values might not be optimally tuned for all endpoints and scenarios. Review and adjust timeouts based on application performance and expected request processing times. Consider different timeouts for different types of requests if needed.


## Mitigation Strategy: [Handle Asynchronous Operations Carefully](./mitigation_strategies/handle_asynchronous_operations_carefully.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Blocking Operations:** Analyze your actix-web application code and identify any potentially blocking operations, such as synchronous I/O, CPU-intensive computations, or calls to blocking external services.
    2.  **Offload Blocking Operations:** Use `actix_rt::task::spawn_blocking` to offload blocking operations to a separate thread pool, preventing them from blocking the main actix-web actor thread.
    3.  **Use Asynchronous Alternatives:** Whenever possible, use asynchronous alternatives for I/O operations (e.g., `tokio::fs` for file I/O, asynchronous database drivers) to avoid blocking the actor thread.
    4.  **Limit Blocking Task Pool Size:** If using `spawn_blocking` extensively, consider configuring the size of the blocking task thread pool to prevent excessive thread creation and resource consumption.
    5.  **Test Asynchronous Handling:** Thoroughly test your application under load to ensure that blocking operations are properly handled asynchronously and don't lead to performance bottlenecks or resource exhaustion in the actix-web actor system.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Performance Degradation and DoS due to Blocking Operations (Medium to High Severity):** Blocking operations on the main actix-web actor thread can lead to performance degradation, increased latency, and potentially DoS if the actor thread becomes unresponsive due to blocked tasks.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion due to Thread Starvation (Medium Severity):**  Excessive blocking operations on the actor thread can lead to thread starvation within the actix-web actor system, impacting overall application performance and responsiveness.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Performance Degradation and DoS due to Blocking Operations (Medium to High Impact):**  Significantly reduces the risk of performance issues and DoS caused by blocking operations by ensuring they are handled asynchronously.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion due to Thread Starvation (Medium Impact):**  Prevents thread starvation within the actix-web actor system by offloading blocking tasks.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented.  `spawn_blocking` is used in some parts of the application where blocking operations are identified (e.g., certain file system operations).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A comprehensive review of the entire codebase is needed to identify all potential blocking operations and ensure they are properly offloaded using `spawn_blocking` or asynchronous alternatives.
    *   The size of the blocking task thread pool is not explicitly configured and is using defaults. Consider tuning this pool size based on the application's workload and resource constraints.
