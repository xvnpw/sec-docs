## Attack Tree Path: [[[Exploit Vulnerability in Dependency]]](./attack_tree_paths/__exploit_vulnerability_in_dependency__.md)

**Description:** This represents the overarching threat of exploiting vulnerabilities within any library that the Actix-web application depends on. Dependencies are a major attack surface because they are often outside the direct control of the application developers.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**
    *   **[[serde Deserialization]] (High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Description:** `serde` is a widely used serialization/deserialization framework in Rust. Deserialization vulnerabilities occur when untrusted data is deserialized into complex data structures, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
        *   **Attack Scenario:** An attacker sends a crafted, malicious serialized payload to an Actix-web endpoint that expects serialized data. The application uses `serde` to deserialize this payload. If a vulnerability exists in `serde` or the target data structure, the deserialization process can trigger unintended code execution, leading to RCE.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Deserialization vulnerabilities are common, and exploits are often publicly available).
        *   **Impact:** Very High (RCE).
        *   **Effort:** Medium (Exploits for known vulnerabilities might be readily available; finding new ones requires more effort).
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (Requires monitoring for suspicious input and potentially analyzing memory dumps).
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Avoid deserializing untrusted data into complex types.
            *   Use a safe deserialization format (e.g., JSON with strict schema validation, Protobuf).
            *   Keep `serde` and related crates up-to-date.
            *   Validate input *before* deserialization.
            *   Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to filter known malicious payloads.
    *   **[Other Crates] -> [[RCE]]**
        *    **Description:** This represents the possibility of RCE through a vulnerability in *any* other dependency besides `serde`.
        *    **Attack Scenario:** A vulnerability exists in a dependency (e.g., a library for image processing, database interaction, or any other functionality). The attacker crafts an input or triggers a condition that exploits this vulnerability, leading to RCE. The specific attack vector depends entirely on the vulnerable crate.
        *    **Likelihood:** Medium (The more dependencies, the higher the chance of one having a vulnerability).
        *    **Impact:** Very High (RCE).
        *    **Effort:** Variable (Depends on the specific vulnerability).
        *    **Skill Level:** Variable (Depends on the specific vulnerability).
        *    **Detection Difficulty:** Variable (Depends on the vulnerability and how it manifests).
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Rigorous dependency management using tools like `cargo audit` and `cargo outdated`.
            *   Regular security audits of the entire dependency tree.
            *   Minimize the number of dependencies.
            *   Keep all dependencies up-to-date.
            *   Implement robust monitoring to detect unusual application behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [[Exploit Vulnerability in Actix-web] -> [Unsafe Code] -> [[Code Injection]]](./attack_tree_paths/_exploit_vulnerability_in_actix-web__-__unsafe_code__-___code_injection__.md)

*   **Description:** This path represents exploiting memory safety vulnerabilities within `unsafe` blocks in the Actix-web framework itself (or custom middleware/handlers using `unsafe`).
    *   **Attack Scenario:**
        *   Actix-web (or a custom component) contains an `unsafe` block with a flaw (e.g., use-after-free, buffer overflow).
        *   An attacker crafts malicious input that triggers this flaw.
        *   The flaw leads to memory corruption.
        *   The attacker leverages the memory corruption to inject and execute arbitrary code (RCE).
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (if Actix-web is well-maintained and audited; Medium if using older versions or custom, unaudited `unsafe` code).
    *   **Impact:** Very High (RCE).
    *   **Effort:** High (Requires finding and exploiting a specific vulnerability in `unsafe` code, which often requires deep understanding of Rust's memory management).
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced to Expert.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (Requires sophisticated monitoring and analysis; might be detected by fuzzing or static analysis tools like `cargo miri`).
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Thoroughly audit all `unsafe` blocks.
        *   Minimize the use of `unsafe`.
        *   Keep Actix-web up-to-date.
        *   Use fuzzing techniques (e.g., with `cargo fuzz`).
        *   Employ static analysis tools.
