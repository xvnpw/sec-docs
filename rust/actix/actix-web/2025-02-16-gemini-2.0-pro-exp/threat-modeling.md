# Threat Model Analysis for actix/actix-web

## Threat: [Actor Mailbox Overflow](./threats/actor_mailbox_overflow.md)

*   **Threat:** Actor Mailbox Overflow DoS
*   **Description:** An attacker sends a large number of messages to a specific actor, exceeding the mailbox capacity. The attacker might identify a particularly slow or resource-intensive actor and target it. They could use automated tools to generate a high volume of requests that trigger messages to this actor.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service (DoS). The targeted actor, and potentially the entire application, becomes unresponsive. Requests may time out, and new requests may be rejected.
*   **Affected Component:** `actix::Actor`, `actix::Addr`, `actix::Context`, message handlers (methods decorated with `#[actix::main]` or similar).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use bounded mailboxes: Configure a maximum size for actor mailboxes using `Context::set_mailbox_capacity`.
    *   Implement backpressure: Use mechanisms like `Context::wait` or stream processing to handle message bursts gracefully.
    *   Rate limiting: Implement rate limiting at the application level (e.g., using middleware) to limit the number of requests that can trigger messages to vulnerable actors.
    *   Asynchronous processing: Ensure message handlers are asynchronous and avoid blocking operations.

## Threat: [Actor Race Condition](./threats/actor_race_condition.md)

*   **Threat:** Actor Race Condition Data Corruption
*   **Description:** An attacker might exploit timing vulnerabilities in the application's logic if multiple actors attempt to modify shared state concurrently without proper synchronization. This is less about a direct attack and more about exploiting existing flaws in the application's design. The attacker might try to trigger specific sequences of requests that are likely to expose race conditions.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, inconsistent application state, unpredictable behavior, potentially leading to crashes or security vulnerabilities.
*   **Affected Component:** `actix::Actor`, any shared mutable state accessed by multiple actors (should be avoided), synchronization primitives (if used incorrectly).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Minimize shared mutable state: Design actors to be as isolated as possible.
    *   Message passing: Prefer message passing for inter-actor communication instead of shared state.
    *   Immutable data: Use immutable data structures whenever possible.
    *   Synchronization: If shared mutable state is unavoidable, use appropriate synchronization primitives (e.g., `Mutex`, `RwLock`) correctly, paying close attention to deadlock avoidance.
    *   Thorough testing: Conduct rigorous testing, including concurrency testing, to identify and fix race conditions.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerability (Actix-Web or its Dependencies)](./threats/dependency_vulnerability__actix-web_or_its_dependencies_.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploitation of Vulnerability in Actix-Web or Dependencies
*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in Actix-Web itself, or in one of its dependencies (e.g., `tokio`, `hyper`, `serde`, etc.). The attacker might use publicly available exploit code or develop their own exploit based on vulnerability disclosures.
*   **Impact:** Varies widely depending on the vulnerability. Could range from denial of service (DoS) to remote code execution (RCE), data breaches, or privilege escalation.
*   **Affected Component:** Potentially any part of the Actix-Web framework or its dependencies.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regular updates: Keep Actix-Web and all dependencies updated to the latest versions.
    *   Vulnerability scanning: Use tools like `cargo audit`, Snyk, or Dependabot to automatically detect known vulnerabilities.
    *   SBOM: Maintain a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to track all dependencies.
    *   Security advisories: Monitor security advisories for Actix-Web and its dependencies.

## Threat: [Middleware Bypass](./threats/middleware_bypass.md)

*   **Threat:** Middleware Bypass or Misconfiguration
*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a request that bypasses security checks implemented in middleware, or exploits a misconfiguration in the middleware. This could involve manipulating headers, URLs, or request bodies. Incorrect ordering of middleware is a common cause.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources, data leakage, privilege escalation, or other security breaches.
*   **Affected Component:** `actix_web::middleware`, custom middleware implementations.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Correct middleware order: Ensure security-related middleware (authentication, authorization) is applied *before* middleware that accesses protected resources.
    *   Thorough testing: Test middleware extensively, including negative test cases to ensure it cannot be bypassed.
    *   Input validation: Validate and sanitize all input within middleware.
    *   Least privilege: Middleware should only have access to the resources it needs.
    *   Secure coding practices: Follow secure coding practices when developing custom middleware.

## Threat: [Unvalidated WebSocket Data](./threats/unvalidated_websocket_data.md)

*   **Threat:** Unvalidated WebSocket Data Injection
*   **Description:** An attacker sends malicious data over an established WebSocket connection. This data is not properly validated or sanitized by the server, leading to vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS) if the data is reflected back to other clients, or other injection attacks.
*   **Impact:** Depends on the vulnerability. Could include XSS, command injection, data corruption, or other security breaches.
*   **Affected Component:** WebSocket handler functions, `actix_web::web::Payload`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Input validation: Validate and sanitize all data received over WebSocket connections.
    *   Output encoding: Encode data appropriately before sending it over WebSocket connections, especially if it originated from user input.
    *   Content Security Policy (CSP): Use CSP to mitigate XSS vulnerabilities.
