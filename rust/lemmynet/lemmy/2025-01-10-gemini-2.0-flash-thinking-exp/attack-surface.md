# Attack Surface Analysis for lemmynet/lemmy

## Attack Surface: [Federated Content Injection](./attack_surfaces/federated_content_injection.md)

**Description:** Malicious or compromised federated instances inject harmful content (e.g., XSS, misleading information) into the local instance.

**How Lemmy Contributes:** Lemmy's core functionality is based on federation, which inherently involves accepting content from external sources. This trust relationship can be abused.

**Example:** A malicious instance sends a post containing a `<script>` tag that, when rendered by the local instance, executes arbitrary JavaScript in users' browsers.

**Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), defacement, spreading misinformation, phishing attacks targeting local instance users.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Implement robust content sanitization and escaping for all federated content before rendering. Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources. Consider implementing reputation scoring or trust levels for federated instances.

## Attack Surface: [Markdown Rendering Vulnerabilities Leading to XSS](./attack_surfaces/markdown_rendering_vulnerabilities_leading_to_xss.md)

**Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Markdown rendering library or Lemmy's implementation to inject and execute malicious scripts.

**How Lemmy Contributes:** Lemmy uses Markdown for user-generated content in posts and comments. If the rendering process is flawed, it can be exploited.

**Example:** A user crafts a post with specific Markdown syntax that, when rendered, injects a `<script>` tag into the page, leading to XSS.

**Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), account compromise, redirection to malicious sites, data theft.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Use a well-maintained and actively patched Markdown rendering library. Implement strict input sanitization and output encoding to prevent the execution of unintended scripts. Regularly update the Markdown library to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [API Authentication and Authorization Bypass](./attack_surfaces/api_authentication_and_authorization_bypass.md)

**Description:**  Circumventing authentication or authorization checks on Lemmy's API endpoints to perform unauthorized actions.

**How Lemmy Contributes:** Lemmy exposes an API for client applications and potentially internal functions. Weaknesses in authentication or authorization can be exploited.

**Example:** An attacker finds a way to craft API requests that bypass authentication checks, allowing them to modify user data, create or delete content, or perform administrative actions without proper credentials.

**Impact:** Unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion; account takeover; privilege escalation.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Implement robust authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0). Enforce strict authorization checks on all API endpoints, ensuring users can only access resources they are permitted to. Regularly audit API endpoints for security vulnerabilities. Avoid relying on client-side validation for security.

## Attack Surface: [Media Handling Vulnerabilities (SSRF, Path Traversal)](./attack_surfaces/media_handling_vulnerabilities__ssrf__path_traversal_.md)

**Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in how Lemmy handles uploaded or linked media files. This can include Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) or Path Traversal attacks.

**How Lemmy Contributes:** Lemmy allows users to upload images and link to external media. Improper handling of these operations can introduce vulnerabilities.

**Example (SSRF):** An attacker provides a link to an internal server, causing the Lemmy server to make a request to that internal resource, potentially exposing internal services.

**Example (Path Traversal):** An attacker uploads a file with a crafted filename that allows them to overwrite or access files outside the intended upload directory.

**Impact:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), arbitrary file access or modification, potential for remote code execution if combined with other vulnerabilities.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:**  Implement strict validation of URLs for linked media. Sanitize filenames and store uploaded files in a secure location with restricted access. Avoid directly exposing internal file paths. If fetching remote media, implement safeguards against SSRF (e.g., block requests to internal networks).
