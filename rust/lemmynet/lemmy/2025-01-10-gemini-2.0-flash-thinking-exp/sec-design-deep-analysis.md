### Security Implications of Key Components:

**Frontend (Web/Mobile):**

*   **Security Consideration:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities could arise from improper handling of user-generated content (posts, comments, community descriptions) or data received from the backend.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement robust contextual output encoding on the frontend. Utilize templating engines with automatic escaping features. Employ a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources of content the browser is allowed to load. Regularly audit frontend code for potential XSS sinks.
*   **Security Consideration:**  Exposure of sensitive information in the client-side code (e.g., API keys, secrets, or sensitive logic).
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:** Avoid embedding sensitive information directly in the frontend code. Utilize secure backend-for-frontend (BFF) patterns to handle sensitive operations on the server-side. Implement robust build processes to prevent accidental inclusion of development secrets in production builds.
*   **Security Consideration:**  Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks could occur if the backend does not properly verify the origin of requests.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement anti-CSRF tokens (Synchronizer Tokens) for state-changing requests. Ensure proper SameSite cookie attributes are set to mitigate CSRF risks.
*   **Security Consideration:**  Dependency vulnerabilities in frontend libraries and frameworks.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement a robust Software Composition Analysis (SCA) process to regularly scan frontend dependencies for known vulnerabilities. Keep dependencies up-to-date with security patches.

**Backend API:**
