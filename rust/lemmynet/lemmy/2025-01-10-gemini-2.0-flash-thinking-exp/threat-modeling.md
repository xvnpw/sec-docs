# Threat Model Analysis for lemmynet/lemmy

## Threat: [Malicious Federated Instances](./threats/malicious_federated_instances.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Federated Instances
    *   **Description:** A compromised or malicious federated Lemmy instance sends crafted messages to your instance, exploiting vulnerabilities within Lemmy's federation handling. This could involve sending posts with malicious scripts (XSS payloads designed to exploit Lemmy's rendering), or messages designed to trigger bugs in Lemmy's ActivityPub implementation. The attacker aims to compromise users of your instance or disrupt its operation through flaws in Lemmy itself.
    *   **Impact:** Users on your instance could be exposed to XSS attacks due to vulnerabilities in how Lemmy processes federated content, leading to account compromise or data theft. Exploits targeting Lemmy's federation handling could lead to unauthorized actions or denial-of-service on your instance.
    *   **Affected Component:** Federation Module, ActivityPub Handler, Post/Comment rendering engine (specifically Lemmy's implementation).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers/Lemmy Maintainers:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization *within Lemmy* for all incoming federated content. Regularly update Lemmy to patch known vulnerabilities in federation handling and rendering. Implement strict parsing and validation of ActivityPub messages.

## Threat: [Abuse of Markdown Parsing Vulnerabilities (Federated Content)](./threats/abuse_of_markdown_parsing_vulnerabilities__federated_content_.md)

*   **Threat:** Abuse of Markdown Parsing Vulnerabilities (Federated Content)
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious markdown within a post or comment on a federated instance. When this content is received and rendered by your Lemmy instance, vulnerabilities in *Lemmy's own markdown parsing library or implementation* are exploited. This could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks executing within the context of your Lemmy instance.
    *   **Impact:** Users viewing the malicious content on your instance could have their browsers compromised, leading to session hijacking, data theft, or redirection to malicious sites. The vulnerability lies within Lemmy's code for processing and displaying markdown.
    *   **Affected Component:** Post/Comment rendering engine (Lemmy's frontend and backend components responsible for displaying content), Markdown parsing library integrated within Lemmy.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers/Lemmy Maintainers:** Use a secure and up-to-date markdown parsing library. Implement strict input sanitization *within Lemmy* for all rendered content, even from federated sources. Employ Content Security Policy (CSP) on your Lemmy instance to mitigate the impact of XSS vulnerabilities.
