# BUSINESS POSTURE

Lemmy is a federated link aggregator, aiming to provide a decentralized alternative to platforms like Reddit. It prioritizes user privacy and community control by being open-source and part of the Fediverse.

- Business priorities and goals:
  - Provide a decentralized social media platform.
  - Offer an alternative to centralized platforms with a focus on user privacy and community governance.
  - Foster a community-driven and open-source ecosystem.
  - Enable users to control their data and online experience.
  - Support interoperability with other Fediverse platforms.

- Business risks:
  - Moderation challenges in a decentralized environment.
  - Difficulty in achieving network effects and user adoption compared to established centralized platforms.
  - Potential for misuse and abuse due to decentralization and open nature.
  - Reliance on community contributions for development and maintenance.
  - Complexity of managing a federated system and ensuring interoperability.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Lemmy, being an open-source project, benefits from community scrutiny, which can contribute to identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities. As a federated platform handling user-generated content and personal data, security is crucial.

- Existing security controls:
  - security control: HTTPS enforced for web traffic (standard web server configuration). Implemented in: Deployment configuration (e.g., reverse proxy setup).
  - security control: Regular software updates for dependencies (Rust crates, Node.js packages). Implemented in: Project's dependency management (Cargo.toml, package.json) and CI/CD pipelines.
  - security control: Input sanitization and output encoding to prevent common web vulnerabilities (likely implemented within the Rust backend and Typescript frontend code). Implemented in: Source code of backend and frontend applications.
  - security control: Rate limiting to mitigate abuse and denial-of-service attacks (likely implemented in the backend application or reverse proxy). Implemented in: Backend application code or reverse proxy configuration.
  - accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies. Mitigation: Regular dependency updates and vulnerability scanning.
  - accepted risk: Community-driven security audits might be less frequent or comprehensive than professional audits. Mitigation: Encourage community contributions and seek external security audits when feasible.

- Recommended security controls:
  - security control: Implement a robust Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
  - security control: Regularly perform static and dynamic application security testing (SAST/DAST) on both backend and frontend code.
  - security control: Implement database security best practices, including principle of least privilege for database access and regular backups.
  - security control: Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring for security events and anomalies.
  - security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing, especially before major releases.
  - security control: Implement a vulnerability disclosure program to encourage responsible reporting of security issues.
  - security control: Secure secret management for API keys, database credentials, and other sensitive information.

- Security requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: Secure user authentication mechanism to verify user identity.
    - Requirement: Support for password-based authentication and potentially federated authentication (e.g., OAuth, WebAuthn).
    - Requirement: Protection against brute-force attacks on login endpoints (e.g., account lockout, rate limiting).
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions and access to features (e.g., admin, moderator, user).
    - Requirement: Fine-grained authorization to control access to specific resources and actions (e.g., posting, commenting, moderating).
    - Requirement: Consistent authorization enforcement across backend and frontend.
  - Input validation:
    - Requirement: Server-side input validation for all user-provided data to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection, XSS).
    - Requirement: Client-side input validation for user experience and early error detection, but not as a primary security control.
    - Requirement: Validation of file uploads to prevent malicious file uploads.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Use of strong encryption algorithms for sensitive data at rest and in transit.
    - Requirement: Secure storage of cryptographic keys and secrets.
    - Requirement: Proper implementation of cryptographic protocols (e.g., TLS for HTTPS).
    - Requirement: Hashing of passwords using strong hashing algorithms with salt.

  - Content creation and moderation (posts, comments, communities).
  - Federation with other instances.
  - User data management.
  - Notification delivery.

- Data sensitivity:
  - User credentials (passwords, potentially federated identities): Highly sensitive. Requires strong encryption and secure storage.
  - User profile information (username, email, bio): Sensitive. Requires protection against unauthorized access and disclosure.
  - User-generated content (posts, comments, messages): Moderately sensitive. Requires moderation and protection against misuse and abuse.
  - IP addresses and activity logs: Moderately sensitive. Can be used for abuse detection and security monitoring, but also raise privacy concerns.
