    * Consider encrypting federated communication beyond standard HTTPS, if supported by Lemmy and necessary.

## Threat: [API Authentication/Authorization Vulnerabilities](./threats/api_authenticationauthorization_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Vulnerabilities in Lemmy's API authentication or authorization mechanisms allow attackers to bypass authentication, elevate privileges, or access/modify sensitive data through the API. This could involve exploiting flaws in Lemmy's token handling, session management, or authorization checks. The attacker targets Lemmy's API endpoints and authentication/authorization modules.
* **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access, manipulation of the Lemmy instance, potential for complete system compromise.
* **Lemmy Component Affected:** API module, Authentication module, Authorization module.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement robust and industry-standard authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0, JWT) within Lemmy's API.
    * Regularly audit and penetration test Lemmy's API specifically for authentication and authorization vulnerabilities.
    * Enforce the principle of least privilege for API access within Lemmy's authorization logic.
    * Implement input validation and sanitization for all API requests handled by Lemmy.
    * Securely store and manage API keys and tokens used by Lemmy.

## Threat: [Backend Component Vulnerabilities (Specific to Lemmy's stack)](./threats/backend_component_vulnerabilities__specific_to_lemmy's_stack_.md)

* **Description:** Vulnerabilities in specific backend components *chosen and used by Lemmy* (e.g., specific libraries, ORM usage patterns) are exploited. This is about vulnerabilities arising from Lemmy's architectural choices and dependencies, not just general OS/DB vulnerabilities. The attacker targets the underlying infrastructure and dependencies *as used by Lemmy*.
* **Impact:** Range from information disclosure to remote code execution, depending on the vulnerability, potential for complete system compromise.
* **Lemmy Component Affected:** Backend infrastructure *as defined by Lemmy's stack*, Dependencies *used by Lemmy*, ORM (if used by Lemmy).
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Keep all backend components and dependencies *used by Lemmy* updated to the latest versions.
    * Regularly scan for vulnerabilities in backend components *within the context of Lemmy's stack* using security scanners.
    * Follow security best practices for the specific database and backend technologies *used by Lemmy*.
    * Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to detect and block attacks targeting backend components *relevant to Lemmy*.

## Threat: [Database Specific Vulnerabilities (Lemmy's database interactions)](./threats/database_specific_vulnerabilities__lemmy's_database_interactions_.md)

* **Description:** Vulnerabilities arise from Lemmy's specific database queries, schema design, or ORM usage that are *unique to Lemmy's implementation*. This could lead to database injection attacks (beyond standard SQL injection if Lemmy uses a specific ORM in a vulnerable way), data corruption, or performance issues due to Lemmy's code. The attacker targets the database interaction layer *of Lemmy*.
* **Impact:** Data breaches, data integrity issues, service disruption, performance degradation, potential for data loss.
* **Lemmy Component Affected:** Database interaction layer *in Lemmy*, ORM (if used by Lemmy), Database queries *generated by Lemmy*, Database schema *defined by Lemmy*.
