## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Input Validation Vulnerabilities -> Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) -> Stored XSS in Posts/Comments [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_input_validation_vulnerabilities_-_cross-site_scripting__xss__-_stored_xss_in_postscommen_adf63513.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a Lemmy post or comment. This code is stored in the database.
*   **Why High-Risk:**
    *   **High Likelihood:** Input validation flaws are common in web applications, especially those handling user-generated content.
    *   **Moderate Impact:** Successful XSS can lead to session hijacking, account takeover, defacement, and malware distribution affecting multiple users who view the compromised content.
    *   **Low Effort & Skill:** Basic XSS attacks can be executed with relatively low effort and skill.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. SQL Injection (Less Likely, but Consider) -> Parameterized Query Bypass in Custom Lemmy Modules/Plugins (if any) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2__sql_injection__less_likely__but_consider__-_parameterized_query_bypass_in_custom_lemmy_modulesplu_f9ddd244.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If the application uses custom Lemmy modules or plugins with database interactions, and these are not properly secured, an attacker might be able to manipulate SQL queries by injecting malicious SQL code through input fields.
*   **Why Critical Node:**
    *   **Critical Impact:** Successful SQL injection can lead to complete database compromise, including data exfiltration, modification, and deletion. It can also allow for arbitrary code execution on the database server in severe cases.
    *   **High Skill & Effort (to find, but impact is extreme):** While less likely in well-maintained modern applications, if present, the impact is catastrophic. Exploiting it might require higher skill to bypass parameterized queries or ORM protections.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Authentication/Authorization Flaws -> Authentication Bypass -> Vulnerabilities in Lemmy's Authentication Logic [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_authenticationauthorization_flaws_-_authentication_bypass_-_vulnerabilities_in_lemmy's_au_de409017.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting flaws in Lemmy's core authentication mechanisms to bypass login procedures and gain unauthorized access to user accounts or administrative functions.
*   **Why Critical Node:**
    *   **Critical Impact:**  Authentication bypass directly leads to unauthorized access, potentially granting full control over the application and its data.
    *   **High Skill & Effort (to find, but impact is extreme):** Finding and exploiting such vulnerabilities usually requires advanced skills and significant effort, but the reward for the attacker is very high.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Authentication/Authorization Flaws -> Privilege Escalation -> Abuse of Lemmy's Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_authenticationauthorization_flaws_-_privilege_escalation_-_abuse_of_lemmy's_role-based_ac_48afb8ec.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Exploiting weaknesses in Lemmy's role-based access control system to gain higher privileges than intended. For example, a regular user becoming an administrator.
*   **Why Critical Node:**
    *   **Critical Impact:** Privilege escalation allows an attacker to perform actions they are not authorized to, potentially including administrative tasks, data access, and system modifications.
    *   **High Skill & Effort (to find, but impact is extreme):**  Requires deep understanding of the RBAC implementation and finding subtle flaws.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Exploit Federation Protocol Vulnerabilities -> ActivityPub Protocol Exploits -> Injection Attacks via Malicious Federated Data [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/5__exploit_federation_protocol_vulnerabilities_-_activitypub_protocol_exploits_-_injection_attacks_v_e55f8b61.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Crafting malicious ActivityPub messages from a federated instance that, when processed by the Lemmy instance, trigger injection vulnerabilities (similar to XSS or other injection types).
*   **Why High-Risk:**
    *   **Medium Likelihood:** Federation introduces a less controlled input source. Processing external data always carries risk.
    *   **Moderate to Significant Impact:**  Impact depends on the type of injection achieved, ranging from user-level compromise (like XSS) to more severe server-side vulnerabilities.
    *   **Medium Effort & Skill:** Requires understanding of ActivityPub and crafting malicious messages.

Exploit Federation Protocol Vulnerabilities -> ActivityPub Protocol Exploits -> Denial of Service via Crafted ActivityPub Messages [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/6__exploit_federation_protocol_vulnerabilities_-_activitypub_protocol_exploits_-_denial_of_service_v_525f309d.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a flood of specially crafted ActivityPub messages designed to overwhelm Lemmy's federation processing, causing a Denial of Service.
*   **Why High-Risk:**
    *   **Medium Likelihood:** Relatively easy to attempt, especially if Lemmy's federation processing is resource-intensive or lacks proper rate limiting.
    *   **Significant Impact:**  DoS can disrupt the application's availability and functionality for all users.
    *   **Low Effort & Skill:**  DoS attacks are generally low effort and require minimal skill.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. Exploit API Vulnerabilities -> API Authentication/Authorization Bypass -> Accessing Admin/Moderation APIs without Proper Credentials [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/7__exploit_api_vulnerabilities_-_api_authenticationauthorization_bypass_-_accessing_adminmoderation__03179a47.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Bypassing authentication or authorization checks on Lemmy's API to gain access to sensitive administrative or moderation API endpoints.
*   **Why Critical Node:**
    *   **Critical Impact:** Access to admin/moderation APIs allows attackers to control the platform, manage users, manipulate content, and potentially gain further system access.
    *   **High Skill & Effort (to find, but impact is extreme):** Requires finding vulnerabilities in API security mechanisms.

## Attack Tree Path: [8. Exploit API Vulnerabilities -> API Rate Limiting Issues -> Abuse API to cause Denial of Service or Resource Exhaustion [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/8__exploit_api_vulnerabilities_-_api_rate_limiting_issues_-_abuse_api_to_cause_denial_of_service_or__21d45ec5.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Flooding Lemmy's API with requests to exhaust server resources and cause a Denial of Service.
*   **Why High-Risk:**
    *   **Medium Likelihood:** If API rate limiting is not properly implemented or configured, it's easily exploitable.
    *   **Significant Impact:** DoS disrupts application availability.
    *   **Low Effort & Skill:**  Simple to execute with readily available tools.

## Attack Tree Path: [9. Exploit Lemmy Configuration and Deployment Weaknesses -> Insecure Lemmy Configuration -> Weak Default Credentials -> Default Admin Password Usage [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/9__exploit_lemmy_configuration_and_deployment_weaknesses_-_insecure_lemmy_configuration_-_weak_defau_fc2977f0.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Using default administrator credentials that were not changed after deployment to gain administrative access.
*   **Why High-Risk & Critical Node:**
    *   **Low Likelihood (ideally, but still happens):**  Should be a basic security practice to change default passwords, but often overlooked.
    *   **Critical Impact:**  Direct administrative access, full compromise.
    *   **Very Low Effort & Skill:**  Trivial to attempt if default credentials are known.

## Attack Tree Path: [10. Exploit Lemmy Configuration and Deployment Weaknesses -> Insecure Lemmy Configuration -> Exposed Debug/Admin Endpoints -> Unprotected Access to Sensitive Admin Panels [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/10__exploit_lemmy_configuration_and_deployment_weaknesses_-_insecure_lemmy_configuration_-_exposed_d_e484fec6.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Accessing publicly exposed debug or administrative interfaces without proper authentication.
*   **Why High-Risk & Critical Node:**
    *   **Very Low Likelihood (should be caught in deployment checks):** Debug endpoints should be disabled in production, admin panels protected.
    *   **Critical Impact:** Direct administrative access, full compromise.
    *   **Very Low Effort & Skill:**  Simply browsing to exposed endpoints.

## Attack Tree Path: [11. Exploit Lemmy Configuration and Deployment Weaknesses -> Vulnerable Dependencies -> Outdated Libraries with Known Vulnerabilities -> Exploiting Vulnerable Rust Crates or JavaScript Libraries [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/11__exploit_lemmy_configuration_and_deployment_weaknesses_-_vulnerable_dependencies_-_outdated_libra_3bd5517e.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in outdated dependencies (Rust crates or JavaScript libraries) used by Lemmy.
*   **Why High-Risk & Critical Node:**
    *   **Medium Likelihood:**  Dependency vulnerabilities are common, and if dependency management is not proactive, systems can become vulnerable.
    *   **Significant to Critical Impact:** Impact depends on the specific vulnerability, ranging from information disclosure to remote code execution.
    *   **Low to Medium Effort & Skill (using existing exploits):** Exploits for known vulnerabilities are often publicly available and easy to use.

## Attack Tree Path: [12. Exploit Infrastructure Misconfigurations -> Weak Server Security -> Exploiting OS or Server Software Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/12__exploit_infrastructure_misconfigurations_-_weak_server_security_-_exploiting_os_or_server_softwa_01c3b139.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the operating system or server software hosting the Lemmy application.
*   **Why Critical Node:**
    *   **Low Likelihood (if standard server hardening is applied):**  Good server security practices reduce likelihood.
    *   **Critical Impact:**  Compromise of the underlying server can lead to full application compromise and potentially affect other services on the same server.
    *   **Medium Effort & Skill:**  Exploiting server vulnerabilities often requires more technical skill and effort than web application vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [13. Exploit Infrastructure Misconfigurations -> Network Segmentation Issues -> Direct Access to Lemmy Database or Internal Components [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/13__exploit_infrastructure_misconfigurations_-_network_segmentation_issues_-_direct_access_to_lemmy__460e93bf.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Lack of proper network segmentation allows an attacker who compromises the web application to directly access backend components like the database without going through intended access controls.
*   **Why Critical Node:**
    *   **Low Likelihood (if network security best practices are followed):** Network segmentation is a standard security practice.
    *   **Critical Impact:** Direct access to the database or internal components bypasses application-level security and can lead to full data compromise and system control.
    *   **Medium Effort & Skill:**  Exploiting network segmentation issues often requires lateral movement skills after initial compromise.
