# Threat Model Analysis for lemmynet/lemmy

## Threat: [Malicious Federated Instance Sending Harmful Content](./threats/malicious_federated_instance_sending_harmful_content.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker operates a compromised or intentionally malicious Lemmy instance that federates with other instances. This instance sends posts, comments, or other content containing exploits (e.g., stored XSS payloads) or misinformation. The attacker aims to compromise users of federated instances or spread disinformation.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of malicious scripts in users' browsers leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other client-side attacks. Spread of misinformation or propaganda, damaging the community's trust and integrity across federated instances.
    *   **Affected Component:** Federation Module (`lemmy_server::api::federation`), Content Processing (`lemmy_server::activitypub::handlers`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement robust instance blocking and allowlisting mechanisms within the Lemmy instance. Sanitize and escape all federated content before rendering it. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP). Regularly review and update the list of federated instances.

## Threat: [Instance Compromise Leading to Data Breach via Federation](./threats/instance_compromise_leading_to_data_breach_via_federation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to a Lemmy instance. They then exploit the federation mechanism to access or exfiltrate data shared with other federated instances, such as user information, post content, or community details.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive user data, content, and potentially internal instance information across the federation. Damage to reputation and potential legal repercussions for compromised instances and the wider network.
    *   **Affected Component:** Federation Module (`lemmy_server::api::federation`), Database interaction related to federated data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement strong security practices on the Lemmy instance, including regular security audits and patching. Minimize the amount of sensitive data stored and shared. Implement robust access controls and monitoring.

## Threat: [Abuse of Federation for Denial of Service (DoS)](./threats/abuse_of_federation_for_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker controls multiple malicious Lemmy instances and uses them to flood other instances with a large volume of requests (e.g., creating numerous fake accounts, posts, or votes). This overwhelms the target instance's resources, making it unavailable to legitimate users.
    *   **Impact:** Instance downtime, degraded performance, and inability for users to access the service across the targeted instances.
    *   **Affected Component:** Federation Module (`lemmy_server::api::federation`), API endpoints handling federated data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement rate limiting on federated requests within the Lemmy instance. Implement mechanisms to identify and block malicious instances based on their behavior. Utilize caching and other performance optimization techniques.

## Threat: [Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Lemmy Content](./threats/stored_cross-site_scripting__xss__via_lemmy_content.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a post, comment, community description, or other user-generated content on a Lemmy instance. This content is then federated to other instances, and the malicious script is executed in the browsers of users viewing that content.
    *   **Impact:** Session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious websites, defacement of instances, and other client-side attacks affecting users across the federation.
    *   **Affected Component:** Content Processing (`lemmy_server::activitypub::handlers`), Frontend rendering of content.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement robust server-side sanitization and escaping of all user-generated content within Lemmy. Utilize a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.

## Threat: [Media Handling Vulnerabilities in Lemmy](./threats/media_handling_vulnerabilities_in_lemmy.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted media file (image, video, etc.) to a Lemmy instance that exploits a vulnerability in Lemmy's media processing logic. This could lead to arbitrary code execution on the Lemmy server.
    *   **Impact:** Server compromise, data breaches, denial of service, or the ability to manipulate media content on the affected Lemmy instance.
    *   **Affected Component:** Media Handling Module (`lemmy_server::media`), Image/Video processing libraries.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Ensure the Lemmy instance is running the latest stable version with all security patches. Implement robust security measures for media processing and storage, including virus scanning and content type validation.

## Threat: [Authorization Bypass in Lemmy's API](./threats/authorization_bypass_in_lemmy's_api.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in Lemmy's API authorization logic to perform actions they are not authorized to do. This could include accessing sensitive data, modifying content, or performing administrative actions without proper credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data or functionalities within the Lemmy instance, potentially leading to data manipulation, privilege escalation, or disruption of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** API Authorization Logic (`lemmy_server::api::auth`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Ensure the Lemmy instance is running the latest stable version with security patches. Implement thorough testing of authorization logic. Follow secure coding practices to prevent authorization vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Account Takeover on Lemmy](./threats/account_takeover_on_lemmy.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in Lemmy's authentication mechanisms (e.g., weak password policies, lack of multi-factor authentication, session management issues) to gain unauthorized access to user accounts.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user data, ability to post and comment as the compromised user, potentially leading to reputational damage or further malicious actions.
    *   **Affected Component:** Authentication Module (`lemmy_server::auth`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Enforce strong password policies. Implement multi-factor authentication. Securely manage user sessions. Regularly review and update authentication mechanisms.
