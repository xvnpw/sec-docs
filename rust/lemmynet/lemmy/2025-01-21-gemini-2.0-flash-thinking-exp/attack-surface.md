# Attack Surface Analysis for lemmynet/lemmy

## Attack Surface: [Federated Authentication Weaknesses](./attack_surfaces/federated_authentication_weaknesses.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from the trust-based authentication model between different Lemmy instances in the federation. A compromised instance could potentially impersonate users or manipulate data on other instances.
    *   **How Lemmy Contributes:** Lemmy relies on the ActivityPub protocol for federated communication and authentication. Weaknesses in its implementation or the inherent complexities of federated identity management can introduce risks.
    *   **Example:** A malicious Lemmy instance could forge an ActivityPub "Announce" activity claiming a user on another instance made a specific post, leading to misinformation or reputational damage.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, data manipulation across instances, potential for widespread misinformation or targeted attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust verification of ActivityPub signatures and origin headers. Carefully validate the `actor` field in received activities. Consider implementing mechanisms for users to verify the origin instance of content. Regularly audit and update the ActivityPub implementation.

## Attack Surface: [ActivityPub Payload Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/activitypub_payload_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Attack vectors stemming from malicious or crafted payloads within ActivityPub objects exchanged between instances. This could include XSS, command injection, or denial-of-service attacks.
    *   **How Lemmy Contributes:** Lemmy processes and renders content received through ActivityPub. Insufficient sanitization or validation of these payloads can lead to vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A malicious instance sends an ActivityPub note containing a `<script>` tag, which is then executed in the browsers of users on the receiving instance, leading to XSS.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), potential for account compromise, redirection to malicious sites, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strict input validation and output encoding for all data received through ActivityPub. Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS. Sanitize HTML content before rendering.

## Attack Surface: [Content Injection (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS)](./attack_surfaces/content_injection__cross-site_scripting_-_xss_.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts into user-generated content (posts, comments, profile information) that are then executed in other users' browsers.
    *   **How Lemmy Contributes:** Lemmy allows users to create and share content, and if this content is not properly sanitized, it can become a vector for XSS attacks.
    *   **Example:** A user crafts a post containing malicious JavaScript that steals session cookies when other users view the post.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise, redirection to malicious sites, data theft, defacement.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust output encoding (escaping) of user-generated content before rendering it in HTML. Utilize a templating engine that automatically escapes output. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP).

## Attack Surface: [API Authentication and Authorization Flaws](./attack_surfaces/api_authentication_and_authorization_flaws.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the authentication and authorization mechanisms for Lemmy's API, potentially allowing unauthorized access to data or functionality.
    *   **How Lemmy Contributes:** Lemmy exposes an API for external interaction. Weaknesses in securing this API can lead to exploitation.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a flaw in the API authentication to gain administrative privileges and modify server settings.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized modification of data, service disruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0). Enforce the principle of least privilege for API access. Thoroughly validate all API requests. Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
