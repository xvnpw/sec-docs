**3. Target Audience**

This document is intended for:

*   Security engineers and architects responsible for threat modeling, security assessments, and penetration testing.
*   Developers working on or contributing to the Lemmy project, particularly those involved in security-sensitive areas.
*   Operations teams responsible for deploying, configuring, and maintaining Lemmy instances in a secure manner.

**4. System Overview**

Lemmy is a federated link aggregator and forum platform, similar to Reddit or Hacker News. It allows users to create communities, submit links and text posts, and engage in discussions through comments and votes. A core design principle of Lemmy is its decentralized nature, achieved through the use of the ActivityPub protocol for federation, enabling seamless communication and interaction between independent Lemmy instances (often referred to as "instances"). This federation introduces unique security considerations.

**5. Architectural Components**

The Lemmy architecture can be broken down into the following key components, with a focus on their security-relevant functionalities:

*   **Frontend (Web UI):**
    *   Provides the user interface for interacting with Lemmy via web browsers.
    *   Built using a modern JavaScript framework (likely React based on the GitHub repository).
    *   Handles user authentication by sending credentials to the backend API and storing authentication tokens (e.g., JWT) in browser storage.
    *   Renders content received from the backend API, potentially exposing it to XSS vulnerabilities if not handled carefully.
    *   Submits user-generated content (posts, comments) to the backend API.
    *   Interacts with the backend API via HTTPS.
*   **Backend (lemmy_server):**
    *   The core application logic of Lemmy, responsible for business logic and data management.
    *   Written in Rust, leveraging its memory safety features.
    *   Exposes a RESTful API (likely using a framework like Actix Web) for the frontend and other clients.
    *   Handles user authentication and authorization, verifying user credentials and permissions for API requests.
    *   Implements input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks.
    *   Manages user accounts, communities, content moderation, and federation logic.
    *   Interacts with the PostgreSQL database for persistent data storage.
    *   Implements the server-side of the ActivityPub protocol for federation.
*   **Database (PostgreSQL):**
    *   Stores persistent data for the application, including sensitive user information and content.
    *   Requires secure configuration and access controls to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.
    *   Vulnerable to SQL injection if the backend does not properly sanitize database queries.
    *   Data at rest should be encrypted.
*   **Federation (ActivityPub):**
    *   Implements the ActivityPub protocol for asynchronous communication with other Lemmy instances and compatible platforms in the Fediverse.
    *   Handles sending and receiving ActivityPub `Activity` objects (e.g., `Create`, `Update`, `Delete`, `Follow`, `Like`).
    *   Requires signature verification of incoming activities to ensure authenticity and prevent spoofing.
    *   Needs to handle potentially malicious or oversized payloads from federated instances.
    *   Manages the local representation of remote users and content.
*   **Reverse Proxy (e.g., Nginx, Apache):**
    *   Acts as the single entry point for all external HTTP/HTTPS requests to the Lemmy instance.
    *   Handles TLS termination, encrypting traffic between users and the server.
    *   Can provide additional security features like request filtering, rate limiting, and header manipulation.
    *   Routes requests to the appropriate backend instances.
    *   May serve static assets for the frontend.
*   **Background Workers (Likely integrated within the backend or a separate service):**
    *   Handles asynchronous and deferred tasks that do not need immediate processing.
    *   Examples include processing incoming federated activities, sending email notifications, and performing scheduled maintenance tasks.
    *   May have access to sensitive data and require appropriate security controls.
*   **Media Storage (Local filesystem or cloud storage like AWS S3, etc.):**
    *   Stores user-uploaded media files (images, videos).
    *   Requires secure configuration to prevent unauthorized access and ensure data integrity.
    *   Needs protection against malicious file uploads and potential exploits.
    *   Access to stored media should be controlled and authenticated.
*   **Cache (e.g., Redis, Memcached):**
    *   Optional component for improving performance by caching frequently accessed data.
    *   If used, sensitive data stored in the cache needs to be protected.
    *   Cache invalidation mechanisms are important for data consistency.

**6. Data Flow (Detailed)**

Here are some key data flow scenarios within the Lemmy system, highlighting security considerations at each step:

*   **User Registration and Login:**
    *   User enters credentials on the **Frontend (Web UI)**.
    *   Frontend sends an HTTPS `POST` request containing credentials to the **Backend (lemmy_server) API** `/api/v3/user/register` or `/api/v3/login`.
    *   Backend receives the request via the **Reverse Proxy**.
    *   Backend validates the input data (e.g., email format, password complexity).
    *   Backend queries the **Database (PostgreSQL)** to check for existing users or to store the new user.
    *   For login, the Backend securely compares the provided password with the stored hashed password.
    *   Upon successful authentication, the Backend generates an authentication token (e.g., JWT).
    *   Backend sends an HTTPS response containing the authentication token back to the Frontend.
    *   Frontend stores the token (e.g., in local storage or session storage). Subsequent requests will include this token in the `Authorization` header.
*   **Posting Content:**
    *   User composes a post on the **Frontend (Web UI)**.
    *   Frontend sends an HTTPS `POST` request containing the post data to the **Backend (lemmy_server) API** `/api/v3/post`. The `Authorization` header includes the user's authentication token.
    *   **Reverse Proxy** forwards the request to the Backend.
    *   Backend authenticates the user by verifying the provided token.
    *   Backend performs input validation and sanitization to prevent XSS and other injection attacks.
    *   Backend stores the post data in the **Database (PostgreSQL)**.
    *   Backend, via the **Federation (ActivityPub)** component, constructs an ActivityPub `Create` activity.
    *   Backend signs the activity with its private key.
    *   Backend sends the signed activity to the inboxes of followers and relevant remote instances.
*   **Viewing Content:**
    *   User navigates to a page on the **Frontend (Web UI)** displaying posts.
    *   Frontend sends an HTTPS `GET` request to the **Backend (lemmy_server) API** (e.g., `/api/v3/post/list`).
    *   **Reverse Proxy** forwards the request.
    *   Backend queries the **Database (PostgreSQL)** for the requested posts, applying any necessary filtering or sorting.
    *   Backend retrieves the post data.
    *   Backend sends an HTTPS response containing the post data to the Frontend.
    *   Frontend renders the content, taking care to sanitize any potentially malicious content to prevent XSS.
*   **Commenting on a Post:**
    *   User submits a comment on the **Frontend (Web UI)**.
    *   Frontend sends an HTTPS `POST` request containing the comment data to the **Backend (lemmy_server) API** `/api/v3/comment`. Includes the authentication token.
    *   **Reverse Proxy** forwards the request.
    *   Backend authenticates the user.
    *   Backend validates and sanitizes the comment text.
    *   Backend stores the comment in the **Database (PostgreSQL)**.
    *   Backend, via **Federation (ActivityPub)**, sends a signed `Create` activity for the comment to relevant federated instances.
*   **Federated Activity Reception:**
    *   A remote Lemmy instance sends an ActivityPub `Activity` to the receiving instance's `/inbox` endpoint.
    *   **Reverse Proxy** receives the HTTPS request.
    *   Reverse Proxy forwards the request to the **Backend (lemmy_server)**.
    *   Backend's **Federation (ActivityPub)** component receives the activity.
    *   Backend verifies the signature of the activity using the sender's public key (obtained through WebFinger or similar mechanisms).
    *   Backend processes the activity based on its type (e.g., creates a local representation of a remote post, adds a remote comment).
    *   Backend updates the **Database (PostgreSQL)** accordingly.
*   **Voting on Content:**
    *   User clicks the vote button on the **Frontend (Web UI)**.
    *   Frontend sends an HTTPS `POST` request to the **Backend (lemmy_server) API** `/api/v3/vote`. Includes the authentication token and vote details.
    *   **Reverse Proxy** forwards the request.
    *   Backend authenticates the user.
    *   Backend updates the vote count in the **Database (PostgreSQL)**.
    *   Backend, via **Federation (ActivityPub)**, may send a `Like` or `Dislike` activity to federated instances.

**8. Security Considerations (Detailed)**

This section expands on the initial security considerations, providing more specific examples and potential threats:

*   **Authentication and Authorization:**
    *   **Threats:** Brute-force attacks on login, credential stuffing, session hijacking, privilege escalation.
    *   **Mitigations:** Strong password policies, multi-factor authentication (MFA), secure session management (e.g., HTTP-only and secure cookies), proper authorization checks on all API endpoints.
*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Threats:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, Command Injection, Path Traversal.
    *   **Mitigations:** Server-side input validation on all user-provided data, output encoding to prevent XSS, parameterized queries or ORM usage to prevent SQL injection, avoiding direct execution of user-provided commands.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Threats:** Malicious scripts injected into web pages, stealing user credentials, redirecting users, defacing the website.
    *   **Mitigations:** Output encoding/escaping of user-generated content, Content Security Policy (CSP) headers.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):**
    *   **Threats:** Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of authenticated users.
    *   **Mitigations:** Anti-CSRF tokens (synchronizer tokens), SameSite cookie attribute.
*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   **Threats:** Unauthorized access to or modification of database data.
    *   **Mitigations:** Using parameterized queries or an ORM, principle of least privilege for database access.
*   **Federation Security:**
    *   **Threats:** Spoofed activities, malicious content from federated instances, denial-of-service attacks via large or malformed activities.
    *   **Mitigations:** Verifying signatures of incoming ActivityPub messages, content filtering and sanitization of federated content, rate limiting of incoming federation requests.
*   **Rate Limiting:**
    *   **Threats:** Denial-of-service attacks, brute-force attacks.
    *   **Mitigations:** Implementing rate limits on API endpoints, especially authentication and content submission endpoints.
*   **Media Handling:**
    *   **Threats:** Upload of malware, serving malicious content, path traversal vulnerabilities.
    *   **Mitigations:** Scanning uploaded files for malware, storing media files outside the webroot, using unique and unpredictable filenames, proper access controls on media storage.
*   **Data Privacy:**
    *   **Threats:** Unauthorized access to personal data, data breaches, non-compliance with privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR).
    *   **Mitigations:** Encryption of sensitive data at rest and in transit, implementing access controls, minimizing data collection, providing users with control over their data.
*   **Secure Configuration:**
    *   **Threats:** Exploitation of default credentials, insecure service configurations.
    *   **Mitigations:** Changing default passwords, disabling unnecessary features, following security best practices for each component (e.g., database, reverse proxy).
*   **Dependency Management:**
    *   **Threats:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
    *   **Mitigations:** Regularly updating dependencies, using dependency scanning tools.

**9. Deployment Considerations (Security Focused)**

Lemmy can be deployed in various environments, with the following security considerations:

*   **Containerization (Docker, Podman):**
    *   **Security:** Use minimal base images, regularly scan container images for vulnerabilities, implement proper container isolation and resource limits.
*   **Reverse Proxy (Nginx, Apache):**
    *   **Security:** Configure TLS with strong ciphers, enforce HTTPS, implement security headers (e.g., HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options), configure rate limiting and request filtering.
*   **Backend Instances:**
    *   **Security:** Run backend processes with non-root users, restrict network access, implement logging and monitoring.
*   **PostgreSQL Database:**
    *   **Security:** Use strong passwords for database users, restrict network access to the database, encrypt data at rest, regularly back up the database.
*   **Media Storage:**
    *   **Security:** Implement access controls to restrict access to authorized users, configure appropriate permissions on the storage location, consider using a dedicated object storage service with built-in security features.

A typical secure deployment often involves:

*   A hardened reverse proxy handling TLS termination and acting as a security gateway.
*   Backend instances running in a private network, only accessible through the reverse proxy.
*   A securely configured PostgreSQL database, potentially in a separate private network.
*   Securely configured media storage with appropriate access controls.
*   Regular security updates and patching of all components.
