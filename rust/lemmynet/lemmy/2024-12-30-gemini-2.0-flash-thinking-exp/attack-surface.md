Here are the high and critical risk attack surfaces directly involving Lemmy:

**High and Critical Lemmy-Specific Attack Surfaces:**

*   **Description:** Malicious Federated Instance Interactions
    *   **How Lemmy Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Lemmy's core functionality relies on federation with other Lemmy instances via the ActivityPub protocol. This inherently trusts data and actions originating from external, potentially malicious, servers.
    *   **Example:** A malicious federated instance sends a crafted ActivityPub message to your Lemmy instance, injecting malicious HTML or JavaScript into a post or comment that is then displayed to your users.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), information disclosure, defacement of content, potential for further exploitation if the injected code interacts with other vulnerabilities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all data received from federated instances. Use a well-vetted ActivityPub library and keep it updated. Implement strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS. Consider implementing reputation scoring or blacklisting for known malicious instances.
        *   **Users/Administrators:** Carefully curate the list of federated instances your instance interacts with. Monitor logs for suspicious activity from federated instances.

*   **Description:** Markdown Rendering Vulnerabilities
    *   **How Lemmy Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Lemmy uses a Markdown rendering engine to format user-generated content (posts, comments). Vulnerabilities in this engine can allow attackers to inject malicious code.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a post with specific Markdown syntax that exploits a vulnerability in the rendering engine, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server or XSS in users' browsers.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), server-side request forgery (SSRF), denial of service (DoS) if the rendering process is resource-intensive, potential for remote code execution (RCE) depending on the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Use a well-vetted and regularly updated Markdown rendering library. Implement strict input sanitization and output encoding for all user-generated content, especially before rendering it in the browser. Consider sandboxing the rendering process.
        *   **Users/Administrators:** Stay updated with Lemmy releases and apply security patches promptly.

*   **Description:** Media Handling Vulnerabilities
    *   **How Lemmy Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Lemmy allows users to upload media (images, videos, etc.). Improper handling of these uploads can lead to various vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted image file that exploits a vulnerability in the image processing library, leading to remote code execution on the server. Alternatively, uploading a large number of files could lead to resource exhaustion.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution (RCE), denial of service (DoS), information disclosure (e.g., through Exif data if not sanitized).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust file type validation and sanitization. Use secure and updated image/video processing libraries. Store uploaded files outside the webroot and serve them through a separate, restricted mechanism. Implement file size limits and rate limiting for uploads. Scan uploaded files for malware.
        *   **Users/Administrators:** Monitor server resources for unusual activity related to file uploads.
