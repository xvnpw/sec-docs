*   **Threat:** Malicious Content Injection from Federated Instances
    *   **Description:** An attacker controlling a malicious Lemmy instance could inject harmful content (e.g., spam, malware links, illegal content, offensive material) into the federated network. This content would then be propagated to the Lemmy instance your application interacts with and potentially displayed to your users. The attacker might automate this process to flood the network with malicious content.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of your users to harmful content, potential malware infections, damage to your application's reputation, legal repercussions depending on the nature of the content.
    *   **Affected Lemmy Component:** Federation module, Post/Comment creation logic, potentially the media proxy if malicious media is included.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize Lemmy's defederation features to block known malicious or untrustworthy instances.
        *   The Lemmy instance itself should implement robust content filtering and sanitization.
        *   Monitor the content coming from federated instances for suspicious patterns (on the Lemmy instance).

*   **Threat:** Malicious Links and Attachments in Lemmy Content
    *   **Description:** Users on Lemmy can post links and attachments that could be malicious (e.g., leading to phishing sites or containing malware). If the Lemmy instance doesn't properly sanitize or warn about these links and attachments, users interacting with the Lemmy instance through your application could be at risk.
    *   **Impact:** Malware infections, phishing attacks, compromise of user accounts.
    *   **Affected Lemmy Component:** Post/Comment content rendering, Media handling.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   The Lemmy instance should implement robust link rewriting and scanning mechanisms.
        *   The Lemmy instance should sanitize HTML content to prevent the execution of malicious scripts.
        *   Warn users about the risks of clicking on external links and downloading attachments within the Lemmy interface.

*   **Threat:** Data Injection via API Interactions
    *   **Description:** If the Lemmy API lacks sufficient input validation, attackers could inject malicious data when creating or modifying content. This could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks affecting other users interacting directly with the Lemmy instance or data corruption within the Lemmy instance.
    *   **Impact:** XSS vulnerabilities affecting other Lemmy users, data corruption within Lemmy.
    *   **Affected Lemmy Component:** API endpoints for content creation/modification.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   The Lemmy API must implement strict input validation and sanitization on all API endpoints that accept user-provided data.
        *   Follow secure coding practices within the Lemmy codebase to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
