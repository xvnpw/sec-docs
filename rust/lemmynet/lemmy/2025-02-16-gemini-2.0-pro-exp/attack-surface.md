# Attack Surface Analysis for lemmynet/lemmy

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Instance Interaction (Federation)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_instance_interaction__federation_.md)

*   **Description:** A rogue or compromised Lemmy instance sends crafted data (posts, comments, user profiles, votes, etc.) to exploit vulnerabilities in other instances.
*   **How Lemmy Contributes:** Lemmy's core functionality relies on trusting data from other, independently operated instances. This trust model is inherent to federation.
*   **Example:** A malicious instance sends a specially crafted ActivityPub `Create` activity containing a comment with an extremely long string in a rarely-used field, triggering a buffer overflow in the receiving instance's parsing logic, leading to remote code execution.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the receiving instance, including data theft, data modification, and potential further propagation of the attack.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Comprehensive Input Validation:** Rigorously validate *all* data received from federated instances, not just user input within the local instance. This includes length checks, type checks, and format validation for *every* field in ActivityPub objects.
        *   **Fuzz Testing:** Employ fuzz testing techniques specifically targeting the ActivityPub parsing and processing logic.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Consider sandboxing or isolating the processing of federated data to limit the impact of potential exploits.
        *   **Defensive Programming:** Assume all external input is malicious and code defensively.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests focused on federation-related vulnerabilities.
    *   **Users/Admins:**
        *   **Instance Selection:** Be cautious about federating with unknown or untrusted instances. Research instances before connecting.
        *   **Monitoring:** Monitor instance logs for suspicious activity from federated instances.
        *   **Defederation:** Be prepared to quickly defederate from instances exhibiting malicious behavior. Have a clear process for this.

## Attack Surface: [ActivityPub Protocol Exploits](./attack_surfaces/activitypub_protocol_exploits.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the implementation of the ActivityPub protocol itself are exploited.
*   **How Lemmy Contributes:** Lemmy's federation is built entirely on ActivityPub. Any weakness in its implementation is a direct vulnerability.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a malformed ActivityPub `Follow` activity that bypasses authentication checks, allowing them to force an instance to follow a malicious actor.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the specific exploit, ranging from denial of service to unauthorized access and data manipulation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Strict Specification Adherence:** Adhere meticulously to the ActivityPub specification. Avoid custom extensions or deviations unless absolutely necessary and thoroughly vetted.
        *   **Library Updates:** Keep the ActivityPub library (and all dependencies) up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Security Reviews:** Conduct regular security reviews of the ActivityPub implementation code.
        *   **Formal Verification:** Consider using formal verification techniques (where feasible) to prove the correctness of critical parts of the ActivityPub implementation.
    *   **Users/Admins:**
        *   **Software Updates:** Keep Lemmy instances updated to the latest version to receive security patches.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Federation](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_federation.md)

*   **Description:** Lemmy fetches data (images, avatars, etc.) from URLs provided by other instances. A malicious URL can trick the server into making requests to internal or sensitive external resources.
*   **How Lemmy Contributes:** Federation inherently involves fetching data from external sources based on information provided by other instances.
*   **Example:** A malicious instance sets its avatar URL to `http://127.0.0.1:22` (or an internal service port). When another instance fetches this avatar, it attempts to connect to the local SSH server (or internal service), potentially revealing information or allowing further attacks.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of internal services, data leakage, potential for further attacks against internal infrastructure.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **URL Allowlisting:** Implement a strict allowlist of permitted domains and protocols for fetching external resources.
        *   **Private IP Blocking:** Explicitly block requests to private IP address ranges (e.g., 127.0.0.1, 192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x, 172.16.x.x - 172.31.x.x).
        *   **Network Isolation:** Use a separate, restricted network context (e.g., a container or virtual machine with limited network access) for fetching external resources.
        *   **DNS Resolution Control:** Control DNS resolution to prevent resolving to internal or sensitive hostnames.
        *   **Redirect Handling:** Carefully handle HTTP redirects, enforcing the same restrictions on redirected URLs.
        *   **Timeout and Resource Limits:** Implement timeouts and resource limits on external requests to prevent denial-of-service attacks.
    *   **Users/Admins:**
        *   **Network Segmentation:** If possible, run Lemmy instances in a network segment that has limited access to internal resources.
