## Mitigation Strategy: [Robust Instance Allowlist/Blocklist System (Lemmy-Specific Implementation)](./mitigation_strategies/robust_instance_allowlistblocklist_system__lemmy-specific_implementation_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:**  Implement a configurable system *within Lemmy* to control which other Lemmy instances your instance federates with, prioritizing an allowlist approach.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Default-Deny (Allowlist Focus):** Modify Lemmy's core federation logic to *default to not federating* with any instance.
    2.  **Allowlist Implementation:**  Extend Lemmy's existing admin panel (or create a new section) to allow administrators to explicitly add trusted instance domains to an allowlist.
    3.  **Blocklist (Secondary):** Maintain the existing blocklist functionality as a secondary mechanism to override the allowlist.
    4.  **Federation Request Handling (Code Modification):**  Alter the code that handles incoming federation requests to:
        *   Check the blocklist *first*. If the requesting instance is blocked, reject immediately.
        *   Check the allowlist *second*. If the requesting instance is *not* on the allowlist, reject.
        *   If on the allowlist (and not blocked), proceed with other checks (rate limiting, etc.).
    5.  **UI/UX Improvements:** Enhance the admin interface for managing the allowlist/blocklist, making it easy to add, remove, search, and import/export lists.
    6.  **Database Schema:** Potentially modify the database schema to efficiently store and query the allowlist/blocklist.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Instances Joining the Federation (High Severity):**  Directly prevents federation with untrusted instances.
    *   **Federation-Based DoS (Medium Severity):**  Allows blocking of known DoS sources.
    *   **Data Poisoning from Federated Instances (Medium Severity):**  Reduces the attack surface by limiting federation.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Instances:** High impact (core mitigation).
    *   **Federation-Based DoS:** Medium impact (reactive blocking).
    *   **Data Poisoning:** Medium impact (reduces exposure).

*   **Currently Implemented:**  Basic blocklist functionality exists.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Default-deny (allowlist-centric) behavior is the key missing piece.** This requires a fundamental change to Lemmy's federation logic.
    *   UI/UX improvements for managing large lists.
    *   Automated allowlist/blocklist updates are not built-in.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Data Validation and Sanitization (Lemmy Codebase)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_data_validation_and_sanitization__lemmy_codebase_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:**  Enhance Lemmy's codebase to rigorously validate and sanitize *all* data received from federated instances and user input *at the point of entry and processing*.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Federated Data Validation (Code Modification):**
        *   Identify *all* code locations where data from other instances is received and processed (ActivityPub handlers, API endpoints).
        *   Implement strict type checking, format validation, range checking, length restrictions, and consistency checks *before* any further processing.  Use Rust's strong typing to enforce this where possible.
        *   Reject any data that does not meet the validation criteria.
    2.  **User Input Sanitization (Code Modification):**
        *   Identify *all* code locations where user input is received (forms, API endpoints).
        *   Ensure that a robust HTML sanitization library (appropriate for Rust) is used *consistently* to sanitize all user-generated content (posts, comments, profiles, etc.).
        *   Verify that output encoding is applied correctly in all templates and API responses.
    3.  **CSP Implementation (Configuration & Code):**
        *   Review and tighten Lemmy's Content Security Policy (CSP) headers.  This likely involves modifying the web server configuration and potentially some code that generates HTTP headers.
        *   Aim for the strictest possible CSP that doesn't break functionality.
    4.  **Regular Expression Review:**
        *  Review all regular expressions.
        *  Ensure that regular expressions are strict.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Poisoning from Federated Instances (High Severity):**  Core defense against malicious data.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):**  Core defense against XSS.
    *   **SQL Injection (High Severity):** (Indirectly, as part of a layered defense).
    *   **Other Injection Attacks (High Severity):**  General protection against injection.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Poisoning:** High impact (essential).
    *   **XSS:** High impact (essential).
    *   **SQL Injection:** Medium impact (layered defense).
    *   **Other Injection Attacks:** High impact.

*   **Currently Implemented:**  Some level of sanitization and validation exists.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A comprehensive, systematic review and enhancement of *all* input validation and sanitization points is needed.  This requires a thorough code audit.
    *   CSP may need tightening.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Parameterized Queries / Prepared Statements (Lemmy Codebase - Verification)](./mitigation_strategies/parameterized_queries__prepared_statements__lemmy_codebase_-_verification_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:**  *Verify* and *enforce* the consistent use of parameterized queries or prepared statements for *all* database interactions within the Lemmy codebase.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Code Review:** Conduct a thorough code review of *all* database interaction code (likely involving Diesel, the ORM).
    2.  **Automated Checks (Ideally):**  If possible, use static analysis tools or linters (if available for Rust and Diesel) to automatically detect any instances of string concatenation in SQL queries.
    3.  **Code Style Enforcement:**  Establish and enforce coding standards that *require* the use of parameterized queries.
    4.  **Documentation:**  Clearly document the requirement for parameterized queries in the developer documentation.
    5. **Training:** Train developers how to use parameterized queries.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **SQL Injection (High Severity):**  The primary defense.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** High impact (eliminates the risk if done correctly).

*   **Currently Implemented:**  Highly likely to be implemented due to Rust's ecosystem and Diesel.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   The key here is *verification* and *enforcement*.  A code review is needed to *guarantee* 100% coverage.  Automated checks would be ideal.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting (Lemmy-Specific Implementation)](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting__lemmy-specific_implementation_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:**  Implement or enhance Lemmy's built-in rate limiting mechanisms, specifically targeting federation traffic and other key actions.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Federation Rate Limiting (Code Modification):**
        *   Add code to track the number of federation requests received from each instance (per time period).
        *   Implement configurable limits (per instance, ideally) in the admin panel.
        *   Reject requests that exceed the limits, returning an appropriate HTTP error code (429).
    2.  **General Rate Limiting (Code Modification):**
        *   Identify other actions that should be rate-limited (e.g., login attempts, post creation, comment creation, user registration).
        *   Implement rate limiting for these actions, using a consistent mechanism (e.g., a dedicated rate-limiting library or module).
        *   Make the limits configurable in the admin panel.
    3.  **Storage:**  Choose an appropriate storage mechanism for tracking request counts (e.g., in-memory cache, Redis, database).
    4. **UI/UX:** Provide administrators with clear feedback in the UI when rate limits are hit.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Federation-Based DoS (Medium Severity):**  Directly addresses this threat.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (Medium Severity):**  Protects against login brute-forcing.
    *   **Spam (Medium Severity):**  Can help control spam.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Low Severity):**  General protection.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Federation-Based DoS:** Medium impact (key mitigation).
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Medium impact.
    *   **Spam:** Medium impact.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Low impact.

*   **Currently Implemented:**  Likely some basic rate limiting exists.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive, configurable rate limiting for *all* relevant actions, especially *per-instance federation rate limiting*, is likely not fully implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [ActivityPub Implementation Hardening (Lemmy Codebase)](./mitigation_strategies/activitypub_implementation_hardening__lemmy_codebase_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:**  Strengthen Lemmy's ActivityPub implementation through rigorous validation, authentication, and authorization checks.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Strict Message Validation (Code Modification):**
        *   Enhance the code that handles incoming ActivityPub messages to perform *very strict* validation against the ActivityPub schema.
        *   Reject any message that does not conform to the expected format or contains invalid data.
        *   Verify digital signatures (if used) to ensure authenticity.
    2.  **Authentication and Authorization (Code Modification):**
        *   Ensure that Lemmy properly authenticates other instances (e.g., using HTTP Signatures).
        *   Implement authorization checks to ensure that only authorized instances can perform specific actions (e.g., sending posts to your instance).
    3.  **Fuzzing (Testing):**  Conduct fuzzing tests specifically targeting the ActivityPub handling code to identify potential vulnerabilities.
    4. **Code Review:** Conduct code review to check if ActivityPub implementation is secure.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Instances (Medium Severity):**  Limits the impact of malicious instances.
    *   **Data Poisoning (High Severity):**  Prevents malformed ActivityPub messages from being processed.
    *   **Federation-Based DoS (Medium Severity):**  Helps prevent DoS via malformed messages.
    *   **ActivityPub-Specific Vulnerabilities (High Severity):**  Addresses protocol-level vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Instances:** Medium impact.
    *   **Data Poisoning:** High impact (essential).
    *   **Federation-Based DoS:** Medium impact.
    *   **ActivityPub-Specific Vulnerabilities:** High impact.

*   **Currently Implemented:**  Lemmy implements ActivityPub.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   The *rigor* of validation and the *completeness* of authentication/authorization checks are areas for potential improvement.  Fuzzing is crucial.
