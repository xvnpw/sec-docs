## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. Abuse Federation Protocol (ActivityPub) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__abuse_federation_protocol__activitypub___high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in Lemmy's implementation of the ActivityPub protocol, which handles communication with other federated instances.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **1.1.1.1. Bypass Signature Verification (if flawed) [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Description:**  If the signature verification process for ActivityPub messages is flawed, an attacker could forge messages from other instances, bypassing authentication.
        *   **Impact:** Very High (RCE, full control)
        *   **Mitigation:**  Rigorous testing and auditing of the signature verification implementation. Ensure adherence to ActivityPub specifications. Use well-vetted cryptographic libraries.
    *   **1.1.1.2. Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities in ActivityPub Handling [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Description:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in how Lemmy deserializes (converts from a serialized format like JSON) ActivityPub messages.  Attackers could inject malicious objects that trigger unintended code execution.
        *   **Impact:** Very High (RCE)
        *   **Mitigation:**  Avoid deserializing untrusted data whenever possible.  If deserialization is necessary, use safe deserialization libraries and techniques.  Implement strict input validation *before* deserialization. Consider using a schema validation library.
    *   **1.1.3.1. Exploit a Vulnerable Federated Instance to Attack Target [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   **Description:**  Compromising a different Lemmy instance (or other ActivityPub-compatible software) and using that compromised instance to send malicious requests or updates to the target instance.
        *   **Impact:** High (depends on the actions performed)
        *   **Mitigation:**  Implement robust monitoring of federation traffic.  Consider implementing a reputation system for federated instances.  Be prepared to defederate from instances that exhibit suspicious behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2. Manipulate User Account Management [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2__manipulate_user_account_management__high_risk_.md)

* **Description:** Exploiting weaknesses in the user account creation, login, and password management processes.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **1.2.1.1. Bypass Email Verification (if flawed):**
        * **Description:** Circumventing the email verification step during password reset, allowing an attacker to take over an account without access to the associated email.
        * **Impact:** High (account takeover)
        * **Mitigation:** Ensure that email verification is mandatory and cannot be bypassed. Use unique, cryptographically secure tokens for email verification links. Implement short expiration times for verification links.
    * **1.2.1.2. Predict or Brute-Force Reset Tokens:**
        * **Description:** Guessing or brute-forcing the tokens used for password reset links.
        * **Impact:** High (account takeover)
        * **Mitigation:** Use long, randomly generated tokens with high entropy. Implement strict rate limiting on password reset attempts. Consider using account lockout policies after multiple failed attempts.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.3. Inject Malicious Code via Image/Media Uploads [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_3__inject_malicious_code_via_imagemedia_uploads__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:**  Uploading malicious files disguised as images or other media to exploit vulnerabilities in image processing or file handling.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **1.3.3.1. Exploit image processing libraries used by Lemmy [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Description:**  Leveraging known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the image processing libraries used by Lemmy (e.g., ImageMagick, libvips) to achieve remote code execution.
        *   **Impact:** Very High (RCE)
        *   **Mitigation:**  Keep image processing libraries up-to-date with the latest security patches.  Consider sandboxing image processing to limit the impact of potential exploits.  Use a minimal set of image processing features. Validate image dimensions and other metadata before processing.
    *   **1.3.3.2 Bypass file type validation:**
        * **Description:** Uploading executable files that are disguised as images by manipulating file extensions or content types.
        * **Impact:** Very High (RCE)
        * **Mitigation:** Implement strict file type validation based on file content, not just extensions. Use a whitelist of allowed file types.  Store uploaded files outside of the web root.  Scan uploaded files with antivirus software.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.4. Exploit API Endpoints [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_4__exploit_api_endpoints__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:**  Attacking the Lemmy API to gain unauthorized access or perform malicious actions.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **1.4.2. Inject Malicious Input into API Parameters [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Description:**  Providing crafted input to API parameters to exploit vulnerabilities in how the API handles that input (e.g., SQL injection, command injection, path traversal).
        *   **Impact:** High to Very High (depends on the vulnerability)
        *   **Mitigation:**  Implement strict input validation and sanitization for *all* API parameters.  Use parameterized queries or ORMs to prevent SQL injection.  Avoid using user input directly in system commands.  Validate file paths and URLs to prevent path traversal.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.3. Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Dependencies [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2_3__vulnerabilities_in_third-party_dependencies__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploiting known vulnerabilities in the libraries and frameworks that Lemmy depends on.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **2.3.1. Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Libraries Used by Lemmy [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Description:**  Leveraging publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) in Lemmy's dependencies to achieve various impacts, including RCE, data breaches, and denial of service.
        *   **Impact:** Varies (depends on the CVE) - Can be Very High
        *   **Mitigation:**  Maintain an up-to-date Software Bill of Materials (SBOM).  Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `cargo audit`, `dependabot`, or OWASP Dependency-Check.  Apply security patches promptly.  Consider using a dependency management system that automatically updates dependencies to secure versions.
