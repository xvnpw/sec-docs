## Threat Model: Compromising Application Using Hyper - High-Risk Sub-Tree

**Attacker Goal:** Gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality of the application by exploiting vulnerabilities within the `hyper` HTTP library.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

*   Compromise Application via Hyper Exploitation
    *   [AND] ***High-Risk Path*** Exploit Hyper's Request Handling
        *   [OR] [CRITICAL] HTTP Request Smuggling
        *   [OR] [CRITICAL] HTTP Header Injection
    *   [AND] ***High-Risk Path*** Exploit Hyper's Response Handling
        *   [OR] [CRITICAL] HTTP Response Splitting
    *   [AND] ***High-Risk Path*** [CRITICAL] Exploit Dependencies or Underlying Libraries (Indirectly through Hyper)
        *   [OR] [CRITICAL] Vulnerabilities in the TLS library used by Hyper

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Hyper's Request Handling**

This path focuses on manipulating incoming HTTP requests to exploit vulnerabilities in how `hyper` processes them.

*   **Critical Node: HTTP Request Smuggling**
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Inconsistent Request Parsing:** The attacker sends an ambiguous HTTP request that is interpreted differently by `hyper` compared to upstream proxies or servers. This discrepancy can be exploited to bypass security controls or route requests to unintended destinations.
            *   The attacker crafts a request with variations in header formatting (e.g., using both `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` in a way that causes confusion).
            *   `hyper` might parse the request one way, while a proxy interprets it another way, leading to a mismatch in how the request is handled.
    *   **Impact:** Bypassing security controls (like WAFs), routing requests to internal-only resources, performing cache poisoning attacks.

*   **Critical Node: HTTP Header Injection**
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Injecting Newline Characters:** The attacker crafts a malicious request where user-controlled input is included in HTTP headers, and this input contains newline characters (`\r\n`). If `hyper` doesn't properly sanitize these characters, it can lead to the injection of arbitrary headers.
            *   An attacker might manipulate a URL parameter or form field that is later used to construct a header value.
            *   By injecting `\r\n`, the attacker can insert new headers or even the start of a new HTTP response within the original request.
    *   **Impact:** Injecting arbitrary HTTP headers, which can be used for various attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) by injecting `Set-Cookie` or other relevant headers, or session fixation by setting a specific session ID.

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Hyper's Response Handling**

This path focuses on manipulating the HTTP responses generated by the application through vulnerabilities in `hyper`.

*   **Critical Node: HTTP Response Splitting**
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Injecting Newline Characters in Response Headers:** Similar to header injection in requests, if the application allows attacker-controlled data to be included in response headers and `hyper` doesn't prevent the injection of newline characters, an attacker can inject arbitrary headers and even the response body.
            *   The application might use user input to set a custom header value.
            *   By injecting `\r\n\r\n`, the attacker can terminate the original response headers and inject their own content, effectively sending a second, malicious HTTP response to the client.
    *   **Impact:** Injecting arbitrary HTTP headers and body into the response. This can be used to perform Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks by injecting malicious JavaScript, redirect users to malicious sites, or manipulate the content displayed to the user.

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Dependencies or Underlying Libraries (Indirectly through Hyper)**

This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities in libraries that `hyper` depends on, particularly the TLS library.

*   **Critical Node: Vulnerabilities in the TLS library used by Hyper**
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities:** Attackers target known vulnerabilities in the specific version of the TLS library that `hyper` is using. These vulnerabilities are often publicly documented and may have readily available exploits.
            *   Examples include vulnerabilities that allow for downgrading the TLS connection to a weaker, less secure protocol version.
            *   Vulnerabilities that allow for bypassing certificate validation.
    *   **Impact:**  Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, where the attacker can intercept and potentially modify communication between the client and the server. This can lead to information disclosure (e.g., stealing credentials, sensitive data) or the injection of malicious content.

These high-risk paths and critical nodes represent the most significant threats related to the use of the `hyper` library. Focusing mitigation efforts on these areas will provide the most effective security improvements for the application.
