# Attack Tree Analysis for rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer

Objective: To achieve arbitrary code execution within the developer's environment or influence the build process of the application by exploiting rust-analyzer.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
*   OR: Exploit Code Analysis Features
    *   **HIGH RISK PATH** AND: Supply Malicious Dependencies
        *   Technique: **CRITICAL NODE** Introduce malicious dependency in Cargo.toml
            *   Vulnerability: **CRITICAL NODE** Rust-analyzer analyzes and potentially processes dependencies.
*   OR: Exploit External Command Execution (Indirect via Build System/Tools)
    *   **HIGH RISK PATH** AND: Command Injection via Formatting/Linting Tools (Triggered by Rust-analyzer)
        *   Technique: **CRITICAL NODE** Configure rust-analyzer to use external formatting or linting tools that are vulnerable to command injection.
            *   Vulnerability: **CRITICAL NODE** If rust-analyzer allows configuration of external tools without proper sanitization of arguments, and those tools are vulnerable.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Malicious Dependencies (High-Risk Path & Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/supply_malicious_dependencies__high-risk_path_&_critical_node_.md)

**Attack:** Supply Chain Attack via Malicious Dependencies.
*   **How it Works:**
    *   The attacker creates a seemingly legitimate Rust crate (dependency) and publishes it to a crate registry (like crates.io) or a private registry.
    *   This malicious crate contains code designed to compromise the developer's environment or the build process. This code could be in the library's Rust source code, or more insidiously, in a `build.rs` script that executes during the build process.
    *   The attacker then attempts to get developers to include this malicious crate as a dependency in their `Cargo.toml` file. This could be achieved through social engineering, typosquatting (creating a crate with a name similar to a popular one), or by compromising a legitimate crate and injecting malicious code into an update.
    *   When a developer adds this malicious dependency to their project and rust-analyzer analyzes the project (which it does automatically), rust-analyzer will process the `Cargo.toml` and the dependency.
    *   If the malicious dependency contains exploitable code (especially in `build.rs`), it can execute within the developer's environment when the project is built or analyzed.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   **Compromise of Developer Environment:** Arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine, leading to data theft, installation of malware, or further attacks.
    *   **Compromise of Build Process:**  Malicious code in `build.rs` can modify build artifacts, inject backdoors into the application being built, or steal secrets during the build process.
*   **Mitigations:**
    *   **Dependency Scanning:** Use tools that scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities and malicious code patterns.
    *   **Secure Dependency Management Practices:**
        *   Carefully review dependencies before adding them to your project.
        *   Use reputable and well-maintained crates.
        *   Pin dependency versions to avoid unexpected updates that might introduce malicious code.
        *   Use private registries for internal dependencies to control the supply chain.
    *   **Code Review of Dependencies:**  For critical projects, consider reviewing the source code of dependencies, especially `build.rs` scripts.
    *   **Sandboxing Build Processes:**  Isolate build processes in sandboxed environments to limit the impact of malicious code execution during builds.

## Attack Tree Path: [Command Injection via Formatting/Linting Tools (High-Risk Path & Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/command_injection_via_formattinglinting_tools__high-risk_path_&_critical_node_.md)

**Attack:** Command Injection through External Tools Configured by rust-analyzer.
*   **How it Works:**
    *   Rust-analyzer often integrates with external formatting tools (like `rustfmt`) and linting tools (like `clippy`) to provide code formatting and static analysis features.
    *   Developers can configure rust-analyzer to use specific external tools and potentially customize how these tools are invoked (e.g., command-line arguments).
    *   If rust-analyzer's configuration mechanism for external tools is vulnerable to command injection, or if the external tools themselves are vulnerable, an attacker can exploit this.
    *   An attacker could potentially craft a malicious project configuration (e.g., in `.rust-analyzer.json` or similar configuration files) that injects malicious commands into the arguments passed to the external formatting or linting tool.
    *   When rust-analyzer triggers these external tools (e.g., on "format on save" or during code analysis), the injected commands will be executed in the developer's environment with the privileges of the rust-analyzer process (and potentially the IDE/editor process).
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution in Developer Environment:**  Successful command injection allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the developer's machine.
    *   **Data Theft, Malware Installation, Further Attacks:** Similar to malicious dependencies, this can lead to full compromise of the developer's environment.
*   **Mitigations:**
    *   **Secure Configuration Practices:**
        *   Carefully review and control rust-analyzer's configuration, especially settings related to external tools.
        *   Avoid using untrusted or overly permissive configurations.
    *   **Input Sanitization in rust-analyzer (Development Team Action):** The rust-analyzer development team should ensure that arguments passed to external tools are properly sanitized to prevent command injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Use Trusted and Updated Tools:**  Use well-known and actively maintained formatting and linting tools. Keep these tools updated to patch any security vulnerabilities in them.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run rust-analyzer and external tools with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of a successful exploit.
    *   **Monitoring Process Executions:** Monitor processes spawned by rust-analyzer, looking for suspicious command executions.
