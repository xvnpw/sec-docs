## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Supply Malicious Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_supply_malicious_dependencies.md)

*   **Critical Node: Introduce malicious dependency in `Cargo.toml`**
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker aims to introduce a malicious Rust crate as a dependency into the application's `Cargo.toml` file. This could be achieved through:
        *   **Directly compromising the repository:** If the attacker gains access to the application's source code repository, they can directly modify `Cargo.toml` to add a malicious dependency.
        *   **Social Engineering:** Tricking a developer into adding a malicious dependency. This could involve creating a seemingly useful crate with a similar name to a legitimate one (typosquatting) or convincing developers to use a compromised crate.
    *   **Critical Node: Rust-analyzer analyzes and potentially processes dependencies.**
        *   **Vulnerability:** Rust-analyzer, as part of its code analysis functionality, parses and analyzes the `Cargo.toml` file and the declared dependencies. If rust-analyzer processes these dependencies in a way that triggers execution of code within the malicious dependency (e.g., during build script analysis or some form of pre-processing), it could lead to compromise.
        *   **Impact:**  If successful, this attack can lead to:
            *   **Compromise of the developer's environment:** Malicious code within the dependency can execute in the developer's environment when rust-analyzer analyzes the project.
            *   **Influence on the build process:**  Malicious dependencies can contain build scripts (`build.rs`) that execute arbitrary code during the build process, potentially injecting backdoors into the application artifacts or compromising the build system.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   **Dependency Scanning:** Regularly scan project dependencies using vulnerability scanners to detect known malicious or vulnerable crates.
            *   **Secure Dependency Management Practices:**
                *   Carefully review dependencies before adding them.
                *   Use crates from trusted sources.
                *   Pin dependency versions to avoid unexpected updates to malicious versions.
                *   Employ dependency lock files (`Cargo.lock`) to ensure consistent dependency versions across environments.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit External Command Execution (Indirect via Formatting/Linting Tools)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_external_command_execution__indirect_via_formattinglinting_tools_.md)

*   **Critical Node: Configure rust-analyzer to use external formatting or linting tools that are vulnerable to command injection.**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Rust-analyzer allows users to configure external tools for code formatting (like `rustfmt`) and linting (like `clippy`). If rust-analyzer's configuration mechanism for these tools is flawed, or if the external tools themselves are vulnerable to command injection, an attacker can exploit this.
        *   **Malicious Configuration:** An attacker could try to modify rust-analyzer's configuration (e.g., via project settings files or global settings) to inject malicious commands into the arguments passed to external formatting or linting tools.
        *   **Vulnerable External Tools:** If the external formatting or linting tools themselves have command injection vulnerabilities, even with correct rust-analyzer configuration, an attacker might be able to exploit these vulnerabilities if rust-analyzer triggers these tools on attacker-controlled code.
    *   **Critical Node: If rust-analyzer allows configuration of external tools without proper sanitization of arguments, and those tools are vulnerable.**
        *   **Vulnerability:** The core vulnerability lies in the potential lack of proper input sanitization by rust-analyzer when constructing commands to execute external tools. If rust-analyzer doesn't sanitize arguments (e.g., user-provided paths, filenames, or configuration options) before passing them to the shell to execute external tools, command injection becomes possible.
        *   **Impact:** Successful command injection can lead to:
            *   **Arbitrary code execution in the developer's environment:** When rust-analyzer triggers the vulnerable external tool (e.g., on "format on save" or during code analysis), the injected commands will be executed with the privileges of the rust-analyzer process (which is typically the developer's user).
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   **Secure Configuration Practices:**
                *   Restrict access to rust-analyzer configuration files and settings.
                *   Carefully review and validate any custom configurations for external tools.
            *   **Validate and Sanitize Arguments:** (Rust-analyzer Development Team Action) Ensure that rust-analyzer properly validates and sanitizes all arguments passed to external tools to prevent command injection.
            *   **Use Trusted and Updated Tools:** Only use trusted and regularly updated formatting and linting tools. Keep these tools updated to patch any known vulnerabilities.
