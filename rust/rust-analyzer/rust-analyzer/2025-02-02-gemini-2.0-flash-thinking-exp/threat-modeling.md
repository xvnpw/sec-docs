# Threat Model Analysis for rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer

## Threat: [Source Code Exposure](./threats/source_code_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability *within rust-analyzer* to access and exfiltrate sensitive source code files being analyzed. This could be achieved by exploiting a path traversal vulnerability *in rust-analyzer's file handling*, a bug in its caching mechanism leading to data leaks, or memory corruption vulnerabilities *within rust-analyzer's core*.
*   **Impact:** Confidential intellectual property is leaked, potentially revealing business logic, algorithms, or proprietary information. If credentials or secrets are hardcoded, they could be exposed, leading to further compromise of systems.
*   **Affected Component:** File System Access *within rust-analyzer*, Caching Mechanism *of rust-analyzer*, Language Server Core *of rust-analyzer*
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in the codebase. Use environment variables or secure configuration management.
    *   **Regularly update rust-analyzer to patch known vulnerabilities.**
    *   Restrict access to the development environment and codebase to authorized personnel.
    *   Monitor rust-analyzer's logs (if available and enabled) for unusual file access patterns *initiated by rust-analyzer*.

## Threat: [Malicious Code Modification via rust-analyzer Vulnerability](./threats/malicious_code_modification_via_rust-analyzer_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a code injection or arbitrary file write vulnerability *in rust-analyzer itself*. This could be triggered by crafting a malicious Rust file that, when analyzed by *a vulnerable rust-analyzer*, causes it to write arbitrary code into other files within the project or even the rust-analyzer installation itself.
*   **Impact:** Introduction of backdoors, malicious logic, or vulnerabilities into the application codebase. This could lead to compromised application security, data breaches, or system takeover when the application is deployed.
*   **Affected Component:** Code Analysis Engine *of rust-analyzer*, Macro Expansion *within rust-analyzer*, Procedural Macro Evaluation *within rust-analyzer*, File System Access *controlled by rust-analyzer*
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep rust-analyzer updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.**
    *   Be extremely cautious about opening untrusted Rust projects with rust-analyzer enabled.
    *   Implement mandatory code review processes to detect any unexpected or malicious code changes.
    *   Utilize version control systems (like Git) to track changes and quickly revert malicious modifications.
    *   Employ file integrity monitoring tools to detect unauthorized file modifications in the project directory.
