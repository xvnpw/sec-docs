# BUSINESS POSTURE

rust-analyzer is a project that provides semantic analysis for the Rust programming language. It operates as a Language Server Protocol (LSP) server, offering features like code completion, error checking, go-to-definition, and refactoring to enhance the Rust development experience in code editors.

Business Priorities and Goals:

- Enhance developer productivity for Rust programmers by providing rich code intelligence features.
- Support the Rust ecosystem by offering a high-quality, open-source language server.
- Enable faster and more reliable Rust software development.
- Facilitate adoption of the Rust programming language by improving the developer experience.

Business Risks:

- Project adoption risk: If the language server is unreliable, slow, or lacks features, developers might not use it, hindering its goals.
- Community support risk: As an open-source project, its success depends on community contributions and maintenance. Lack of community engagement can lead to stagnation and security vulnerabilities.
- Security vulnerability risk: Vulnerabilities in the language server could potentially impact developer machines or the integrity of the code being developed.
- Performance risk: Poor performance of the language server can negatively impact developer experience and productivity.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

- security control: Open Source Code: The project is open source, allowing for community review and scrutiny of the codebase. Implemented in: GitHub repository.
- security control: Code Review: Contributions are reviewed via pull requests. Implemented in: GitHub pull request process.
- security control: Automated Testing: The project likely has automated tests to ensure code quality and prevent regressions. Implemented in: CI pipelines (GitHub Actions).
- security control: Dependency Management: Using Cargo, Rust's package manager, for managing dependencies. Implemented in: `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock` files.

Accepted Risks:

- accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security fixes.
- accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities to be introduced before being identified and patched due to the complexity of the codebase.
- accepted risk: Risk of supply chain vulnerabilities through dependencies, although Rust's dependency management and security practices mitigate this to some extent.

Recommended Security Controls:

- security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Integrate SAST tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan the codebase for potential vulnerabilities.
- security control: Dependency Scanning: Implement dependency scanning to identify known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
- security control: Fuzzing: Employ fuzzing techniques to discover unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities in code parsing and analysis logic.
- security control: Security Audits: Conduct periodic security audits by external security experts to identify and address potential security weaknesses.

Security Requirements:

- Authentication: Not directly applicable as rust-analyzer is a language server and does not handle user authentication in the traditional sense. However, secure communication channels might be relevant if rust-analyzer were to communicate over a network in certain configurations (though typically it communicates locally via pipes or stdio).
- Authorization: Not directly applicable in the traditional sense. Authorization in this context relates to ensuring rust-analyzer only accesses and processes files within the developer's project scope and respects file system permissions.
- Input Validation: Critical. rust-analyzer processes source code and project configurations provided by the user's editor. Robust input validation is essential to prevent vulnerabilities arising from maliciously crafted code or configuration files that could exploit parsing or analysis logic. This includes validating file paths, code syntax, and configuration parameters.
- Cryptography: Not a primary requirement for core functionality. Cryptography might be relevant if features like secure code signing or encrypted communication were to be added in the future, but it's not a core security requirement for the current scope of a language server.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

- Developer Productivity: rust-analyzer directly impacts developer productivity by providing code intelligence features that speed up development and reduce errors.
- Rust Ecosystem Support: rust-analyzer is a key component of the Rust ecosystem, supporting the language's usability and adoption.

Data Sensitivity:

- Source Code: rust-analyzer processes source code, which can be highly sensitive and confidential, especially in commercial projects. While rust-analyzer itself does not store or transmit source code outside the developer's machine, vulnerabilities could potentially expose or compromise the code being analyzed.
- Project Configurations: Project configuration files (e.g., `Cargo.toml`) are also processed, which might contain sensitive information or influence the build process.
- Developer Environment: Indirectly, vulnerabilities in rust-analyzer could potentially compromise the developer's machine and environment.

Data Sensitivity Level: High. Source code and developer environments are highly sensitive assets.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

- Are there any specific compliance requirements that rust-analyzer needs to adhere to (e.g., security certifications, data privacy regulations)?
- Are there any plans to introduce network communication features in rust-analyzer in the future?
- What is the current process for handling security vulnerabilities reported by the community or discovered internally?
- Are there any specific performance requirements that have security implications (e.g., DoS resistance)?

Assumptions:

- BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to enhance developer productivity and support the Rust ecosystem. Security is important but not the absolute highest priority compared to functionality and performance for initial versions, but becomes increasingly critical as adoption grows.
- SECURITY POSTURE: The project follows standard open-source security practices, including code review and automated testing. There is an awareness of security risks, but dedicated security measures might be still evolving.
- DESIGN: rust-analyzer is primarily designed as a local language server application communicating with code editors via LSP. Deployment is assumed to be on developer machines, and the build process uses standard Rust tooling and CI practices.
