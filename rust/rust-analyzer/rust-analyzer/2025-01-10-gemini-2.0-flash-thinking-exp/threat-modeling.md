# Threat Model Analysis for rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer

## Threat: [Malicious Code Injection via Analyzed Code](./threats/malicious_code_injection_via_analyzed_code.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides specially crafted Rust code to the application. This code is then passed to `rust-analyzer` for analysis. The malicious code exploits a vulnerability in `rust-analyzer`'s parsing, macro expansion, or analysis logic to execute arbitrary code.

**Impact:** Remote code execution on the server or in the context where `rust-analyzer` is running, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Parser, Macro Expander, Type Checker, potentially other analysis modules within `rust-analyzer`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Sanitize or validate the input code before passing it to `rust-analyzer`. This is extremely difficult for complex languages like Rust.
* Run `rust-analyzer` in a heavily sandboxed environment with limited permissions (e.g., using containers, VMs, or process isolation techniques).
* Keep `rust-analyzer` updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
* Implement strict resource limits (CPU, memory, time) for the `rust-analyzer` process.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Maliciously Crafted Code](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_maliciously_crafted_code.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides extremely large, deeply nested, or computationally intensive Rust code that, when analyzed by `rust-analyzer`, consumes excessive CPU, memory, or other system resources.

**Impact:** Denial of service, performance degradation of the application or the underlying system.

**Affected Component:** Parser, Name Resolution, Type Inference, Macro Expansion, potentially all analysis modules within `rust-analyzer`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Set limits on the size and complexity of the code submitted for analysis.
* Implement timeouts for analysis requests.
* Monitor `rust-analyzer`'s resource usage and restart the process if it exceeds thresholds.
* Consider offloading analysis to a separate, isolated process or machine with resource constraints.

## Threat: [Exploiting Parser or Analyzer Bugs for Denial of Service](./threats/exploiting_parser_or_analyzer_bugs_for_denial_of_service.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts specific Rust code that triggers a bug in `rust-analyzer`'s parsing or analysis logic, causing it to crash or enter an infinite loop.

**Impact:** Denial of service, instability of the application relying on `rust-analyzer`.

**Affected Component:** Parser, Lexer, any analysis module within `rust-analyzer` with exploitable bugs.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep `rust-analyzer` updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes.
* Implement error handling and recovery mechanisms in the application to gracefully handle `rust-analyzer` crashes.
* Monitor `rust-analyzer`'s logs and restart the process automatically upon crashes.

## Threat: [Compromised `rust-analyzer` Binary or Source](./threats/compromised__rust-analyzer__binary_or_source.md)

**Description:** If the source code or the pre-compiled binary of `rust-analyzer` is compromised (e.g., through a supply chain attack), it could contain malicious code.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the system where `rust-analyzer` is running.

**Affected Component:** Entire `rust-analyzer` codebase.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Obtain `rust-analyzer` from trusted sources.
* Verify the integrity of the downloaded binary (e.g., using checksums or signatures).
* Consider building `rust-analyzer` from source if greater control over the build process is required.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation within `rust-analyzer` (if improperly configured)](./threats/privilege_escalation_within__rust-analyzer___if_improperly_configured_.md)

**Description:** If `rust-analyzer` is running with elevated privileges (which is generally not recommended), vulnerabilities within `rust-analyzer` could be exploited to gain further access to the system.

**Impact:** Full system compromise.

**Affected Component:** Any part of `rust-analyzer` that has a security vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Run `rust-analyzer` with the least necessary privileges.
* Utilize sandboxing and isolation techniques to limit the impact of potential exploits.
