# Attack Surface Analysis for rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer

## Attack Surface: [Execution of Arbitrary Code via Malicious Build Scripts (`build.rs`)](./attack_surfaces/execution_of_arbitrary_code_via_malicious_build_scripts___build_rs__.md)

**Description:** A Rust project contains a malicious `build.rs` script that executes arbitrary code when `rust-analyzer` analyzes the project.

**How rust-analyzer contributes:** `rust-analyzer` interacts with Cargo, the Rust build system, which may execute `build.rs` scripts as part of the project analysis process.

**Example:** A `build.rs` script that downloads and executes a malicious binary, modifies system files, or exfiltrates data.

**Impact:** Full system compromise, data theft, installation of malware, denial of service. This is a significant risk as `build.rs` scripts have the same privileges as the user running `rust-analyzer`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Thoroughly review the contents of `build.rs` scripts, especially in projects from untrusted sources.**
* **Utilize containerization or virtual machines for development of untrusted projects to isolate potential damage.**
* Employ security scanning tools that analyze build scripts for suspicious activity.
* Consider disabling or sandboxing the execution of build scripts within `rust-analyzer` if such options become available (currently not a standard feature).
