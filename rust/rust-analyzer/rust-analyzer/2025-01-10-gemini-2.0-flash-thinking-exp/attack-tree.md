## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code via rust-analyzer's Analysis](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_via_rust-analyzer's_analysis.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker aims to introduce malicious code into the application's environment by leveraging rust-analyzer's code analysis process. The core idea is that if rust-analyzer processes specially crafted malicious code, it can trigger vulnerabilities within rust-analyzer itself or influence its behavior in a way that leads to code execution within the application's context.

* **Potential Consequences:** Successful injection of malicious code can lead to arbitrary code execution within the application's environment, allowing the attacker to:
    * Gain complete control over the application.
    * Access and exfiltrate sensitive data.
    * Modify application data or functionality.
    * Use the application as a stepping stone for further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Malicious Code in Project Files](./attack_tree_paths/supply_malicious_code_in_project_files.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker directly introduces malicious code into the application's project source files. This could happen through various means, such as:
    * Compromising a developer's machine or account.
    * Submitting malicious pull requests that are not properly reviewed.
    * Exploiting vulnerabilities in the version control system or development tools.

* **Mechanism Related to rust-analyzer:** The malicious code is specifically crafted to exploit vulnerabilities within rust-analyzer's parsing, analysis, or code generation logic. When rust-analyzer processes these files, it triggers the vulnerability, leading to the execution of the attacker's code.

* **Potential Consequences:** Similar to the broader "Inject Malicious Code" scenario, this can result in arbitrary code execution and complete application compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Malicious Code via Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/supply_malicious_code_via_dependencies.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker introduces malicious code indirectly by compromising one of the application's dependencies (either direct or transitive). This can be achieved by:
    * Uploading a malicious crate to a package registry with a similar name to a legitimate one (typosquatting).
    * Compromising the maintainer account of a popular crate and injecting malicious code into a new version.
    * Exploiting vulnerabilities in the dependency resolution process to force the inclusion of a malicious dependency.

* **Mechanism Related to rust-analyzer:** When rust-analyzer analyzes the application's dependencies, it encounters the malicious code within the compromised crate. This malicious code is designed to exploit vulnerabilities in rust-analyzer's processing of external code, leading to code execution within the application's environment.

* **Potential Consequences:** This attack vector can also lead to arbitrary code execution and full application compromise. It is particularly dangerous because developers often trust their dependencies, making it harder to detect.
