### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving `procs` Library

This document outlines high and critical threats that directly involve the `procs` library.

*   **Threat:** Information Disclosure of Sensitive Process Data
    *   **Description:** An attacker might exploit vulnerabilities within the `procs` library or its interaction with the application to directly access sensitive information contained within process details. This could involve flaws in how `procs` retrieves or exposes data, allowing unauthorized access to command-line arguments, environment variables, usernames, and file paths of running processes.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data such as command-line arguments (potentially containing passwords or API keys), environment variables, usernames, and file paths. This can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and further system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `procs::Process` struct: Specifically the fields within this struct that hold sensitive information like `cmdline`, `environ`, `cwd`, where vulnerabilities in `procs` could expose this data without proper authorization.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update the `procs` library to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches that address potential information disclosure vulnerabilities within the library itself.
        *   If possible, contribute to or review the `procs` library's code to identify and address potential information disclosure issues.
        *   Be cautious about the permissions required by the application when using `procs`. Ensure it operates with the minimum necessary privileges to access process information.

*   **Threat:** Dependency Vulnerabilities within `procs` or its Dependencies
    *   **Description:** The `procs` library relies on other crates (dependencies). Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be directly exploited by an attacker if the `procs` library doesn't properly isolate or mitigate these risks. This could involve vulnerabilities that allow for remote code execution or other severe impacts originating from a dependency of `procs`.
    *   **Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency. It could range from denial of service to remote code execution on the system running the application, directly stemming from a flaw in a library that `procs` relies upon.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   Dependencies of the `procs` crate as defined in its `Cargo.toml` file. A vulnerability in a dependency directly impacts the security of `procs`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the specific vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update the `procs` library to the latest version, as updates often include updates to its dependencies, addressing known vulnerabilities.
        *   Utilize tools like `cargo audit` to identify known vulnerabilities in the dependencies of the `procs` library.
        *   Consider the security posture and reputation of the dependencies used by `procs` when evaluating its suitability for your application.
        *   If feasible, explore alternative libraries or methods if critical vulnerabilities are identified in `procs`' dependencies and are not promptly addressed.
