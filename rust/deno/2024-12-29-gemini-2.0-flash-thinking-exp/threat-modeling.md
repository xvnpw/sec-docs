Here's the updated threat list focusing on high and critical severity threats directly involving Deno:

*   **Threat:** Unrestricted File System Access
    *   **Description:** An attacker could exploit a vulnerability (e.g., path traversal) or a malicious dependency to read or write arbitrary files on the system *due to overly permissive use of Deno's file system access flags*. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, modification of application code or data, or even system compromise.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, code injection, application malfunction, system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Deno's permission model, specifically the `--allow-read` and `--allow-write` flags.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Grant file system access only to specific directories or files using `--allow-read=<path>` and `--allow-write=<path>`.
        *   Avoid using `--allow-read` or `--allow-write` without specifying allowed paths.
        *   Carefully validate and sanitize user-provided file paths *within the Deno application*.

*   **Threat:** Dependency Confusion Leading to Malicious Code Execution
    *   **Description:** An attacker could publish a malicious package with the same name as an internal or private module that the Deno application intends to use. If the application's module resolution logic *within Deno* is not carefully configured, it might inadvertently download and execute the attacker's malicious package.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the application's context, potentially leading to data theft, system compromise, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Deno's module resolution mechanism, specifically when relying on direct URL imports without strict verification.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Prefer using private registries or internal module repositories for internal dependencies.
        *   When using direct URL imports, carefully verify the source and integrity of the imported modules.
        *   Consider using subresource integrity (SRI) hashes for imported modules to ensure their integrity.

*   **Threat:** Compromised Dependency Source Injecting Malicious Code
    *   **Description:** If a Deno application imports a module directly from a URL, and the server hosting that module is compromised, an attacker could inject malicious code into the module. When the application loads this compromised module *through Deno's import mechanism*, the malicious code will be executed.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the application's context, potentially leading to data theft, system compromise, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Deno's module loading mechanism, specifically direct URL imports.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Pin specific versions of dependencies in import statements to avoid automatically pulling in compromised updates.
        *   Monitor the sources of your dependencies for any signs of compromise.
        *   Consider using subresource integrity (SRI) hashes for imported modules.

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Deno Standard Library Modules
    *   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities might exist within the modules provided by Deno's standard library (`std`). An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities if the application uses the affected modules.
    *   **Impact:** Depends on the nature of the vulnerability, could range from information disclosure to remote code execution.
    *   **Affected Component:** Modules within the `deno std` library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Stay updated with the latest Deno releases, which often include security patches for the standard library.
        *   Be aware of reported vulnerabilities in the Deno standard library and avoid using affected modules if necessary.

*   **Threat:** WebAssembly (Wasm) Sandbox Escape
    *   **Description:** While Deno provides a sandbox for executing WebAssembly modules, vulnerabilities in the Wasm runtime *within Deno* or the way Deno interacts with Wasm could potentially be exploited to escape the sandbox. This could allow malicious Wasm code to access resources or perform actions outside of its intended confinement.
    *   **Impact:** Code execution outside the Wasm sandbox, potentially leading to system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Deno's WebAssembly runtime.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Exercise caution when using untrusted WebAssembly modules.
        *   Stay updated with Deno releases, which include updates to the Wasm runtime.
