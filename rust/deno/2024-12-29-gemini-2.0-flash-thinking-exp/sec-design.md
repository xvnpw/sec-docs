    *   **Testing:**  Executes unit tests within the Deno environment (`deno test`).
    *   **Documentation Generation:** Creates API documentation from code comments (`deno doc`).
    *   **REPL:** Offers an interactive environment for evaluating Deno code (`deno`).
*   **Security Considerations:**
    *   **Command Injection:**  The CLI must be designed to prevent the injection of malicious commands through user-supplied input or arguments.
    *   **Path Traversal:**  Care must be taken to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities when handling file paths provided to CLI commands.
    *   **Configuration Security:**  If configuration files are used, they should be parsed securely to avoid manipulation.

### 4.2. V8 JavaScript Engine

*   **Functionality:**
    *   **Code Execution:** Parses, compiles (using just-in-time compilation), and executes JavaScript and TypeScript code.
    *   **Memory Management:**  Handles memory allocation and garbage collection for the JavaScript heap.
    *   **API Exposure:** Provides the underlying APIs that Deno uses to interact with the runtime environment.
    *   **Isolate Management:**  Deno utilizes V8 isolates to provide sandboxing and isolation between different contexts.
*   **Security Considerations:**
    *   **V8 Vulnerabilities:** Deno's security is heavily reliant on the security of the V8 engine. Staying up-to-date with V8 releases and security patches is critical.
    *   **Sandbox Escapes:**  Any vulnerabilities that allow escaping the V8 sandbox would have severe security implications for Deno.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:**  Malicious code could potentially exploit V8 to consume excessive resources, leading to denial-of-service.

    *   **Implementation Vulnerabilities:**  Bugs in the implementation of these APIs could introduce security flaws.
    *   **Web API Security Best Practices:**  Adhering to security best practices for web APIs is crucial to prevent common web vulnerabilities.

### 4.9. Native Plugins (FFI)

*   **Functionality:** Enables Deno code to call functions in dynamically linked libraries (`.dll`, `.so`, `.dylib`). This allows interaction with system-level functionalities or libraries written in other languages.
*   **Security Considerations:**
    *   **Increased Attack Surface:**  Native plugins bypass Deno's sandboxing and introduce significant security risks.
    *   **Memory Safety Issues:**  Interacting with native code can introduce memory safety vulnerabilities if not handled carefully.
    *   **Permission Requirements:**  The `--allow-plugin` permission is required to use native plugins, highlighting the inherent risk.

## 5. Data Flow

A typical Deno application execution flow involves the following steps, highlighting the movement and transformation of data:

1. **User Input:** The user provides input to the Deno CLI, typically a command like `deno run <script_url_or_path>`. This input includes the script to be executed and potentially permission flags.
2. **CLI Processing:** The Deno CLI parses the command and identifies the script to be executed.
3. **Module Resolution and Fetching:** The Module Loader resolves the dependencies of the script. If remote modules are involved, network requests are made to fetch the module code. The fetched code is typically text-based (JavaScript or TypeScript).
4. **Compilation (TypeScript):** If the script is TypeScript, the TypeScript Compiler parses and type-checks the code, transforming it into JavaScript. The output is JavaScript code.
5. **Permission Checks:** Before executing code that interacts with protected resources, the Permissions System checks if the necessary permissions have been granted based on the flags provided during CLI invocation.
6. **V8 Execution:** The V8 engine executes the JavaScript code. This involves interpreting and compiling the code into machine code.
7. **API Interactions:** The executed code interacts with the Deno runtime through built-in APIs or the standard library. These interactions often involve data exchange, such as reading files (returning file contents), making network requests (sending and receiving data), or accessing environment variables (returning string values).
8. **Native Plugin Calls (if applicable):** If the code uses native plugins, data is marshaled between the V8 environment and the native library. This can involve various data types depending on the plugin's API.
9. **Output:** The script produces output, which can be text, binary data, or other formats, directed to the console or other output streams.
