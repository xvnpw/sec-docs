## Mitigation Strategy: [Rigorous Smart Contract (Move Module) Auditing](./mitigation_strategies/rigorous_smart_contract__move_module__auditing.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Move-Specific Code Review:** Conduct in-depth code reviews of all Move modules (smart contracts) developed for your Diem application. Focus on vulnerabilities unique to Move's bytecode and the Diem Virtual Machine (DVM), such as resource management issues, Move prover limitations, and Diem framework-specific security considerations.
    2.  **Move Static Analysis:** Employ static analysis tools designed for Move and the Diem ecosystem. Configure these tools to detect vulnerability patterns specific to Move and the Diem platform, like incorrect resource handling or issues with Diem framework libraries. Integrate these tools into your Move development workflow.
    3.  **Diem Testnet Dynamic Testing:** Deploy and rigorously test your Move modules on the Diem Testnet environment. Utilize Diem-specific testing frameworks and tools to simulate real-world Diem network conditions and identify runtime vulnerabilities within the Diem context.
    4.  **Independent Diem/Move Security Audit:** Engage security experts specializing in Diem and Move smart contract security for independent audits. Ensure auditors have deep understanding of Diem's architecture, Move language, and common attack vectors within the Diem ecosystem.
    5.  **Continuous Move Module Auditing:** Implement a schedule for ongoing security audits of Move modules, especially after any updates or changes to your Diem application's smart contract logic.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Move Smart Contract Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Exploitable vulnerabilities within your Move modules that are specific to the Move language and Diem environment. This includes resource leaks, incorrect access control in Move, and vulnerabilities arising from interactions with Diem framework modules. Exploitation can lead to loss of Diem assets, application disruption, or unauthorized actions within the Diem network context.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Key Management for Diem Accounts (HSMs/Secure Enclaves for Diem Keys)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_key_management_for_diem_accounts__hsmssecure_enclaves_for_diem_keys_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Diem Key Identification:** Identify all private keys used for interacting with the Diem blockchain, including keys for Diem accounts used by your application (e.g., operator accounts, treasury accounts, user wallets if directly managed).
    2.  **HSM/Secure Enclave Integration for Diem:** Integrate Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) or secure enclave technologies specifically for managing and protecting Diem private keys. Ensure compatibility with Diem's key formats and signing algorithms.
    3.  **Diem Key Generation in Secure Hardware:** Generate Diem private keys directly within HSMs or secure enclaves. Ensure keys are never exposed outside these secure environments during generation or usage for Diem transactions.
    4.  **Secure Diem Key Storage:** Store Diem private keys exclusively within HSMs or secure enclaves. Leverage the tamper-resistant and access-controlled storage provided by these technologies to protect Diem keys.
    5.  **Diem Key Access Control:** Implement strict access control policies for HSMs/secure enclaves holding Diem keys. Limit access to authorized application components and personnel involved in Diem operations.
    6.  **Diem Key Backup and Recovery (Secure):** Establish secure backup and recovery procedures for Diem keys stored in HSMs/secure enclaves, adhering to best practices for HSM/enclave key management and ensuring backups are also protected.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Diem Private Key Compromise (Critical Severity):** Theft or unauthorized access to Diem private keys, leading to complete control over associated Diem accounts. This can result in unauthorized transfer of Diem assets, impersonation within the Diem network, and disruption of Diem-related application functionalities.
    *   **Diem Account Takeover (Critical Severity):** If Diem private keys are compromised, attackers can take over Diem accounts controlled by your application, potentially leading to significant financial losses and operational disruptions within the Diem ecosystem.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Diem Private Key Compromise (High Reduction):** HSMs and secure enclaves provide robust protection for Diem private keys, making compromise extremely difficult even if application infrastructure is breached.
    *   **Diem Account Takeover (High Reduction):** Secure Diem key management significantly reduces the risk of Diem account takeovers by protecting the cryptographic keys that control these accounts.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   *Project Specific - To be determined.* (Example: Operator keys for Diem node interaction are stored in HSMs. User wallet keys are software-encrypted.)

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   *Project Specific - To be determined.* (Example: HSMs/secure enclaves are not used for all Diem account keys, such as treasury keys or user wallet keys. Secure backup and recovery for Diem keys in HSMs/enclaves needs to be fully implemented.)

## Mitigation Strategy: [Multi-Signature Schemes for Critical Diem Transactions](./mitigation_strategies/multi-signature_schemes_for_critical_diem_transactions.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Critical Diem Operations:** Determine Diem transactions that require heightened security due to their impact (e.g., large Diem asset transfers, changes to critical Move module parameters, Diem account administration).
    2.  **Define Diem Multi-Sig Policy:** Establish a multi-signature policy specifically for critical Diem transactions. Define the required number of signers and authorized parties for each type of critical Diem operation within your application's Diem context.
    3.  **Implement Diem Multi-Sig Wallets/Accounts:** Utilize Diem's multi-signature account capabilities or implement custom multi-sig logic within your Move modules to enforce multi-signature requirements for critical Diem transactions.
    4.  **Diem Key Distribution for Multi-Sig:** Distribute Diem private keys for multi-sig accounts to distinct, trusted individuals or application components. Ensure secure management of these distributed Diem keys.
    5.  **Diem Transaction Approval Workflow (Multi-Sig):** Implement a transaction approval workflow that mandates multiple authorized signers to approve critical Diem transactions before they are broadcast to the Diem network. This workflow should be specific to Diem transaction signing and submission.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Critical Diem Transactions (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized execution of critical transactions on the Diem blockchain by requiring multiple signatures. This mitigates risks from compromised single accounts or malicious insiders attempting to manipulate Diem assets or application state on Diem.
    *   **Single Point of Failure in Diem Transaction Authorization (High Severity):** Eliminates single points of failure in authorizing critical Diem transactions. Compromise of a single Diem private key is insufficient to initiate these transactions.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Critical Diem Transactions (High Reduction):** Multi-signature significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized critical Diem transactions by requiring consensus from multiple authorized parties.
    *   **Single Point of Failure in Diem Transaction Authorization (High Reduction):**  Completely eliminates single points of failure for authorizing critical actions on the Diem network.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   *Project Specific - To be determined.* (Example: Treasury account for Diem assets uses a multi-signature Diem wallet.)

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   *Project Specific - To be determined.* (Example: Multi-signature is not enforced for all critical Diem operations, such as Move module upgrades or changes to application parameters stored on Diem. The multi-sig policy for Diem transactions needs to be formally defined and consistently applied.)

    2.  **Diem-Specific Pre-flight Checks:** Implement pre-flight checks in your application code that are tailored to Diem transaction requirements. Validate Diem account balances, Move module permissions, Diem transaction gas limits, and other Diem-specific parameters before constructing and signing Diem transactions.
    3.  **User Feedback on Diem Transaction Simulation:** Provide users with clear feedback in the application's user interface based on the results of Diem transaction simulations. Show the predicted outcome of the Diem transaction before they confirm and sign it.
    4.  **Automated Diem Transaction Testing with Simulation:** Incorporate Diem transaction simulation into your automated testing processes. Ensure that tests simulate various Diem network states and transaction scenarios to validate the behavior of your application's Diem interactions.
    5.  **Diem Error Handling based on Simulation:** Design error handling logic that specifically addresses potential issues identified during Diem transaction simulation. Prevent transactions from being submitted to the Diem network if simulations indicate errors or unexpected outcomes within the Diem context.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Accidental Diem Transaction Errors (Medium Severity):** Prevents accidental submission of incorrect Diem transactions due to wrong parameters, insufficient Diem funds, or incorrect permissions within the Diem network.
    *   **Unexpected Diem Transaction Outcomes (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of unexpected results from Diem transactions by allowing preview and validation of transaction effects before execution on the Diem blockchain.
    *   **Wasted Diem Gas Fees (Low Severity):** Helps avoid unnecessary Diem gas costs by identifying potentially failing transactions before they are submitted to the Diem network and consume gas.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Accidental Diem Transaction Errors (Medium Reduction):** Significantly reduces the occurrence of accidental errors in Diem transactions, preventing unintended actions on the Diem blockchain.
    *   **Unexpected Diem Transaction Outcomes (Medium Reduction):** Increases predictability and reduces surprises related to Diem transactions, improving user experience and application reliability within the Diem ecosystem.
    *   **Wasted Diem Gas Fees (Low Reduction):**  Helps optimize Diem gas usage by preventing submission of transactions likely to fail, although gas estimation itself can have variations.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   *Project Specific - To be determined.* (Example: Diem transaction simulation is used in developer test environments using the Diem SDK.)

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   *Project Specific - To be determined.* (Example: Diem transaction simulation is not integrated into the user-facing application for pre-transaction previews. Diem-specific pre-flight checks are not comprehensively implemented for all Diem transaction types.)
