# Threat Model Analysis for diem/diem

## Threat: [Smart Contract Reentrancy Vulnerability](./threats/smart_contract_reentrancy_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a Move smart contract where a function can be called recursively before the previous invocation completes, potentially leading to unexpected state changes or fund drain. The attacker might call a vulnerable function in a loop, withdrawing funds multiple times before the contract's balance is updated correctly.
*   **Impact:** Loss of funds held in the vulnerable smart contract, potentially significant financial loss depending on the contract's value.
*   **Affected Diem Component:** Move Smart Contract (specific Move module and function with the vulnerability).
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement checks-effects-interactions pattern in smart contract design to minimize reentrancy risks.
    *   Use resource-oriented programming principles in Move to control resource access and prevent unexpected state changes.
    *   Conduct thorough security audits and penetration testing of smart contracts before deployment.
    *   Utilize static analysis tools to detect potential reentrancy vulnerabilities in Move code.

## Threat: [Private Key Theft via Phishing](./threats/private_key_theft_via_phishing.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uses phishing techniques (e.g., fake websites, emails) to trick users into revealing their Diem private keys. The attacker might impersonate legitimate services or applications to lure users into entering their private keys on malicious websites or applications.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Diem account associated with the stolen private key, loss of funds held in the account, unauthorized transactions.
*   **Affected Diem Component:** Diem Account, User Key Management.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Educate users about phishing attacks and best practices for protecting their private keys.
    *   Implement strong password policies and multi-factor authentication for user accounts managing Diem keys.
    *   Use secure key storage mechanisms (e.g., hardware wallets, secure enclaves) to minimize the risk of key theft.
    *   Warn users against entering private keys on untrusted websites or applications.

## Threat: [Private Key Exposure due to Software Vulnerability](./threats/private_key_exposure_due_to_software_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability in software used to manage or store Diem private keys (e.g., wallet software, application code) is exploited by an attacker to gain access to the keys. This could be due to buffer overflows, injection vulnerabilities, or other software security flaws.
*   **Impact:** Compromise of private keys, loss of funds, unauthorized transactions, potential for wider system compromise if the vulnerable software is part of a larger system.
*   **Affected Diem Component:** Diem Account, Key Management Software/Application.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use reputable and well-audited wallet software and key management libraries.
    *   Keep software and dependencies up to date with the latest security patches.
    *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of key management software and applications.
    *   Implement secure coding practices to minimize software vulnerabilities.
