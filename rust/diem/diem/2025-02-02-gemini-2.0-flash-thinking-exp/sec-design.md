# BUSINESS POSTURE

The Diem project aims to create a permissioned blockchain-based payment system to enable efficient and low-cost global payments. The primary business goal is to provide a more accessible and efficient financial infrastructure, particularly for cross-border transactions and underserved populations.

Business priorities include:

*   Regulatory compliance: Adhering to financial regulations across different jurisdictions is critical for Diem's operation and acceptance.
*   Security and trust: Maintaining the security and integrity of the Diem network and user funds is paramount to build trust and ensure adoption.
*   Scalability and performance: The system needs to handle a large volume of transactions efficiently and reliably.
*   Interoperability:  Diem should be able to integrate with existing financial systems and services.
*   Adoption and ecosystem growth:  Encouraging the development of applications and services on top of Diem to expand its utility.

Most important business risks:

*   Regulatory rejection:  Failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals in key jurisdictions could prevent Diem from launching or operating effectively.
*   Security breaches:  Successful cyberattacks or vulnerabilities in the Diem network could lead to loss of funds, reputational damage, and loss of trust.
*   Scalability issues:  Inability to handle transaction volume growth could lead to performance degradation and user dissatisfaction.
*   Lack of adoption:  Insufficient user and developer adoption could result in Diem failing to achieve its goals and becoming irrelevant.
*   Competition:  Existing payment systems and emerging cryptocurrencies pose competitive threats to Diem's market position.

    *   Requirement:  Users accessing Diem services (e.g., wallets, APIs) must be authenticated.
    *   Requirement:  Authentication mechanisms should support multi-factor authentication where appropriate.
*   Authorization:
    *   Requirement:  Access to sensitive data and operations within the Diem network must be strictly controlled based on roles and permissions.
    *   Requirement:  Authorization policies should be clearly defined and enforced consistently.
    *   Requirement:  Principle of least privilege should be applied to all access controls.
*   Input validation:
    *   Requirement:  All inputs to the Diem network and its components must be thoroughly validated to prevent injection attacks and other input-related vulnerabilities.
    *   Requirement:  Input validation should be performed at multiple layers of the system.
    *   Requirement:  Use of secure coding practices to handle input validation.
*   Cryptography:
    *   Requirement:  Strong cryptographic algorithms and protocols must be used to protect sensitive data in transit and at rest.
    *   Requirement:  Cryptographic keys must be securely generated, stored, and managed throughout their lifecycle.
    *   Requirement:  Regularly review and update cryptographic algorithms and protocols to maintain security against evolving threats.

Build Process Description:

1.  Developer writes code changes on their workstation and commits them to the source code repository (e.g., GitHub).
2.  Pushing code changes to the repository triggers a webhook, initiating the CI/CD pipeline.
3.  The Build Server (e.g., GitHub Actions runner) checks out the latest code from the repository.
4.  The Build Server compiles the code, runs unit tests, and performs other build steps.
5.  SAST Scanner performs static application security testing to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code.
6.  If SAST scan passes and build is successful, the Build Server builds container images for the Diem components and pushes them to the Container Registry.
7.  Build artifacts (e.g., binaries, configuration files) are published to the Artifact Repository.
8.  Deployment Automation tool (e.g., Kubernetes deployment scripts) is triggered to deploy the new version of the application to the Target Environment (e.g., Kubernetes cluster).

Build Process Security Controls:

*   security control: Secure Code Repository: Access control to the code repository, branch protection, and audit logging.
*   security control: Authenticated CI/CD Pipeline: Secure authentication and authorization for accessing and executing the CI/CD pipeline.
*   security control: Secure Build Environment: Hardened build servers, isolated build environments, and regular security patching.
*   security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Automated SAST scanning integrated into the pipeline to detect code vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Container Image Scanning: Security scanning of container images in the Container Registry for vulnerabilities before deployment.
*   security control: Artifact Signing: Signing build artifacts to ensure integrity and authenticity.
*   security control: Access Control to Artifact Repositories: Role-based access control to container and artifact registries.
*   security control: Immutable Infrastructure: Deploying immutable container images to prevent runtime modifications.
*   security control: Deployment Authorization: Secure authorization mechanisms for deployment automation to prevent unauthorized deployments.
*   security control: Audit Logging: Comprehensive audit logging of all build and deployment activities.
*   security control: Dependency Scanning: Scanning dependencies for known vulnerabilities.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes to protect:

*   Transaction processing: Ensuring the reliable and secure processing of Diem transactions is fundamental to the system's operation.
*   Ledger integrity: Maintaining the integrity and immutability of the Diem ledger is crucial for trust and accountability.
*   Consensus mechanism: Protecting the consensus mechanism from attacks and manipulation is essential for network security and stability.
*   Smart contract execution: Secure execution of smart contracts is necessary to prevent vulnerabilities and ensure predictable behavior.
*   Key management: Protecting cryptographic keys used for transaction signing and network security is paramount.

Data to protect and sensitivity:

*   Transaction data: Contains information about senders, receivers, amounts, and timestamps. Sensitivity: High (PII, financial data). Requires confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
*   Account balances: Represents user holdings of Diem. Sensitivity: High (financial data). Requires confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
*   Smart contract code: Contains business logic and potentially sensitive algorithms. Sensitivity: Medium (intellectual property, business logic). Requires confidentiality and integrity.
*   Validator private keys: Used for signing blocks and participating in consensus. Sensitivity: Critical (network security). Requires extreme confidentiality and integrity.
*   User private keys: Used for authorizing transactions. Sensitivity: Critical (user funds). Requires extreme confidentiality and integrity.
*   Audit logs: Records of system events and activities. Sensitivity: Medium (security monitoring, compliance). Requires integrity and availability.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

*   What specific regulatory frameworks is Diem targeting for compliance?
*   What is the planned throughput and latency for Diem transactions?
*   What specific consensus algorithm is being used (e.g., HotStuff variant)?
*   What type of database is used for Ledger Storage?
*   What are the key management practices for validator and user keys?
*   What specific SAST and DAST tools are planned to be used in the CI/CD pipeline?
*   What is the disaster recovery plan for the Diem network?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: Diem aims to be a globally compliant and secure payment system. Security and regulatory compliance are top priorities.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: Diem is being developed with security in mind, employing standard security practices for blockchain and software development.  A permissioned blockchain model is a key security control.
*   DESIGN: Diem adopts a microservices architecture deployed on a cloud-based Kubernetes platform for scalability and resilience. Standard security controls for cloud environments and containerized applications are assumed to be in place.  A CI/CD pipeline with security checks is used for software delivery.
