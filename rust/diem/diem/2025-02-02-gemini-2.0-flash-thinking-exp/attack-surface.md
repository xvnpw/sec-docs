# Attack Surface Analysis for diem/diem

## Attack Surface: [Smart Contract Logic Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/smart_contract_logic_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Flaws in the Move smart contract code that can be exploited to cause unintended behavior.
*   **Diem Contribution:** Diem's smart contract platform relies on MoveVM and custom smart contracts for application logic and asset management. Vulnerabilities in these contracts directly impact applications built on Diem.
*   **Example:** A DeFi application on Diem has a smart contract with a reentrancy vulnerability. An attacker exploits this to repeatedly withdraw funds, draining the contract's balance.
*   **Impact:** Financial loss (theft of Diem coins or other assets), application malfunction, reputational damage.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure Coding Practices: Follow secure coding guidelines for Move development, including input validation, access control, and reentrancy protection.
    *   Rigorous Testing: Implement comprehensive unit, integration, and fuzz testing of smart contracts.
    *   Formal Verification: Utilize Move Prover and other formal verification tools to mathematically prove contract correctness.
    *   Security Audits: Engage independent security auditors to review smart contract code before deployment.
    *   Bug Bounty Programs: Implement bug bounty programs to incentivize ethical hackers to find and report vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Smart Contract Deployment/Upgrade](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_smart_contract_deploymentupgrade.md)

*   **Description:**  Deployment or upgrading of malicious smart contracts due to inadequate access control or vulnerabilities in the deployment/upgrade process.
*   **Diem Contribution:** Diem's permissioned nature means control over contract deployment and upgrades is crucial. If this control is compromised, malicious actors can inject harmful code.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the account responsible for deploying smart contracts for a Diem-based application. They deploy a malicious contract that steals user funds or disrupts application services.
*   **Impact:** Complete application compromise, data breaches, financial loss, reputational damage, DoS.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strong Access Control: Implement robust access control mechanisms for contract deployment and upgrade functionalities. Use multi-signature accounts and role-based access control.
    *   Secure Key Management: Securely manage private keys associated with deployment accounts. Use hardware wallets or secure key management systems.
    *   Deployment Process Security:  Establish a secure and auditable deployment process with multiple approval stages and code reviews.
    *   Monitoring and Alerting: Monitor contract deployments and upgrades for suspicious activity and implement alerting mechanisms.

## Attack Surface: [Validator Compromise (BFT Attacks)](./attack_surfaces/validator_compromise__bft_attacks_.md)

*   **Description:**  Compromise of a sufficient number of Diem validators to manipulate the consensus process and ledger state.
*   **Diem Contribution:** Diem relies on a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus mechanism (HotStuff) secured by a set of validators. Compromising validators directly undermines the security of the entire Diem network and applications built upon it.
*   **Example:** Attackers compromise a significant portion of Diem validators (beyond the BFT threshold) through various means (e.g., social engineering, software vulnerabilities). They then collude to double-spend Diem coins or censor legitimate transactions.
*   **Impact:**  Loss of trust in Diem, financial instability, double-spending, transaction censorship, potential network fork.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Validator Security Hardening: Validators must implement robust security measures, including intrusion detection, regular security audits, and secure infrastructure.
    *   Geographic and Organizational Diversity of Validators:  Ensure validators are geographically distributed and from diverse organizations to reduce the risk of coordinated attacks.
    *   Strong Validator Selection Process: Implement a rigorous and transparent process for selecting and vetting validators.
    *   Continuous Monitoring of Validator Health: Monitor validator performance and security posture to detect and respond to compromises quickly.
    *   Regular Security Audits of Validator Infrastructure: Conduct independent security audits of validator infrastructure and operations.

## Attack Surface: [API Authentication and Authorization Flaws](./attack_surfaces/api_authentication_and_authorization_flaws.md)

*   **Description:** Weak or missing authentication and authorization mechanisms in Diem APIs, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionalities.
*   **Diem Contribution:** Applications interact with Diem through APIs (client libraries, REST APIs). Vulnerabilities in these APIs directly expose application data and functionalities to unauthorized access.
*   **Example:** A Diem exchange application uses an API with weak authentication. An attacker exploits this to bypass authentication and access user account information, including private keys or transaction history.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to user accounts, financial theft, privacy violations.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strong Authentication Mechanisms: Implement robust authentication methods like OAuth 2.0, API keys with proper rotation, or mutual TLS.
    *   Granular Authorization: Implement fine-grained authorization controls to restrict access based on user roles and permissions (RBAC).
    *   Input Validation and Sanitization:  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all API inputs to prevent injection attacks.
    *   Rate Limiting and DoS Protection: Implement rate limiting and other DoS prevention measures to protect APIs from abuse.
    *   Regular API Security Audits: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of Diem APIs.

## Attack Surface: [Client Library Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/client_library_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Bugs or vulnerabilities in Diem client libraries (SDKs) that can be exploited to compromise applications using them.
*   **Diem Contribution:** Developers rely on Diem client libraries to interact with the Diem network. Vulnerabilities in these libraries can be inherited by applications, creating a widespread attack surface.
*   **Example:** A Diem client library has a vulnerability that allows for arbitrary code execution when processing malicious transaction data. An attacker crafts a malicious transaction that, when processed by an application using the vulnerable library, compromises the application server.
*   **Impact:** Application compromise, data breaches, denial of service, potential for widespread exploitation across applications using the vulnerable library.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use Official and Up-to-Date Libraries:  Always use official Diem client libraries from trusted sources and keep them updated to the latest versions.
    *   Dependency Scanning: Regularly scan client library dependencies for known vulnerabilities and update them promptly.
    *   Input Validation in Applications:  Even with secure libraries, applications should still perform input validation on data received from the Diem network to mitigate potential library vulnerabilities.
    *   Security Audits of Client Libraries:  Encourage and support security audits of Diem client libraries by the Diem project and community.
    *   Isolate Client Library Execution:  Consider isolating client library execution in sandboxed environments to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Diem Core and Libraries](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_diem_core_and_libraries.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by Diem core components or client libraries.
*   **Diem Contribution:** Diem, like most software projects, relies on external libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can indirectly affect Diem's security and applications built on it.
*   **Example:** A critical vulnerability is discovered in a widely used cryptographic library that Diem depends on. This vulnerability could potentially be exploited to compromise Diem's cryptographic operations or related applications.
*   **Impact:**  Wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, from DoS to data breaches and system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Dependency Scanning and Management: Implement automated dependency scanning tools to identify vulnerabilities in Diem's dependencies.
    *   Regular Dependency Updates:  Keep Diem's dependencies updated to the latest versions, including security patches.
    *   Vulnerability Monitoring:  Actively monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for Diem's dependencies.
