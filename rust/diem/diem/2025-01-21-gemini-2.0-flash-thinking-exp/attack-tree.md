## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using Diem [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_diem__critical_node_.md)

*   The ultimate goal of the attacker. Success means the application's security and integrity are breached.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Vulnerabilities in Diem Client Library [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_diem_client_library__critical_node_.md)

*   Attack Vectors:
    *   **Identify Vulnerable Dependency in Diem Client Library AND Leverage Vulnerability to Execute Malicious Code in Application Context [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   Attacker identifies a known security flaw in a third-party library used by the Diem client.
        *   They craft an exploit that leverages this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code within the application's process, potentially gaining full control.
    *   **Inject Malicious Code into Updated Library [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   Attacker intercepts the process of updating the Diem client library (e.g., through a man-in-the-middle attack on the update server).
        *   They replace the legitimate library with a malicious version containing backdoors or exploits.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Abuse Application's Use of Diem Client Library [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__abuse_application's_use_of_diem_client_library__critical_node_.md)

*   Attack Vectors:
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Insecure Storage of Private Keys [CRITICAL NODE] leading to Access Stored Private Keys to Impersonate User or Execute Transactions [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   The application stores Diem private keys in an insecure manner (e.g., plain text, weak encryption, easily accessible location).
        *   An attacker gains access to these stored keys, allowing them to impersonate users, transfer funds, or execute other unauthorized actions on the Diem blockchain.
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Improper Handling of Diem Account Credentials leading to Steal or Misuse Credentials to Access Diem Accounts [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   The application mishandles Diem account credentials (e.g., mnemonic phrases, seed phrases), making them vulnerable to theft or unauthorized access.
        *   Attackers can steal these credentials to gain control over associated Diem accounts.
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Vulnerable Transaction Construction leading to Craft Malicious Transactions Exploiting Logic Flaws in Application's Transaction Building [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   The application's logic for creating Diem transactions has flaws (e.g., insufficient input validation, incorrect parameter handling).
        *   Attackers can craft malicious transactions that exploit these flaws to perform unintended actions, such as sending funds to the wrong address or manipulating data.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Transaction Manipulation/Replay Attacks leading to Replay Valid Transactions to Duplicate Actions or Steal Funds [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__transaction_manipulationreplay_attacks_leading_to_replay_valid_transactions_to_dupl_05326d74.md)

*   Attack Vectors:
    *   Attackers intercept valid, signed Diem transactions.
    *   They then rebroadcast these transactions to the Diem network, causing the actions to be executed multiple times (e.g., transferring funds repeatedly).

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Diem Smart Contract Vulnerabilities (If Application Uses Custom Contracts) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_diem_smart_contract_vulnerabilities__if_application_uses_custom_contracts___63f7d5cb.md)

*   Attack Vectors:
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Logic Errors in Smart Contract Code [CRITICAL NODE] leading to Exploit Flaws in Contract Logic to Manipulate State or Steal Assets [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   The custom smart contracts deployed by the application contain logical flaws in their code.
        *   Attackers identify and exploit these flaws to manipulate the contract's state, transfer ownership, steal assets, or disrupt its intended functionality.
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Reentrancy Attacks [CRITICAL NODE] leading to Exploit Reentrancy Vulnerabilities to Drain Contract Funds [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   The custom smart contracts have reentrancy vulnerabilities, where a function can call itself recursively before the initial call completes.
        *   Attackers exploit this to repeatedly withdraw funds or manipulate the contract's state in an unintended way, often leading to the draining of the contract's balance.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Diem Nodes Used by Application [CRITICAL NODE] leading to Gain Control of Nodes to Manipulate Data or Transactions [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_diem_nodes_used_by_application__critical_node__leading_to_gain_control_of_nodes_to_manipu_ad835f49.md)

*   Attack Vectors:
    *   Attackers compromise the Diem nodes that the application directly connects to (e.g., through exploiting vulnerabilities in the node software or the underlying infrastructure).
    *   Once compromised, attackers can manipulate the data the application receives from the blockchain, censor transactions, or even forge transactions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Man-in-the-Middle Attack on Communication with Diem Nodes [CRITICAL NODE] leading to Intercept and Modify Communication to Alter Transactions or Data [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/man-in-the-middle_attack_on_communication_with_diem_nodes__critical_node__leading_to_intercept_and_m_400d593a.md)

*   Attack Vectors:
    *   Attackers intercept the communication between the application and the Diem nodes it interacts with.
    *   They can then modify the data being exchanged, such as altering transaction details (recipient address, amount) before they are submitted to the network or manipulating the data the application receives from the network.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Entities with Administrative Privileges [CRITICAL NODE] leading to Gain Control Over Diem Network Operations Affecting the Application [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_entities_with_administrative_privileges__critical_node__leading_to_gain_control_over_diem_c19c8f33.md)

*   Attack Vectors:
    *   In a permissioned Diem network, certain entities have administrative privileges.
    *   Attackers compromise the systems or accounts of these privileged entities.
    *   This allows them to perform administrative actions on the Diem network that could negatively impact the application, such as freezing accounts, altering permissions, or disrupting network operations.
