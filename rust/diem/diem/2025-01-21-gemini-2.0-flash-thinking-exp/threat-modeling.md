# Threat Model Analysis for diem/diem

## Threat: [Smart Contract Reentrancy](./threats/smart_contract_reentrancy.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a Move smart contract where a function can recursively call itself before the initial call completes. This allows the attacker to repeatedly execute actions, such as withdrawing funds, beyond the intended limits.

**Impact:** Financial loss due to unauthorized withdrawals or manipulation of contract state, potentially leading to significant economic damage for the application and its users.

**Affected Diem Component:** Move VM (specifically the execution environment for smart contracts).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement the "checks-effects-interactions" pattern in smart contract development.
* Use reentrancy guards (if available in Move or through custom logic) to prevent recursive calls.
* Conduct thorough security audits of Move code.

## Threat: [Integer Overflow/Underflow in Smart Contracts](./threats/integer_overflowunderflow_in_smart_contracts.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts inputs to a Move smart contract that cause integer variables to overflow (exceed their maximum value) or underflow (go below their minimum value). This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as incorrect calculations for token transfers or access control bypasses.

**Impact:** Financial loss due to incorrect value handling, unauthorized access to functionalities, potential for denial of service if calculations are critical for operation.

**Affected Diem Component:** Move VM (specifically the arithmetic operations within smart contracts).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use safe math libraries or built-in functions that prevent overflows/underflows (if available in Move).
* Implement input validation to ensure values are within expected ranges.
* Thoroughly test smart contracts with boundary conditions.

## Threat: [Transaction Replay Attack](./threats/transaction_replay_attack.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts a valid, signed Diem transaction and resubmits it to the network. If the transaction's effect is repeatable and not protected against replay, the attacker can duplicate the action (e.g., transferring funds multiple times).

**Impact:** Financial loss due to duplicated actions, manipulation of application state if transactions trigger state changes.

**Affected Diem Component:** Transaction Processing Logic, State Management.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Incorporate unique nonces (numbers that can only be used once) into transactions.
* Include timestamps in transactions and enforce a validity window.
* Design application logic to be idempotent where possible (performing the same action multiple times has the same effect as performing it once).

## Threat: [Private Key Compromise (Application's Diem Key)](./threats/private_key_compromise__application's_diem_key_.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to the private key used by the application to sign Diem transactions. This allows the attacker to impersonate the application and perform any action the application is authorized to do, such as transferring funds or interacting with smart contracts.

**Impact:** Significant financial loss, complete compromise of the application's Diem interactions, potential for data manipulation on the blockchain.

**Affected Diem Component:** Diem Account associated with the compromised key, Transaction Signing mechanism.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Store private keys securely using Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) or secure enclaves.
* Implement multi-signature schemes where multiple keys are required to authorize transactions.
* Rotate private keys regularly.
* Enforce strict access control for systems holding private keys.

## Threat: [Account Takeover of User Diem Accounts (If Application Manages Keys)](./threats/account_takeover_of_user_diem_accounts__if_application_manages_keys_.md)

**Description:** If the application is responsible for managing user Diem private keys (which is generally discouraged), vulnerabilities in the application's key management system could allow attackers to gain control of user accounts and their associated funds.

**Impact:** Significant financial loss for users, reputational damage for the application, potential legal liabilities.

**Affected Diem Component:** User Diem Accounts, Application's Key Management System.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Strongly discourage** managing user private keys directly.
* If absolutely necessary, implement extremely robust security measures for key generation, storage, and retrieval (e.g., using secure enclaves, multi-party computation).
* Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for user accounts.
* Provide users with options for self-custody of their keys.
