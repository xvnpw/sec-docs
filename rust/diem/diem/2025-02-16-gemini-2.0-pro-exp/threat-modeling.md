# Threat Model Analysis for diem/diem

## Threat: [Threat 1: Consensus Manipulation via BFT Weakness](./threats/threat_1_consensus_manipulation_via_bft_weakness.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a previously unknown vulnerability in the DiemBFT consensus algorithm (e.g., a flaw in the leader election or signature aggregation process). The attacker might collude with a subset of validators or exploit a bug to influence the ordering of transactions, potentially causing a double-spend or censoring specific transactions.
    *   **Impact:** Loss of funds for users (double-spending), denial of service for specific users or applications (censorship), loss of confidence in the Diem network.
    *   **Affected Diem Component:** `DiemBFT` consensus mechanism (specifically, components related to leader election, block proposal, and signature verification within the `consensus` module).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Developers: Stay informed about security audits and updates to DiemBFT (hypothetically, as the project is defunct). Contribute to formal verification efforts.
        *   Users/Node Operators: Monitor the network for unusual validator behavior (e.g., frequent leader changes, inconsistent block proposals). Use multiple independent full nodes for transaction verification. *Note: Mitigation is severely limited due to the project's defunct status.*

## Threat: [Threat 2: Move VM Exploit - Integer Overflow](./threats/threat_2_move_vm_exploit_-_integer_overflow.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious Move module that triggers an integer overflow or underflow vulnerability within the Move VM.  For example, they might manipulate arithmetic operations on `u64` or `u128` types in a way that bypasses built-in checks, leading to unexpected state changes.
    *   **Impact:**  The attacker could potentially steal funds, create unauthorized tokens, or corrupt the state of a deployed Move module.
    *   **Affected Diem Component:** Move Virtual Machine (`move-vm` crate), specifically the bytecode interpreter and arithmetic operation handlers.  Also, any deployed Move module that interacts with the vulnerable code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Developers: Use safe arithmetic libraries within Move modules. Thoroughly test for edge cases and boundary conditions. Employ static analysis tools to detect potential integer overflow/underflow vulnerabilities.  Stay updated on Move VM security patches (hypothetically, as the project is defunct). *Note: Mitigation is severely limited due to the project's defunct status.*
        *   Users: Only interact with well-audited and trusted Move modules (extremely difficult to verify given the project's status).

## Threat: [Threat 3: Move VM Exploit - Reentrancy (Despite Protections)](./threats/threat_3_move_vm_exploit_-_reentrancy__despite_protections_.md)

*   **Description:**  Despite Move's design to prevent reentrancy, an attacker discovers a subtle interaction between multiple Move modules, or a bug in the VM's call stack management, that allows them to re-enter a function before its previous execution has completed. This could allow them to manipulate state in an unintended way.
    *   **Impact:**  The attacker could drain funds from a contract, bypass access controls, or corrupt data.
    *   **Affected Diem Component:** Move Virtual Machine (`move-vm` crate), specifically the call stack and execution context management.  Also, any deployed Move modules involved in the reentrant call chain.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Developers:  Follow secure coding practices for Move, paying close attention to function call sequences and state updates. Use static analysis tools specifically designed to detect reentrancy vulnerabilities, even in Move. *Note: Mitigation is severely limited due to the project's defunct status.*
        *   Users:  Only interact with well-audited and trusted Move modules (extremely difficult to verify given the project's status).

## Threat: [Threat 7:  JSON-RPC API - Unauthorized Access](./threats/threat_7__json-rpc_api_-_unauthorized_access.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to a Diem node's JSON-RPC interface due to a misconfiguration (e.g., exposed without authentication or with default credentials). The attacker can then issue commands to the node, potentially querying sensitive information or even submitting transactions *if they can craft valid transactions*. This directly impacts the Diem node.
    *   **Impact:**  Information disclosure (e.g., account balances, transaction history).  Unauthorized transaction submission (though limited by the need for valid signatures).  Potential control over the node.
    *   **Affected Diem Component:**  The Diem node's JSON-RPC server implementation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Node Operators:  Secure the JSON-RPC interface with strong authentication (e.g., API keys, mutual TLS).  Restrict access to the interface to authorized IP addresses.  Disable the JSON-RPC interface if it's not needed.  Regularly audit access logs.

## Threat: [Threat 8: Dependency Vulnerability in Diem *Core* Components](./threats/threat_8_dependency_vulnerability_in_diem_core_components.md)

* **Description:** A vulnerability is discovered in a third-party library used *directly by core Diem components* (e.g., a cryptographic library used within the consensus mechanism, a networking library used for peer-to-peer communication). This is distinct from a client library vulnerability. An attacker exploits this to compromise the Diem node itself.
    * **Impact:** Compromise of the Diem node, potentially leading to consensus manipulation, data corruption, or denial of service *at the blockchain level*.
    * **Affected Diem Component:** The specific core Diem component (e.g., `consensus`, `network`, `storage`) and the vulnerable third-party dependency.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Developers: Regularly update all dependencies to their latest secure versions. Use dependency management tools to track and audit dependencies. Consider using software composition analysis (SCA) tools to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies. *Note: Mitigation is severely limited due to the project's defunct status.*
