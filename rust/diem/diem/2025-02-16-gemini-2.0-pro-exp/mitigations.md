# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for diem/diem

## Mitigation Strategy: [Formal Verification of Move Modules](./mitigation_strategies/formal_verification_of_move_modules.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Formal Verification

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Critical Modules:** Determine which Move modules handle the most sensitive operations (e.g., token transfers, access control, state updates) *within the Diem blockchain*.
    2.  **Define Invariants:** For each critical module, formally define the key properties (invariants) that *must always* hold true *within the context of Diem's resource model and transaction execution*. Examples:
        *   "The total supply of a Diem token cannot increase or decrease except through the designated minting/burning functions, as defined by the Diem framework."
        *   "Only authorized users, as determined by Diem's account authentication, can perform specific actions on resources."
        *   "Account balances, represented as Diem resources, cannot become negative."
    3.  **Write Specifications:** Translate these invariants into formal specifications using the Move Prover's specification language.  This involves writing pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants directly within the Move code, specifically leveraging Move's features for resource safety and access control.
    4.  **Run the Move Prover:** Execute the Move Prover (`move prove`) on your Diem-specific codebase. The prover will attempt to mathematically prove that your Move code, *as it will execute on the Diem blockchain*, satisfies the specifications.
    5.  **Address Verification Failures:** If the prover reports failures, analyze the error messages. This indicates a bug in your Move code *or* an incompleteness in your specifications, *specifically related to how your code interacts with Diem's rules*. Refine until the prover reports success.
    6.  **Integrate into Diem-Specific CI/CD:** Make formal verification part of your CI/CD pipeline *that deploys to the Diem testnet or mainnet*. This ensures that any changes to your Move modules are verified *before being deployed to the Diem blockchain*.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Resource Manipulation Errors (Diem-Specific):** (Severity: High) - Prevents violations of Diem's resource model, such as accidentally destroying or duplicating Diem resources.
    *   **Integer Overflows/Underflows (within Move):** (Severity: High) - Catches arithmetic errors within Move code that could lead to unexpected behavior on the Diem blockchain.
    *   **Logic Errors in Access Control (Diem Permissions):** (Severity: High) - Ensures that only authorized users/modules, *as defined by Diem's authentication and access control mechanisms*, can perform specific actions.
    *   **Reentrancy (Move Context):** (Severity: Medium) - Helps prevent reentrancy vulnerabilities within the context of Move's execution model on Diem.
    *   **Unvalidated Inputs (to Move Modules):** (Severity: Medium) - Specifications often implicitly require validation of inputs to Move functions *that interact with Diem resources*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Resource Manipulation Errors (Diem-Specific):** Risk reduced by 90-95%.
    *   **Integer Overflows/Underflows (within Move):** Risk reduced by 95-99%.
    *   **Logic Errors in Access Control (Diem Permissions):** Risk reduced by 80-90%.
    *   **Reentrancy (Move Context):** Risk reduced by 50-70%.
    *   **Unvalidated Inputs (to Move Modules):** Risk reduced by 60-70%.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Formal verification is used for the core `DiemToken` module (proving supply invariants), but not for the custom `UserAccessControl` module (which extends Diem's basic permissions).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   The `UserAccessControl` module, which builds upon Diem's permission system, lacks formal verification.
    *   The `DiemPayment` module (which handles Diem coin transfers) has basic specifications, but they are not comprehensive.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Comprehensive Testing of Move Modules and Diem Interactions](./mitigation_strategies/comprehensive_testing_of_move_modules_and_diem_interactions.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Comprehensive Testing (Diem-Specific)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Unit Tests (Move):** Write tests for each function within your Move modules *using the Move testing framework (`move test`)*. Focus on testing interactions with Diem resources, Diem coin, and Diem's standard library functions.
    2.  **Integration Tests (Diem Testnet):** Create tests that simulate interactions between multiple modules *deployed on a Diem testnet*. This ensures that modules work together correctly *within the Diem environment*. Use a testing framework that interacts with the Diem testnet API.
    3.  **Property-Based Tests (Move & Diem):** Use `proptest` (or similar) to generate inputs for your Move functions, focusing on properties related to Diem's resource model and transaction semantics.  For example, test that transferring Diem coin correctly updates balances *according to Diem's rules*.
    4.  **Fuzzing (Move & Diem):** Use a fuzzer to feed random data to your Move modules, specifically targeting interactions with Diem resources and APIs. This can uncover vulnerabilities in how your code handles unexpected inputs *within the Diem context*.
    5.  **Test Coverage (Move Code):** Aim for high test coverage of your Move code, focusing on lines and branches that interact with Diem's core functionality.
    6.  **Automated Testing (Diem CI/CD):** Integrate all tests into your CI/CD pipeline *that deploys to the Diem testnet or mainnet*.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Resource Manipulation Errors (Diem-Specific):** (Severity: High)
    *   **Integer Overflows/Underflows (within Move):** (Severity: High)
    *   **Logic Errors in Access Control (Diem Permissions):** (Severity: High)
    *   **Reentrancy (Move Context):** (Severity: Medium)
    *   **Unvalidated Inputs (to Move Modules):** (Severity: Medium)
    *   **General Bugs in Move Code Interacting with Diem:** (Severity: Variable)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **All Threats:** Risk reduced by 70-80% (depending on test thoroughness).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Good unit test coverage for most Move modules using `move test`.
    *   Basic integration tests on the Diem testnet are in place.
    *   Property-based testing is used for the `DiemToken` module.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Fuzzing of Move modules interacting with Diem is not implemented.
    *   Integration tests need to cover more complex scenarios on the Diem testnet.
    *   Property-based testing should be applied to other modules interacting with Diem.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Robust Error Handling for Diem Blockchain Interactions](./mitigation_strategies/robust_error_handling_for_diem_blockchain_interactions.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Robust Error Handling (Diem-Specific)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Check Diem Transaction Status:** After submitting a transaction to the Diem blockchain, *always* check its status using the Diem client library.  This is crucial for understanding whether the transaction was successfully included in a block and executed.
    2.  **Handle Diem-Specific Status Codes:** Be prepared to handle Diem-specific status codes, including success, various failure reasons (insufficient Diem coin, invalid arguments, Move module errors, sequence number mismatches), and pending. Understand the implications of each code *within the Diem transaction lifecycle*.
    3.  **Implement Retries (with Backoff for Diem):** For transient Diem network errors, implement retries with exponential backoff.  This avoids overwhelming the Diem network. Be aware of Diem's transaction submission rules and potential for transaction replay.
    4.  **Log Diem Errors:** Log all errors encountered during Diem blockchain interactions, including the Diem transaction hash, Diem-specific error code, and any relevant context from the Diem client library.
    5.  **Abort on Critical Move Errors:** Within your Move modules, use the `abort` instruction *strategically* to halt execution when an unrecoverable error occurs *that would violate Diem's invariants*. This prevents the module from entering an inconsistent state *on the Diem blockchain*.  Understand the implications of `abort` within Diem's transaction execution model.
    6. **Handle Diem Sequence Number Issues:** Properly manage Diem account sequence numbers to avoid transaction replay attacks and ensure transactions are processed in the correct order.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Incorrectly Handling Diem Transaction Failures:** (Severity: High) - Prevents the application from assuming a Diem transaction succeeded when it failed.
    *   **Relying on Potentially Manipulated On-Chain Diem Data (Indirectly):** (Severity: Medium) - Checking transaction status reduces the risk of acting on outdated or incorrect Diem data.
    *   **Diem-Specific DoS (Partial):** (Severity: Medium) - Retries with backoff help mitigate some forms of DoS targeting the Diem network.
    * **Diem Sequence Number Issues:** (Severity: High)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Incorrectly Handling Diem Transaction Failures:** Risk reduced by 90-95%.
    *   **Relying on Potentially Manipulated On-Chain Diem Data:** Risk reduced by 40-50%.
    *   **Diem-Specific DoS:** Risk reduced by 30-40%.
    * **Diem Sequence Number Issues:** Risk reduced by 90-95%.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic Diem transaction status checking is implemented.
    *   Diem error logging is in place.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Retries with exponential backoff are not consistently implemented for Diem interactions.
    *   More comprehensive error handling within Move modules (using `abort` strategically in relation to Diem invariants) is needed.
    *   Diem Sequence Number handling is basic and needs review.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Diem-Specific Rate Limiting](./mitigation_strategies/diem-specific_rate_limiting.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Rate Limiting (Diem Interactions)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Diem Rate-Limiting Points:** Determine where rate limiting should be applied *specifically for interactions with the Diem blockchain*. This includes:
        *   Client-side code submitting transactions to Diem.
        *   Move module functions that can be called repeatedly *and have implications for Diem resource usage or network congestion*.
    2.  **Choose a Rate-Limiting Algorithm (Considering Diem Gas):** Select an algorithm, considering Diem's gas model.  For example, you might limit the *total gas consumption* of transactions submitted by a user within a time period, rather than just the number of transactions.
    3.  **Implement Rate Limiting (Diem-Aware):**
        *   **Client-Side (Diem Transactions):** Implement rate limiting in your client to prevent sending too many transactions to Diem.
        *   **Move Module (Advanced - Diem Gas):** Consider implementing rate limiting *within* your Move modules to limit the gas consumption or frequency of calls to specific functions *that impact Diem resources*. This requires careful design and understanding of Diem's gas mechanics.
    4.  **Monitor and Tune (Diem Network Conditions):** Monitor the effectiveness of your rate limiting and adjust the limits based on Diem network conditions and your application's needs.
    5. **Inform Users (Diem Transaction Failures):** If a user exceeds the rate limit, provide a clear error message, explaining that the transaction failed due to rate limiting *on the Diem network*.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Diem-Specific Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks:** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents attackers from overwhelming the Diem network with transactions.
    *   **Abuse of Diem Resources:** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents users from consuming excessive Diem gas or other resources.
    *   **Diem Spam Transactions:** (Severity: Low)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Diem-Specific Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks:** Risk reduced by 60-80%.
    *   **Abuse of Diem Resources:** Risk reduced by 70-90%.
    *   **Diem Spam Transactions:** Risk reduced by 50-70%.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic rate limiting is implemented on the client-side for submitting transactions to Diem.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Rate limiting within Move modules (considering Diem gas) is not implemented.
    *   Monitoring and tuning of Diem-specific rate limits are not automated.
