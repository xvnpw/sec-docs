# Attack Surface Analysis for diem/diem

## Attack Surface: [Move VM Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/move_vm_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the Move Virtual Machine (bytecode verifier, interpreter, or gas metering) to execute malicious code or cause unexpected behavior.
*   **Diem Contribution:** Diem's core functionality relies on the Move VM for executing all smart contracts (Move modules). Any flaw in the VM is a *direct* Diem vulnerability.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a Move module that, due to a verifier bug, bypasses access control checks and allows unauthorized modification of another user's account balance. Or, a module is crafted to cause an infinite loop (if the gas mechanism fails), consuming resources and potentially halting transaction processing.
*   **Impact:** Loss of funds, data corruption, denial of service, unauthorized access to resources.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Stay Updated:** Developers *must* apply all Diem security updates promptly. These often contain critical VM patches.
    *   **Formal Verification:** For high-value or complex Move modules, use formal verification tools.
    *   **Auditing:** Thorough code audits of custom Move modules by experienced security professionals are essential.
    *   **Gas Limit Monitoring:** Implement monitoring to detect unusually high gas consumption.
    *   **Static Analysis:** Utilize Diem's provided static analysis tools.
    *   **Input Sanitization:** Even within Move, carefully validate any external data.

## Attack Surface: [Consensus Mechanism Attacks (DiemBFT)](./attack_surfaces/consensus_mechanism_attacks__diembft_.md)

*   **Description:** Attacks targeting the DiemBFT consensus algorithm, aiming to disrupt the network, censor transactions, or (in extreme, unlikely cases) double-spend.
*   **Diem Contribution:** DiemBFT is the *core* consensus mechanism of Diem.
*   **Example:** A compromised validator node (or a small group of colluding nodes) could attempt to delay or censor specific transactions. A vulnerability in the validator set management *within Diem* could allow an attacker to introduce malicious nodes.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, transaction censorship, potential (though highly unlikely in a well-managed permissioned network) double-spending, loss of trust.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (Lower than a public blockchain, but still significant due to the centralized nature of validator selection).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Validator Security:** Validator operators *must* implement robust security.
    *   **Network Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring of network connectivity and validator participation.
    *   **Key Management:** Secure key management practices for validator keys (HSMs, multi-signature).
    *   **Diem Updates:** Apply all Diem security updates related to consensus.
    *   **Reputation System (Future):** A robust reputation system could help.

## Attack Surface: [Cryptographic Weaknesses](./attack_surfaces/cryptographic_weaknesses.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in the cryptographic primitives *used by Diem* or their implementation *within the Diem codebase*.
*   **Diem Contribution:** Diem relies on specific cryptographic algorithms and implementations for its core security.
*   **Example:** A flaw in the signature scheme *used by Diem* is discovered, allowing for signature forgery. A side-channel attack on Diem's cryptographic library implementation allows key extraction.
*   **Impact:** Loss of funds, unauthorized access, data breaches, complete compromise of the network.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **HSMs:** Use Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) to protect private keys.
    *   **Secure Enclaves:** Leverage secure enclaves where available.
    *   **Key Rotation:** Implement regular key rotation.
    *   **Auditing:** Regularly audit Diem's cryptographic implementations.
    *   **Library Updates:** Keep Diem's cryptographic libraries updated.
    *   **Multi-signature:** Use multi-signature schemes for critical operations.

## Attack Surface: [On-chain Governance Attacks](./attack_surfaces/on-chain_governance_attacks.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers submit malicious proposals through the *Diem on-chain governance mechanism* to disrupt the network or gain control.
*   **Diem Contribution:** Diem's on-chain governance system is a *direct* part of the Diem protocol.
*   **Example:**  An attacker submits a proposal that, if approved, would change a critical system parameter (e.g., gas pricing) to disrupt the network. Or, a proposal contains malicious Move code.
*   **Impact:** Network disruption, parameter manipulation, potential execution of malicious code, loss of funds.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rigorous Code Review:** All proposed changes must undergo thorough code review.
    *   **Simulation and Testing:** Proposals should be extensively simulated and tested.
    *   **Voting Thresholds:** High voting thresholds and quorum requirements.
    *   **Emergency Powers:** A well-defined emergency shutdown mechanism.
    *   **Community Vigilance:** An active and engaged community.
    * **Time Delay:** Implement time delay between proposal acceptance and execution.
