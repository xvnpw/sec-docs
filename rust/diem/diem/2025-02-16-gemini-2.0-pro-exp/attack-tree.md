## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Diem Node(s)](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_diem_node_s_.md)

*   **1.1 Gain Unauthorized Access:**
    *   **1.1.1 Exploit Network Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK]:**
        *   **Description:** Attacker finds and exploits vulnerabilities in the Diem node's network-facing services (e.g., remote code execution, buffer overflows).
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** High (Full node compromise)
        *   **Effort:** High
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced/Expert
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium/Hard
    *   **1.1.2 Social Engineering [HIGH-RISK]:**
        *   **Description:** Attacker tricks node operators into revealing credentials, installing malware, or granting unauthorized access.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High (Full node compromise)
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
    * **1.1.3 Supply Chain Attack:**
        *   **Description:** Compromising the Diem software before it's even installed (e.g., by compromising the build process or distribution channels).
        *   **Likelihood:** Very Low
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** Very High
        *   **Skill Level:** Expert
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Move Language Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_move_language_vulnerabilities__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **2.1 Logic Errors in Smart Contracts:**
    *   **2.1.1 Re-entrancy [HIGH-RISK]:**
        *   **Description:** A malicious contract repeatedly calls back into a vulnerable contract before the first invocation finishes, potentially draining funds or manipulating state.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate/Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **2.1.2 Integer Overflow/Underflow:**
        *   **Description:** Arithmetic operations produce results outside the representable range of the integer type, leading to unexpected behavior.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low/Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium/High
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **2.1.3 Access Control Violation:**
        *   **Description:** Incorrectly implemented access control allows unauthorized users to perform privileged actions.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Client-Side Diem Integration Issues [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_client-side_diem_integration_issues__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **4.1 Improper Handling of Private Keys/Seeds:**
    *   **4.1.1 Storage in Plaintext [HIGH-RISK]:**
        *   **Description:** Private keys or seed phrases are stored without encryption, making them easily accessible to attackers who gain access to the storage location.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Very High (Complete loss of funds)
        *   **Effort:** Very Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
    *   **4.1.2 Transmission Insecurely [HIGH-RISK]:**
        *   **Description:** Private keys or seed phrases are transmitted over unencrypted channels (e.g., HTTP, email), allowing attackers to intercept them.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low/Medium
        *   **Impact:** Very High (Complete loss of funds)
        *   **Effort:** Low
