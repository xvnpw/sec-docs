## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Manipulate Diem Transactions to Affect Application State (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_manipulate_diem_transactions_to_affect_application_state__critical_node_.md)

* Objective: To alter the application's state or balances by manipulating Diem transactions.
    * Key Attack Vector:
        * Double Spending Attack (Application Misinterprets Transaction Status) (CRITICAL NODE):
            * Description: An attacker attempts to spend the same Diem more than once by exploiting the application's failure to properly track transaction confirmation and finality on the Diem blockchain.
            * How it works: The attacker submits a transaction, and before it's fully confirmed, submits another transaction spending the same funds. If the application doesn't correctly verify finality, it might credit the attacker twice.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Diem Smart Contracts Used by the Application (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_diem_smart_contracts_used_by_the_application__critical_node_.md)

* Objective: To leverage vulnerabilities in Diem smart contracts to harm the application or its users.
    * Key Attack Vectors:
        * Reentrancy Attack (If Application Logic is Susceptible) (CRITICAL NODE):
            * Description: An attacker exploits a smart contract's ability to make external calls to recursively call back into the vulnerable contract before the initial call's state changes are finalized, potentially draining funds or manipulating state.
        * Integer Overflow/Underflow Exploitation (CRITICAL NODE):
            * Description: Attackers manipulate arithmetic operations in smart contracts to cause integer overflows (value exceeds the maximum) or underflows (value goes below the minimum), leading to unexpected and potentially exploitable behavior, such as bypassing security checks or manipulating asset values.
        * Logic Errors in Smart Contracts (CRITICAL NODE):
            * Description: Exploiting flaws or oversights in the intended functionality of the smart contract's code. This could involve manipulating the contract's state in unintended ways, bypassing access controls, or causing incorrect calculations.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Compromise Diem Accounts/Keys Used by the Application (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_compromise_diem_accountskeys_used_by_the_application__critical_node_.md)

* Objective: To gain unauthorized control over the Diem accounts or private keys used by the application.
    * Key Attack Vectors:
        * Steal Private Keys Associated with Application's Diem Accounts (CRITICAL NODE):
            * Exploit Vulnerabilities in Application's Key Management System (CRITICAL NODE):
                * Description: Attackers target weaknesses in how the application generates, stores, and manages the private keys associated with its Diem accounts. This could involve insecure storage (unencrypted files, easily accessible locations), weak key generation algorithms, or exposure of keys through logs or memory dumps.
        * Gain Unauthorized Access to Application's Diem Wallets/Accounts (CRITICAL NODE):
            * Description: Attackers bypass the application's authentication and authorization mechanisms to directly access and control its Diem wallets or accounts without possessing the private keys. This could be due to flaws in the application's Diem integration logic, weak security measures, or exposed credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Nodes:](./attack_tree_paths/critical_nodes.md)

* Compromise Application via Diem Exploitation: The ultimate goal of the attacker, representing a complete breach of the application's security through Diem vulnerabilities.
* Manipulate Diem Transactions to Affect Application State: A critical point where attackers can directly influence the application's functionality and data by manipulating financial transactions on the blockchain.
* Double Spending Attack (Application Misinterprets Transaction Status): A specific, high-impact attack within transaction manipulation that can lead to significant financial losses.
* Exploit Diem Smart Contracts Used by the Application: A critical juncture where vulnerabilities in smart contracts can be leveraged for various malicious purposes.
* Reentrancy Attack (If Application Logic is Susceptible): A well-known and dangerous smart contract vulnerability.
* Integer Overflow/Underflow Exploitation: A common class of smart contract vulnerabilities with potentially severe consequences.
* Logic Errors in Smart Contracts: Represents flaws in the fundamental design and implementation of smart contract functionality.
* Compromise Diem Accounts/Keys Used by the Application: A direct path to controlling the application's Diem assets and capabilities.
* Steal Private Keys Associated with Application's Diem Accounts: The most direct and impactful way to compromise the application's Diem identity.
* Exploit Vulnerabilities in Application's Key Management System: The underlying weakness that enables private key theft.
* Gain Unauthorized Access to Application's Diem Wallets/Accounts: A critical failure in the application's access control mechanisms for Diem resources.
