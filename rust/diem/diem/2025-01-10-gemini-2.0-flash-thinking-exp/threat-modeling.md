# Threat Model Analysis for diem/diem

## Threat: [Logic Errors in Custom Move Modules](./threats/logic_errors_in_custom_move_modules.md)

*   **Threat:** Logic Errors in Custom Move Modules
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits flaws in the logic of our application's custom Move smart contracts. This could involve manipulating contract state, bypassing intended access controls, or causing unexpected behavior during transaction execution. For instance, an attacker might find a way to transfer funds without proper authorization or trigger a function in an unintended state.
    *   **Impact:** Financial losses due to unauthorized transfers, corruption of on-chain data managed by the contract, disruption of application functionality relying on the flawed contract, reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Component:** Custom Move Modules deployed by our application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the severity of the logic flaw and the value at stake).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly test smart contracts with comprehensive unit and integration tests.
        *   Conduct formal verification of critical contract logic.
        *   Perform security audits by experienced smart contract auditors.
        *   Implement circuit breakers or emergency stop mechanisms in contracts where feasible.
        *   Follow secure coding best practices for Move development.

## Threat: [Reentrancy Attacks on Custom Move Modules](./threats/reentrancy_attacks_on_custom_move_modules.md)

*   **Threat:** Reentrancy Attacks on Custom Move Modules
    *   **Description:** An attacker leverages the ability of a Move contract to call another contract before the initial call is finalized. This can be used to recursively call a vulnerable function, potentially draining funds or manipulating state in unintended ways. For example, an attacker's contract could repeatedly withdraw funds from our contract before the initial withdrawal is recorded.
    *   **Impact:** Significant financial losses, corruption of contract state, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Custom Move Modules with external calls or interactions with other contracts.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement the "checks-effects-interactions" pattern: perform checks before making state changes, and make external calls last.
        *   Use reentrancy guards or mutexes to prevent recursive calls within critical functions.
        *   Carefully analyze the control flow and potential for reentrancy in all external calls.

## Threat: [Loss or Compromise of Application's Private Keys](./threats/loss_or_compromise_of_application's_private_keys.md)

*   **Threat:** Loss or Compromise of Application's Private Keys
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the private keys associated with our application's Diem accounts. This could occur through phishing, malware, insecure storage of keys, or insider threats. With the private keys, the attacker can impersonate our application, transfer funds, and manipulate on-chain data controlled by those accounts.
    *   **Impact:** Complete loss of funds held in the compromised accounts, unauthorized modification of on-chain data, reputational damage, disruption of application functionality.
    *   **Affected Component:** Diem Accounts controlled by our application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use secure key management practices, such as hardware wallets or secure enclave solutions.
        *   Implement multi-signature schemes for critical accounts.
        *   Enforce strict access controls for systems that handle private keys.
        *   Educate developers and operations staff about the importance of key security.
        *   Regularly rotate keys.

## Threat: [Reliance on Diem Network Availability](./threats/reliance_on_diem_network_availability.md)

*   **Threat:** Reliance on Diem Network Availability
    *   **Description:** Our application's functionality is dependent on the Diem network being operational. If the Diem network experiences outages or significant performance issues, our application's ability to interact with the blockchain will be impaired or completely unavailable.
    *   **Impact:** Temporary or prolonged disruption of our application's services, inability to process transactions, potential loss of revenue or user trust.
    *   **Affected Component:** The entire Diem Network infrastructure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (potential for significant disruption).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms for blockchain interactions.
        *   Monitor the status of the Diem network and provide users with relevant information during outages.
        *   Consider alternative mechanisms for critical functionalities if the Diem network is unavailable for extended periods (if feasible).
