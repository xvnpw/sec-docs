**Deep Dive into Key Attack Vectors and Mitigation Strategies (with Diem Specifics):**

* **Attack Vector 1.1: Direct Key Compromise:**
    * **Diem Specifics:** Diem uses EdDSA signatures. Weak RNG can lead to predictable signatures, potentially allowing key recovery.
    * **Mitigation:**
        * **Strong Random Number Generation:** Utilize cryptographically secure random number generators (CSPRNGs) provided by trusted libraries or the operating system.
        * **Hardware Security Modules (HSMs):**  Mandatory for high-value wallets and operational accounts. Diem supports integration with HSMs.
        * **Secure Key Storage:**  Never store private keys in plaintext. Use encryption at rest and in transit. Consider using secure enclaves or trusted execution environments (TEEs).
        * **Key Derivation Functions (KDFs):** If deriving keys from a master secret, use strong KDFs like Argon2 or scrypt.
        * **Multi-Sig:** Implement multi-signature schemes for critical wallets, requiring multiple private keys to authorize transactions.
        * **Regular Key Rotation:**  Implement a policy for rotating private keys, especially for frequently used hot wallets.

* **Attack Vector 1.2: Exploiting Application Logic to Access Wallet Functionality:**
    * **Diem Specifics:** Understand how your application interacts with the Diem blockchain. Are you using the Diem SDK? Are you building your own transaction signing logic?
    * **Mitigation:**
        * **Secure Authentication and Authorization:** Implement robust authentication (e.g., multi-factor authentication) and fine-grained authorization controls based on the principle of least privilege.
        * **Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks. Be especially careful with data used in constructing Diem transactions.
        * **API Security:** Secure all APIs used for wallet management with strong authentication (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0) and authorization. Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
        * **Secure Transaction Signing:** If the application handles transaction signing, ensure the process is secure and prevents manipulation. Consider using trusted libraries for signing.
        * **Nonce Management:**  Properly manage transaction nonces to prevent replay attacks on the Diem blockchain.

* **Attack Vector 2.1: Server-Side Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Diem Specifics:** The servers managing Diem wallets are a high-value target.
    * **Mitigation:**
        * **Regular Security Patching:**  Maintain a rigorous patching schedule for all software components.
        * **Server Hardening:**  Follow security best practices for server hardening, including disabling unnecessary services, configuring firewalls, and using intrusion detection/prevention systems.
        * **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant only necessary permissions to users and processes on the servers.
        * **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the infrastructure.

* **Attack Vector 3.1: Logic Errors in Application's Smart Contracts:**
    * **Diem Specifics:** Diem uses the Move programming language for smart contracts. Understanding Move's security features and potential pitfalls is crucial.
    * **Mitigation:**
        * **Secure Smart Contract Development:** Follow secure coding practices for Move. Utilize static analysis tools and formal verification where possible.
        * **Thorough Testing:**  Conduct extensive unit, integration, and fuzz testing of smart contracts.
