## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Compromise Application via Diem Exploitation (CRITICAL NODE)

This analysis focuses on the attack tree path labeled "Compromise Application via Diem Exploitation," which is designated as a **CRITICAL NODE**. This signifies a high-severity security risk where an attacker leverages vulnerabilities or weaknesses within the Diem blockchain or the application's interaction with it to compromise the application itself.

To achieve this **CRITICAL NODE**, an attacker needs to successfully execute one or more of the following sub-goals (represented as **OR** gates in a typical attack tree):
