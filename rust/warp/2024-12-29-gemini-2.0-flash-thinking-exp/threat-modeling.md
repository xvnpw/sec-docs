### High and Critical Warp-Specific Threats

Here's a list of high and critical threats that directly involve the `warp` framework:

*   **Threat:** Path Traversal via Malformed Routes
    *   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate user-provided input used in route handlers to construct file paths. By injecting characters like `../`, they can navigate outside the intended directory and access sensitive files on the server's filesystem.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach: Attackers could access sensitive configuration files, application data, or user information. Integrity breach: In some cases, attackers might be able to modify or delete files. Availability breach: Accessing critical system files could lead to application malfunction or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Warp Component:** `warp::path()` filter and route handler logic that processes file paths.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user input used in file path construction.
        *   Utilize `std::path::PathBuf` and its methods for safe path manipulation.
        *   Avoid directly concatenating user input into file paths.
        *   Implement proper access controls and permissions on the server's filesystem.

*   **Threat:** Resource Exhaustion via Unbounded Body Size
    *   **Description:** An attacker could send requests with extremely large bodies to the server. If the application doesn't enforce limits on request body size, processing these large bodies can exhaust server memory and lead to a denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Availability breach: The server becomes unresponsive or crashes due to memory exhaustion.
    *   **Affected Warp Component:** `warp::body()` module, specifically when used without size limits.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use `warp::body::limit()` to enforce maximum size limits on request bodies.
        *   Consider the expected size of request bodies for different endpoints and set appropriate limits.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Cookie Handling
    *   **Description:** If the application uses `warp`'s cookie handling mechanisms without setting appropriate security flags (e.g., `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite`), cookies might be vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) or cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.
    *   **Impact:** Session hijacking: Attackers can steal user session cookies. Cross-site scripting (XSS): Attackers can inject malicious scripts that can access cookies. Cross-site request forgery (CSRF): Attackers can trick users into making unintended requests.
    *   **Affected Warp Component:** `warp::reply::with_cookie()`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always set appropriate security flags (`HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite`) for cookies, especially those containing sensitive information like session identifiers.
        *   Use `warp::reply::with_cookie()` with the necessary attributes.
