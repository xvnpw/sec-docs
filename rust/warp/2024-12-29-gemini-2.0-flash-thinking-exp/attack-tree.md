            * Downgrade Attacks (if Warp doesn't enforce strong TLS)
                * Exploit: Force the server to use weaker encryption protocols, making communication easier to intercept. **[HIGH-RISK PATH END]**
            * Replay Attacks (if not properly mitigated at application level)
                * Exploit: Intercept and resend valid requests to perform unauthorized actions. **[HIGH-RISK PATH END]**
    * OR Exploiting Warp's Internal Logic/API Misuse
        * AND Triggering Unintended Panic/Crash
            * Exploit: Send specific requests or data that trigger an unhandled error or panic within Warp's core logic, leading to application downtime. **[HIGH-RISK PATH END]**
        * AND Resource Leaks within Warp
            * Exploit: Send requests that cause Warp to allocate resources without releasing them, eventually leading to memory exhaustion and DoS. **[HIGH-RISK PATH END]**

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

* **Compromise Application via Warp Weakness [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents any successful exploitation of a vulnerability within the Warp framework to compromise the application.

* **Exploiting HTTP Handling Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH START]:**
    * This category encompasses attacks that target how Warp processes incoming HTTP requests. Vulnerabilities here can lead to various forms of compromise.

* **HTTP Parsing Errors [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * Warp is responsible for parsing HTTP headers and the request body. Sending malformed or excessively large data can expose weaknesses in this parsing logic, leading to crashes, resource exhaustion, or unexpected behavior.
        * **Send Oversized Headers/Body [HIGH-RISK PATH END]:** Attackers send HTTP requests with extremely large headers or bodies. If Warp doesn't handle these limits properly, it can lead to buffer overflows (writing beyond allocated memory) or excessive memory allocation, causing the server to crash or become unresponsive (Denial of Service).

* **Routing Vulnerabilities:**
    * Warp's routing mechanism maps incoming requests to specific handlers. Flaws in this mechanism can allow attackers to bypass intended access controls or access unintended functionality.
        * **Route Confusion/Bypass [HIGH-RISK PATH END]:** Attackers craft requests that exploit ambiguities or flaws in Warp's route matching logic. This can allow them to access endpoints they shouldn't have access to, potentially exposing sensitive data or allowing them to execute unauthorized actions.

* **WebSocket Vulnerabilities (if used) [HIGH-RISK PATH START]:**
    * If the application uses Warp's WebSocket support, vulnerabilities in handling WebSocket connections and messages can be exploited.
        * **Resource Exhaustion (WebSocket) [HIGH-RISK PATH END]:** Attackers open a large number of WebSocket connections to the server, consuming server resources (memory, CPU, network bandwidth) and potentially causing a Denial of Service for legitimate users.
        * **Lack of Input Validation (WebSocket) [HIGH-RISK PATH END]:** Attackers send malicious data through WebSocket connections. If the application doesn't properly validate and sanitize this input, it can lead to various issues, including compromising application logic, data manipulation, or even cross-site scripting (XSS) if the data is reflected in a web interface.

* **Exploiting Connection Handling Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH START]:**
    * This category focuses on attacks that target how Warp manages incoming network connections.

* **Denial of Service (DoS) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * The goal of these attacks is to make the application unavailable to legitimate users by overwhelming its resources.
        * **Connection Exhaustion [HIGH-RISK PATH END]:** Attackers open a large number of TCP connections to the server, exhausting the server's ability to accept new connections and serve legitimate requests.
        * **Slowloris Attack (HTTP Keep-Alive Abuse) [HIGH-RISK PATH END]:** Attackers send partial HTTP requests and keep the connections alive for an extended period, slowly consuming server resources and preventing it from handling new requests.

* **TLS/SSL Vulnerabilities (Indirectly via Warp's TLS integration):**
    * While Warp relies on libraries like `tokio-tls`, improper configuration or lack of enforcement can create vulnerabilities.
        * **Downgrade Attacks (if Warp doesn't enforce strong TLS) [HIGH-RISK PATH END]:** Attackers attempt to force the server to use older, weaker versions of the TLS protocol. These older versions may have known vulnerabilities, making the communication easier to eavesdrop on or manipulate.
        * **Replay Attacks (if not properly mitigated at application level) [HIGH-RISK PATH END]:** Attackers intercept legitimate, authenticated requests and resend them to the server. If the application doesn't have proper mechanisms to prevent replay attacks (like nonces or timestamps), the attacker can perform unauthorized actions.

* **Exploiting Warp's Internal Logic/API Misuse:**
    * This involves finding and exploiting bugs or unexpected behavior within the Warp framework itself.
        * **Triggering Unintended Panic/Crash [HIGH-RISK PATH END]:** Attackers send specific requests or data that trigger an unhandled error or panic within Warp's core code. This can cause the application to crash and become unavailable.
        * **Resource Leaks within Warp [HIGH-RISK PATH END]:** Attackers send requests that cause Warp to allocate resources (like memory or file handles) without properly releasing them. Over time, this can lead to resource exhaustion and a Denial of Service.
