### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Request Parameter Injection

**Understanding the Vulnerability:**

Request Parameter Injection occurs when an attacker can control or influence the parameters of an HTTP request made by the application. This control allows them to inject malicious data that can be interpreted by the receiving server in unintended ways. The core issue lies in the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-supplied input before it's used to construct the HTTP request.

**How it Relates to `bend`:**

The `bend` library provides a convenient way to build and send HTTP requests in Go. While `bend` itself doesn't inherently introduce vulnerabilities, improper usage within the application can create opportunities for Request Parameter Injection. Specifically, if the application uses user input to dynamically construct URLs, request bodies, or headers when using `bend`'s functions, it becomes susceptible.

**Potential Attack Vectors using `bend`:**

* **URL Parameter Injection:**
    * **Scenario:** The application takes user input to build a URL that `bend` then uses to make a request.
    * **Example:** Imagine an application that allows users to search for products on an external API. The search term is taken from user input and used to construct the API endpoint URL.
    * **Vulnerable Code (Conceptual):**
      ```go
      import "github.com/higherorderco/bend"
      import "net/url"

      func searchProducts(searchTerm string) (*bend.Response, error) {
          baseURL := "https://api.example.com/products"
          // Vulnerable: Directly concatenating user input
          searchURL := baseURL + "?q=" + searchTerm

          client := bend.NewClient()
          req, err := client.NewRequest("GET", searchURL, nil)
          if err != nil {
              return nil, err
          }
          return client.Do(req)
      }
      ```
    * **Exploitation:** An attacker could provide a malicious `searchTerm` like `"'; DROP TABLE products; --"` which, if not properly handled by the receiving API, could lead to SQL Injection on the backend. Even if the backend is protected against SQL injection, other issues like Open Redirects or information disclosure could arise depending on how the injected parameters are processed.

* **Request Body Injection:**
    * **Scenario:** The application uses user input to construct the body of a POST or PUT request sent by `bend`.
    * **Example:** Consider an application that allows users to submit feedback. The feedback message is taken as input and sent in the request body.
    * **Vulnerable Code (Conceptual):**
      ```go
      import (
          "github.com/higherorderco/bend"
          "strings"
      )

      func submitFeedback(message string) (*bend.Response, error) {
          apiURL := "https://api.example.com/feedback"
          // Vulnerable: Directly using user input in the request body
          body := strings.NewReader(`{"message": "` + message + `"}`)

          client := bend.NewClient()
          req, err := client.NewRequest("POST", apiURL, body)
          if err != nil {
              return nil, err
          }
          req.Header.Set("Content-Type", "application/json")
          return client.Do(req)
      }
      ```
    * **Exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious JSON or other data into the `message` field, potentially disrupting the receiving server's processing or even leading to vulnerabilities if the backend doesn't properly validate the request body.

* **Header Injection:**
    * **Scenario:** The application uses user input to set custom headers in the HTTP request using `bend`.
    * **Example:** An application might allow users to specify a custom user agent string.
    * **Vulnerable Code (Conceptual):**
      ```go
      import "github.com/higherorderco/bend"

      func makeRequestWithCustomUserAgent(url string, userAgent string) (*bend.Response, error) {
          client := bend.NewClient()
          req, err := client.NewRequest("GET", url, nil)
          if err != nil {
              return nil, err
          }
          // Vulnerable: Directly using user input for header value
          req.Header.Set("User-Agent", userAgent)
          return client.Do(req)
      }
      ```
    * **Exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious characters or control characters into the `userAgent` string, potentially leading to HTTP Response Splitting vulnerabilities on the receiving server if it echoes the header back.

**Potential Impact:**

A successful Request Parameter Injection attack can have various severe consequences, including:

* **Data Breaches:**  If the injected parameters lead to the retrieval or modification of sensitive data on the backend.
* **Unauthorized Actions:**  If the injected parameters allow the attacker to perform actions they are not authorized to perform.
* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** If the injected parameters are reflected in the response and interpreted as code by the user's browser.
* **SQL Injection:** If the injected parameters are used in database queries on the backend without proper sanitization.
* **Open Redirects:** If the injected parameters manipulate the redirect URL, leading users to malicious websites.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):**  If the injected parameters cause the backend server to crash or become overloaded.
* **Bypassing Security Controls:**  Attackers might be able to bypass authentication or authorization mechanisms by manipulating request parameters.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To effectively mitigate Request Parameter Injection vulnerabilities when using `bend`, the following strategies should be implemented:

* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    * **Strictly validate all user-supplied input:**  Define expected formats, lengths, and character sets for each input field.
    * **Sanitize input:** Remove or escape potentially harmful characters before using the input to construct HTTP requests. Use appropriate encoding functions for URLs, JSON, and other data formats.
    * **Use allow-lists instead of block-lists:** Define what is allowed rather than trying to block all possible malicious inputs.

* **Output Encoding:**
    * **Encode data before including it in URLs, request bodies, or headers:** Use URL encoding for URL parameters, JSON encoding for JSON bodies, and appropriate encoding for other data formats. Go's standard library provides functions like `url.QueryEscape` and the `encoding/json` package for this purpose.

* **Use Parameterized Queries or Prepared Statements (if applicable to the receiving end):** While this is primarily a backend concern, understanding how the receiving server handles parameters is crucial. If the backend uses databases, encourage the use of parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.

* **Avoid Direct String Concatenation for URL Construction:**  Instead of directly concatenating strings to build URLs, use the `net/url` package to properly construct and encode URL components.

* **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP):**  While not a direct mitigation for Request Parameter Injection, CSP can help mitigate the impact of successful XSS attacks that might result from it.

* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities and ensure the effectiveness of implemented mitigations.

* **Educate Developers:**  Ensure the development team understands the risks of Request Parameter Injection and best practices for secure coding with `bend`.

**Example of Secure Code (URL Parameter):**

```go
import (
	"github.com/higherorderco/bend"
	"net/url"
)

func searchProductsSecure(searchTerm string) (*bend.Response, error) {
	baseURL := "https://api.example.com/products"
	params := url.Values{}
	params.Add("q", searchTerm)

	u, err := url.Parse(baseURL)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	u.RawQuery = params.Encode()

	client := bend.NewClient()
	req, err := client.NewRequest("GET", u.String(), nil)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	return client.Do(req)
}
```

**Example of Secure Code (Request Body - JSON):**

```go
import (
	"bytes"
	"encoding/json"
	"github.com/higherorderco/bend"
)

type FeedbackRequest struct {
	Message string `json:"message"`
}

func submitFeedbackSecure(message string) (*bend.Response, error) {
	apiURL := "https://api.example.com/feedback"
	feedback := FeedbackRequest{Message: message}
	bodyBytes, err := json.Marshal(feedback)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	body := bytes.NewReader(bodyBytes)

	client := bend.NewClient()
	req, err := client.NewRequest("POST", apiURL, body)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	req.Header.Set("Content-Type", "application/json")
	return client.Do(req)
}
```

**Conclusion:**

Request Parameter Injection is a significant security risk that can have severe consequences. When using the `bend` library, it's crucial to avoid directly incorporating unsanitized user input into HTTP requests. By implementing robust input validation, output encoding, and following secure coding practices, the development team can effectively mitigate this vulnerability and build more secure applications. Continuous education and regular security assessments are essential to maintain a strong security posture.
