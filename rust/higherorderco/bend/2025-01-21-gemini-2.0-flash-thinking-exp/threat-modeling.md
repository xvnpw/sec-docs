# Threat Model Analysis for higherorderco/bend

## Threat: [Insecure Route Definitions or Wildcard Usage](./threats/insecure_route_definitions_or_wildcard_usage.md)

**Description:**

*   **Attacker Action:** An attacker might attempt to access unintended endpoints or functionalities by exploiting overly permissive route definitions or the misuse of wildcard characters in route patterns defined within Bend. They could craft URLs that match these broad patterns to bypass intended access controls enforced by Bend's routing mechanism.

**Impact:**

*   Unauthorized access to sensitive data or administrative functions managed by Bend-routed endpoints.
*   Exposure of internal application logic or components accessible through Bend's routing.

**Affected Bend Component:**

*   Router (specifically the route definition and matching logic provided by Bend).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Define explicit and specific routes for each intended endpoint within Bend's routing configuration.
*   Avoid using overly broad wildcard characters in route patterns defined in Bend.
*   Regularly review and audit route configurations within Bend to ensure they are secure and intended.
*   Implement robust authorization checks within route handlers managed by Bend to verify user permissions.

## Threat: [Middleware Vulnerabilities or Misconfiguration](./threats/middleware_vulnerabilities_or_misconfiguration.md)

**Description:**

*   **Attacker Action:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in custom-developed middleware integrated into Bend's pipeline or misconfigurations of built-in middleware provided by Bend to bypass security checks, manipulate requests or responses handled by Bend, or cause denial of service within the Bend application. They might also try to exploit the order of middleware execution within Bend's pipeline if it creates a vulnerability.

**Impact:**

*   Bypass of authentication or authorization mechanisms implemented through Bend's middleware.
*   Information disclosure through manipulated responses processed by Bend's middleware.
*   Denial of service by overloading or crashing the middleware within the Bend application.
*   Potential for further exploitation if middleware handles sensitive data insecurely within the Bend context.

**Affected Bend Component:**

*   Middleware Pipeline (the system within Bend for registering and executing middleware functions).
*   Individual Middleware Functions (both built-in to Bend and custom middleware integrated with Bend).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Thoroughly review and test all custom middleware integrated with Bend for security vulnerabilities.
*   Understand the security implications of built-in middleware provided by Bend and configure them appropriately.
*   Carefully consider the order of middleware execution within Bend's pipeline to prevent unintended interactions or bypasses.
*   Keep middleware dependencies used within Bend up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) via Bend's Templating Engine](./threats/server-side_template_injection__ssti__via_bend's_templating_engine.md)

**Description:**

*   **Attacker Action:** An attacker could inject malicious code into user-controlled input that is then processed by Bend's template engine without proper sanitization. This code is executed on the server when Bend renders the template.

**Impact:**

*   Remote code execution on the server hosting the Bend application.
*   Full compromise of the application and potentially the underlying server.
*   Data breaches and manipulation within the Bend application's scope.

**Affected Bend Component:**

*   Template Rendering Engine (the component within Bend responsible for processing and rendering templates, likely using Go's `html/template` or a similar library integrated with Bend).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Always treat user-provided data as untrusted when rendering templates within Bend.
*   Utilize the templating engine's built-in escaping mechanisms for all user-provided data processed by Bend's templating.
*   Avoid constructing templates dynamically from user input within the Bend application.
*   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of successful SSTI within the Bend application's rendered output.

## Threat: [Exposure of Bend-Specific Configuration Files](./threats/exposure_of_bend-specific_configuration_files.md)

**Description:**

*   **Attacker Action:** An attacker could gain access to Bend's configuration files, potentially revealing sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, or other secrets used by the Bend application.

**Impact:**

*   Disclosure of sensitive configuration data used by the Bend framework.
*   Potential for further compromise using the exposed credentials or secrets within the Bend application's context.

**Affected Bend Component:**

*   Configuration Loading (the mechanism Bend uses to load its configuration files).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Securely store and manage Bend's configuration files, restricting access to authorized personnel.
*   Implement appropriate access controls on Bend's configuration files at the operating system level.
*   Avoid including sensitive information directly in Bend's configuration files; use environment variables or secrets management solutions integrated with Bend.
*   Ensure web server configurations prevent direct access to Bend's configuration files.
