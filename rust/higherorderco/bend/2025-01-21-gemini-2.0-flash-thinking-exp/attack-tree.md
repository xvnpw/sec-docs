## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE] Manipulate Outgoing Requests via Bend](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__critical_node__manipulate_outgoing_requests_via_bend.md)

**Attack Vectors:** This high-risk area focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application constructs and sends HTTP requests using the Bend library. Attackers aim to inject malicious data or manipulate the request parameters to achieve their goals. This is critical because it directly controls the application's communication with external or internal services.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE] Request Parameter Injection](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__critical_node__request_parameter_injection.md)

**Attack Vectors:** This involves injecting malicious data into the parameters of HTTP requests sent by Bend. This can occur when the application uses user-supplied input without proper sanitization or encoding to build URLs, request bodies, or headers.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Control URL Parameters](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__control_url_parameters.md)

**Attack Vectors:** Attackers can manipulate URL parameters by injecting malicious values. This can lead to various vulnerabilities depending on how the backend processes these parameters. Examples include:
                * **SQL Injection:** If the backend uses the parameter value in a database query without proper sanitization.
                * **Command Injection:** If the backend executes system commands based on the parameter value.
                * **Data Exfiltration:** By crafting URLs that cause the backend to send sensitive data to an attacker-controlled server.
                * **Unauthorized Actions:** By manipulating parameters to perform actions the attacker is not authorized to do.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Arbitrary URL/Host Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__arbitrary_urlhost_manipulation.md)

**Attack Vectors:** This attack vector exploits situations where the application allows user-controlled input to determine the target URL or hostname that Bend connects to. This can lead to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks.
        * **SSRF Attack:** An attacker can force the application to make requests to arbitrary internal or external resources. This can be used to:
            * **Access internal services:** Bypassing firewall restrictions and accessing services not directly exposed to the internet.
            * **Read sensitive data:** Accessing files or data on internal systems.
            * **Perform actions on internal systems:**  Triggering actions on internal services.
            * **Port scanning:** Scanning internal networks to identify open ports and services.
            * **Credential theft:** Targeting metadata endpoints of cloud providers to steal credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Bend's Internal Functionality/Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_bend's_internal_functionalityvulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vectors:** This critical area focuses on exploiting potential vulnerabilities within the Bend library itself or its dependencies. Successful exploitation here can have severe consequences as it directly compromises the underlying HTTP client.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE] Code Vulnerabilities within Bend (Hypothetical)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__critical_node__code_vulnerabilities_within_bend__hypothetical_.md)

**Attack Vectors:** This involves discovering and exploiting bugs or vulnerabilities within Bend's codebase. These could be classic software vulnerabilities such as:
        * **Buffer Overflows:**  Causing a crash or potentially allowing arbitrary code execution by providing input larger than expected.
        * **Injection Flaws:**  Similar to request parameter injection, but within Bend's internal logic for constructing requests.
        * **Logic Errors:** Flaws in Bend's code that can be exploited to cause unintended behavior.
        * **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The most severe outcome, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server running the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vectors:** Bend relies on other Go packages (dependencies). If these dependencies have known vulnerabilities, they can be exploited through Bend.
        * **Vulnerable HTTP Parsing Libraries:** If a dependency used for parsing HTTP requests or responses has a vulnerability, it could be exploited by sending specially crafted requests or receiving malicious responses.
        * **Other Vulnerable Libraries:** Any vulnerable dependency used by Bend could potentially be exploited, depending on its functionality and how Bend utilizes it. This could lead to various impacts, including RCE, denial of service, or information disclosure.
