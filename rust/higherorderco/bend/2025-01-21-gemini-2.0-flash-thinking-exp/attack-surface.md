# Attack Surface Analysis for higherorderco/bend

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Custom Route Handler Logic](./attack_surfaces/insecure_custom_route_handler_logic.md)

* **Attack Surface: Insecure Custom Route Handler Logic**
    * **Description:** Vulnerabilities exist within the application-specific code implemented in `bend` route handlers.
    * **How Bend Contributes:** `bend` provides the framework for defining and executing these handlers, making their security the developer's responsibility. It routes requests to these custom functions, and the security of the logic within is paramount.
    * **Example:** A route handler defined using `bend`'s routing mechanism directly uses unsanitized user input from a POST request to construct a database query, leading to SQL injection.
    * **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, unauthorized access to resources.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement robust input validation and sanitization within `bend` route handlers.
        * Utilize parameterized queries or ORM features within handlers to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
        * Apply the principle of least privilege when accessing resources from within handlers.
        * Conduct thorough code reviews and security testing specifically targeting the logic within `bend` route handlers.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Custom Middleware](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_custom_middleware.md)

* **Attack Surface: Vulnerable Custom Middleware**
    * **Description:** Security flaws present in custom middleware functions added to the `bend` request processing pipeline.
    * **How Bend Contributes:** `bend` allows developers to define and chain middleware functions that intercept and process requests. Vulnerabilities in these custom middleware components, integrated through `bend`, can be exploited.
    * **Example:** A custom authentication middleware, registered with `bend`, incorrectly validates JWT tokens, allowing an attacker to forge a valid token and gain unauthorized access.
    * **Impact:** Authentication bypass, unauthorized access, privilege escalation.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Thoroughly review and test custom middleware functions registered with `bend` for security vulnerabilities.
        * Follow secure coding practices when developing middleware intended for use with `bend`.
        * Ensure middleware correctly handles errors and exceptions within the `bend` pipeline.
        * Consider using well-vetted and established middleware libraries where possible, integrating them through `bend`.

## Attack Surface: [Improper Parameter Handling](./attack_surfaces/improper_parameter_handling.md)

* **Attack Surface: Improper Parameter Handling**
    * **Description:** The application fails to securely handle parameters extracted from requests by `bend`.
    * **How Bend Contributes:** `bend` provides the mechanisms for extracting parameters from various parts of the request (path, query, body). Insecure handling of these parameters *after* extraction by `bend` creates a significant attack surface.
    * **Example:** An application uses a user-provided ID extracted from the URL path by `bend` to directly access a file without proper authorization checks, leading to information disclosure.
    * **Impact:** Information disclosure, unauthorized access to resources, data manipulation.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strict input validation for all parameters extracted by `bend` within your application logic.
        * Avoid directly using raw parameters obtained through `bend` in sensitive operations without sanitization or validation.
        * Use type checking and casting on parameters extracted by `bend` to ensure they are in the expected format.
        * Implement proper authorization checks based on the accessed resource and user context, utilizing parameters handled by `bend`.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfiguration of Middleware Order](./attack_surfaces/misconfiguration_of_middleware_order.md)

* **Attack Surface: Misconfiguration of Middleware Order**
    * **Description:** Incorrect ordering of middleware in the `bend` pipeline leads to security vulnerabilities.
    * **How Bend Contributes:** `bend` allows developers to define the order in which middleware functions are executed. An incorrect order can lead to security middleware being bypassed, directly involving `bend`'s configuration.
    * **Example:** An authentication middleware is registered with `bend` *after* a middleware that handles request processing and resource access, allowing unauthenticated requests to access protected resources.
    * **Impact:** Authentication bypass, unauthorized access.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Carefully plan and document the intended order of middleware execution within your `bend` application.
        * Thoroughly test the middleware chain configured in `bend` to ensure it functions as expected and security checks are enforced.
        * Follow security best practices for middleware ordering (e.g., authentication and authorization early in the `bend` pipeline).
