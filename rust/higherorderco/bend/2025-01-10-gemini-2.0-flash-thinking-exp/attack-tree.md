## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using Bend [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_bend__critical_.md)

**Description:** This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized access, control, or causing significant damage to the application and its data.
*   **Why Critical:** Achieving this node signifies a complete security failure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Bend's Routing Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_bend's_routing_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

**Description:** Targeting weaknesses in how Bend defines, matches, and handles routes. Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized access to different parts of the application.
*   **Why Critical:** Routing is fundamental to web application security, and vulnerabilities here can have widespread impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Bend's Routing Vulnerabilities -> Route Parameter Injection -> Exploit Lack of Sanitization in Route Parameters](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_bend's_routing_vulnerabilities_-_route_parameter_injection_-_exploit_lack_of_sanitization_in_97895610.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate route parameters (data within the URL path) to bypass security checks or access restricted resources. This is possible when the application (or Bend itself) doesn't properly sanitize or validate these parameters.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Lack of input sanitization is a common developer oversight).
*   **Impact:** Medium (Can lead to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or triggering unintended application behavior).
*   **Attack Vector Example:** An application uses a route like `/view/user/{id}`. An attacker could try `/view/user/admin` if the application doesn't validate that the `id` parameter corresponds to a regular user.
*   **Mitigation:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all route parameters. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements if database interaction is involved.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Bend's Middleware Handling [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_bend's_middleware_handling__critical_.md)

**Description:** Targeting weaknesses in how Bend processes and executes middleware functions. Successful exploitation can allow attackers to bypass security checks or inject malicious code into the request/response flow.
*   **Why Critical:** Middleware often handles crucial security functions like authentication and authorization. Bypassing or manipulating it can have severe consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Bend's Middleware Handling -> Middleware Bypass -> Craft requests to skip security middleware due to Bend's processing order or logic](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_bend's_middleware_handling_-_middleware_bypass_-_craft_requests_to_skip_security_middleware__4123242d.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers craft specific HTTP requests designed to circumvent security middleware (like authentication or authorization checks) due to flaws in Bend's middleware execution order or logic.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (The complexity of middleware chains can sometimes lead to logical errors or oversights).
*   **Impact:** High (Successful bypass can grant unauthorized access to sensitive resources or functionalities).
*   **Attack Vector Example:** A vulnerability in Bend's middleware execution might allow a request with a specific header combination to skip the authentication middleware.
*   **Mitigation:** Thoroughly review Bend's middleware execution order. Ensure all critical security middleware is correctly applied to all relevant routes. Implement integration tests to verify middleware behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Bend's Request Handling [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_bend's_request_handling__critical_.md)

**Description:** Targeting vulnerabilities in how Bend processes incoming HTTP requests, including headers and body. Successful exploitation can lead to various attacks like information disclosure, XSS, or denial of service.
*   **Why Critical:** Request handling is the initial point of interaction with the application, making it a prime target for attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Bend's Request Handling -> Header Manipulation Vulnerabilities -> Exploit how Bend parses or handles specific headers (e.g., content-type, custom headers)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_bend's_request_handling_-_header_manipulation_vulnerabilities_-_exploit_how_bend_parses_or_h_ab45a5f0.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate HTTP headers to exploit how Bend parses or handles them. This can lead to vulnerabilities like HTTP Response Splitting or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if header values are not properly sanitized when reflected in responses.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Header manipulation is a common attack vector in web applications).
*   **Impact:** Medium (Can lead to information disclosure, redirection to malicious sites, or execution of malicious scripts in the user's browser).
*   **Attack Vector Example:** Injecting newline characters into a header like `Location` to perform HTTP Response Splitting.
*   **Mitigation:** Ensure Bend (or the application) properly sanitizes and validates header values, especially those that might be reflected in responses. Use secure coding practices to prevent header injection vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Bend's Request Handling -> Cookie Manipulation Issues -> Exploit Bend's cookie handling mechanisms for session fixation or other cookie-based attacks](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_bend's_request_handling_-_cookie_manipulation_issues_-_exploit_bend's_cookie_handling_mechan_406b59a4.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate cookies to exploit weaknesses in how Bend manages cookies. This can lead to session fixation (forcing a user to use a known session ID) or other attacks that compromise user sessions.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (If secure cookie attributes like `HttpOnly` and `Secure` are not enforced or if there are flaws in session management).
*   **Impact:** Medium (Can lead to account takeover or session hijacking).
*   **Attack Vector Example:** Exploiting the lack of the `HttpOnly` flag on a session cookie to access it via client-side JavaScript.
*   **Mitigation:** Ensure Bend enforces secure cookie attributes (`HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite`). Implement robust session management practices and regenerate session IDs after login.
