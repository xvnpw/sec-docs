# Threat Model Analysis for higherorderco/bend

## Threat: [Malicious EDN Input Exploiting Parser Vulnerabilities](./threats/malicious_edn_input_exploiting_parser_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts malicious EDN input, such as deeply nested structures, excessively large strings, or unusual combinations of EDN types, and sends it to an endpoint that uses `bend` to parse the data. This input could exploit vulnerabilities within `bend`'s EDN parsing logic.

**Impact:** Application crashes, unexpected behavior, resource exhaustion leading to denial of service, potential for remote code execution if a critical vulnerability exists in the parser.

**Affected Bend Component:** `bend`'s core EDN parsing logic (likely within the main parsing functions).

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep `bend` updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
*   Implement input validation *before* passing data to `bend`. Define expected data structures and types.
*   Consider using schema validation libraries in conjunction with `bend` to enforce data constraints.
*   Implement timeouts for parsing operations to prevent resource exhaustion from overly complex input.

## Threat: [Denial of Service through Resource Exhaustion via Complex EDN](./threats/denial_of_service_through_resource_exhaustion_via_complex_edn.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends extremely large or deeply nested EDN structures to an endpoint that uses `bend`. The `bend` library attempts to parse this complex data, consuming excessive CPU and memory resources, potentially leading to a denial of service.

**Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive or crashes, impacting availability for legitimate users.

**Affected Bend Component:** `bend`'s core EDN parsing logic.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement request size limits on endpoints that accept EDN data.
*   Set timeouts for parsing operations within `bend` or the surrounding application logic.
*   Implement resource monitoring and alerting to detect and respond to excessive resource consumption.
*   Consider using techniques like pagination or limiting the depth and size of accepted EDN structures.
