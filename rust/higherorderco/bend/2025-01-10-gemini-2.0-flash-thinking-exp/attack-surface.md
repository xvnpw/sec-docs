# Attack Surface Analysis for higherorderco/bend

## Attack Surface: [Component Template Injection](./attack_surfaces/component_template_injection.md)

**Description:** When user-provided data is directly embedded into component templates without proper sanitization or escaping, allowing attackers to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript.

**How Bend Contributes:** Bend's core architecture relies on components with templates for rendering UI. The lack of automatic escaping or developer negligence in handling data within these templates creates a direct pathway for injection attacks.

**Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, or arbitrary actions on behalf of the user.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Utilize Bend's recommended methods for safely rendering dynamic content, ensuring proper escaping of user-provided data within templates.**
* **Sanitize user input before it's passed to components and ultimately rendered in templates.**
* **Implement and enforce a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to limit the impact of any successful XSS attempts.**

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Component Logic Exploiting Bend's Structure](./attack_surfaces/insecure_component_logic_exploiting_bend's_structure.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from flawed logic within Bend components that are exacerbated or made possible by how Bend structures and manages components. This goes beyond general insecure coding and focuses on how Bend's features can be misused.

**How Bend Contributes:** Bend's component lifecycle and data binding mechanisms, if not carefully implemented, can create opportunities for exploitation. For example, if a lifecycle hook performs a sensitive action based on unvalidated data passed through component properties.

**Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, unauthorized access to resources, or even remote code execution depending on the specific vulnerability and how Bend's features are involved.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Thoroughly validate all user inputs within component logic, especially before performing sensitive operations.**
* **Carefully manage component lifecycle hooks and ensure they don't perform actions based on untrusted data without validation.**
* **Follow the principle of least privilege within components, limiting their access to sensitive data and functionalities.**

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side Routing Manipulation Leading to Unauthorized Access](./attack_surfaces/client-side_routing_manipulation_leading_to_unauthorized_access.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in Bend's client-side routing mechanism that allow attackers to bypass intended navigation flows and access protected components or functionalities without proper authorization.

**How Bend Contributes:** Bend's routing system maps URLs to specific components. If this mapping or the logic within route guards is flawed, attackers can manipulate the URL to access areas they shouldn't.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive features or information, potentially leading to privilege escalation or data exposure.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Implement robust authorization checks within components that handle sensitive routes, verifying user permissions before rendering the component.**
* **Ensure that Bend's client-side routing logic is correctly configured and prevents unauthorized navigation through URL manipulation.**
* **For critical functionalities, consider implementing server-side route protection as an additional security layer.**

## Attack Surface: [State Management Vulnerabilities Enabling Malicious Actions](./attack_surfaces/state_management_vulnerabilities_enabling_malicious_actions.md)

**Description:**  If Bend's state management allows for direct or indirect manipulation of sensitive application state in a way that bypasses intended controls, it can enable attackers to perform unauthorized actions or access restricted data.

**How Bend Contributes:** Bend's state management features provide a central way to manage application data. If updates to this state are not properly controlled and validated, attackers can potentially manipulate it to their advantage.

**Impact:** Privilege escalation, data corruption, the ability to trigger unintended application behavior or access restricted functionalities.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Implement strict controls over how the application state can be modified, ensuring that only authorized actions can trigger state changes.**
* **Validate all state updates to prevent malicious or unintended modifications.**
* **Avoid storing highly sensitive information directly in the client-side state without proper encryption and security considerations.**
