# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, named 'bend', aims to simplify the development and deployment of serverless applications, specifically targeting AWS Lambda and API Gateway. It provides a framework and tooling to streamline the serverless workflow, potentially increasing developer productivity and reducing the complexity associated with serverless deployments.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Accelerate serverless application development and deployment cycles.
- Reduce operational overhead associated with serverless infrastructure management.
- Improve developer experience in building and managing serverless applications.
- Enable faster iteration and innovation in serverless environments.
- Potentially reduce infrastructure costs by optimizing serverless deployments.

Business Risks:
- Vendor lock-in to the 'bend' framework, if it becomes tightly coupled with specific versions or features.
- Security vulnerabilities within the 'bend' framework itself could impact all applications built using it.
- Operational risks if the framework introduces complexities or dependencies that are not well understood or documented.
- Adoption risk if developers find the framework too opinionated or difficult to learn.
- Compatibility issues with future AWS service updates or changes in serverless best practices.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) - assumed to be in place, including code reviews and testing, although specific details are not provided in the repository.
- security control: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) - likely used for defining and deploying serverless infrastructure, promoting consistency and auditability.
- security control: Principle of Least Privilege - assumed to be followed in IAM role configurations for Lambda functions and API Gateway.
- security control: Regular dependency updates - assumed to be practiced to address known vulnerabilities in Node.js dependencies.
- security control: Static code analysis - likely used by developers during development, although not explicitly enforced by the project.
- accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions - potential risk of vulnerabilities introduced by external contributors if contributions are not thoroughly vetted.
- accepted risk: Open-source nature - publicly available code might be scrutinized by malicious actors seeking vulnerabilities.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Automated Security Scanning in CI/CD pipeline - Implement SAST and DAST tools to automatically detect vulnerabilities in code and configurations during the build and deployment process.
- security control: Dependency vulnerability scanning - Integrate tools to automatically scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities and alert developers.
- security control: Secrets Management - Implement a secure secrets management solution to avoid hardcoding sensitive information in code or configurations.
- security control: Security training for developers - Provide developers with security training focused on serverless security best practices and common vulnerabilities.
- security control: Penetration testing - Conduct regular penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities in deployed applications and infrastructure.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication:
  - requirement: API Gateway should enforce authentication for all external API endpoints.
  - requirement: Internal components should authenticate each other using secure mechanisms if direct communication is necessary.
- Authorization:
  - requirement: Implement fine-grained authorization controls to ensure users and services only have access to the resources they need.
  - requirement: Lambda functions should operate with the least privilege necessary to perform their tasks, enforced through IAM roles.
- Input Validation:
  - requirement: All external inputs to API Gateway and Lambda functions must be thoroughly validated to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection, cross-site scripting).
  - requirement: Input validation should be performed at multiple layers, both at the API Gateway level and within Lambda functions.
- Cryptography:
  - requirement: Sensitive data at rest should be encrypted using appropriate encryption mechanisms (e.g., KMS for Lambda environment variables, S3 encryption for data storage).
  - requirement: Data in transit should be encrypted using HTTPS for API Gateway and TLS for internal communications where applicable.
  - requirement: Securely manage and rotate cryptographic keys.

Build Process Description:

1. Developer commits and pushes code changes to the GitHub repository.
2. GitHub triggers a GitHub Actions workflow defined in the repository.
3. The workflow executes a series of stages:
    - Build Stage:
        - Checkout Code: Retrieves the latest code changes from the repository.
        - Install Dependencies: Installs necessary project dependencies (e.g., Node.js modules).
        - Build Application: Compiles and builds the application code.
    - Test Stage:
        - Unit Tests: Executes unit tests to verify the functionality of individual components.
        - Integration Tests: Runs integration tests to ensure different parts of the application work together correctly.
    - Security Scan Stage:
        - SAST Scan: Performs Static Application Security Testing to identify potential vulnerabilities in the source code.
        - Dependency Scan: Scans project dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
    - Publish Artifacts Stage:
        - Package Deployment Artifacts: Packages the built application and necessary deployment files into an artifact (e.g., ZIP file).
        - Upload to S3: Uploads the deployment artifact to an S3 bucket, making it ready for deployment.

Build Process Security Controls:
- security control: Secure GitHub repository - Access control to the repository, branch protection, code review process.
- security control: GitHub Actions secrets management - Securely store and manage secrets used in workflows (e.g., AWS credentials).
- security control: Workflow definition in code - Infrastructure as code approach for build and deployment pipelines, version controlled workflow definitions.
- security control: Automated testing - Unit and integration tests to catch functional defects early in the development cycle.
- security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) - Automated SAST tools integrated into the pipeline to identify code-level vulnerabilities.
- security control: Dependency vulnerability scanning - Automated scanning of dependencies to identify and alert on known vulnerabilities.
- security control: Artifact signing (optional) - Signing build artifacts to ensure integrity and authenticity.
- security control: Access control to S3 bucket - Restrict access to the S3 bucket where build artifacts are stored.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- Deployment of serverless applications: The ability to reliably and securely deploy updates and new applications is critical for business agility and innovation.
- Availability of serverless applications: Ensuring the deployed applications are available and performant for end-users is crucial for business operations.
- Data processing within serverless applications: Secure and reliable processing of data by Lambda functions is essential for data integrity and business logic.

Data Sensitivity:
- Application code: Sensitive as it contains business logic and potential vulnerabilities. Confidentiality and integrity are important.
- Environment variables: May contain sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, etc. Confidentiality is critical.
- Application data (if stored in S3): Sensitivity depends on the application. Could be highly sensitive PII, financial data, etc. Confidentiality, integrity, and availability are important.
- Deployment artifacts: Less sensitive but integrity is important to ensure correct and secure deployments.
- Infrastructure configurations (CloudFormation templates): Sensitive as misconfigurations can lead to security vulnerabilities. Integrity and confidentiality are important.
