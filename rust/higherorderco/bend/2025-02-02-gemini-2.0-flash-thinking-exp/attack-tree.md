## Attack Tree Path: [[1.3] Exploit Bend's Default Configurations/Features Misuse:](./attack_tree_paths/_1_3__exploit_bend's_default_configurationsfeatures_misuse.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Exploiting weaknesses arising from how Bend's features are used or misconfigured in the application code.
    *   Targeting common web application vulnerabilities that are made possible or easier due to Bend's architecture or default settings.
    *   Focusing on areas where developer error in using Bend's features can lead to security breaches.

## Attack Tree Path: [[1.3.1] Misuse of Bend's Routing System (Compojure):](./attack_tree_paths/_1_3_1__misuse_of_bend's_routing_system__compojure_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[1.3.1.1] Route Parameter Manipulation for Unauthorized Access:**
        *   Manipulating URL parameters to access resources or functionalities that should be restricted.
        *   Bypassing authorization checks by altering route parameters that are not properly validated or sanitized before being used in authorization decisions.
        *   Example: Changing a user ID in the URL to access another user's profile if authorization is solely based on the parameter without proper session or role verification.

## Attack Tree Path: [[1.3.2] Misuse of Bend's Middleware System:](./attack_tree_paths/_1_3_2__misuse_of_bend's_middleware_system.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[1.3.2.1] Bypassing Security Middleware due to Configuration Errors:**
        *   Exploiting misconfigurations in middleware ordering or application to routes, causing security middleware to not be executed for certain routes.
        *   Circumventing authentication or authorization middleware if it's not correctly applied to all relevant endpoints.
        *   Example: A developer forgets to apply an authentication middleware to a new API endpoint, making it publicly accessible without authentication.
    *   **[1.3.2.3] Middleware Logic Flaws Leading to Authorization or Authentication Bypass:**
        *   Identifying and exploiting logical errors in custom middleware code that handles authentication or authorization.
        *   Bypassing authentication checks due to flaws in the middleware's logic for verifying user credentials or session validity.
        *   Circumventing authorization rules due to errors in the middleware's logic for determining user permissions or roles.
        *   Example: A custom authorization middleware has a flaw in its role-checking logic, allowing users with insufficient privileges to access administrative functions.

## Attack Tree Path: [[1.3.3] Misuse of Bend's Templating (Hiccup) or Rendering Features:](./attack_tree_paths/_1_3_3__misuse_of_bend's_templating__hiccup__or_rendering_features.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[1.3.3.2] Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities due to Improper Output Encoding in Hiccup:**
        *   Injecting malicious JavaScript code into web pages by exploiting improper output encoding when rendering dynamic content using Hiccup templates.
        *   Causing the injected script to execute in the victim's browser, potentially stealing session cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
        *   Occurs when user-controlled input is directly embedded into Hiccup templates without proper escaping or sanitization.

## Attack Tree Path: [[1.3.4] Misuse of Bend's Database Integration (next.jdbc):](./attack_tree_paths/_1_3_4__misuse_of_bend's_database_integration__next_jdbc_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[1.3.4.1] SQL Injection Vulnerabilities via next.jdbc:**
        *   Injecting malicious SQL code into database queries by exploiting improper handling of user input in SQL queries constructed using `next.jdbc`.
        *   Gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data, modifying data, or even executing arbitrary commands on the database server.
        *   Occurs when developers construct SQL queries by directly concatenating user input instead of using parameterized queries or prepared statements provided by `next.jdbc`.

## Attack Tree Path: [[1.3.5] Misuse of Bend's Authentication/Authorization Features (If Implemented):](./attack_tree_paths/_1_3_5__misuse_of_bend's_authenticationauthorization_features__if_implemented_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[1.3.5.2] Flaws in Bend's Authorization Logic or Implementation:**
        *   Exploiting weaknesses in the application's authorization logic, potentially implemented using Bend's features or custom code.
        *   Bypassing authorization checks to access resources or functionalities that should be restricted based on user roles or permissions.
        *   Example: Inconsistent authorization checks across different parts of the application, allowing access through one path while blocking it through another.
    *   **[1.3.5.3] Session Management Vulnerabilities Introduced by Bend Usage:**
        *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in session management practices within a Bend application.
        *   Session fixation, session hijacking, or insufficient session timeouts leading to unauthorized access.
        *   Issues might arise from how Bend is used in conjunction with session management libraries or custom session handling code.

## Attack Tree Path: [[2.4] Vulnerabilities in next.jdbc (Database Library):](./attack_tree_paths/_2_4__vulnerabilities_in_next_jdbc__database_library_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[2.4.1] SQL Injection Vulnerabilities if next.jdbc is Misused (See 1.3.4.1, but also potential next.jdbc library bugs):**
        *   While primarily related to developer misuse (1.3.4.1), there's a theoretical risk of vulnerabilities within the `next.jdbc` library itself that could lead to SQL injection if exploited.
        *   This is less likely than developer misuse but should be considered as part of a comprehensive threat model, especially if using older or unpatched versions of `next.jdbc`.
