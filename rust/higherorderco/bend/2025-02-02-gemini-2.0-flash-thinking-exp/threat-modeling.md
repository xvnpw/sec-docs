# Threat Model Analysis for higherorderco/bend

## Threat: [Schema Injection](./threats/schema_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker injects malicious schema definitions through dynamic configuration or extension points in Bend. They could modify the data model to bypass security checks, gain broader access, or disrupt application functionality. This is directly related to how Bend handles data model configuration and potential extensibility features.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, privilege escalation, data corruption, denial of service, application instability.
    *   **Bend Component Affected:** Data Model Configuration, Plugin System (if applicable)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid dynamic schema modifications based on user input if possible.
        *   If dynamic schema modifications are necessary, strictly validate and sanitize all input used for schema definition.
        *   Implement strong input validation and sanitization for configuration files or plugin inputs.
        *   Regularly audit and review schema configurations for unexpected changes.

## Threat: [Mass Assignment Vulnerability](./threats/mass_assignment_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker sends malicious API requests with extra parameters to modify data attributes they are not authorized to change. They leverage automatically generated API endpoints by Bend that directly map request parameters to data model attributes without proper filtering. This is a direct consequence of Bend's API generation approach.
    *   **Impact:** Data manipulation, privilege escalation, unauthorized modification of sensitive attributes.
    *   **Bend Component Affected:** API Generation, Request Handling
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Disable or restrict mass assignment globally if possible within Bend's configuration.
        *   Implement attribute whitelisting for API endpoints within Bend's data model definition or API configuration to explicitly define allowed modifiable attributes.
        *   Utilize Bend's features (if available) to control data binding and validation.
        *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user inputs before data binding, even when using Bend's generated APIs.

## Threat: [Insufficient Input Validation in APIs (Bend Generated)](./threats/insufficient_input_validation_in_apis__bend_generated_.md)

They can gain unauthorized access to sensitive functionalities or data due to Bend's initial setup.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, privilege escalation, data breaches, system compromise.
    *   **Bend Component Affected:** API Generation, Default Configuration, Setup Process
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Review and harden default API configurations *provided by Bend* before deployment.
        *   Ensure all sensitive endpoints generated by Bend require authentication and authorization.
        *   Disable or restrict access to debugging or administrative endpoints generated by Bend in production.
        *   Consult Bend's documentation for security hardening guidelines specific to its default configurations.

## Threat: [Weak Default Authentication/Authorization (Bend Provided)](./threats/weak_default_authenticationauthorization__bend_provided_.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker exploits weak or insecure default authentication/authorization mechanisms *provided directly by Bend*. This could involve weak algorithms, insecure storage, or bypassable implementations inherent in Bend's built-in security features.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, account compromise, privilege escalation, data breaches.
    *   **Bend Component Affected:** Authentication Module (Bend's built-in), Authorization Module (Bend's built-in)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using *Bend's default* authentication/authorization mechanisms if they are weak or insufficient for your security requirements.
        *   If using Bend's built-in features, configure them to use strong authentication methods and algorithms.
        *   Ensure Bend's default credential storage (if any) is secure and meets security best practices.
        *   Implement robust authorization checks and role-based access control using Bend's authorization features, ensuring they are correctly configured and enforced.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Code Generation Logic (Bend's Engine)](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_code_generation_logic__bend's_engine_.md)

*   **Description:** Flaws in *Bend's code generation logic itself* lead to insecure code being generated. This could introduce vulnerabilities like SQL Injection, XSS, or other code-level flaws in the application due to errors in Bend's core functionality.
    *   **Impact:** Code injection vulnerabilities, data breaches, application compromise, denial of service.
    *   **Bend Component Affected:** Code Generation Engine, Templating Engine (if used by Bend for code generation)
