## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation in Bend Handlers](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation_in_bend_handlers.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Strict Input Validation in Bend Handlers
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Input Points in Handlers:**  Within each `bend` handler function, pinpoint all sources of user-provided input. This includes data accessed via `req.params`, `req.query`, `req.headers`, and `req.body` (if body parsing is enabled, often implicitly by `bend` or underlying middleware).
    2.  **Define Validation Rules for Handler Inputs:** For every input identified in step 1, establish rigorous validation rules. These rules should specify expected data types, formats, lengths, allowed character sets, and value ranges. Utilize validation libraries (like Joi or express-validator, which can be integrated into a Bend application) to define these rules declaratively.
    3.  **Implement Validation Logic within Bend Handlers:**  Directly within your `bend` handler functions, implement the validation logic using the defined rules and chosen validation library.  Crucially, perform validation *before* any processing or database interaction occurs using the input data.
    4.  **Handle Validation Errors in Bend Handlers:**  When validation fails within a `bend` handler, implement proper error handling. Return informative HTTP error responses (e.g., 400 Bad Request) to the client, clearly indicating the validation errors. Avoid exposing internal server details in these error responses.
    5.  **Sanitize Inputs in Bend Handlers (If Necessary):** If input requires sanitization (e.g., to prevent XSS when rendering user-provided content), perform sanitization *after* successful validation and *before* using the input in any output context. Exercise caution with sanitization to avoid unintended side effects or bypasses.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Injection Attacks (SQL, NoSQL, Command Injection, etc.) (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious code or commands through unvalidated input processed by `bend` handlers.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Medium to High Severity):** Reduces the risk of XSS by validating and potentially sanitizing user-provided data handled within `bend` handlers that might be rendered in web pages.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues (Medium Severity):** Ensures data processed by `bend` handlers conforms to expected formats and constraints, preventing data corruption and application logic errors.
*   **Impact:** Significantly reduces the risk of input-related vulnerabilities within the application logic defined by `bend` handlers. Enhances data integrity and application stability.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Some handlers might have basic validation, but consistent and robust validation across all `bend` handlers is likely missing.  Usage of dedicated validation libraries within handlers might be inconsistent.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Needs to be implemented consistently across *all* `bend` handler functions. Standardize on a validation library for use within handlers. Conduct a review of existing handlers to ensure comprehensive input validation is in place, specifically within the context of how `bend` processes requests.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Development and Review of Custom Bend Middleware](./mitigation_strategies/secure_development_and_review_of_custom_bend_middleware.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Development and Review of Custom Bend Middleware
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Apply Secure Coding Practices to Bend Middleware:** When developing custom middleware for your `bend` application, strictly adhere to secure coding principles.  Avoid common vulnerabilities such as injection flaws, insecure session management, improper authentication/authorization, and inadequate error handling within your middleware logic.
    2.  **Minimize Complexity of Bend Middleware:** Keep custom `bend` middleware functions focused and as simple as possible. Complex middleware is inherently more difficult to review for security vulnerabilities and increases the likelihood of introducing errors.
    3.  **Implement Input Validation in Bend Middleware (If Applicable):** If your custom `bend` middleware handles user input (e.g., parsing custom headers, processing specific request formats before handlers), apply input validation directly within the middleware. This ensures data integrity early in the request processing pipeline *before* it reaches your `bend` handlers.
    4.  **Conduct Security-Focused Code Reviews for Bend Middleware:** Subject all custom `bend` middleware code to thorough code reviews by developers with security expertise. Specifically focus on identifying potential vulnerabilities introduced by the middleware and ensuring adherence to secure coding practices relevant to middleware in a `bend` application.
    5.  **Perform Security Testing of Bend Middleware:**  Test custom `bend` middleware both independently (unit tests) and integrated within the application (integration tests) to identify and address any security issues. Include test cases that specifically target potential vulnerabilities in the middleware's logic and data handling.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Introduction of Vulnerabilities through Custom Bend Middleware Code (High to Medium Severity):** Prevents developers from unintentionally introducing security vulnerabilities through poorly written or insecure custom middleware that is part of the `bend` application's request processing flow.
    *   **Logic Flaws in Bend Middleware (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of logic errors within custom `bend` middleware that could lead to unexpected application behavior, security bypasses, or denial-of-service conditions.
*   **Impact:** Significantly reduces the risk of introducing vulnerabilities through custom middleware used in `bend` applications. Improves the overall security and reliability of the request processing pipeline.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Code reviews are likely conducted for general code quality, but dedicated security-focused reviews specifically targeting custom `bend` middleware might not be consistently performed. Security testing of middleware, especially for vulnerability detection, might be lacking.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Establish a formal security review process specifically for all custom `bend` middleware. Integrate security testing as a mandatory part of the middleware development lifecycle. Provide developers with security training focused on secure middleware development within the `bend` framework.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Custom Error Handling in Bend Applications for Information Disclosure Prevention](./mitigation_strategies/custom_error_handling_in_bend_applications_for_information_disclosure_prevention.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Custom Error Handling in Bend Applications for Information Disclosure Prevention
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement a Global Error Handler in Bend:** Create a global error handling mechanism within your `bend` application to catch unhandled exceptions and errors that might occur during request processing within `bend` handlers or middleware.  This can be achieved by using Express.js error handling mechanisms that `bend` utilizes under the hood, or by wrapping your main `bend` application logic in a try-catch block.
    2.  **Securely Log Detailed Errors (Server-Side):** In your global error handler, log detailed error information (including stack traces, error messages, request details, and potentially user context) to a secure, server-side logging system. This detailed information is crucial for debugging, monitoring, and security incident analysis. Ensure these logs are stored securely and access is restricted.
    3.  **Return Generic Error Responses to Clients (Client-Side):** For error responses sent back to clients (e.g., web browsers, API consumers), return generic, non-revealing error messages. For example, use messages like "An unexpected error occurred" or "Server error."  Avoid exposing sensitive information such as stack traces, internal file paths, configuration details, or database error messages in client-facing error responses. Use appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error) to indicate the general error type without revealing specifics.
    4.  **Test Bend Application Error Handling:** Thoroughly test various error scenarios within your `bend` application, including errors in handlers, middleware, and during data processing. Verify that sensitive information is *not* leaked in client-facing error responses and that detailed error information is correctly and securely logged server-side.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure through Error Messages (Medium Severity):** Prevents attackers from gaining sensitive information about the `bend` application's internal workings, configuration, or code structure by analyzing overly verbose or detailed error messages returned to clients. This information could be used to plan more targeted attacks.
*   **Impact:** Significantly reduces the risk of information disclosure through error messages in `bend` applications. Protects sensitive internal details of the application from being exposed to unauthorized parties.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic error handling might be present in the application, but it might not be specifically configured to prevent information disclosure. Default error responses from Express.js (used by `bend`) might inadvertently expose too much information.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Implement a robust global error handler within the `bend` application that is specifically designed to prevent information disclosure in client-facing error responses. Review existing error handling configurations to ensure they adhere to this principle and customize error responses to be generic and safe for public exposure.
