### Bend Application High and Critical Threats Directly Involving Bend

This list details high and critical security threats that directly involve the `bend` library (https://github.com/higherorderco/bend).

*   **Threat:** Client-Side Cache Tampering
    *   **Description:** An attacker, with access to the user's browser or device, directly modifies the data stored in `bend`'s client-side cache (e.g., using browser developer tools, local storage manipulation). This allows them to alter data values, add or remove entries, or even inject malicious data. This directly exploits how `bend` persists data on the client.
    *   **Impact:** The application might display incorrect information, make flawed decisions based on tampered data, bypass client-side validation, or potentially expose sensitive information based on the manipulated cache state.
    *   **Affected Component:** `bend`'s Cache Module (specifically the client-side storage mechanism used by `bend`, such as `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement integrity checks on cached data managed by `bend`.
        *   Consider encrypting sensitive data stored in `bend`'s cache.
        *   Avoid relying solely on client-side cached data managed by `bend` for critical security decisions or authorization.
        *   Implement server-side validation to verify data integrity, regardless of `bend`'s cache state.

*   **Threat:** Cache Poisoning via Manipulated API Responses
    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts or manipulates responses from the backend API before they reach the client and are stored in `bend`'s cache. This could be achieved through Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks or by compromising the API itself. The manipulated response contains malicious or incorrect data that `bend` then caches and serves. This directly impacts `bend`'s role in data management.
    *   **Impact:** The application displays incorrect or malicious data to the user, potentially leading to phishing attacks, redirection to malicious sites, or triggering client-side vulnerabilities (if the injected data contains malicious scripts).
    *   **Affected Component:** `bend`'s Data Fetching and Cache Invalidation Logic (the part that handles storing data from API responses into `bend`'s cache).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce HTTPS to prevent MITM attacks, protecting data flowing to `bend`.
        *   Implement robust server-side validation of all API responses *before* they are processed and potentially cached by `bend`.
        *   Use Subresource Integrity (SRI) for any external resources loaded by the application, though this is less directly related to `bend` itself.
        *   Consider implementing response signing or verification mechanisms that `bend` could potentially use to validate cached data.

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Data through Unintended Caching
    *   **Description:** Developers might inadvertently configure `bend` to cache sensitive information that should not be stored on the client-side or for longer than necessary. This could include personal data, API keys, or other confidential information, directly leveraging `bend`'s caching capabilities.
    *   **Impact:** If an attacker gains access to the user's browser or device, they could potentially retrieve this sensitive information from `bend`'s cache.
    *   **Affected Component:** `bend`'s Cache Configuration (how developers configure what data is cached and for how long within `bend`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully review what data is being cached by `bend` and its sensitivity.
        *   Avoid caching sensitive information on the client-side using `bend` if possible.
        *   If caching is necessary with `bend`, use appropriate encryption and set short cache expiration times within `bend`'s configuration.
        *   Implement proper access controls and security measures for client-side storage, understanding how `bend` utilizes it.
