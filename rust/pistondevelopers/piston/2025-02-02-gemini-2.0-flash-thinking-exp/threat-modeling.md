# Threat Model Analysis for pistondevelopers/piston

## Threat: [Malicious Assets Exploiting Piston's Asset Handling](./threats/malicious_assets_exploiting_piston's_asset_handling.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts malicious assets (images, sounds, models, etc.) specifically designed to exploit vulnerabilities within Piston's asset loading and processing modules or its underlying dependencies. By providing these crafted assets, the attacker aims to trigger memory corruption, buffer overflows, or code execution when Piston attempts to load and process them. This could occur when loading game assets from untrusted sources or user-generated content.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine, allowing the attacker to gain full control of the system. Data breaches, installation of malware, and complete system compromise are possible.

**Affected Piston Component:** `piston_image`, `piston_audio`, `piston_obj` (or other asset loading modules used by Piston), and underlying image/audio decoding libraries used as dependencies.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Prioritize loading assets only from trusted and verified sources.** Avoid loading assets from untrusted origins or user-generated content without rigorous security measures.
*   **Implement robust asset validation and sanitization *before* using Piston to load them.** This should include checks for file format validity, expected data structures, and known malicious patterns. Consider using dedicated asset validation libraries.
*   **Keep Piston and *all* its dependencies, especially image and audio decoding libraries, updated to the latest versions.** Regularly check for security updates and apply them promptly to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   **Consider sandboxing asset loading processes.** Isolate the asset loading functionality in a restricted environment to limit the impact of a successful exploit.

## Threat: [Path Traversal Vulnerability in Piston's Asset Loading](./threats/path_traversal_vulnerability_in_piston's_asset_loading.md)

**Description:** A vulnerability exists within Piston's asset loading functions that allows an attacker to bypass intended directory restrictions. By providing manipulated file paths, an attacker can trick Piston into loading assets from outside the designated asset directories. This could enable access to sensitive files on the system or even the loading of malicious executable code from unexpected locations.

**Impact:**  Access to sensitive system files, potentially leading to information disclosure or privilege escalation. In severe cases, if an attacker can load and execute code from outside the intended asset paths, it could result in arbitrary code execution.

**Affected Piston Component:**  File system access functions within Piston's asset loading modules, potentially affecting any module that loads files based on paths (`piston_image`, `piston_audio`, custom asset loading logic using Piston APIs).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Enforce strict whitelisting of allowed asset directories.** Configure Piston or the application to only load assets from explicitly defined and controlled directories.
*   **Thoroughly sanitize and validate all file paths *before* passing them to Piston's asset loading functions.**  Ensure that paths are canonicalized and do not contain path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`).
*   **Avoid using user-provided or externally influenced paths directly for asset loading.** If user input is involved, carefully validate and sanitize it before constructing asset paths.
*   **Regularly audit and review Piston's code and configuration related to file path handling.** Look for potential weaknesses in path validation and access control.

## Threat: [Shader Vulnerabilities Exploiting Piston's Shader Handling](./threats/shader_vulnerabilities_exploiting_piston's_shader_handling.md)

**Description:** If Piston applications utilize custom shaders or allow loading shaders from external sources, vulnerabilities in Piston's shader loading or management could be exploited. A malicious shader, when processed by Piston and the underlying graphics driver, could trigger vulnerabilities in the shader compiler or driver itself. This could lead to memory corruption, driver crashes, or potentially even escalate to code execution depending on the specific vulnerability and graphics stack.

**Impact:** Application crash, rendering glitches, graphics driver instability, denial of service. In the worst-case scenario, it could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution if a shader vulnerability can be leveraged to compromise the graphics driver or system.

**Affected Piston Component:** `piston_graphics` (shader loading, compilation, and management), interaction with the underlying graphics API (OpenGL, Vulkan) and graphics drivers.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Avoid loading shaders from untrusted or external sources if possible.**  Restrict shader usage to internally developed and thoroughly vetted shaders.
*   **If loading external shaders is necessary, implement strict shader validation and sanitization.** Use shader validation tools and techniques to detect potentially malicious or malformed shader code before loading it into Piston.
*   **Keep graphics drivers updated to the latest versions.** Driver updates often include security patches that address shader-related vulnerabilities.
*   **Consider shader sandboxing or isolation techniques.** If feasible, run shader compilation and execution in a restricted environment to limit the impact of potential exploits.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Piston's Libraries](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_piston's_libraries.md)

**Description:** Piston relies on various external libraries for core functionalities (e.g., SDL2 for windowing and input, image/audio libraries). These dependencies may contain known security vulnerabilities. If Piston uses vulnerable versions of these libraries, applications built with Piston become indirectly vulnerable. Attackers can exploit these dependency vulnerabilities through a Piston application to compromise the system.

**Impact:**  Wide range of impacts depending on the specific vulnerability in the dependency. This can include arbitrary code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, or privilege escalation. The impact severity is dictated by the most critical vulnerability present in Piston's dependencies.

**Affected Piston Component:** Indirectly affects various Piston modules that rely on vulnerable dependencies. Examples include modules relying on `sdl2`, image decoding libraries, audio libraries, etc.

**Risk Severity:** Critical (depending on the severity of vulnerabilities in dependencies)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Maintain a comprehensive and up-to-date inventory of Piston's dependencies.**  Use dependency management tools to track all direct and transitive dependencies.
*   **Regularly scan Piston's dependencies for known vulnerabilities using vulnerability scanning tools.** Integrate dependency scanning into the development and build pipeline.
*   **Keep Piston and *all* its dependencies updated to the latest versions with security patches.** Prioritize updating dependencies with known critical vulnerabilities.
*   **Follow security advisories and vulnerability databases related to Piston's dependencies.** Stay informed about newly discovered vulnerabilities and apply patches promptly.
*   **Consider using static analysis tools to detect potential vulnerabilities arising from dependency usage within the application code.**
