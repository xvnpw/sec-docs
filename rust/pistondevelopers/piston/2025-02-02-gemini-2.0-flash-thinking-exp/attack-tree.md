## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Piston Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_piston_exploitation.md)

Description: This is the root goal of the attacker. It encompasses all potential attack vectors that leverage weaknesses in the Piston game engine or applications built upon it.

Attack Vectors (Summarized from Sub-Tree):
*   Exploiting vulnerabilities within the Piston library itself.
*   Exploiting flaws in the application's logic that are made possible or easier by using Piston features.
*   Directly causing Denial of Service by abusing Piston's functionalities.

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Piston Library Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_piston_library_vulnerabilities.md)

Description: This category focuses on attacks that directly target vulnerabilities within the Piston game engine code or its immediate interfaces.

Attack Vectors (Summarized from Sub-Tree):
*   **1.1. Input Handling Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting weaknesses in how Piston and the application process user input (keyboard, mouse, gamepad events).
*   **1.4. Resource Management Vulnerabilities:** Triggering memory leaks or CPU spikes through specific usage patterns of Piston APIs.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. Input Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__input_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

Description:  Focuses on vulnerabilities arising from the processing of user input within Piston applications. Input handling is a common area for security issues in many types of applications.

High-Risk Paths:
*   **1.1.1. Input Injection Attack:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Crafting malicious input (e.g., specific keyboard or mouse event sequences) and injecting it into the application.
    *   **Exploitation:** If the application doesn't properly validate or sanitize input, attackers can manipulate game logic, bypass intended mechanics, or even cause application crashes by sending unexpected or malformed input.
*   **1.1.3. Logic Flaws in Input Processing:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Identifying and exploiting logical errors or unhandled edge cases in the application's input processing logic (event handlers).
    *   **Exploitation:** By sending specific sequences of inputs that trigger these logic flaws, attackers can achieve unintended behaviors, gain unfair advantages in games, or cause unexpected application states.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.4. Resource Management Vulnerabilities (Memory Leaks, CPU Spikes)](./attack_tree_paths/1_4__resource_management_vulnerabilities__memory_leaks__cpu_spikes_.md)

Description: This category targets vulnerabilities related to how Piston applications manage system resources like memory and CPU. Resource exhaustion can lead to Denial of Service.

High-Risk Paths:
*   **1.4.1. Trigger Memory Leaks via Specific Piston API Usage:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Identifying specific sequences of Piston API calls or usage patterns within the application that lead to memory leaks.
    *   **Exploitation:** Repeatedly triggering these vulnerable API sequences can cause the application to gradually consume more and more memory, eventually leading to memory exhaustion, application slowdown, or crashes (Denial of Service).
*   **1.4.2. Cause CPU Spikes via Intensive Piston Operations:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Identifying CPU-intensive operations within Piston (e.g., complex physics calculations, pathfinding if used by the application) and finding ways to trigger these operations excessively.
    *   **Exploitation:** By forcing the application to perform these CPU-intensive operations repeatedly or in a maximized manner, attackers can cause CPU starvation, making the application unresponsive and effectively leading to Denial of Service.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2. Resource Exhaustion via Rendering](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2__resource_exhaustion_via_rendering.md)

Attack Vector: Identifying resource-intensive rendering operations in the application (e.g., drawing many objects, complex shaders, particle effects) and triggering actions that force the application to perform these operations excessively.

Exploitation: By overloading the rendering pipeline (CPU and/or GPU), attackers can cause resource exhaustion, leading to application unresponsiveness, frame rate drops, or complete Denial of Service.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.2. Event Queue Flooding](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_2__event_queue_flooding.md)

Attack Vector: Identifying the event handling mechanisms in the Piston application and generating a large volume of events (input events, window events, etc.) rapidly.

Exploitation: By flooding the event queue with a massive number of events, attackers can overwhelm the application's event processing system, causing it to become unresponsive or crash, resulting in Denial of Service.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Application Logic Flaws Leveraging Piston Features](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_application_logic_flaws_leveraging_piston_features.md)

Description: This category focuses on vulnerabilities that are not directly in Piston itself, but rather in the application's own logic, which is built using Piston features. Piston provides tools and APIs, and vulnerabilities can arise from how developers use these tools.

High-Risk Paths:
*   **2.1. Game Logic Exploits via Input Manipulation (Building on 1.1.1):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Understanding the game rules and logic implemented using Piston and crafting specific input sequences to exploit weaknesses or exploitable logic in these rules. This builds upon basic input injection but targets higher-level game logic.
    *   **Exploitation:** Attackers can gain unfair advantages in games (cheating), bypass intended game mechanics, skip levels, or achieve unintended outcomes by manipulating game state through carefully crafted input.
*   **2.2. Resource Abuse via Game Mechanics (Building on 1.2.2 & 1.4):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Identifying resource-intensive game mechanics (e.g., particle effects, complex simulations, AI calculations) and triggering these mechanics in a way that maximizes resource consumption.
    *   **Exploitation:** By abusing game mechanics, attackers can cause Denial of Service or significant performance degradation, especially in multiplayer games where this can affect other players as well.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Denial of Service by Abusing Piston Features](./attack_tree_paths/3__denial_of_service_by_abusing_piston_features.md)

Description: This category specifically focuses on Denial of Service attacks that are achieved by directly abusing features provided by the Piston game engine.

High-Risk Paths:
*   **3.1. Resource Exhaustion via Asset Loading:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Identifying asset loading mechanisms in the Piston application and requesting or triggering the loading of extremely large or numerous assets.
    *   **Exploitation:** By forcing the application to load excessive assets, attackers can cause memory exhaustion, slowdowns, or long startup times, leading to Denial of Service or a severely degraded user experience.
*   **3.2. Excessive Event Generation (Building on 1.3.2):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Identifying event generation triggers in the application (e.g., rapid input, window resizing events) and generating events at an extremely high rate. This is a more direct way to flood the event queue.
    *   **Exploitation:** Overwhelming the event handling system with a flood of events leads to application unresponsiveness and Denial of Service.
