# BUSINESS POSTURE

The Piston Game Engine project aims to provide a modular, open-source 2D game engine written in Rust. Its primary goal is to empower game developers with a flexible and efficient toolset for creating games. The project prioritizes modularity and modern Rust practices, targeting developers who value control and performance in their game development process.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Provide a robust and feature-rich 2D game engine.
- Foster an active and supportive open-source community around the engine.
- Encourage adoption of the engine by game developers for various projects.
- Maintain high code quality and performance.
- Offer a modular and extensible architecture.

Business Risks:
- Security vulnerabilities in the engine could lead to exploitation in games built with Piston, damaging the reputation of the engine and potentially affecting end-users.
- Lack of security awareness within the development community could result in insecure coding practices and vulnerabilities being introduced into the engine.
- Dependency vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by Piston could be exploited.
- Inadequate input validation in the engine could lead to crashes or unexpected behavior in games.
- Insufficient security testing could result in vulnerabilities being missed before release.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: GitHub repository with version control and history. (Implemented: GitHub)
- security control: Issue tracking system for reporting bugs and potential vulnerabilities. (Implemented: GitHub Issues)
- security control: Community contributions and peer review through pull requests. (Implemented: GitHub Pull Requests)
- security control: Basic automated testing as part of CI using GitHub Actions. (Implemented: GitHub Actions, see `.github/workflows` in repository)

Accepted Risks:
- accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability identification and patching.
- accepted risk: Limited dedicated security expertise within the project.
- accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities to be present in dependencies.
- accepted risk: Security testing might be less comprehensive compared to commercial software.

Recommended Security Controls:
- recommended security control: Implement automated dependency scanning to identify and alert on vulnerable dependencies.
- recommended security control: Integrate static analysis security testing (SAST) tools into the CI pipeline to automatically detect potential code-level vulnerabilities.
- recommended security control: Introduce security focused code reviews, specifically looking for common vulnerability patterns.
- recommended security control: Establish a process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities, including a security policy and contact information.
- recommended security control: Consider performing penetration testing or security audits, especially before major releases.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication: Not directly applicable to the game engine itself, as it's a library/framework. Authentication might be relevant for any associated services or websites (not part of this project scope).
- Authorization: Not directly applicable to the game engine itself. Authorization might be relevant in the context of game development tools built on top of Piston, but not within the engine core.
- Input Validation: Critical for all engine APIs that accept external input (e.g., file loading, network input, user input). All input from external sources must be validated to prevent crashes, unexpected behavior, and potential vulnerabilities like buffer overflows or injection attacks.
- Cryptography: May be required for game features like saving game state securely, implementing secure networking in games, or handling sensitive data within games built using Piston. If cryptography is used, it must be implemented correctly using well-vetted libraries and best practices to avoid vulnerabilities.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes to Protect:
- Providing a functional and reliable game engine: The core business process is to ensure the engine works as expected and is free from critical bugs and vulnerabilities that could prevent developers from using it effectively or lead to issues in games built with it.
- Maintaining the integrity of the engine codebase: Protecting the source code from unauthorized modifications or malicious insertions is crucial to ensure the engine remains trustworthy and secure.
- Ensuring the availability of the engine: The engine and its documentation should be accessible to developers when needed.

Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
- Source code of the Piston Game Engine: High sensitivity. Intellectual property and potential vulnerabilities are exposed if compromised.
- Build artifacts (libraries, binaries): Medium sensitivity. Compromised build artifacts could be distributed to developers, potentially introducing vulnerabilities into their games.
- Project documentation: Low to medium sensitivity. Documentation vulnerabilities could mislead developers or expose non-critical information.
- Developer accounts and credentials: High sensitivity. Compromised developer accounts could lead to unauthorized code changes or malicious actions.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What is the process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities in Piston? Is there a security policy or dedicated contact?
- Are there any plans to implement more advanced security testing, such as penetration testing or security audits?
- What is the strategy for managing dependencies and ensuring they are free from vulnerabilities?
- Are there any specific security requirements or compliance standards that Piston needs to adhere to (e.g., for game distribution platforms)?
- Is there a formal security awareness training for contributors to the project?

Assumptions:
- The primary users of Piston are game developers who are building 2D games.
- The project is open-source and community-driven, relying on community contributions for development and security.
- The project uses GitHub for version control, issue tracking, and CI/CD.
- Security is considered important for the project, but resources and expertise might be limited due to its open-source nature.
- The deployment environment primarily considered is the developer's local machine for development and testing. Games built with Piston are deployed to various platforms by game developers, which is outside the direct scope of the engine's deployment.
