# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for pistondevelopers/piston

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Sanitization for Resource Paths (Piston Asset Loading)](./mitigation_strategies/input_sanitization_for_resource_paths__piston_asset_loading_.md)

**Description:**
1.  Identify all locations in your game code where you use Piston's asset loading APIs (e.g., functions that load textures, sounds, or other assets based on file paths).
2.  Before passing any file path to Piston's asset loading functions, implement a sanitization function. This is crucial when paths are derived from user input, configuration files, or network data.
3.  The sanitization function should:
    *   Check for directory traversal sequences like `../` or `..\\` which could allow access outside intended asset directories.
    *   Validate that the path is relative and does not start with a `/` or `\` indicating an absolute path.
    *   Ensure the path only contains allowed characters (alphanumeric, underscores, hyphens, periods, and directory separators as needed).
4.  If the path fails sanitization, log an error and prevent Piston from loading the resource. Use a default or safe fallback asset instead.
5.  Always resolve paths relative to a secure, predefined base directory for your game assets when using Piston's loading functions.
**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   Path Traversal Vulnerability via Piston Asset Loading - Severity: High
    *   Attackers could potentially exploit vulnerabilities in how Piston handles file paths during asset loading to access or load files outside the intended game asset directories, potentially leading to sensitive file access or unexpected game behavior.
**Impact:**
*   Path Traversal Vulnerability via Piston Asset Loading: High Risk Reduction
    *   Effectively prevents path traversal attacks specifically through Piston's asset loading mechanisms by ensuring only sanitized and valid resource paths are processed by Piston.
**Currently Implemented:** No - Currently, asset paths used with Piston loading functions are not sanitized, making the application potentially vulnerable to path traversal if paths are derived from external sources.
**Missing Implementation:**  Sanitization needs to be implemented in the asset loading module, specifically before any path is passed to Piston's asset loading functions. This should be applied wherever asset paths originate from external or potentially untrusted sources.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Whitelisting for Piston Asset Loading](./mitigation_strategies/resource_whitelisting_for_piston_asset_loading.md)

**Description:**
1.  Create a whitelist of allowed asset file names or directory paths that your game is permitted to load using Piston's asset loading APIs. This whitelist can be defined in a configuration file, a hardcoded list within your code, or generated dynamically based on your game's asset requirements.
2.  Before using Piston to load any asset, check if the requested resource path is present in your defined whitelist.
3.  If the resource path is not found in the whitelist, prevent Piston from loading the asset and log an error. Use a default or safe fallback asset instead.
4.  Regularly review and update the whitelist whenever you add new assets to your game or change your asset loading structure to ensure it remains accurate and secure.
**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   Unauthorized Resource Loading via Piston - Severity: Medium
    *   Prevents the game from loading unexpected or malicious asset files through Piston's loading mechanisms, even if they are present in accessible directories. This reduces the risk of loading manipulated or replaced assets.
**Impact:**
*   Unauthorized Resource Loading via Piston: Medium Risk Reduction
    *   Significantly reduces the attack surface related to Piston's asset loading by strictly limiting the assets that can be loaded to a predefined and controlled set.
**Currently Implemented:** No - The application currently relies on directory structure and file extensions for asset management when using Piston, but not a strict whitelist enforced before Piston loading.
**Missing Implementation:**  A resource whitelisting mechanism needs to be implemented and integrated directly before any asset loading call to Piston. This should act as a gatekeeper, ensuring only whitelisted assets are passed to Piston for loading.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization for Piston Events](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization_for_piston_events.md)

**Description:**
1.  Identify all event handlers in your game code that process events provided by Piston (e.g., keyboard events, mouse events, window events).
2.  Within these event handlers, implement validation and sanitization for relevant event data before using it in your game logic.
3.  For example, for keyboard input:
    *   Validate key codes to ensure they are within expected ranges or belong to allowed sets of keys.
    *   Sanitize text input from keyboard events to prevent injection of unexpected characters or control sequences if you are directly processing text input from Piston events.
4.  For mouse input:
    *   Validate mouse coordinates to ensure they are within the expected game window bounds.
    *   Sanitize mouse button events to prevent unexpected button combinations or sequences if your game logic relies on specific button patterns from Piston events.
5.  Handle invalid or sanitized event data gracefully. Either ignore the invalid event data or process the sanitized version in a safe manner within your game logic.
**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   Logic Errors due to Unexpected Piston Events - Severity: Medium
    *   Prevents game logic from breaking or behaving unexpectedly due to malformed or out-of-range data within Piston events. Unexpected event data could be caused by input glitches or, in more advanced scenarios, by input manipulation if the game receives input from external sources.
*   Crashes due to Piston Event Handling Errors - Severity: Medium
    *   Reduces the risk of crashes caused by improperly handled data within Piston events in your game's event handlers.
**Impact:**
*   Logic Errors due to Unexpected Piston Events: Medium Risk Reduction
    *   Improves the stability and predictability of game logic that relies on Piston events.
*   Crashes due to Piston Event Handling Errors: Medium Risk Reduction
    *   Enhances the robustness of game event handling and user experience when interacting with the game through Piston events.
**Currently Implemented:** Partial - Basic event handling is implemented using Piston events, but comprehensive validation and sanitization of event data within event handlers are likely missing.
**Missing Implementation:**  Systematic review and implementation of input validation and sanitization are needed within all event handlers that process Piston events throughout the game code. Focus on validating and sanitizing data *extracted from* Piston events before using it in game logic.
