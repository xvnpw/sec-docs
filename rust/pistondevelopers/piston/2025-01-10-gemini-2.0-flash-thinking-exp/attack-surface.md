# Attack Surface Analysis for pistondevelopers/piston

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Shader Injection](./attack_surfaces/malicious_shader_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious shader code (GLSL, HLSL, etc.) that is then loaded and executed by the graphics processing unit (GPU).
    *   **How Piston Contributes to the Attack Surface:** If Piston's API or design allows applications to load and compile shaders from external sources or user-provided input without sufficient safeguards, it directly contributes to this attack surface. This includes how Piston handles shader loading requests and interacts with the underlying graphics API for compilation.
    *   **Example:** An application using Piston allows users to load custom shader effects. A malicious user provides a specially crafted shader file that, when processed by Piston and compiled, causes the graphics driver to crash, leaks sensitive information from the GPU, or potentially allows for arbitrary code execution on the GPU (depending on driver vulnerabilities).
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (GPU crash), information disclosure (reading GPU memory), potential system compromise (through driver vulnerabilities).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid allowing the loading of shaders from untrusted or external sources.
        *   If dynamic shader loading is absolutely necessary, implement extremely strict validation and sanitization of shader code *before* it is passed to Piston for compilation. This might involve static analysis or sandboxing the compilation process.
        *   Prefer pre-compiling shaders as part of the application build process to eliminate runtime compilation of potentially malicious code via Piston.
        *   Implement robust error handling around shader compilation to prevent crashes from propagating.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Asset Loading (Textures, Models, Sounds)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_asset_loading__textures__models__sounds_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides maliciously crafted asset files (e.g., textures, 3D models, sound files) that exploit vulnerabilities within Piston's asset loading mechanisms or the libraries Piston uses internally to handle these assets.
    *   **How Piston Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Piston provides functionalities for loading various asset types. Vulnerabilities within Piston's code that handles asset parsing, decoding, or memory allocation during the loading process can be exploited by malicious assets. This includes potential buffer overflows, integer overflows, or other memory safety issues within Piston's asset loading routines.
    *   **Example:** A specially crafted PNG image file, when loaded using Piston's image loading functionality, triggers a buffer overflow within Piston's image decoding code, leading to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution within the application's context. A malformed 3D model file could exploit a parsing vulnerability in Piston's model loading logic.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, denial of service, potential arbitrary code execution within the application's process.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid loading assets from untrusted or external sources.
        *   If loading assets from external sources is required, implement rigorous validation and sanitization of asset files *before* they are passed to Piston for loading. This might involve checking file headers, sizes, and using separate, sandboxed processes for initial asset inspection.
        *   Ensure Piston and its dependencies (especially image and model loading libraries) are kept up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement resource limits and error handling during asset loading to prevent resource exhaustion and gracefully handle potentially corrupt files.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal Vulnerabilities in Piston's File Access](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_vulnerabilities_in_piston's_file_access.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates file paths provided to Piston's file access utilities (if Piston provides such utilities) to access files or directories outside of the intended application sandbox.
    *   **How Piston Contributes to the Attack Surface:** If Piston offers functions or APIs that allow applications to interact with the file system based on paths provided by the user or external sources, and these functions do not properly sanitize or validate the paths, it directly introduces this vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** An application uses a Piston function to load a file based on a user-provided path. A malicious user provides a path like `"../../../../etc/shadow"` hoping that Piston's file access function will not prevent accessing this sensitive system file.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure (reading sensitive files), potential data modification or deletion (if Piston's file access also allows writing, though less common for core game engine functionality).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using Piston's file access utilities with user-provided or external paths directly.
        *   If file access is necessary, implement strict whitelisting of allowed file paths or directories.
        *   Use relative paths and resolve them against a known safe base directory within the application's data folder.
        *   If Piston provides path manipulation functions, ensure they are used securely and do not introduce vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement robust error handling to prevent the application from revealing information about the file system structure in error messages.
