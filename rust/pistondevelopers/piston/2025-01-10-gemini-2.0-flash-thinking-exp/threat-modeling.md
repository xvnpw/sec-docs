# Threat Model Analysis for pistondevelopers/piston

## Threat: [Malicious Code Injection](./threats/malicious_code_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker submits a code snippet containing malicious commands or logic. Piston executes this code, potentially allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands within the execution environment, access data accessible to that environment, or disrupt the execution process. This directly leverages Piston's core function of running user-provided code.

**Impact:** Compromise of the Piston execution environment, potentially leading to access to sensitive information within that environment or disruption of service.

**Affected Component:** Code Execution Module

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong containerization technologies (e.g., Docker with secure configurations, gVisor) with resource limits and restricted capabilities.
*   Enforce the principle of least privilege for the Piston execution environment.
*   Regularly update Piston and its dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion within the Container](./threats/resource_exhaustion_within_the_container.md)

**Description:** An attacker submits code designed to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) within the execution container managed by Piston. This can lead to performance degradation or denial of service for other executions managed by the same Piston instance. This directly impacts Piston's ability to serve other requests.

**Impact:** Denial of service for the application relying on Piston, performance degradation of the Piston service.

**Affected Component:** Resource Management within the Execution Environment

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement and enforce strict resource limits (CPU quotas, memory limits, disk I/O throttling) at the container level configured by Piston.
*   Set timeouts for code execution within Piston.
*   Monitor resource usage of Piston-managed containers and implement alerting mechanisms for anomalies.

## Threat: [Fork Bomb/Process Exhaustion](./threats/fork_bombprocess_exhaustion.md)

**Description:** An attacker submits code that rapidly creates a large number of processes within the container managed by Piston, exhausting the container's process table. This directly impacts Piston's ability to manage and execute further code.

**Impact:** Denial of service for the application relying on Piston.

**Affected Component:** Process Management within the Execution Environment

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Limit the number of processes a container can create using configuration options within Piston's container management.
*   Implement process monitoring and killing mechanisms for runaway processes within Piston's execution environment.
*   Set appropriate resource limits within Piston to prevent excessive process creation.

## Threat: [Exploiting Language-Specific Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploiting_language-specific_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker submits code that leverages known vulnerabilities or unsafe features within a specific programming language's runtime environment supported by Piston (e.g., buffer overflows in C/C++, arbitrary code execution through `eval()` in dynamic languages). Piston is directly responsible for providing these language runtimes.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the container managed by Piston, potentially leading to further compromise of the Piston service.

**Affected Component:** Language Runtimes

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep the language runtimes within the Piston environment updated with the latest security patches.
*   Consider disabling or restricting access to potentially dangerous language features within Piston's configuration.

## Threat: [Insecure API Access to Piston (if exposed)](./threats/insecure_api_access_to_piston__if_exposed_.md)

**Description:** If Piston exposes an API for code execution, and this API is not properly secured (e.g., weak authentication, lack of authorization checks), attackers could bypass the application's intended interface and directly submit malicious code to Piston.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution via Piston, resource exhaustion of the Piston service, or other attacks as if they were legitimate users of the Piston API.

**Affected Component:** API Endpoints

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for any Piston API endpoints (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0).
*   Follow the principle of least privilege when granting access to the Piston API.
*   Regularly audit Piston API access logs for suspicious activity.
