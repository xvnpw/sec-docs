## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Plugin/Extension Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_pluginextension_vulnerabilities.md)

**Install Malicious Plugin:**
* **Find Way to Install Unverified Plugin (e.g., insecure plugin management):** An attacker identifies a weakness in the application's plugin management system that allows them to install plugins from untrusted sources or bypass verification processes. This could involve exploiting API endpoints, manipulating file uploads, or leveraging default insecure configurations.
* **Malicious Plugin Executes Code Upon Loading/Execution (CRITICAL):** Once a malicious plugin is installed, it can execute arbitrary code on the server when Piston loads or activates the plugin. This grants the attacker full control over the application's environment.

**Exploit Vulnerability in Existing Plugin:**
* **Identify Vulnerability in a Loaded Piston Plugin:** An attacker discovers a security flaw within a legitimate Piston plugin. This could be a known vulnerability or a zero-day vulnerability they have discovered. Common plugin vulnerabilities include input validation issues, insecure API usage, or logic flaws.
* **Trigger Vulnerability to Execute Code/Gain Access (CRITICAL):** The attacker crafts specific input or actions to trigger the identified vulnerability in the plugin. Successful exploitation allows them to execute arbitrary code within the context of the application or gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionalities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities.md)

**Configuration File Manipulation:**
* **Find Way to Modify Piston's Configuration Files (CRITICAL):** An attacker finds a way to gain write access to Piston's configuration files. This could be achieved through exploiting a file upload vulnerability, leveraging insecure file permissions, or compromising other parts of the system that have access to these files.
* **Inject Malicious Settings Leading to Code Execution/Undesired Behavior (CRITICAL):** Once configuration files are accessible, the attacker injects malicious settings. This could involve specifying paths to malicious executables, altering command-line arguments, or modifying other configuration parameters that cause Piston to execute arbitrary code or behave in an unintended and harmful way.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Piston's Core Logic](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_piston's_core_logic.md)

**Discover and Exploit a Known Vulnerability:**
* **Identify a Publicly Known Vulnerability in Piston (CRITICAL):** The attacker researches publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in the specific version of Piston being used by the application. This information is often available in security advisories, CVE databases, or security research publications.
* **Exploit the Vulnerability (CRITICAL):** The attacker uses readily available exploit code or crafts their own exploit to leverage the known vulnerability. Successful exploitation allows them to execute arbitrary code, bypass security controls, or gain unauthorized access.

**Discover and Exploit a Zero-Day Vulnerability:**
* **Discover a Previously Unknown Vulnerability in Piston:** The attacker performs in-depth analysis of Piston's source code, binaries, or runtime behavior to identify a previously unknown security flaw. This requires significant expertise and time.
* **Exploit the Vulnerability (CRITICAL):** The attacker develops a custom exploit to leverage the newly discovered zero-day vulnerability. Because the vulnerability is unknown, there are no existing patches or mitigations, making successful exploitation highly impactful.

## Attack Tree Path: [Piston Parses File Causing Code Execution/Memory Corruption](./attack_tree_paths/piston_parses_file_causing_code_executionmemory_corruption.md)

If the application allows Piston to process files, a specially crafted malicious file can exploit vulnerabilities in Piston's file parsing logic. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code on the server or cause memory corruption, potentially leading to further exploitation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Piston Executes Input as Code](./attack_tree_paths/piston_executes_input_as_code.md)

If Piston or a plugin incorrectly interprets user-provided input as executable code or commands, an attacker can inject malicious code that will be executed by the application. This is a severe vulnerability that grants the attacker direct control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Piston's Input Handling Logic Overflows Buffer, Leading to Memory Corruption/Code Execution](./attack_tree_paths/piston's_input_handling_logic_overflows_buffer__leading_to_memory_corruptioncode_execution.md)

If Piston's underlying C/C++ code doesn't properly validate the size of input data, an attacker can provide input that exceeds the allocated buffer. This buffer overflow can overwrite adjacent memory locations, potentially allowing the attacker to inject and execute malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Vulnerability to Execute Code/Gain Access (within Plugin Exploitation)](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_vulnerability_to_execute_codegain_access__within_plugin_exploitation_.md)

This node represents the successful exploitation of a vulnerability within an existing plugin, leading to code execution or unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Find Way to Modify Piston's Configuration Files (within Configuration Manipulation)](./attack_tree_paths/find_way_to_modify_piston's_configuration_files__within_configuration_manipulation_.md)

This node represents the successful gaining of write access to Piston's configuration files, a crucial step in the configuration manipulation high-risk path.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Settings Leading to Code Execution/Undesired Behavior (within Configuration Manipulation)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_settings_leading_to_code_executionundesired_behavior__within_configuration_manipula_eed99801.md)

This node represents the successful injection of malicious settings into Piston's configuration files, leading to code execution or other harmful behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify a Publicly Known Vulnerability in Piston (within Core Logic Exploitation)](./attack_tree_paths/identify_a_publicly_known_vulnerability_in_piston__within_core_logic_exploitation_.md)

This node represents the successful identification of a known vulnerability in Piston, a necessary precursor to exploiting it.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit the Vulnerability (within Core Logic Exploitation)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_the_vulnerability__within_core_logic_exploitation_.md)

This node represents the successful exploitation of a vulnerability in Piston's core logic, whether known or a zero-day.
