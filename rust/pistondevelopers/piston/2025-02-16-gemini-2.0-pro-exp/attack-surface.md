# Attack Surface Analysis for pistondevelopers/piston

## Attack Surface: [1. Malformed Input Handling (pistoncore-input)](./attack_surfaces/1__malformed_input_handling__pistoncore-input_.md)

*Description:* Vulnerabilities arising from improper handling of user input within Piston's own input processing logic. This focuses on flaws *within* `pistoncore-input` itself, *not* solely within underlying libraries like GLFW (though those are still a concern, they are less *direct*).
*Piston Contribution:* `pistoncore-input` provides the core input abstraction.  Bugs in *this* code, such as incorrect bounds checking or flawed state management when processing input events, are the direct concern.
*Example:* An attacker sends a rapid sequence of specifically crafted, but still "valid" according to the external library, input events that trigger an integer overflow *within Piston's internal input state tracking*, leading to a crash or unexpected behavior.  This distinguishes it from a pure GLFW bug.
*Impact:* Denial of Service (DoS), *potential* for limited arbitrary code execution (ACE) if the flaw allows for memory corruption within Piston's code.
*Risk Severity:* High.
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   *Developers:* Rigorous input validation and sanitization *within* `pistoncore-input`'s handling logic.  Extensive fuzz testing specifically targeting Piston's input event processing.  Careful review of state management and data structure manipulation within the input handling code.  Assume external libraries *may* have flaws, and add defensive checks within Piston.

## Attack Surface: [2. Shader Code Injection (graphics libraries)](./attack_surfaces/2__shader_code_injection__graphics_libraries_.md)

*Description:* Injection of malicious shader code, focusing on how Piston's graphics libraries handle shader loading and execution.
*Piston Contribution:* Piston's graphics libraries (e.g., `graphics`, `gfx_graphics`) are responsible for loading, compiling (potentially), and passing shader code to the underlying graphics API.  If these libraries lack sufficient safeguards, they become the conduit for the attack.  The vulnerability lies in Piston's *handling* of the shader data, not *just* the GPU driver.
*Example:* An attacker provides a shader file that, while syntactically valid GLSL, contains a carefully crafted sequence of operations that exploit a weakness in how Piston *prepares* the shader data before sending it to the driver (e.g., a buffer overflow during string manipulation of the shader source *within Piston*).
*Impact:* Arbitrary code execution on the GPU, potential for system compromise, data exfiltration, DoS.
*Risk Severity:* Critical.
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   *Developers:* Implement *strict* validation and sanitization of shader code *before* passing it to the graphics API.  This might involve parsing the shader source and checking for potentially dangerous operations.  Consider using a sandboxed shader compiler (if compilation is done on the client-side).  *Never* load shaders from untrusted sources without thorough vetting.  Explore using a restricted subset of the shader language, enforced by Piston's loading logic.

## Attack Surface: [3.  Graphics API Misuse (leading to driver vulnerabilities)](./attack_surfaces/3___graphics_api_misuse__leading_to_driver_vulnerabilities_.md)

*Description:* Incorrect or unsafe usage of graphics API calls *within Piston's graphics libraries* that could trigger vulnerabilities in the underlying graphics driver. This is distinct from a direct driver bug; it's about Piston *causing* the driver to misbehave.
*Piston Contribution:* Libraries like `gfx_graphics` make direct calls to OpenGL, Vulkan, etc.  If these calls are made incorrectly (e.g., passing invalid parameters, using deprecated functions in an insecure way, triggering race conditions in the API), they can expose driver vulnerabilities.
*Example:* Piston's code incorrectly manages a graphics buffer, leading to a use-after-free condition *within the driver* when a subsequent draw call is made. The root cause is Piston's incorrect API usage, not a pre-existing driver bug in isolation.
*Impact:*  Wide range, from rendering glitches to arbitrary code execution (ACE) on the GPU or even CPU.
*Risk Severity:* High to Critical.
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   *Developers:* Extremely careful and meticulous adherence to graphics API specifications.  Thorough code reviews of all graphics API interactions within Piston.  Use of validation layers and debugging tools provided by the graphics APIs to detect errors early.  Regular updates to graphics libraries to incorporate any safety improvements or bug fixes related to API usage.  Consider using higher-level abstractions that reduce the risk of direct API misuse.
