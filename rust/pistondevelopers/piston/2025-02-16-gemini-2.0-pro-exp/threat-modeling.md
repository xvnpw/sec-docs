# Threat Model Analysis for pistondevelopers/piston

## Threat: [Malicious Asset Substitution (Spoofing)](./threats/malicious_asset_substitution__spoofing_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker replaces legitimate game assets (textures, models, sounds, shaders loaded from external files) with crafted malicious files. The attacker might achieve this by compromising a download server, modifying files on the user's system (if they have sufficient privileges), or exploiting a vulnerability in the asset loading process that allows them to specify arbitrary file paths. The malicious asset is designed to exploit vulnerabilities in Piston's parsing or rendering code.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Execution of arbitrary code (if the malicious asset exploits a vulnerability in the parsing/rendering code within Piston or its immediate graphics dependencies).
        *   Denial of service (if the asset causes a crash or excessive resource consumption due to a bug in Piston's handling).
        *   Information disclosure (if the asset is designed to leak data, exploiting a Piston-related vulnerability).
    *   **Affected Piston Component:**
        *   `piston_window` (or any window/graphics crate used, e.g., `gfx_graphics`, `opengl_graphics`) - Specifically, the functions related to loading and processing external resources (e.g., `Texture::from_path`, image loading functions *provided by Piston wrappers*).  This is critical if Piston's wrappers around lower-level libraries introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on whether the vulnerability exploited is in Piston's code or a closely-coupled graphics library).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Implement strict asset validation:** Use cryptographic hashing (e.g., SHA-256) to verify the integrity of all loaded assets against a known-good manifest. This is crucial even if using a seemingly "safe" Piston API.
        *   **Use digital signatures:** Digitally sign assets and verify the signatures before loading, ensuring the signing process covers the entire asset loading pipeline within Piston.
        *   **Load assets from trusted sources only:** Avoid loading assets from user-specified paths or untrusted network locations. Use a secure, controlled repository for assets.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Consider sandboxing the asset loading and processing code *specifically within Piston's context* to limit the impact of any potential vulnerabilities. This might involve using a separate process or a restricted environment, focusing on isolating Piston's asset handling.
        *   **Input validation:** If asset paths are derived from user input *and used within Piston's API calls*, thoroughly sanitize and validate the input to prevent path traversal attacks.
        *   **Regularly update Piston and its graphics dependencies:** Keep Piston and its *graphics-related* dependencies up-to-date to benefit from security patches, paying close attention to changelogs for security fixes in asset handling.

## Threat: [Shader-Based Attacks (Tampering/Denial of Service)](./threats/shader-based_attacks__tamperingdenial_of_service_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a malicious shader (GLSL, HLSL, etc.) that exploits vulnerabilities in the graphics driver *or, critically, in Piston's shader handling and interaction with the graphics API*. This could lead to crashes, and in rare, high-impact scenarios, potentially arbitrary code execution if a vulnerability exists in how Piston passes shader data to the underlying graphics library.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Application crash (most likely).
        *   System instability (if the driver is affected).
        *   *Potential* for arbitrary code execution (low probability, but high impact if a vulnerability exists in Piston's interaction with the graphics API).
        *   Information disclosure (e.g., reading from unintended memory locations, again, if Piston's handling is flawed).
    *   **Affected Piston Component:**
        *   `piston_window` (and the underlying graphics crate that Piston uses, e.g., `gfx_graphics`, `opengl_graphics`). Specifically, the functions related to shader loading, compilation, and execution *as managed by Piston*. The vulnerability would likely be in how Piston interfaces with the graphics API, not the API itself.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (due to the potential for code execution, even if low probability, and the direct involvement of Piston's graphics handling).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Shader validation:** If loading shaders from external sources, validate them against a known-good set or use a shader compiler with built-in security checks.  This validation should occur *before* passing the shader to Piston's API.
        *   **Use a safe subset of shader features:** Avoid using complex or experimental shader features that are more likely to contain vulnerabilities, especially when interacting with Piston's graphics abstraction layer.
        *   **Keep graphics drivers up-to-date:** Driver updates often include security patches, but this is less directly related to Piston itself.
        *   **Sandboxing (if possible):** Explore sandboxing techniques for shader execution, although this is complex and might not be feasible within Piston's architecture. The focus would be on isolating Piston's graphics context.
        *   **Limit shader complexity:** Impose limits on shader size, instruction count, and resource usage *before* providing the shader to Piston.
        *   **Careful API Usage:** Scrutinize Piston's documentation and source code for any warnings or best practices related to shader handling. Ensure you are using the API *exactly* as intended, as misuse could introduce vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (Elevation of Privilege/Tampering) - *Specifically impacting Piston's core functionality*](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities__elevation_of_privilegetampering__-_specifically_impacting_piston's_core__91d7743e.md)

*   **Description:** While all dependencies pose a risk, this threat focuses on vulnerabilities in dependencies that are *tightly integrated* with Piston's core functionality and are *essential* for its operation (e.g., `gfx-rs`, `winit`, a core graphics or windowing library that Piston directly wraps). A vulnerability here could allow an attacker to bypass Piston's intended security mechanisms.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Arbitrary code execution (if the vulnerability is in a low-level graphics or windowing library that Piston directly uses).
        *   Elevation of privilege (if the compromised dependency has higher privileges).
        *   Data breaches (if the vulnerability allows access to sensitive data handled by Piston).
        *   Denial of service.
    *   **Affected Piston Component:** Any component that uses the vulnerable *core* dependency. This is more targeted than a general dependency vulnerability; it's about dependencies that Piston *cannot function without*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific core dependency and the nature of the vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Prioritize Core Dependency Updates:** Focus on updating dependencies that are *directly and critically* used by Piston's core, such as graphics and windowing libraries.
        *   **Use `cargo audit`:** Regularly run `cargo audit` to identify known vulnerabilities in *all* dependencies, but pay *special attention* to those core to Piston.
        *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Actively monitor security advisories for Rust and, *specifically*, for the core crates that Piston relies on (check Piston's `Cargo.toml` for these).
        *   **Consider (with caution) Vendoring Critical Dependencies:** For the *most critical* dependencies (e.g., the graphics backend), *if* you have the expertise and resources, consider vendoring (copying the source code) to have absolute control over the code and ensure you're using a known-good, audited version. This is a high-effort, high-responsibility option.
        * **Lockfile:** Use Cargo.lock to ensure consistent dependency versions.
