# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for pistondevelopers/piston

## Mitigation Strategy: [Language and Runtime Restrictions (Piston Configuration and Usage)](./mitigation_strategies/language_and_runtime_restrictions__piston_configuration_and_usage_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Language Selection (Piston's Supported Languages):**  Within the set of languages *supported by Piston*, choose those with the strongest security features.  Prioritize Rust, Go (with *extremely* careful review of any `unsafe` code), or WebAssembly.  If using interpreted languages (Python, Node.js), *strictly* adhere to step 2.
    2.  **Module Whitelisting (Interpreted Languages - *Within* Piston's Execution Context):**
        *   Create a *very* restrictive whitelist of allowed modules.  This list should *only* contain modules that are *absolutely essential* for the intended functionality.  *Never* include modules that provide system access (e.g., `os`, `subprocess`, `child_process`, `fs`, `ctypes`, `ffi`).
        *   *Crucially*, this whitelisting must be enforced *within* the Piston execution environment.  This might involve:
            *   Modifying the Piston source code (if necessary and *carefully* reviewed) to add custom module import restrictions. This is the most robust, but also most complex, approach.
            *   Using language-specific features *within* the executed code to limit module imports (e.g., overriding the `__import__` function in Python – *but this is easily bypassed if the attacker has full code control*). This is less reliable.
            *   Using Piston's "pre-execution" hooks (if available) to inject code that restricts module imports *before* the user-provided code runs. This is a good compromise if Piston supports it.
    3.  **Runtime Updates (Piston's Dependencies):** Keep the language runtimes *used by Piston* up-to-date.  This is distinct from updating Piston itself.  This often involves managing the Docker image or environment that Piston uses.  Automate this process as much as possible.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Critical):** Malicious code injection leading to arbitrary command execution. Module whitelisting and language selection are the primary defenses here.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (High):** Some DoS attacks can be mitigated by language choice (e.g., memory-safe languages).
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium):** Limiting access to system modules reduces the risk of leaking sensitive information.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (High):** Restricting language features and modules makes it harder for an attacker to gain more privileges.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **RCE:** Risk significantly reduced by the combination of language choice and *strict, Piston-enforced* module whitelisting.
    *   **DoS:** Risk moderately reduced (primarily through language choice).
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk moderately reduced.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk moderately reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Language Selection: [Specify the currently used languages, focusing on those *supported by Piston* and their security implications.]
    *   Module Whitelisting: [Specify if *Piston-enforced* module whitelisting is implemented and how.  Be very specific about how this is enforced *within* Piston's execution context.]
    *   Runtime Updates: [Specify if updates to the language runtimes *used by Piston* are automated.]

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Language Selection: [Identify any languages that need review or replacement *within Piston's supported set*. ]
    *   Module Whitelisting: [Specify any gaps in *Piston-enforced* module whitelisting. This is the most critical area.]
    *   Runtime Updates: [Specify any manual update processes or runtimes *used by Piston* that are not automatically updated.]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limits (Piston Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limits__piston_configuration_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Baseline Measurement:** Run test executions of representative code snippets to determine typical resource usage (memory, CPU time, process creation, file I/O).
    2.  **Configure Piston's `runtime` Settings:**  Use Piston's configuration mechanism (e.g., a `piston.toml` file, environment variables, or API calls – depending on how Piston is integrated) to set *strict* limits:
        *   `memory_limit`: Set a maximum memory allocation (e.g., "64MB").  This is *crucial*.
        *   `cpu_time_limit`: Set a maximum execution time (e.g., "1s").  This is also *crucial*.
        *   `process_limit`: Set a maximum number of processes (e.g., "1").  Essential to prevent fork bombs.
        *   `file_size_limit`: Set a maximum file size for created files (e.g., "1MB").  Important to prevent disk exhaustion.
    3.  **Testing and Iteration:**  Thoroughly test with a variety of inputs to ensure the limits are appropriate and don't break legitimate functionality.  Adjust as needed.
    4. **Network Restrictions:** Ensure that network access is *disabled* within Piston's configuration. This is usually the default, but *verify* it. If network access is *absolutely required*, it should be handled *completely outside* of Piston, with Piston communicating with a separate, secured service via a *very* restricted API.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (High):** Prevents resource exhaustion attacks (memory, CPU, disk space, processes).
    *   **Resource Abuse (Medium):** Limits the ability of malicious code to consume excessive resources.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Risk significantly reduced.  Strict resource limits are highly effective.
    *   **Resource Abuse:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   [Specify *exactly* which resource limits are configured in Piston and their values (e.g., "Memory limit set to 128MB via the `PISTON_MEMORY_LIMIT` environment variable").]

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   [Specify any missing resource limits or limits that need adjustment *within Piston's configuration*. ]
    *   [Explicitly state whether network access is disabled in Piston's configuration.]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Handling (Within Piston's Control)](./mitigation_strategies/input_handling__within_piston's_control_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Length Limits (Enforced *by* Piston):**  If Piston provides a mechanism to limit the size of the input code *before* it's passed to the language runtime, use it.  This might be a configuration setting or an API parameter. This is *distinct* from length limits enforced by the application *using* Piston.
    2. **Reject Invalid Code (Pre-Execution Checks *within* Piston):** If Piston offers any pre-execution checks (e.g., basic syntax validation using language-specific tools *integrated into Piston*), enable them. This prevents Piston from even attempting to run malformed code that might exploit vulnerabilities in the language runtimes.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium):** Length limits (if enforced by Piston) can prevent some DoS attacks.
    *   **Exploits Targeting Runtime Vulnerabilities (Variable):** Pre-execution checks (if available in Piston) can prevent execution of code designed to exploit specific vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Risk moderately reduced by Piston-enforced length limits.
    *   **Exploits:** Risk reduction depends on the specific pre-execution checks available in Piston.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Length Limits: [Specify if Piston has a built-in mechanism for limiting input size and if it's used.]
    *   Pre-Execution Checks: [Specify if Piston has any built-in pre-execution validation and if it's enabled.]

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   [Specify any missing input handling features *within Piston's capabilities*.]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Output Handling (Within Piston's Control)](./mitigation_strategies/output_handling__within_piston's_control_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Output Length Limits (Enforced *by* Piston):** If Piston provides a mechanism to limit the size of the output generated by the executed code, *use it*. This is a configuration setting or API parameter *within Piston*.
    2. **Error Handling (Piston's Error Reporting):** If Piston allows customizing how errors are reported, ensure that *detailed error messages and stack traces from the executed code are *not* exposed*. Return only generic error messages. This might involve configuring Piston or modifying its error handling logic.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Low):** Output length limits prevent excessively large outputs.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium):** Generic error messages prevent leaking sensitive information.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Risk slightly reduced by Piston-enforced output length limits.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk significantly reduced by controlling Piston's error reporting.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Output Length Limits: [Specify if Piston has a built-in mechanism for limiting output size and if it's used.]
    *   Error Handling: [Specify how Piston's error reporting is configured and whether detailed error information is suppressed.]

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   [Specify any missing output handling features *within Piston's capabilities*.]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Updates (Piston Library Itself)](./mitigation_strategies/regular_updates__piston_library_itself_.md)

* **Description:**
    1.  Establish a process for monitoring new releases of the *Piston library itself* (e.g., subscribe to release notifications on GitHub).
    2.  When a new release is available, review the changelog for security-related fixes.
    3.  Update the Piston library in your project's dependencies.
    4.  Thoroughly test the application after updating Piston.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Vulnerabilities in Piston (Variable Severity):** Addresses security vulnerabilities discovered and fixed in the Piston library.

* **Impact:**
    * **Vulnerabilities in Piston:** Risk reduced depending on the severity of the patched vulnerabilities.

* **Currently Implemented:**
    * [Specify the process for updating the Piston library.]

* **Missing Implementation:**
    * [Specify any improvements needed in the Piston library update process.]
