## Attack Tree Path: [1. Input Handling Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1__input_handling_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **[CRITICAL] Buffer Overflows (unsafe/FFI):**
    *   **Description:** Exploiting memory corruption vulnerabilities in `unsafe` Rust code or through Foreign Function Interface (FFI) calls to C libraries. The attacker crafts malicious input that overwrites memory beyond allocated buffers.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low
    *   **Impact:** High (ACE)
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
    *   **Mitigation:** Rigorous code review of `unsafe` blocks and FFI calls. Extensive fuzz testing with malformed input. Use of memory-safe alternatives where possible.

*   **[CRITICAL] Integer Overflows/Underflows (unsafe/FFI):**
    *   **Description:** Similar to buffer overflows, but exploiting integer arithmetic errors in `unsafe` code or FFI calls.  The attacker provides input that causes calculations to wrap around, leading to unexpected memory access.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High (Memory corruption, potentially ACE)
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
    *   **Mitigation:** Careful review of integer arithmetic in `unsafe` code and FFI calls. Use of checked arithmetic operations. Fuzz testing.

*   **[CRITICAL] Deserialization Issues:**
    *   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application deserializes data (e.g., from network input or configuration files). If a vulnerable deserialization library is used, the attacker can craft malicious serialized data that, when deserialized, executes arbitrary code.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
    *   **Impact:** High (ACE)
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
    *   **Mitigation:** Use a secure deserialization library. Avoid deserializing untrusted data. Implement strict input validation before deserialization.

*    **Logic Errors:**
    *   **Description:** Exploiting flaws in how input events are processed, leading to incorrect state or unintended actions.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Low to Medium
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:** Thorough code review, unit and integration testing.

    *   **Likelihood:** Low
    *   **Impact:** High (ACE)
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High

    *   **Impact:** Medium (DoS)
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement resource limits (e.g., maximum texture size, number of draw calls).

*   **[CRITICAL] Vulnerabilities in Underlying Graphics Libraries:**
    *   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the underlying graphics APIs (OpenGL, Vulkan, etc.) used by Piston.
    *   **Likelihood:** Very Low
