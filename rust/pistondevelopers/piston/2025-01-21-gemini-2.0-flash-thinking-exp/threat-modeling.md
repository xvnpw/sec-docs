# Threat Model Analysis for pistondevelopers/piston

## Threat: [Malicious Input Injection](./threats/malicious_input_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input events (keyboard, mouse, gamepad) and sends them to the application. This input is designed to exploit vulnerabilities in how **Piston's `input` module** processes input events. Successful exploitation can lead to unexpected application behavior, crashes, or potentially arbitrary code execution if vulnerabilities exist within Piston's input handling logic itself.
*   **Impact:** Application crash, unexpected game behavior, potential arbitrary code execution.
*   **Piston Component Affected:** `input` module, specifically event handling functions and input processing logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Piston library updated to benefit from potential input handling security patches.
    *   While primarily an application-level responsibility, be aware of potential vulnerabilities in Piston's input processing and report any suspected issues to the Piston developers.

## Threat: [Input Buffer Overflow](./threats/input_buffer_overflow.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends excessively long input strings or sequences exceeding the allocated buffer size for input data within **Piston's `input` module**. This overflow can overwrite adjacent memory regions managed by Piston, leading to crashes, memory corruption, or potentially allowing the attacker to inject and execute malicious code if vulnerabilities exist in Piston's memory management related to input.
*   **Impact:** Application crash, memory corruption, potential arbitrary code execution.
*   **Piston Component Affected:** `input` module, memory management within `input` module.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Piston library updated to benefit from potential buffer overflow fixes in input handling.
    *   Report any suspected buffer overflow vulnerabilities in Piston's input handling to the Piston developers.

## Threat: [Path Traversal during Asset Loading](./threats/path_traversal_during_asset_loading.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates file paths used for loading assets (images, sounds, models) to include path traversal sequences like `../`. If **Piston's asset loading functions within the `graphics` module** don't properly sanitize these paths, the attacker could access files outside the intended asset directory. This could lead to reading sensitive application files or system files if Piston's file access permissions are not correctly managed or if vulnerabilities exist in Piston's path handling.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, unauthorized access to files, potential compromise of application or system data.
*   **Piston Component Affected:** `graphics` module, asset loading functions, file system access operations within `graphics` module.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Piston library updated to benefit from potential path traversal vulnerability fixes in asset loading.
    *   Report any suspected path traversal vulnerabilities in Piston's asset loading to the Piston developers.

## Threat: [Malicious Asset Exploitation](./threats/malicious_asset_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious asset files (e.g., manipulated image files, model files) and provides them to the application. These malicious assets are designed to exploit vulnerabilities in asset processing components like image decoders, model parsers, or other libraries used by **Piston's `graphics` module** for asset loading and rendering. Exploiting these vulnerabilities can lead to crashes, memory corruption, or even arbitrary code execution if Piston relies on vulnerable asset processing libraries.
*   **Impact:** Application crash, memory corruption, potential arbitrary code execution.
*   **Piston Component Affected:** `graphics` module, asset loading and decoding functions, image loading libraries, model loading libraries used by `graphics` module.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Piston library and its dependencies updated, especially asset loading libraries, to benefit from security patches.
    *   Report any suspected vulnerabilities related to asset processing within Piston to the Piston developers.

## Threat: [Shader Vulnerabilities (if dynamically loaded and applicable)](./threats/shader_vulnerabilities__if_dynamically_loaded_and_applicable_.md)

*   **Description:** If the application uses shaders and allows dynamic loading or modification of shader code, and if **Piston's `graphics` module** provides mechanisms for dynamic shader loading or compilation, an attacker could provide malicious shader code. Vulnerabilities in the shader code itself or in **Piston's shader compilation process** could be exploited. Malicious shaders might cause rendering errors, crashes, or in more severe cases, potentially be leveraged for more serious exploits depending on the underlying graphics API and drivers and how Piston interacts with them.
*   **Impact:** Rendering errors, graphical glitches, application crashes, potential for more serious exploits depending on the vulnerability and graphics system.
*   **Piston Component Affected:** `graphics` module, shader handling (if dynamically loaded), OpenGL/Vulkan backend interaction, shader compilation process within `graphics` module.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   If using dynamic shaders with Piston, carefully review and audit shader loading and compilation processes for potential vulnerabilities.
    *   Keep Piston library and graphics drivers updated to benefit from potential shader-related security patches.
    *   Report any suspected shader-related vulnerabilities within Piston to the Piston developers.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Piston's Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_piston's_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Piston relies on various external libraries and dependencies. If **Piston includes or depends on vulnerable versions of these libraries**, applications using Piston become indirectly vulnerable. Attackers could exploit known vulnerabilities in Piston's dependencies through the Piston application. This is a vulnerability within the Piston ecosystem itself, as it dictates which dependencies are used.
*   **Impact:** Varies widely depending on the specific dependency vulnerability. Could range from Denial of Service to arbitrary code execution, data breaches, or other critical impacts.
*   **Piston Component Affected:** All Piston modules indirectly, as they rely on dependencies. Dependency management and inclusion within Piston project.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly audit and update Piston's dependencies to their latest secure versions. This is primarily the responsibility of the Piston development team. Application developers should use the latest stable Piston releases.
    *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for Piston and its dependencies. Report any outdated or vulnerable dependencies found in Piston to the Piston developers.
