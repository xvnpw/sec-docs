### High and Critical Attack Surfaces Directly Involving Piston

Here's an updated list of key attack surfaces with high or critical risk severity that directly involve the Piston game engine:

*   **Malicious Asset Loading:**
    *   **Description:** The application loads external assets (images, audio, custom data) which could be maliciously crafted to exploit vulnerabilities in the loading or processing logic *provided by Piston*.
    *   **How Piston Contributes:** Piston provides functionalities for loading various asset types. If the application uses *Piston's* asset loading functions to load assets from untrusted sources or user-provided paths without validation, it becomes vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** A user provides a specially crafted PNG image file that, when loaded using *Piston's* image loading capabilities, triggers a buffer overflow in the underlying image decoding library *used by Piston*.
    *   **Impact:** Code execution, application crash, denial of service, potential information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate all asset paths and filenames before using *Piston's* loading functions.
        *   **Sandboxing:** If possible, load and process assets in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of potential exploits when using *Piston's* loading mechanisms.
        *   **Use Trusted Sources:** Only load assets from trusted and verified sources when using *Piston's* asset loading features.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Piston updated, as updates may include fixes for vulnerabilities in its asset loading components or the libraries it uses.

*   **Path Traversal via Asset Loading:**
    *   **Description:** Attackers can manipulate file paths provided to *Piston's* asset loading functions to access or overwrite files outside the intended asset directory.
    *   **How Piston Contributes:** Piston provides functions for loading assets based on file paths. If the application allows user-controlled paths to be directly used with *Piston's* loading functions without proper sanitization, it's vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** A user provides a file path like `"../../../../etc/passwd"` to *Piston's* asset loading function, potentially allowing the application to read sensitive system files.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential for arbitrary file read or write depending on application permissions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Restrict File Paths:**  Never directly use user-provided file paths for asset loading with *Piston's* functions. Instead, use a predefined asset directory and allow users to select assets by name or ID, mapping these to safe file paths internally before using *Piston's* loading.
        *   **Path Sanitization:** If user-provided paths are unavoidable when interacting with *Piston's* asset loading, rigorously sanitize them to remove path traversal sequences (e.g., `..`).
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the application runs with the minimum necessary permissions to prevent unauthorized file access when using *Piston's* file access features.
