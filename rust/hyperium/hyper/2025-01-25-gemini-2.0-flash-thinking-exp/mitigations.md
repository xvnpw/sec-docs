# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for hyperium/hyper

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict HTTP Protocol Compliance](./mitigation_strategies/strict_http_protocol_compliance.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Strict HTTP Protocol Compliance

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Conduct a thorough code review of all custom HTTP request and response handling logic within the application built using `hyper`. Focus on areas where you might be deviating from standard HTTP practices when using `hyper`.
*   Step 2: Verify that your application, when using `hyper`, adheres strictly to relevant HTTP RFCs (e.g., RFC 7230, RFC 7231, RFC 9110). Ensure correct usage of `hyper`'s API for headers, methods, status codes, and body handling according to HTTP standards.
*   Step 3: Prioritize using `hyper`'s built-in API for handling HTTP requests and responses. Leverage provided functions for header manipulation, body streaming, and method handling within `hyper` instead of implementing custom logic from scratch. This ensures you are using `hyper` in a way that is designed to be protocol compliant.
*   Step 4: Implement unit and integration tests specifically designed to validate HTTP protocol compliance when using `hyper`. These tests should check how `hyper` handles various scenarios, including edge cases, malformed requests, and unusual header combinations as processed by `hyper`.
*   Step 5: If possible, use HTTP protocol validators in your development process to check the HTTP interactions generated by your `hyper` application for compliance.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Request Smuggling (High Severity): Exploiting discrepancies in HTTP parsing, which can be introduced by incorrect usage of `hyper` or deviations from HTTP standards when building on top of `hyper`.
*   Response Splitting (Medium Severity): Manipulating response headers due to incorrect header handling in your `hyper` application, potentially leading to injected content.
*   HTTP Desync Attacks (High Severity): Causing inconsistencies in request/response handling, which can arise from misusing `hyper`'s features or not understanding its HTTP handling behavior.

**Impact:**
*   Request Smuggling: High Risk Reduction - Significantly reduces the attack surface for request smuggling vulnerabilities by ensuring correct `hyper` usage and protocol adherence.
*   Response Splitting: Medium Risk Reduction - Minimizes the risk of response splitting by ensuring correct header formatting and handling within your `hyper` application.
*   HTTP Desync Attacks: High Risk Reduction - Prevents desync issues by enforcing consistent and standard-compliant HTTP communication when using `hyper`.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Step 3 (Using `hyper` API): Largely implemented throughout the codebase for standard HTTP operations using `hyper`.
*   Step 4 (Unit tests): Basic unit tests exist for core request handlers using `hyper`, but protocol compliance testing specific to `hyper` is not explicitly focused.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Step 1 & 2 (Code Review & RFC Adherence): A dedicated code review focused on HTTP protocol compliance in the context of `hyper` usage is needed.
*   Step 4 (Integration tests): Integration tests specifically targeting HTTP protocol compliance when using `hyper`, especially in proxy scenarios, are missing.
*   Step 5 (HTTP Validators): No HTTP protocol validators are currently integrated to specifically check `hyper`'s HTTP interactions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Header Injection Prevention](./mitigation_strategies/header_injection_prevention.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Header Injection Prevention

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Identify all locations in your `hyper`-based application's code where HTTP response headers are constructed using `hyper`'s API, especially those that incorporate user-controlled data.
*   Step 2: Implement strict validation and sanitization for any user-controlled data before including it in HTTP response headers when using `hyper`. Define allowed characters, formats, and lengths for header values within the context of `hyper`'s header handling.
*   Step 3: Utilize `hyper`'s API specifically for setting headers. Prefer using `hyper`'s methods that handle encoding and escaping automatically, reducing the risk of manual errors when working with headers in `hyper`.
*   Step 4: For sensitive headers like `Location`, `Content-Type`, and `Set-Cookie`, exercise extra caution when setting them dynamically in `hyper`. Avoid directly embedding user input. If necessary, use secure encoding functions or consider alternative approaches that minimize user data inclusion when using `hyper` to set these headers.
*   Step 5: Implement security testing specifically for header injection vulnerabilities in your `hyper` application. Use tools and techniques to attempt injecting malicious characters and sequences into headers to verify proper sanitization and handling when using `hyper`'s header mechanisms.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Header Injection (Medium to High Severity): Allows attackers to inject arbitrary HTTP headers through your `hyper` application, potentially leading to various attacks like XSS, session fixation, or cache poisoning.

**Impact:**
*   Header Injection: High Risk Reduction - Significantly reduces the possibility of header injection by enforcing validation and using secure header setting mechanisms provided by `hyper`.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Step 3 (Using `hyper` API): Generally used for setting standard headers using `hyper`'s API.
*   Step 2 (Validation): Basic validation might be present for some user inputs, but not specifically for header injection prevention in all cases when using `hyper`.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Step 1 (Identification): A systematic review to identify all header construction points using `hyper` is needed.
*   Step 2 (Strict Validation & Sanitization):  Comprehensive and consistent validation and sanitization for user data in headers when using `hyper` is missing.
*   Step 4 (Sensitive Headers Caution): Specific review and hardening of sensitive header handling within `hyper` is required.
*   Step 5 (Security Testing): Dedicated header injection vulnerability testing for the `hyper` application is not regularly performed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Response Splitting Mitigation](./mitigation_strategies/response_splitting_mitigation.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Response Splitting Mitigation

**Description:**
*   Step 1:  Re-examine all code paths in your `hyper` application where user-controlled data might influence HTTP response headers constructed using `hyper`, particularly status lines and header values.
*   Step 2:  Avoid directly embedding user-controlled data into HTTP response headers when using `hyper` without rigorous encoding or validation. Treat all user input as potentially malicious when constructing responses with `hyper`.
*   Step 3:  Leverage `hyper`'s response building mechanisms. These are designed to prevent basic response splitting if used correctly. Ensure you are not bypassing these mechanisms with custom string manipulation when working with `hyper` responses.
*   Step 4:  Implement robust output encoding for any user-provided data that *must* be included in headers when using `hyper`. Use appropriate encoding functions to neutralize characters that could be interpreted as header separators (e.g., newline characters) in the context of `hyper`'s header handling.
*   Step 5:  Conduct thorough penetration testing to specifically target response splitting vulnerabilities in your `hyper` application. Attempt to inject newline characters and other control characters into headers via user inputs to verify mitigation effectiveness when using `hyper`'s response mechanisms.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Response Splitting (Medium Severity): Allows attackers to inject arbitrary HTTP responses through your `hyper` application, potentially leading to XSS, cache poisoning, or session hijacking.

**Impact:**
*   Response Splitting: High Risk Reduction - Drastically reduces the risk of response splitting by preventing direct user data embedding and enforcing secure response construction using `hyper`.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Step 3 (Using `hyper` mechanisms): Generally followed for standard response construction using `hyper`.
*   Step 2 (Avoid direct embedding): Awareness exists, but consistent enforcement might be lacking when building responses with `hyper`.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Step 1 (Code Path Review): A dedicated review to identify all user-data-to-header paths in `hyper` response construction is needed.
*   Step 4 (Robust Encoding):  Consistent and robust output encoding for user data in headers when using `hyper` is not fully implemented.
*   Step 5 (Penetration Testing): Specific response splitting penetration testing for the `hyper` application is not regularly conducted.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Request Smuggling Prevention](./mitigation_strategies/request_smuggling_prevention.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Request Smuggling Prevention

**Description:**
*   Step 1: If your `hyper` application acts as a reverse proxy or interacts with upstream HTTP servers, meticulously review the configuration and code related to request forwarding and handling within `hyper`.
*   Step 2: Ensure consistent interpretation of request boundaries (Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding headers) between `hyper` and any upstream servers or proxies. Misalignment when `hyper` is involved can lead to smuggling.
*   Step 3: If using `hyper` as an HTTP client, be aware of potential vulnerabilities in the HTTP implementations of the servers it communicates with. Craft requests carefully using `hyper`'s client API and consider security implications of interacting with external systems through `hyper`.
*   Step 4: Implement thorough integration testing in proxy scenarios involving your `hyper` application. Test with various request types, header combinations, and upstream server configurations to identify potential smuggling vulnerabilities related to `hyper`'s proxy behavior.
*   Step 5: If possible, configure your `hyper` application and upstream systems to enforce a single, consistent method for request body delimitation (e.g., prefer Content-Length over Transfer-Encoding when feasible and secure) to reduce ambiguity in request parsing.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Request Smuggling (High Severity): Allows attackers to bypass security controls, gain unauthorized access, or perform other malicious actions by exploiting how `hyper` and other servers interpret HTTP requests.

**Impact:**
*   Request Smuggling: High Risk Reduction - Significantly reduces the risk of request smuggling by ensuring consistent request boundary handling in `hyper` and thorough testing in proxy scenarios.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Step 2 (Consistent Interpretation):  Basic configuration aims for consistency, but might not be rigorously verified in the context of `hyper`.
*   Step 1 (Proxy Review): Initial proxy setup with `hyper` was reviewed, but ongoing review might be lacking.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Step 1 (Detailed Proxy Review): A deep dive review of proxy configurations and code involving `hyper` for smuggling vulnerabilities is needed.
*   Step 4 (Integration Testing): Comprehensive integration tests specifically for request smuggling in proxy setups using `hyper` are missing.
*   Step 5 (Enforce Single Method):  Strategy to enforce a single, consistent body delimitation method in configurations involving `hyper` is not defined or implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strong TLS Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/strong_tls_configuration.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Strong TLS Configuration

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Review the current TLS configuration for both server-side and client-side `hyper` instances in your application. Identify the TLS protocol versions and cipher suites being used in conjunction with `hyper`.
*   Step 2: Configure `hyper` to enforce the use of strong TLS protocols. Disable or remove support for outdated protocols like SSLv3, TLS 1.0, and TLS 1.1 when configuring TLS for `hyper`. Mandate TLS 1.2 or preferably TLS 1.3 as the minimum supported version in `hyper`'s TLS settings.
*   Step 3: Select and configure strong cipher suites for use with `hyper`. Prioritize cipher suites that offer forward secrecy (e.g., ECDHE-RSA, ECDHE-ECDSA) and avoid weak or insecure ciphers (e.g., RC4, DES, CBC mode ciphers with TLS 1.2) when configuring `hyper`'s TLS.
*   Step 4: Utilize `hyper`'s TLS configuration options (often through libraries like `rustls` or `openssl-rs`) to implement these secure settings. Ensure the configuration is applied consistently across all `hyper` instances in your application.
*   Step 5: Regularly review and update the TLS configuration used with `hyper` to align with current security best practices and recommendations. Stay informed about new vulnerabilities and recommended configurations for TLS in `hyper` and its related libraries.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Protocol Downgrade Attacks (Medium to High Severity): Attackers can force the use of weaker TLS protocols when communicating with your `hyper` application, making it easier to exploit known vulnerabilities.
*   Cipher Suite Weakness Exploitation (Medium to High Severity): Using weak cipher suites with `hyper` can make TLS connections vulnerable to attacks like BEAST, POODLE, or SWEET32.
*   Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (Medium Severity): Weaker TLS configurations in `hyper` increase the risk of successful MITM attacks.

**Impact:**
*   Protocol Downgrade Attacks: High Risk Reduction - Prevents downgrade attacks by enforcing strong protocol versions in `hyper`'s TLS configuration.
*   Cipher Suite Weakness Exploitation: High Risk Reduction - Eliminates the use of weak ciphers in `hyper`, mitigating cipher-related vulnerabilities.
*   Man-in-the-Middle Attacks: Medium Risk Reduction - Strengthens TLS security in `hyper`, making MITM attacks more difficult.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Step 2 (Protocol Versions): TLS 1.2 is likely the minimum supported protocol in the current `hyper` configuration.
*   Step 4 (Using `hyper` options): TLS configuration is done through `rustls` or `openssl-rs` integration with `hyper`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Certificate Validation and Management](./mitigation_strategies/certificate_validation_and_management.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Certificate Validation and Management

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Ensure that certificate validation is enabled in `hyper`'s TLS configuration, especially when acting as an HTTP client. Verify server certificates against trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs) when using `hyper` to make client requests.
*   Step 2: Implement robust certificate management practices for certificates used by your `hyper` application. This includes secure storage of private keys (e.g., using hardware security modules or encrypted storage), restricted access to keys, and regular key rotation for certificates used with `hyper`.
*   Step 3: For server certificates used with `hyper`, ensure they are obtained from reputable CAs and are valid for the domain(s) they are serving. Regularly monitor certificate expiration and renew certificates before they expire for your `hyper` servers.
*   Step 4: If using client-side certificates for mutual TLS (mTLS) with `hyper`, implement secure handling and storage of client certificates and private keys on both the client and server sides of your `hyper` application.
*   Step 5: Consider using certificate pinning for critical connections made by or to your `hyper` application to further enhance security by restricting accepted certificates to a predefined set. However, implement pinning carefully with a robust update mechanism in your `hyper` configuration.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (High Severity): Improper certificate validation in `hyper` can allow attackers to impersonate legitimate servers when your `hyper` application acts as a client.

## Mitigation Strategy: [HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) Implementation](./mitigation_strategies/hsts__http_strict_transport_security__implementation.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) Implementation

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Configure your `hyper` application to set the `Strict-Transport-Security` header in all HTTPS responses generated by `hyper`. This header instructs browsers to only communicate with the server over HTTPS in the future when interacting with your `hyper` application.
*   Step 2: Set appropriate `max-age` directive in the HSTS header sent by your `hyper` application. Start with a shorter duration (e.g., a few weeks or months) and gradually increase it as confidence grows in HTTPS deployment. Consider using `includeSubDomains` directive if applicable to enforce HSTS for all subdomains served by your `hyper` application.
*   Step 3: Ensure HSTS is configured correctly for the primary domain and all relevant subdomains served by your `hyper` application. Verify that the header is consistently sent in HTTPS responses generated by `hyper` and not in HTTP responses.
*   Step 4: Consider preloading the domain in HSTS preload lists maintained by browsers for domains served by your `hyper` application. This further enhances security by ensuring HSTS is enforced even for the first visit to the domain.
*   Step 5: Regularly monitor HSTS configuration in your `hyper` application and ensure it remains correctly implemented. Check for any misconfigurations or regressions that might weaken HSTS enforcement in your `hyper` setup.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Protocol Downgrade Attacks (Medium to High Severity): Prevents downgrade attacks by forcing browsers to use HTTPS even if a user types `http://` or clicks on an HTTP link when interacting with your `hyper` application.
*   Cookie Hijacking (Medium Severity): Reduces the risk of cookie hijacking by ensuring secure HTTPS connections for all communication with your `hyper` application.
*   Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (Medium Severity): Makes MITM attacks more difficult by enforcing HTTPS and preventing interception of initial HTTP redirects to HTTPS for your `hyper` application.

**Impact:**
*   Protocol Downgrade Attacks: High Risk Reduction - Effectively prevents protocol downgrade attacks for subsequent visits after HSTS is set by your `hyper` application.
*   Cookie Hijacking: Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces cookie hijacking risk by enforcing HTTPS for your `hyper` application.
