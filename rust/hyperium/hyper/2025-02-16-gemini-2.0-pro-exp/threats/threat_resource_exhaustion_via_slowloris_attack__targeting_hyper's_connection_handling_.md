# Deep Analysis: Resource Exhaustion via Slowloris Attack (Hyper)

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the "Resource Exhaustion via Slowloris Attack" threat targeting a Hyper-based application, as identified in the threat model.  This analysis aims to:

*   Understand the precise mechanics of how a Slowloris attack exploits Hyper's connection handling.
*   Identify specific vulnerabilities within Hyper's components and configuration that contribute to the attack's success.
*   Evaluate the effectiveness of proposed mitigation strategies and identify potential gaps or weaknesses.
*   Provide concrete recommendations for developers to harden their Hyper-based applications against Slowloris attacks.
*   Determine how to test the effectiveness of mitigations.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the Slowloris attack vector against applications built using the Hyper library (https://github.com/hyperium/hyper).  It considers:

*   **Hyper's HTTP/1.x implementation:**  The primary focus is on `hyper::server::conn` and `hyper::proto::h1::io`, as these are directly involved in handling HTTP/1.x connections and I/O.
*   **Tokio Runtime Interaction:**  The analysis acknowledges the role of the underlying Tokio runtime in managing asynchronous tasks and its potential impact on resource exhaustion.
*   **Configuration Options:**  The analysis examines Hyper's configuration options related to timeouts, connection limits, and other relevant settings.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**  The analysis evaluates the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation strategies, including aggressive timeouts, connection limits, and rate limiting.
*   **External Components (Limited Scope):** While the primary focus is on Hyper itself, the analysis briefly considers the role of external components like reverse proxies and load balancers in mitigating Slowloris attacks.  Detailed analysis of these external components is out of scope.

### 1.3. Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Code Review:**  Examine the relevant source code of Hyper (specifically `hyper::server::conn` and `hyper::proto::h1::io`) to understand how connections are established, maintained, and timed out.  This includes analyzing the interaction with the Tokio runtime.
2.  **Documentation Review:**  Thoroughly review Hyper's official documentation, including API documentation, guides, and examples, to understand the intended behavior and configuration options related to connection handling and timeouts.
3.  **Experimentation (Proof-of-Concept):**  Develop a simple Hyper-based server and simulate a Slowloris attack using tools like `slowhttptest` or custom scripts.  This will allow for observation of the attack's impact and the effectiveness of different mitigation strategies.
4.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  Based on the code review, documentation review, and experimentation, identify specific vulnerabilities and weaknesses that make Hyper susceptible to Slowloris attacks.
5.  **Mitigation Evaluation:**  Assess the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation strategies (aggressive timeouts, connection limits, rate limiting) by implementing them in the test server and observing their impact on the simulated attack.
6.  **Recommendation Generation:**  Based on the analysis, provide concrete and actionable recommendations for developers to harden their Hyper-based applications against Slowloris attacks.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

### 2.1. Attack Mechanics

A Slowloris attack exploits the way HTTP servers, including those built with Hyper, handle persistent connections (keep-alive).  The attack works as follows:

1.  **Multiple Connections:** The attacker initiates numerous TCP connections to the target server.
2.  **Partial Requests:**  Instead of sending complete HTTP requests, the attacker sends only partial requests.  For example, they might send the initial request line and a few headers, but deliberately omit the final `\r\n\r\n` sequence that signals the end of the headers.
3.  **Slow Data Transmission:** The attacker sends data very slowly, often just a few bytes at a time, with long delays between transmissions.  This keeps the connection alive and consumes server resources.
4.  **Resource Exhaustion:**  The server, expecting the completion of the request, keeps the connection open and allocates resources (memory, threads/tasks) to handle it.  As the attacker opens more and more slow connections, the server's resources are gradually exhausted, leading to a denial of service for legitimate clients.

### 2.2. Hyper-Specific Vulnerabilities

While Hyper is designed for performance and efficiency, certain aspects of its default behavior and configuration can make it vulnerable to Slowloris attacks:

*   **Default Timeouts:**  If timeouts are not explicitly configured, Hyper may use relatively long default timeouts (or rely on the underlying OS defaults).  This allows an attacker to hold connections open for extended periods, consuming resources.
*   **Unlimited Connections (by default):**  By default, Hyper might not impose a strict limit on the number of concurrent connections.  This allows an attacker to establish a large number of slow connections, potentially overwhelming the server.
*   **Tokio Task Management:**  Each connection in Hyper is typically handled by a separate asynchronous task within the Tokio runtime.  While Tokio is highly efficient, a massive number of slow connections can still lead to a large number of tasks, potentially impacting the scheduler and overall performance.
*   **HTTP/1.x Keep-Alive:**  Hyper's support for HTTP/1.x keep-alive connections, while beneficial for performance in normal scenarios, is a key enabler for Slowloris attacks.  The attacker exploits the server's willingness to keep connections open for subsequent requests.

### 2.3. Mitigation Strategy Evaluation

Let's evaluate the proposed mitigation strategies in detail:

*   **Aggressive Timeouts (Crucial):**
    *   **`http1_read_timeout`:** This is the *most critical* setting.  It controls how long Hyper will wait for data to be received on a connection *before* closing it.  A short timeout (e.g., a few seconds) is essential to prevent Slowloris attacks.  The attacker's slow data transmission will trigger this timeout, causing Hyper to close the connection and free up resources.
    *   **`http1_write_timeout`:**  This controls how long Hyper will wait to send data.  While less critical for Slowloris (which focuses on slow *reading*), a reasonable write timeout is still good practice.
    *   **`http1_keep_alive`:** This setting can be used to disable keep-alive connections entirely. While effective against Slowloris, it can significantly impact performance for legitimate clients.  A better approach is to use short read/write timeouts *in conjunction with* keep-alive.
    *   **Effectiveness:**  *High*.  Aggressive timeouts are the primary defense against Slowloris.
    *   **Potential Gaps:**  Setting timeouts *too* low can impact legitimate clients with slow network connections.  Finding the right balance is crucial.

*   **Connection Limits (Within Hyper or Externally):**
    *   **Hyper Configuration:** Hyper allows setting limits on the number of concurrent connections.  This can help prevent an attacker from completely overwhelming the server.
    *   **External Load Balancer:**  A load balancer or reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy) can also enforce connection limits, providing an additional layer of defense.
    *   **Effectiveness:**  *Medium*.  Connection limits can mitigate the *severity* of a Slowloris attack, but they don't prevent it entirely.  An attacker can still exhaust resources within the allowed connection limit.
    *   **Potential Gaps:**  Setting the connection limit too low can impact legitimate users.  The limit needs to be carefully tuned based on expected traffic.

*   **Rate Limiting (Ideally External):**
    *   **External Load Balancer/Reverse Proxy:**  Rate limiting is best implemented *before* requests reach the Hyper server.  A reverse proxy or load balancer can track the number of requests from a particular IP address or client and throttle them if they exceed a predefined limit.
    *   **Effectiveness:**  *High*.  Rate limiting can effectively prevent Slowloris attacks by limiting the number of connections an attacker can establish.
    *   **Potential Gaps:**  Rate limiting can be complex to configure correctly.  It can also be bypassed by attackers using distributed attacks (multiple IP addresses).  It's also not a feature built directly into Hyper.

### 2.4. Testing Mitigation Effectiveness

Testing is crucial to ensure that mitigations are effective.  Here's a recommended approach:

1.  **Baseline Test:**  Establish a baseline performance profile of the Hyper server *without* any mitigations, under normal load.  Measure metrics like requests per second, latency, and resource usage (CPU, memory).
2.  **Slowloris Attack (No Mitigations):**  Launch a Slowloris attack against the unmitigated server using a tool like `slowhttptest`.  Observe the impact on performance and resource usage.  The server should become unresponsive.
3.  **Implement Timeouts:**  Configure aggressive read and write timeouts in Hyper (`http1_read_timeout`, `http1_write_timeout`).  Repeat the Slowloris attack and observe the difference.  The server should remain responsive, and the attack should be mitigated.
4.  **Implement Connection Limits:**  Add connection limits (either within Hyper or using an external load balancer).  Repeat the Slowloris attack.  Observe the impact on the attack's effectiveness.
5.  **Implement Rate Limiting (External):**  Configure rate limiting using a reverse proxy or load balancer.  Repeat the Slowloris attack.  The attack should be effectively blocked.
6.  **Combined Mitigations:**  Test the server with all mitigations enabled (timeouts, connection limits, rate limiting).  This provides the most robust defense.
7.  **Legitimate Client Testing:**  Ensure that legitimate clients with varying network conditions are still able to connect and use the server reliably, even with the mitigations in place.

### 2.5. Recommendations

1.  **Mandatory Aggressive Timeouts:**  Developers *must* configure short `http1_read_timeout` and `http1_write_timeout` values in their Hyper server configuration.  Values in the range of 1-5 seconds for `http1_read_timeout` are generally recommended, but this should be tuned based on the specific application's needs.
2.  **Connection Limits:**  Implement connection limits, either within Hyper or using an external load balancer.  The specific limit should be determined based on expected traffic and server capacity.
3.  **External Rate Limiting:**  Strongly recommend using an external reverse proxy or load balancer (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy) to implement rate limiting.  This provides the most effective defense against Slowloris and other DoS attacks.
4.  **Monitoring:**  Implement monitoring to track connection statistics, resource usage, and error rates.  This will help detect and respond to Slowloris attacks in real-time.
5.  **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including Slowloris susceptibility.
6.  **Keep Hyper Updated:** Regularly update to the latest version of Hyper to benefit from security patches and improvements.
7.  **Consider HTTP/2 or HTTP/3:** While this analysis focused on HTTP/1.x, migrating to HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 can offer inherent protection against Slowloris due to their multiplexing capabilities.  A single connection can handle multiple requests, making it much harder for an attacker to exhaust resources with slow connections.

By implementing these recommendations, developers can significantly reduce the risk of Slowloris attacks against their Hyper-based applications and ensure the availability and reliability of their services.
