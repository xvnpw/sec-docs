# Deep Analysis: HPACK Bomb (HTTP/2 Header Compression Bomb) in Hyper

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the HPACK Bomb threat within the context of a Hyper-based application, assess its potential impact, evaluate the effectiveness of proposed mitigations, and identify any gaps in protection.  We aim to provide actionable recommendations to the development team to ensure robust defense against this specific DoS attack.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on:

*   The `hyper::proto::h2` module and its interaction with the `hpack` crate.
*   HTTP/2 request processing within Hyper.
*   The effectiveness of `hyper::server::conn::Builder::max_header_list_size` and other potential configuration options.
*   The interaction between Hyper and external components like WAFs in mitigating this threat.
*   The attack surface presented by HTTP/2 header compression.
*   The analysis will *not* cover general HTTP/1.x vulnerabilities, unrelated DoS attacks, or vulnerabilities outside of Hyper's HTTP/2 implementation.

### 1.3. Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methodologies:

*   **Code Review:**  Examine the relevant source code of `hyper::proto::h2` and the `hpack` crate to understand the decompression process, identify potential vulnerabilities, and verify the implementation of size limits.
*   **Documentation Review:**  Thoroughly review Hyper's official documentation, including configuration options, best practices, and security advisories related to HTTP/2 and header compression.
*   **Testing (Conceptual):**  Describe how we would conceptually test the application's resilience to HPACK bombs, including the creation of malicious payloads and monitoring resource consumption.  (Actual penetration testing is outside the scope of this document, but the methodology is described).
*   **Threat Modeling:**  Refine the existing threat model entry by considering various attack vectors and potential bypasses of mitigations.
*   **Best Practices Research:**  Consult industry best practices and security recommendations for mitigating HTTP/2-specific DoS attacks.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the HPACK Bomb Threat

### 2.1. Threat Mechanism

An HPACK Bomb exploits the compression algorithm used in HTTP/2 (HPACK) to cause resource exhaustion on the server.  Here's a breakdown:

1.  **Compression Context:** HPACK maintains a dynamic table (shared between client and server) that stores frequently used header fields.  This table is used to reduce the size of subsequent headers by referencing entries in the table instead of sending the full header value.

2.  **Attacker Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a series of HTTP/2 requests that strategically populate the dynamic table with entries designed to maximize the expansion ratio.  This can involve:
    *   **Large Header Values:**  Sending headers with very large values that are then added to the dynamic table.
    *   **References to Large Entries:**  Subsequent requests reference these large entries, causing them to be repeatedly decompressed.
    *   **Dynamic Table Poisoning:**  The attacker may try to fill the dynamic table with useless, large entries, displacing legitimate entries and increasing the size of future headers.

3.  **Resource Exhaustion:**  When Hyper's `hpack` decoder processes a malicious request, it attempts to decompress the headers.  Due to the attacker's manipulation, this decompression can result in a massive expansion of the header data, consuming significant CPU and memory resources.  This can lead to:
    *   **CPU Overload:**  The server spends excessive CPU cycles on decompression, slowing down or halting the processing of legitimate requests.
    *   **Memory Exhaustion:**  The expanded header data may exceed available memory, causing the server to crash or become unresponsive.  This is the more likely outcome.

### 2.2. Hyper-Specific Considerations

*   **`hpack` Crate:** Hyper relies on the external `hpack` crate for HPACK encoding and decoding.  Therefore, the security of Hyper's HTTP/2 implementation is directly tied to the security and robustness of `hpack`.  It's crucial to ensure that `hpack` is kept up-to-date to benefit from any security patches or improvements.
*   **`hyper::proto::h2`:** This module handles the overall HTTP/2 protocol logic, including the interaction with `hpack`.  It's responsible for enforcing limits and managing the connection state.
*   **`max_header_list_size`:** This configuration option (available through `hyper::server::conn::Builder`) is the *primary* defense mechanism within Hyper.  It sets a limit on the total size (in bytes) of the *decompressed* headers.  A crucial aspect of this analysis is determining the appropriate value for this setting.  Too low, and legitimate requests might be blocked.  Too high, and the server remains vulnerable.
*   **Stream Multiplexing:** HTTP/2 allows multiple requests (streams) to be multiplexed over a single connection.  An attacker could potentially launch an HPACK bomb on one stream while other streams are active, impacting the performance of those other streams.
* **Dynamic Table Size Limits:** While `max_header_list_size` limits the size of a single header list, the dynamic table itself also has a size limit.  The attacker might try to manipulate this table to their advantage, even if individual header lists are constrained.  Hyper and `hpack` should have sensible defaults and potentially configurable limits for the dynamic table size.

### 2.3. Mitigation Strategy Evaluation

*   **`max_header_list_size` (Effectiveness: High, but requires careful tuning):**
    *   **Pros:**  Directly addresses the core issue of excessive header size.  Implemented within Hyper, providing a low-level defense.
    *   **Cons:**  Requires careful configuration.  A value that's too restrictive can break legitimate applications.  Doesn't prevent dynamic table manipulation *per se*, but limits its impact.
    *   **Recommendation:**  Start with a conservative value (e.g., 8KB or 16KB) and monitor for any issues with legitimate traffic.  Gradually increase the limit if necessary, while closely monitoring resource usage.  Document the chosen value and the rationale behind it.  Consider providing different limits based on the route or application context.

*   **Resource Monitoring (Effectiveness: Medium, for detection and response):**
    *   **Pros:**  Provides visibility into potential attacks.  Allows for proactive response (e.g., terminating connections, blocking IPs).
    *   **Cons:**  Doesn't prevent the attack itself.  Requires a robust monitoring infrastructure.  May generate false positives.
    *   **Recommendation:**  Implement comprehensive monitoring of CPU and memory usage, specifically focusing on processes related to Hyper.  Set up alerts for unusual spikes in resource consumption.  Correlate these alerts with HTTP/2 traffic patterns.

*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF) (Effectiveness: High, if properly configured):**
    *   **Pros:**  Can provide an additional layer of defense, often with pre-configured rules for detecting HPACK bombs.  May offer more sophisticated mitigation techniques (e.g., rate limiting, connection throttling).
    *   **Cons:**  Requires a WAF that specifically supports HTTP/2 and HPACK bomb detection.  May introduce latency.  Configuration complexity.
    *   **Recommendation:**  If a WAF is used, ensure it's configured to inspect HTTP/2 traffic and has rules enabled for HPACK bomb mitigation.  Regularly review and update the WAF's ruleset.

* **Dynamic Table Size Limit** (Effectiveness: Medium)
    * **Pros:** Prevents the dynamic table from growing unboundedly, limiting the potential for long-term resource exhaustion.
    * **Cons:** Attackers can still manipulate the table within the allowed size.
    * **Recommendation:** Review the default dynamic table size limit in `hpack` and Hyper.  Consider making this limit configurable, allowing administrators to tune it based on their needs and risk tolerance.

### 2.4. Potential Attack Vectors and Bypasses

*   **Slowloris-Style HPACK Bomb:**  An attacker could send a series of requests that slowly build up the dynamic table, gradually increasing the size of subsequent headers.  This could evade detection mechanisms that focus on sudden spikes in resource usage.
*   **Multiple Connections:**  An attacker could open multiple connections to the server and launch HPACK bombs on each connection, amplifying the impact.
*   **Bypassing `max_header_list_size` (Unlikely, but worth considering):**  If there are any bugs or edge cases in the `hpack` decoder or Hyper's handling of header limits, an attacker might be able to craft a payload that bypasses the size restriction.  This highlights the importance of code review and fuzzing.
*   **Targeting Specific Header Fields:**  The attacker might focus on specific header fields that are known to be large or frequently used, maximizing the impact of their attack.

### 2.5. Testing Methodology (Conceptual)

1.  **Test Environment:**  Set up a test environment that mirrors the production environment as closely as possible, including the same version of Hyper, `hpack`, and any relevant configuration settings.

2.  **Payload Generation:**  Create a tool or script to generate malicious HTTP/2 requests with compressed headers designed to expand to various sizes.  This tool should allow for:
    *   Controlling the size of individual header values.
    *   Referencing previously defined entries in the dynamic table.
    *   Adjusting the rate at which requests are sent.

3.  **Resource Monitoring:**  Configure monitoring tools to track CPU and memory usage of the Hyper process.

4.  **Test Execution:**
    *   **Baseline Test:**  Send legitimate requests to establish a baseline for resource consumption.
    *   **HPACK Bomb Tests:**  Send a series of malicious requests with varying payload sizes and rates.
    *   **Monitor Resource Usage:**  Observe the impact of the malicious requests on CPU and memory usage.
    *   **Vary `max_header_list_size`:**  Repeat the tests with different values for `max_header_list_size` to determine the optimal setting.
    *   **Test for Bypasses:**  Attempt to craft payloads that might bypass the size limits.

5.  **Analysis:**  Analyze the test results to:
    *   Determine the effectiveness of `max_header_list_size`.
    *   Identify any vulnerabilities or weaknesses in Hyper's handling of HPACK.
    *   Refine the monitoring thresholds.

## 3. Recommendations

1.  **Set `max_header_list_size` to a Conservative Value:**  Implement a strict limit on the maximum decompressed header size.  Start with a conservative value (e.g., 8KB or 16KB) and adjust as needed based on testing and monitoring.
2.  **Implement Resource Monitoring:**  Establish comprehensive monitoring of CPU and memory usage, with alerts for unusual spikes.
3.  **Keep `hpack` Updated:**  Ensure that the `hpack` crate is kept up-to-date to benefit from security patches.
4.  **Review and Configure WAF:**  If a WAF is used, ensure it's configured to protect against HPACK bombs.
5.  **Consider Dynamic Table Size Limits:**  Review and potentially configure the dynamic table size limit.
6.  **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
7.  **Fuzz Testing:** Consider fuzz testing the `hpack` decoder and Hyper's HTTP/2 implementation to uncover potential edge cases and vulnerabilities.
8. **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on the number of HTTP/2 requests per connection or per IP address to mitigate slowloris-style attacks.

## 4. Conclusion

The HPACK Bomb is a serious threat to Hyper-based applications, but it can be effectively mitigated through a combination of careful configuration, resource monitoring, and the use of a WAF.  By implementing the recommendations outlined in this analysis, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of a successful DoS attack.  Continuous monitoring and regular security reviews are essential to maintain a strong security posture.
