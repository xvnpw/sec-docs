# Deep Analysis: Limit Decoded Header Size (HTTP/2) in `hyper`

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness and completeness of the "Limit Decoded Header Size (HTTP/2)" mitigation strategy within our application, which utilizes the `hyper` library.  We aim to:

*   Verify the correct implementation of the strategy on both the server and client sides.
*   Assess the chosen limit (8KB) for its suitability against potential threats and legitimate use cases.
*   Identify any gaps in error handling related to this limit.
*   Provide concrete recommendations for improvement and further hardening.
*   Ensure the development team understands the implications of this configuration.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the `max_header_list_size` configuration within `hyper`'s HTTP/2 implementation.  It covers:

*   **Server-side configuration:**  How `hyper::server::conn::http2::Builder::max_header_list_size` is used and its impact.
*   **Client-side configuration:** How `hyper::client::conn::http2::Builder::max_header_list_size` is used (or should be used) and its impact.
*   **Error handling:**  The application's response to `hyper` errors triggered by exceeding the header size limit.
*   **Threat model:**  The specific threats (HPACK Bomb, Large Header Attacks) this mitigation addresses.
*   **Performance considerations:**  Potential (though likely minimal) performance implications of the chosen limit.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Other HTTP/2 settings in `hyper` (unless directly related to header size limits).
*   HTTP/1.x specific vulnerabilities or mitigations.
*   Application-level header validation (beyond size limits).
*   Network-level protections (e.g., firewalls, WAFs).

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methods:

1.  **Code Review:**  Examine the codebase (specifically `src/server.rs` and any client-related code) to verify the `max_header_list_size` configuration and error handling.
2.  **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools (if available) to identify potential issues related to error handling and resource usage.
3.  **Testing:**
    *   **Unit Tests:**  Create or review unit tests that specifically trigger the header size limit and verify the expected error response (both server and client).
    *   **Integration Tests:**  Perform integration tests with realistic and oversized headers to confirm the behavior in a more complete environment.
    *   **Fuzz Testing (Optional):**  If feasible, use a fuzzing tool to send a variety of malformed and oversized headers to test the robustness of the implementation.
4.  **Documentation Review:**  Review relevant `hyper` documentation and HTTP/2 specifications (RFC 7540, RFC 7541) to ensure compliance and best practices.
5.  **Threat Modeling:**  Re-evaluate the threat model to confirm the chosen limit adequately addresses the identified risks.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Mitigation Strategy

### 4.1. Server-Side Implementation

*   **Current Status:**  `max_header_list_size` is set to 8KB in `src/server.rs`.  This is a good starting point and provides a reasonable level of protection.
*   **Code Review Findings:** (Assume the following code snippet exists in `src/server.rs`)

    ```rust
    // Example (Illustrative - Adapt to your actual code)
    let h2 = hyper::server::conn::http2::Builder::new()
        .max_header_list_size(8 * 1024) // 8KB
        .handshake(incoming)
        .await?;
    ```

    *   The code correctly uses `max_header_list_size` to set the limit.
    *   The value is explicitly set in bytes (8 * 1024), which is good practice for clarity.
*   **Error Handling (Server):**
    *   **Requirement:** The application *must* handle the `hyper::Error` that is returned when the header list size is exceeded.  This error will likely be a variant of `hyper::Error::HeaderTooBig`.
    *   **Code Review (Example):**

        ```rust
        // Example (Illustrative - Adapt to your actual code)
        if let Err(err) = h2.await {
            if err.is_header_too_big() { // Or a more specific check
                // Send a 431 Request Header Fields Too Large response
                let mut res = Response::new(Body::empty());
                *res.status_mut() = StatusCode::REQUEST_HEADER_FIELDS_TOO_LARGE;
                if let Err(send_err) = tx.send(res).await { // Assuming a channel 'tx' for sending responses
                    eprintln!("Failed to send 431 response: {:?}", send_err);
                }
            } else {
                // Handle other errors appropriately
                eprintln!("HTTP/2 connection error: {:?}", err);
            }
        }
        ```
    *   **Assessment:**  The code *must* include a check for `err.is_header_too_big()` (or a similar, specific check) and return a 431 status code.  Without this, the server might crash or exhibit undefined behavior.  The example above demonstrates the *correct* approach.  **Verify this is implemented in your actual code.**
*   **Testing (Server):**
    *   **Unit Test:** A unit test should send a request with headers exceeding 8KB and assert that the server returns a 431 status code.
    *   **Integration Test:**  Similar to the unit test, but in a more realistic environment.

### 4.2. Client-Side Implementation

*   **Current Status:**  The client-side `max_header_list_size` is *not* explicitly configured. This is a **critical gap**.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  The client *must* also limit the size of decoded headers it accepts from the server.  Without this, the client is vulnerable to HPACK bombs and large header attacks originating from a malicious or compromised server.
*   **Recommendation:**  Implement `max_header_list_size` on the client side using `hyper::client::conn::http2::Builder::max_header_list_size`.  Choose a reasonable limit, likely the same 8KB used on the server, or potentially larger if the client expects larger headers from specific, trusted servers.
*   **Code Example (Client):**

    ```rust
    // Example (Illustrative - Adapt to your actual code)
    let (mut request_sender, connection) = hyper::client::conn::http2::Builder::new()
        .max_header_list_size(8 * 1024) // 8KB - Match server, or adjust as needed
        .handshake(stream) // Assuming 'stream' is your connection to the server
        .await?;

    // Spawn a task to run the connection
    tokio::spawn(async move {
        if let Err(e) = connection.await {
            eprintln!("Client connection error: {:?}", e);
        }
    });
    ```
*   **Error Handling (Client):**
    *   **Requirement:**  Similar to the server, the client code must handle `hyper::Error::HeaderTooBig` (or equivalent) gracefully.  This might involve logging the error, closing the connection, and potentially retrying with a different server (if applicable).  It should *not* crash the client.
    *   **Example:**  The error handling would be similar to the server-side example, but the action taken would be different (e.g., closing the connection instead of sending a 431).
*   **Testing (Client):**
    *   **Unit Test:**  This is more challenging to test directly without a mock server.  However, you can create a mock `AsyncRead` and `AsyncWrite` implementation that simulates a server sending oversized headers.
    *   **Integration Test:**  This is crucial.  Set up a test server (or use a publicly available test server known to send large headers) and verify that the client correctly handles the oversized headers and doesn't crash.

### 4.3. Threat Model and Limit Justification

*   **HPACK Bomb:**  The 8KB limit effectively mitigates HPACK bomb attacks.  HPACK bombs rely on highly compressed headers that expand to a much larger size.  8KB is small enough to prevent excessive memory allocation.
*   **Large Header Attacks:**  8KB is generally sufficient to prevent most large header attacks.  However, legitimate use cases might require larger headers (e.g., large cookies, JWTs, custom headers).
*   **Limit Justification:**  8KB is a reasonable default, but consider:
    *   **Expected Header Sizes:**  Analyze your application's typical header sizes.  If legitimate requests routinely exceed 8KB, you'll need to increase the limit.
    *   **Security vs. Functionality:**  A smaller limit provides better security but might break legitimate requests.  A larger limit increases the attack surface but accommodates larger headers.
    *   **Monitoring:**  Implement monitoring to track header sizes.  This will help you identify potential attacks and fine-tune the limit over time.  Log any instances where the limit is hit.

### 4.4. Performance Considerations

*   The performance impact of `max_header_list_size` is generally negligible.  The HPACK decoding process is efficient, and the limit only adds a simple size check.
*   However, *very* small limits (e.g., a few hundred bytes) could theoretically impact performance by causing more frequent errors and connection resets.  8KB is well above this threshold.

## 5. Recommendations

1.  **Implement `max_header_list_size` on the Client:** This is the most critical recommendation.  The client is currently vulnerable without this configuration.
2.  **Thoroughly Test Error Handling:**  Ensure both the server and client code correctly handle `hyper::Error::HeaderTooBig` (or equivalent) and respond appropriately (431 on the server, connection closure on the client).  Write unit and integration tests to verify this.
3.  **Review and Potentially Adjust the Limit:**  8KB is a good starting point, but monitor header sizes and adjust the limit if necessary to balance security and functionality.
4.  **Document the Configuration:**  Clearly document the chosen `max_header_list_size` values and the rationale behind them.  This is important for maintainability and future security reviews.
5.  **Consider Fuzz Testing:** If resources permit, fuzz testing can help identify edge cases and improve the robustness of the implementation.
6. **Implement Monitoring:** Monitor for the frequency of `HeaderTooBig` errors. This will help you to identify if the limit is too low for legitimate traffic, or if you are under attack.

## 6. Conclusion

The "Limit Decoded Header Size (HTTP/2)" mitigation strategy is crucial for protecting against HPACK bombs and large header attacks.  The server-side implementation is a good start, but the **missing client-side configuration is a significant vulnerability**.  By implementing the recommendations above, the development team can significantly improve the security and resilience of the application.  The combination of proper configuration, robust error handling, and thorough testing is essential for effective mitigation.
