# Deep Analysis: HTTP Request Smuggling/Splitting in Hyper

## 1. Objective of Deep Analysis

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the risks associated with HTTP Request Smuggling/Splitting vulnerabilities within applications leveraging the Hyper (https://github.com/hyperium/hyper) HTTP library.  This includes identifying specific code paths within Hyper that could be exploited, understanding the potential impact on applications, and defining robust mitigation strategies beyond simple version updates.  We aim to provide actionable guidance for developers to proactively secure their applications.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on:

*   **Hyper's HTTP/1.1 parser:**  We will examine how Hyper processes incoming HTTP/1.1 requests, paying close attention to header parsing, particularly `Transfer-Encoding`, `Content-Length`, and related headers (e.g., `TE`, malformed chunk extensions).
*   **Interaction with downstream systems:**  While the core vulnerability lies in Hyper's parsing, we'll consider how discrepancies between Hyper's interpretation and that of downstream systems (proxies, application servers, caches) exacerbate the risk.
*   **Hyper versions:** We will consider the evolution of Hyper's handling of these headers across different versions, identifying any known fixed vulnerabilities and potential regressions.
*   **Exclusion:** This analysis *does not* cover general HTTP/2 vulnerabilities, general denial-of-service attacks (unless directly related to request smuggling), or vulnerabilities in application logic *unrelated* to Hyper's HTTP parsing.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methodologies:

1.  **Code Review:**  A detailed examination of Hyper's source code, specifically focusing on the `src/proto/h1` directory (and related modules) responsible for HTTP/1.1 parsing.  We will trace the execution flow for requests with various combinations of `Transfer-Encoding` and `Content-Length` headers.  We will use tools like `grep`, `rg` (ripgrep), and code editors with "find all references" functionality to identify relevant code sections.
2.  **Vulnerability Research:**  Reviewing existing CVEs, security advisories, blog posts, and research papers related to HTTP Request Smuggling in general and, if available, specifically targeting Hyper or similar Rust-based HTTP libraries.
3.  **Fuzz Testing (Conceptual Design):**  We will outline a fuzz testing strategy specifically designed to target the identified attack surface.  This will include defining input generation techniques and expected behavior checks.  We won't *execute* the fuzzing here, but we'll define the *approach*.
4.  **Differential Analysis:**  Comparing Hyper's behavior to the expected behavior defined in relevant RFCs (e.g., RFC 7230, RFC 9112) to identify any deviations that could lead to smuggling vulnerabilities.
5.  **Impact Assessment:**  Analyzing the potential consequences of successful exploitation, considering various application architectures and deployment scenarios.

## 4. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

### 4.1. Hyper's HTTP/1.1 Parsing (Code Review Focus)

Hyper's HTTP/1.1 parsing logic is primarily located in the `src/proto/h1` directory of the repository. Key files and areas of interest include:

*   **`src/proto/h1/decode.rs`:** This file contains the core logic for decoding incoming HTTP/1.1 requests.  We need to examine the functions responsible for parsing headers, particularly:
    *   `parse_headers`:  How are headers extracted and validated?  Are there any checks for duplicate headers or conflicting `Transfer-Encoding` and `Content-Length` values?
    *   `decode_chunked`:  How is chunked transfer encoding handled?  Are there checks for malformed chunk sizes, invalid chunk extensions, or premature termination of the chunked stream?
    *   `try_parse_message`: How the request line and headers are parsed.
*   **`src/proto/h1/role.rs`:** Defines roles (client/server) and associated state machines.  While less directly related to parsing, understanding the state transitions can help identify potential edge cases.
*   **`src/proto/h1/conn.rs`:**  Manages the connection and I/O.  We need to understand how data is read from the socket and passed to the decoder.
*   **`src/proto/h1/mod.rs`:**  The main module for HTTP/1.1.

**Specific Code Review Questions:**

*   **Duplicate Headers:** Does Hyper reject requests with duplicate `Transfer-Encoding` or `Content-Length` headers?  If not, how does it prioritize them?
*   **Conflicting Headers:** How does Hyper handle requests with *both* `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` and `Content-Length` headers?  Which one takes precedence?  Is this behavior consistent across all versions?
*   **Chunked Encoding Validation:**  Are chunk sizes strictly validated?  Are negative or excessively large chunk sizes rejected?  Are chunk extensions parsed and validated?  Are there any potential integer overflow vulnerabilities in chunk size calculations?
*   **Whitespace Handling:**  How does Hyper handle whitespace around header names and values?  Are there any ambiguities that could be exploited?  (e.g., `Transfer-Encoding : chunked` vs. `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`)
*   **Line Endings:**  Does Hyper strictly enforce CRLF line endings?  Could variations (e.g., LF only) lead to misinterpretation?
*   **Header Folding:** Does Hyper support (or reject) header folding (deprecated in RFC 7230)? If supported, is it handled correctly?
*   **Connection: close:** How is the `Connection: close` header handled in conjunction with `Transfer-Encoding` and `Content-Length`?

### 4.2. Vulnerability Research

We need to search for:

*   **CVEs related to Hyper:**  Check the CVE database for any previously reported vulnerabilities in Hyper related to request smuggling.
*   **Security advisories from Hyper:**  Review the Hyper project's security advisories for any relevant information.
*   **Research papers and blog posts:**  Search for general information on HTTP Request Smuggling and specific examples targeting other HTTP libraries.  This can provide insights into potential attack vectors.
*   **Rust-specific HTTP library vulnerabilities:**  Investigate vulnerabilities in other Rust-based HTTP libraries (e.g., `actix-web`, `rocket`) to identify common patterns or weaknesses.

### 4.3. Fuzz Testing Strategy

A robust fuzz testing strategy is crucial for uncovering subtle parsing vulnerabilities.  Here's a conceptual design:

*   **Fuzzer:**  We would use a fuzzer like `cargo fuzz` (which integrates with libFuzzer) or `AFL++`.  These fuzzers are designed for Rust and can efficiently generate a wide range of inputs.
*   **Target:**  The fuzzing target would be a function within Hyper that takes a raw byte stream (representing an HTTP/1.1 request) as input and attempts to parse it.  This could be a wrapper around `decode::parse_headers` or a similar function.
*   **Input Generation:**  The fuzzer should generate inputs that focus on:
    *   **Variations of `Transfer-Encoding` and `Content-Length`:**  Include combinations like:
        *   `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` with a valid `Content-Length`
        *   `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` with an invalid `Content-Length`
        *   Multiple `Transfer-Encoding` headers with different values (e.g., `chunked`, `gzip`, `identity`)
        *   Multiple `Content-Length` headers with different values
        *   Malformed `Transfer-Encoding` values (e.g., `Transfer-Encoding: chunked, , gzip`)
        *   Whitespace variations around header names and values
    *   **Malformed Chunked Encoding:**
        *   Invalid chunk sizes (negative, excessively large, non-numeric)
        *   Missing or incorrect chunk terminators (CRLF)
        *   Malformed chunk extensions
        *   Premature termination of the chunked stream
    *   **Header Variations:**
        *   Long header names and values
        *   Unusual characters in header names and values
        *   Header folding (if supported)
        *   Variations in line endings (CRLF, LF, CR)
*   **Oracles (Expected Behavior Checks):**  The fuzzer needs to determine if a given input triggers a vulnerability.  We can use the following oracles:
    *   **Crash Detection:**  The fuzzer will automatically detect crashes (e.g., segmentation faults, panics) caused by memory safety issues.
    *   **Differential Comparison:**  Compare Hyper's parsing results with a known-good HTTP parser (e.g., a Python library like `httptools`).  Any discrepancies could indicate a vulnerability.
    *   **Sanitizers:**  Use Rust's sanitizers (e.g., AddressSanitizer, MemorySanitizer) to detect memory errors that might not cause immediate crashes.
    *   **Timeout Detection:**  If parsing an input takes an unusually long time, it could indicate a denial-of-service vulnerability.
    *   **Specific Error Codes:** Monitor the error codes returned by Hyper. Unexpected error codes or a lack of expected error codes could indicate a problem.

### 4.4. Differential Analysis (RFC Compliance)

We need to compare Hyper's behavior to the relevant RFCs, specifically:

*   **RFC 7230 (HTTP/1.1 Message Syntax and Routing):**  This is the primary RFC for HTTP/1.1.  We need to pay close attention to sections on:
    *   Message framing (Section 3)
    *   Header fields (Section 3.2)
    *   Transfer-Encoding (Section 3.3.1)
    *   Content-Length (Section 3.3.2)
    *   Chunked Transfer Coding (Section 4.1)
*   **RFC 9112 (HTTP/1.1):** This obsoletes RFC 7230, but the core principles remain the same.

**Key areas to compare:**

*   **Precedence of `Transfer-Encoding` and `Content-Length`:**  RFC 7230 states that if both are present, `Transfer-Encoding` *must* be processed and `Content-Length` *must* be ignored.
*   **Rejection of Invalid Messages:**  RFC 7230 requires that servers reject messages with invalid framing or conflicting headers.
*   **Chunked Encoding Rules:**  RFC 7230 defines strict rules for chunked encoding, including chunk size limits and terminator requirements.

### 4.5. Impact Assessment

Successful exploitation of HTTP Request Smuggling can have severe consequences:

*   **Cache Poisoning:**  An attacker can inject malicious content into a shared cache, affecting other users.
*   **Request Hijacking:**  An attacker can intercept and modify requests from other users.
*   **Session Fixation:**  An attacker can force a user to use a specific session ID, potentially gaining access to their account.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  An attacker can inject malicious scripts into responses, compromising the user's browser.
*   **Bypassing Security Controls:**  An attacker can bypass authentication or authorization mechanisms by smuggling requests that appear to originate from a trusted source.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** While not the primary goal of request smuggling, it can be used to cause DoS by consuming server resources or creating infinite loops.
*  **Data Exfiltration:** By smuggling requests, attackers can potentially exfiltrate sensitive data.

The specific impact depends on the application's architecture and the nature of the smuggled request.  For example, if the application uses a reverse proxy that is vulnerable to request smuggling, the attacker could potentially gain access to internal systems or data.

## 5. Mitigation Strategies (Beyond Version Updates)

While updating Hyper to the latest version is essential, it's not sufficient as a sole mitigation.  We need a layered approach:

1.  **Input Validation (Application Level):**
    *   **Whitelist Allowed Headers:**  If possible, define a whitelist of allowed HTTP headers and reject any requests containing unexpected headers.
    *   **Validate Header Values:**  Implement strict validation of header values, particularly for headers like `Content-Type`, `Host`, and any custom headers used by the application.
    *   **Sanitize User Input:**  Ensure that any user-provided data included in HTTP requests is properly sanitized to prevent injection attacks.

2.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF) (with caution):**
    *   A WAF *can* help detect and block some request smuggling attacks, but it should *not* be relied upon as the primary defense.  WAFs are often bypassable, and they can introduce their own vulnerabilities.
    *   Configure the WAF to specifically look for patterns associated with request smuggling, such as conflicting headers and malformed chunked encoding.

3.  **Proxy Configuration (If Applicable):**
    *   **Prefer HTTP/2:**  HTTP/2 is generally less susceptible to request smuggling due to its binary framing and stricter header handling.  If possible, use HTTP/2 for communication between the client and the server, and between the server and any downstream systems.
    *   **Consistent Proxy Handling:**  Ensure that all proxies in the request path (e.g., reverse proxies, load balancers) are configured to handle HTTP/1.1 requests consistently and securely.  This includes:
        *   Rejecting requests with ambiguous headers.
        *   Normalizing headers before forwarding them.
        *   Using a consistent interpretation of `Transfer-Encoding` and `Content-Length`.

4.  **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including request smuggling.

5.  **Monitoring and Alerting:**
    *   Implement monitoring and alerting to detect suspicious HTTP traffic, such as requests with unusual headers or error codes.

6. **Disable HTTP/1.1 (If Possible):** In some cases, if the application and its clients fully support HTTP/2 or HTTP/3, disabling HTTP/1.1 entirely can eliminate this attack surface. This is the most robust solution, but it requires careful consideration of compatibility.

7. **Contribute to Hyper's Security:** If vulnerabilities are found during code review or fuzzing, responsibly disclose them to the Hyper maintainers and, if possible, contribute patches to fix the issues.

## Conclusion

HTTP Request Smuggling/Splitting is a critical vulnerability that can have severe consequences for applications using Hyper.  By understanding Hyper's HTTP/1.1 parsing logic, employing robust fuzz testing, and implementing a layered defense strategy, developers can significantly reduce the risk of exploitation.  Continuous monitoring, regular security audits, and proactive engagement with the Hyper community are essential for maintaining a strong security posture.
