# Attack Surface Analysis for hyperium/hyper

## Attack Surface: [Malformed HTTP Headers Processing:](./attack_surfaces/malformed_http_headers_processing.md)

*   **Malformed HTTP Headers Processing:**
    *   **Description:** Attackers send HTTP requests with malformed or specially crafted headers designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the header parsing logic.
    *   **How Hyper Contributes:** `hyper` is responsible for parsing incoming HTTP headers. If `hyper`'s parsing logic has flaws or doesn't handle certain edge cases correctly, it can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** Sending a header with an excessively long value, containing non-ASCII characters where they are not expected, or using unusual header delimiters.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to parsing errors, unexpected application behavior, potential for bypassing security checks if header information is used for authorization or routing.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep `hyper` updated to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        *   Utilize `hyper`'s configuration options to set limits on header sizes and the number of headers.

## Attack Surface: [HTTP Request Smuggling (Potential):](./attack_surfaces/http_request_smuggling__potential_.md)

*   **HTTP Request Smuggling (Potential):**
    *   **Description:** Exploiting discrepancies in how intermediary proxies/load balancers and the backend server (using `hyper`) interpret `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers, allowing attackers to inject additional requests.
    *   **How Hyper Contributes:** While `hyper` aims to handle these headers correctly, misconfiguration or incorrect application-level logic when interacting with `hyper`'s request handling can create vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** Sending a request with conflicting `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers that are interpreted differently by the proxy and the `hyper`-based server.
    *   **Impact:** Bypassing security controls, gaining unauthorized access, cache poisoning, and potentially executing arbitrary code on the backend server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure consistent configuration of HTTP handling across all components (proxies, load balancers, `hyper` server).
        *   Preferably use HTTP/2 or later, which is less susceptible to request smuggling.
        *   Carefully review and test how the application handles requests with both `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding`.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service via Large Request Bodies:](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service_via_large_request_bodies.md)

*   **Denial of Service via Large Request Bodies:**
    *   **Description:** Attackers send requests with excessively large bodies to overwhelm the server's resources (memory, CPU).
    *   **How Hyper Contributes:** `hyper` will receive and potentially process the entire request body unless limits are explicitly set.
    *   **Example:** Sending a POST request with a multi-gigabyte payload to an endpoint that doesn't expect such large data.
    *   **Impact:** Server resource exhaustion, leading to service unavailability for legitimate users.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure `hyper` to set maximum request body size limits.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure TLS Configuration (HTTPS):](./attack_surfaces/insecure_tls_configuration__https_.md)

*   **Insecure TLS Configuration (HTTPS):**
    *   **Description:** Using weak or outdated TLS protocols and cipher suites, making the connection vulnerable to eavesdropping or man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **How Hyper Contributes:** `hyper` relies on underlying TLS libraries (like `tokio-rustls` or `native-tls`). The security of the connection depends on how these libraries are configured when used with `hyper`.
    *   **Example:** Not disabling SSLv3 or TLS 1.0, or allowing the use of weak cipher suites like RC4.
    *   **Impact:** Confidential data transmitted over HTTPS can be intercepted and decrypted by attackers.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure the TLS implementation used with `hyper` to only allow strong and up-to-date TLS protocols (TLS 1.2 or higher).
        *   Disable weak cipher suites and prioritize forward secrecy.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities:](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Dependency Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities exist in `hyper` itself or in the libraries it depends on (e.g., `tokio`, `bytes`, TLS implementations).
    *   **How Hyper Contributes:**  The application directly depends on `hyper` and indirectly on its dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited through the application.
    *   **Example:** A known security flaw in a specific version of the `tokio` crate that `hyper` uses.
    *   **Impact:**  Wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, including remote code execution, DoS, and information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update `hyper` and all its dependencies to the latest stable versions.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion due to Connection Handling:](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_due_to_connection_handling.md)

*   **Resource Exhaustion due to Connection Handling:**
    *   **Description:** Attackers open a large number of connections to the server, exhausting its resources (file descriptors, memory, CPU).
    *   **How Hyper Contributes:** `hyper` manages connections. If not configured with appropriate limits, it can be susceptible to connection exhaustion attacks.
    *   **Example:** A SYN flood attack or simply opening and holding many idle connections.
    *   **Impact:** Server becomes unresponsive to legitimate requests, leading to DoS.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure connection limits within `hyper` or the underlying TCP listener.
        *   Set appropriate timeouts for idle connections.
