```
*   *** CRITICAL NODE *** Exploit Hyper's Response Handling
    *   *** HIGH-RISK PATH *** *** CRITICAL NODE *** Exploit Header Injection Vulnerabilities
        *   Action: If the application uses Hyper to construct response headers based on user input without proper sanitization, an attacker might inject malicious headers (e.g., `Set-Cookie`, `Location`).

        *   *** CRITICAL NODE *** Open Excessive Connections
            *   Action: Open a large number of connections to the server without sending requests or closing them, exhausting server resources.
*   *** CRITICAL NODE *** Exploit Hyper's Internal Logic or Dependencies

## Attack Tree Path: [*** CRITICAL NODE *** Exploit Hyper's Response Handling](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node__exploit_hyper's_response_handling.md)

This is a critical area because it involves how the application sends data back to the client. If this process is flawed, attackers can manipulate the client's browser or intercept sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** HIGH-RISK PATH *** *** CRITICAL NODE *** Exploit Header Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path___critical_node__exploit_header_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** When an application uses user-controlled data to construct HTTP response headers without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject arbitrary headers.

**Mechanism:**  The attacker sends malicious input that gets incorporated into a response header. For example, if the application sets a header based on a user-provided name, the attacker could provide a name like `"value\r\nSet-Cookie: malicious=true\r\n"`

**Impact:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Injecting `Content-Type: text/html` and malicious JavaScript code can lead to XSS attacks, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary scripts in the user's browser.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Injecting `Set-Cookie` headers can allow the attacker to set their own session cookies, potentially hijacking a user's session.
*   **Redirection:** Injecting `Location` headers can redirect users to malicious websites.
*   **Cache Poisoning:** Injecting headers that control caching behavior can lead to the server or client caching malicious content.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** CRITICAL NODE *** Exploit Hyper's Connection Management](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node__exploit_hyper's_connection_management.md)

This is a critical area because it concerns how the server manages network connections. Vulnerabilities here can lead to denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** HIGH-RISK PATH *** *** CRITICAL NODE *** Connection Exhaustion (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path___critical_node__connection_exhaustion__dos_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker attempts to overwhelm the server by opening and maintaining a large number of connections, exhausting server resources and preventing legitimate users from connecting.

**Mechanism:** The attacker exploits the server's capacity to handle concurrent connections.

**Impact:**
*   **Service Unavailability:** The application becomes unresponsive to legitimate user requests.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** Server resources like CPU, memory, and network bandwidth are consumed, potentially impacting other services on the same infrastructure.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** CRITICAL NODE *** Open Excessive Connections](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node__open_excessive_connections.md)

**Attack Vector:**  A simple but effective way to cause connection exhaustion.

**Mechanism:** The attacker establishes numerous TCP connections to the server but either doesn't send complete requests or sends them very slowly, tying up server resources allocated to these connections.

**Impact:** Directly leads to connection exhaustion and denial of service as the server reaches its limit for open connections.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** CRITICAL NODE *** Exploit Hyper's Internal Logic or Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node__exploit_hyper's_internal_logic_or_dependencies.md)

This is a critical area because vulnerabilities within Hyper itself or its underlying libraries can have widespread impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** CRITICAL NODE *** Vulnerabilities in Hyper's Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node__vulnerabilities_in_hyper's_dependencies.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Exploiting known security vulnerabilities in libraries that Hyper relies on, such as `tokio` (for asynchronous I/O) or `bytes` (for byte buffer management).

**Mechanism:** Attackers target known vulnerabilities in these dependencies. For example, a memory corruption vulnerability in `tokio` could be triggered through specific network interactions handled by Hyper.

**Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency. It can range from:
*   **Denial of Service:** Crashing the application or making it unresponsive.
*   **Memory Corruption:** Potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Leaking sensitive data from memory.
*   **Other unexpected behavior:** Depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
