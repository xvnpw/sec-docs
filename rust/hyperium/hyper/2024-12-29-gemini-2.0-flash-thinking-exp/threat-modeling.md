### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving Hyper

Here's an updated list of high and critical threats that directly involve the `hyper` crate:

*   **Threat:** Malformed HTTP Request Handling Vulnerability
    *   **Description:** An attacker sends HTTP requests with invalid syntax, missing components, or excessively long fields. This can cause `hyper`'s parsing logic to crash, hang, or behave unpredictably.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing the server or making it unresponsive. Potential for resource exhaustion.
    *   **Affected Hyper Component:** `hyper::server::conn::http1::decode::Decoder` (for HTTP/1.1), `hyper::server::conn::http2::Recv` (for HTTP/2), header parsing logic within these components.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust error handling around request processing.
        *   Configure `hyper` with appropriate limits for header sizes and request body sizes.
        *   Use a reverse proxy or load balancer with request validation capabilities in front of the application.
        *   Regularly update `hyper` to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.

*   **Threat:** HTTP Header Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a request where data intended for the request body is interpreted as a header by the application due to improper handling of header boundaries or encoding issues *within hyper's parsing*. This can lead to the injection of arbitrary headers into the response.
    *   **Impact:** Response splitting/smuggling, cache poisoning, cross-site scripting (XSS) if attacker-controlled headers influence the response interpretation by the client.
    *   **Affected Hyper Component:** `hyper::http::HeaderMap`, potentially the request parsing logic if it doesn't strictly enforce header boundaries.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly validate and sanitize all input that is used to construct HTTP responses, especially headers.
        *   Avoid directly using raw request data to set response headers. Use `hyper`'s API for setting headers.
        *   Ensure proper encoding and escaping of data when constructing responses.

*   **Threat:** HTTP Request Smuggling
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits discrepancies in how different HTTP intermediaries (e.g., proxies, load balancers) and the backend server (using `hyper`) parse the `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers, allowing them to inject additional requests into the TCP connection. This directly involves `hyper`'s HTTP/1.1 parsing logic.
    *   **Impact:** Bypassing security controls, gaining unauthorized access, cache poisoning, request routing manipulation.
    *   **Affected Hyper Component:** `hyper::server::conn::http1::decode::Decoder`, specifically the logic handling `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure all HTTP intermediaries and the backend server have consistent configurations and interpretations of HTTP specifications.
        *   Prefer HTTP/2, which is less susceptible to request smuggling due to its framing mechanism.
        *   Configure `hyper` to be strict in its parsing of `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding`.
        *   Use a web application firewall (WAF) that can detect and prevent request smuggling attacks.

*   **Threat:** HTTP/2 Stream Multiplexing Abuse
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits the stream multiplexing feature of HTTP/2 by creating an excessive number of streams, potentially overwhelming the server's resources (memory, CPU) and leading to a denial of service. This is a vulnerability within `hyper`'s HTTP/2 implementation.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), resource exhaustion.
    *   **Affected Hyper Component:** `hyper::server::conn::http2::Recv`, specifically the stream management and flow control logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure `hyper` with appropriate limits on the maximum number of concurrent streams per connection (`SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS`).
        *   Implement connection limits to restrict the number of connections from a single client.
        *   Monitor server resource usage and implement rate limiting if necessary.

*   **Threat:** HTTP/2 Header Compression (HPACK) Bomb
    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a sequence of HTTP/2 headers that, when decompressed using HPACK *within hyper*, expand to a very large size, consuming excessive memory and potentially leading to a denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), memory exhaustion.
    *   **Affected Hyper Component:** `hyper::server::conn::http2::frame::hpack::Decoder`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure `hyper` with limits on the maximum size of the decompressed header list (`SETTINGS_MAX_HEADER_LIST_SIZE`).
        *   Regularly update `hyper` to benefit from any fixes or improvements in HPACK handling.
