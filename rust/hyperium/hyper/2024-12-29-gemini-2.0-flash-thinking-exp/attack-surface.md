*   **Attack Surface:** HTTP Request Parsing Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** Flaws in how `hyper` parses incoming HTTP requests can lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or resource exhaustion.
    *   **How Hyper Contributes:** `hyper` is responsible for parsing the raw bytes of an incoming HTTP request into structured data (headers, method, URI, body). Vulnerabilities in this parsing logic are directly within `hyper`'s domain.
    *   **Example:** Sending a request with an excessively long header line that `hyper` attempts to allocate memory for, leading to an out-of-memory error and denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, potential for bypassing security checks if parsing inconsistencies exist.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep `hyper` updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        *   Configure `hyper` with appropriate limits for header sizes, request line length, and the number of headers.
        *   Implement robust error handling around request parsing to gracefully handle malformed requests without crashing.

*   **Attack Surface:** Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length Mismatches
    *   **Description:** Inconsistencies or vulnerabilities in how `hyper` handles `Transfer-Encoding` and `Content-Length` headers can allow attackers to inject malicious content or bypass security checks.
    *   **How Hyper Contributes:** `hyper` is responsible for correctly interpreting and enforcing the rules around these headers to determine the size and encoding of the request body.
    *   **Example:** Sending a request with conflicting `Transfer-Encoding` and `Content-Length` headers, causing `hyper` to process the body differently than intended, potentially leading to injection vulnerabilities in the application logic.
    *   **Impact:** Data injection, bypassing security controls.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure `hyper` is configured to strictly enforce the correct usage of `Transfer-Encoding` and `Content-Length`.
        *   Avoid relying on complex or ambiguous combinations of these headers in application logic.
        *   Validate the request body size and encoding independently if necessary.

*   **Attack Surface:** TLS Configuration Weaknesses
    *   **Description:** Insecure TLS configuration when using `hyper` for HTTPS connections can expose the application to man-in-the-middle attacks or other cryptographic vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Hyper Contributes:** `hyper` relies on underlying TLS libraries (like `rustls` or `openssl`) for secure communication. Improper configuration of these libraries through `hyper` can weaken security.
    *   **Example:** Using outdated TLS versions or weak cipher suites when configuring `hyper`'s HTTPS client or server, allowing an attacker to eavesdrop on or manipulate communication.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, data integrity compromise, man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure `hyper` to use strong TLS versions (TLS 1.2 or higher) and secure cipher suites.
        *   Enforce proper certificate validation when acting as an HTTPS client.
        *   Regularly update the underlying TLS libraries used by `hyper`.

*   **Attack Surface:** Denial of Service through Resource Exhaustion
    *   **Description:** Attackers can send requests that consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) on the server running the application using `hyper`, leading to denial of service.
    *   **How Hyper Contributes:** If `hyper` doesn't have proper limits or efficient handling of large requests, numerous connections, or slow clients, it can become a bottleneck and contribute to resource exhaustion.
    *   **Example:** Sending a large number of concurrent requests or slowloris attacks that keep connections open for extended periods, exhausting server resources managed by `hyper`.
    *   **Impact:** Service unavailability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure `hyper` with appropriate timeouts for connections and request processing.
        *   Implement connection limits to prevent a single attacker from overwhelming the server.
        *   Consider using load balancing and rate limiting to distribute traffic and mitigate DoS attacks.
