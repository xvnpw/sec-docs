# BUSINESS POSTURE

The `hyperium/hyper` project is a foundational HTTP library written in Rust. Its primary business priority is to provide a robust, performant, and secure HTTP implementation for the Rust ecosystem. This library serves as a building block for numerous applications and services that require HTTP networking capabilities.

Business goals for the `hyperium/hyper` project include:

*   **Reliability:** Ensuring the library functions correctly and consistently across various platforms and network conditions.
*   **Performance:** Providing a high-performance HTTP implementation that minimizes latency and maximizes throughput.
*   **Security:** Maintaining a secure codebase that is resistant to common HTTP vulnerabilities and protects users from potential attacks.
*   **Usability:** Offering a well-documented and easy-to-use API that simplifies HTTP client and server development in Rust.
*   **Community Support:** Fostering a strong community around the project to encourage contributions, bug reports, and feature requests.
*   **Long-term Maintainability:** Designing the library for long-term maintainability and evolution to adapt to changing HTTP standards and Rust language features.

Most important business risks that need to be addressed:

*   **Security Vulnerabilities:**  Vulnerabilities in `hyper` could have a wide-reaching impact on the Rust ecosystem, affecting numerous applications and services that depend on it. This is the most critical risk.
*   **Performance Regressions:** Performance issues can negatively impact applications built on top of `hyper`, leading to slower response times and reduced user experience.
*   **API Instability:** Breaking changes to the API can disrupt users and require significant code modifications in downstream projects.
*   **Lack of Maintenance:** Insufficient maintenance and bug fixes can lead to security vulnerabilities remaining unpatched and the library becoming less reliable over time.
*   **Community Fragmentation:** A fractured or inactive community can hinder the project's growth and long-term sustainability.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:

*   security control: Memory safety provided by Rust language, mitigating many common classes of vulnerabilities like buffer overflows and use-after-free. Implemented by Rust compiler and language design.
*   security control: Use of TLS libraries (like `rustls` or `openssl`) for secure communication. Implemented within `hyper`'s TLS features.
*   security control: Regular code reviews by maintainers and community contributors. Implemented as part of the development process on GitHub.
*   security control: Public vulnerability reporting process via GitHub issues and security advisories. Documented in the project's security policy (if available) or general contribution guidelines.
*   security control: Testing framework including unit and integration tests. Implemented using Rust's built-in testing framework and potentially external crates.

Accepted risks:

*   accepted risk: Dependencies on external crates might introduce vulnerabilities. Accepted due to the necessity of using libraries for functionalities like TLS and HTTP parsing. Risk mitigated by dependency review and updates.
*   accepted risk: Complexities of HTTP protocol and evolving standards might lead to implementation errors and potential vulnerabilities. Accepted as inherent to the nature of implementing a complex protocol. Mitigated by thorough testing and adherence to standards.

Recommended security controls:

*   security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to detect potential vulnerabilities early in the development process.
*   security control: Integrate Dependency Check tools in the CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Conduct regular security audits by external security experts to identify and address potential weaknesses in the codebase and design.
*   security control: Implement Fuzzing to discover unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities by providing invalid or malformed inputs.
*   security control: Formalize a security incident response plan to handle and mitigate security vulnerabilities effectively when they are discovered.

Security requirements:

*   Authentication: Not directly applicable to the `hyper` library itself, as it's a building block. Authentication is typically handled by applications built using `hyper`. However, `hyper` should provide mechanisms to support authentication schemes (e.g., handling authentication headers).
*   Authorization: Similar to authentication, authorization is primarily the responsibility of applications using `hyper`. `hyper` should provide mechanisms to enforce authorization decisions made by the application (e.g., handling authorization headers, access control based on request paths).
*   Input Validation: Critical for `hyper`. The library must rigorously validate all inputs, including HTTP headers, request methods, URLs, and body data, to prevent injection attacks, buffer overflows, and other input-related vulnerabilities. Input validation should be implemented throughout the request processing pipeline.
*   Cryptography: Essential for secure communication over HTTPS. `hyper` relies on TLS libraries for cryptographic operations. Security requirements include:
    *   Using strong and up-to-date cryptographic algorithms and protocols.
    *   Properly handling TLS configuration and certificate validation.
    *   Protecting cryptographic keys and secrets if any are managed by `hyper` (though typically key management is external).
    *   Avoiding cryptographic vulnerabilities like side-channel attacks in cryptographic operations (though this is largely the responsibility of the underlying TLS libraries).

The deployment architecture of `hyper` itself is not directly applicable in the same way as a deployable application. However, we can describe how applications using `hyper` are typically deployed.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process we are trying to protect:

*   Providing a secure and reliable HTTP library for the Rust ecosystem. This is critical because many applications and services depend on `hyper` for their networking functionality. A vulnerability or instability in `hyper` can have widespread consequences.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:

*   Integrity of the `hyper` codebase: High sensitivity.  Compromising the codebase could lead to malicious code being distributed to a large number of users.
*   Confidentiality of potential vulnerability information: High sensitivity. Premature disclosure of vulnerabilities could be exploited by attackers before patches are available.
*   Availability of the `hyper` library: Medium sensitivity. While not directly causing data breaches, unavailability of the library would disrupt development and potentially impact applications relying on it.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   What is the current vulnerability management process for `hyper`? Is there a documented security policy?
*   Are there any existing SAST or dependency scanning tools integrated into the CI/CD pipeline?
*   Are regular security audits conducted for the `hyper` project?
*   What is the process for handling security incidents and releasing security patches?
*   What are the performance testing and benchmarking practices for `hyper`, and how are performance regressions prevented?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to provide a secure, reliable, and performant HTTP library for the Rust ecosystem. Security is a top priority.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: The project benefits from Rust's memory safety.  Basic security practices like code review and testing are in place. There is room for improvement in automated security checks and formal security processes.
*   DESIGN: The design is modular and component-based, reflecting the structure of an HTTP library. The C4 diagrams accurately represent the high-level architecture and dependencies. The deployment model focuses on how applications using `hyper` are deployed, as `hyper` itself is a library. The build process is automated using CI and includes basic quality checks.
