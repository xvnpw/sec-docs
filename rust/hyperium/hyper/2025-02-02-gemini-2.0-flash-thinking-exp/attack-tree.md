## Attack Tree Path: [1. [CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Application via Hyper Vulnerabilities:](./attack_tree_paths/1___critical_node__compromise_application_via_hyper_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:** This is the overarching goal. Attackers will attempt to exploit any weakness in Hyper or its integration to compromise the application. This includes all attack vectors listed below.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. [CRITICAL NODE] Exploit HTTP Protocol Handling Vulnerabilities:](./attack_tree_paths/2___critical_node__exploit_http_protocol_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP Request Smuggling/Desync:**
        *   **Divergence in Request Parsing between Hyper and Backend:** Attackers craft requests that are interpreted differently by Hyper and the backend server. This can lead to:
            *   Bypassing security controls (e.g., authentication, authorization).
            *   Request hijacking, where one user's request is routed to another user's session.
            *   Cache poisoning, where malicious responses are cached and served to legitimate users.
    *   **Header Injection via Crafted Requests:** Attackers manipulate HTTP headers in requests to inject malicious content or commands. This can lead to:
        *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if injected headers are reflected in responses.
        *   Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) if injected headers control backend requests.
        *   Bypassing security checks based on header values.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. [CRITICAL NODE] Exploit TLS/SSL Implementation Vulnerabilities (if using HTTPS):](./attack_tree_paths/3___critical_node__exploit_tlsssl_implementation_vulnerabilities__if_using_https_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **TLS Downgrade Attacks:** Attackers attempt to force the application to use weaker, less secure TLS versions or cipher suites. This can be achieved through:
        *   **Weak TLS Configuration in Hyper:** If Hyper is configured to allow outdated TLS protocols (e.g., TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1) or weak cipher suites, attackers can exploit these weaknesses.
        *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in the TLS negotiation process.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks due to Misconfiguration:** Attackers intercept communication between the client and server. This can be facilitated by:
        *   **Allowing Insecure TLS Configurations:** Weak TLS configurations make MitM attacks easier to execute.
        *   **Lack of Proper Certificate Management:**
            *   Using expired or self-signed certificates can lead to client-side warnings that users might ignore, or can be bypassed by attackers.
            *   Compromised private keys allow attackers to impersonate the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion (under Exploit Asynchronous Nature and Resource Management Issues):](./attack_tree_paths/4__denial_of_service_via_resource_exhaustion__under_exploit_asynchronous_nature_and_resource_managem_14a80731.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Unbounded Connection/Request Handling:** If Hyper is not configured with appropriate limits on connections and requests, attackers can overwhelm the server by:
        *   Opening a large number of connections simultaneously.
        *   Sending a flood of requests.
        *   Exploiting HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 stream limits if not properly configured.
        *   This can lead to service unavailability and resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, network bandwidth).

## Attack Tree Path: [5. [CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Dependencies Vulnerabilities:](./attack_tree_paths/5___critical_node__exploit_dependencies_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Hyper's Direct Dependencies:** Hyper relies on other Rust crates (dependencies). If these dependencies have known vulnerabilities, attackers can exploit them through the application using Hyper.
        *   **Outdated or Vulnerable Dependencies:** Using outdated versions of dependencies that have known security flaws.
        *   Exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities in dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Exploit Misconfiguration or Misuse of Hyper API:](./attack_tree_paths/6__exploit_misconfiguration_or_misuse_of_hyper_api.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Insecure Defaults or Lack of Hardening:**
        *   **Relying on Default Hyper Configurations without Review:** Using Hyper with its default settings without understanding and customizing them for security can leave the application vulnerable. Default settings might be too permissive or expose unnecessary features.
    *   **Improper Error Handling in Application Code:**
        *   **Leaking Sensitive Information in Error Responses:** Application code that uses Hyper might inadvertently expose sensitive information (e.g., internal paths, database credentials, user data) in error responses when handling Hyper-related errors.
