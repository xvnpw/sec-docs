# Attack Tree Analysis for hyperium/hyper

Objective: Gain unauthorized access or control over the application or its data by exploiting vulnerabilities in the `hyper` library.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
**Objective:** Compromise application using `hyper` by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the library itself.

**Attacker's Goal:** Gain unauthorized access or control over the application or its data by exploiting vulnerabilities in the `hyper` library.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree and Critical Nodes:**

* [CRITICAL] Compromise Application Using Hyper
    * [CRITICAL] Exploit Request Handling Vulnerabilities (OR) [HIGH RISK PATH]
        * [CRITICAL] Send Malformed HTTP Requests (AND) [HIGH RISK PATH]
            * [CRITICAL] Send Requests with Large or Chunked Bodies (potentially malicious) [HIGH RISK PATH]
        * [CRITICAL] Exploit Connection Handling Vulnerabilities (AND) [HIGH RISK PATH]
            * [CRITICAL] Send a Large Number of Concurrent Requests (Connection Exhaustion) [HIGH RISK PATH]
            * [CRITICAL] Send Slowloris Attacks (gradually sending headers to keep connections open) [HIGH RISK PATH]
    * [CRITICAL] Exploit Data Handling Vulnerabilities (OR) [HIGH RISK PATH]
        * [CRITICAL] Exploit Insecure Deserialization (if application deserializes data received via hyper) (AND) [HIGH RISK PATH]
```


## Attack Tree Path: [1. [CRITICAL] Compromise Application Using Hyper:](./attack_tree_paths/1___critical__compromise_application_using_hyper.md)

* This is the overarching goal of the attacker. Success in any of the sub-trees below leads to achieving this goal.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. [CRITICAL] Exploit Request Handling Vulnerabilities (OR) [HIGH RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/2___critical__exploit_request_handling_vulnerabilities__or___high_risk_path_.md)

* This represents a broad category of attacks targeting how the application and `hyper` process incoming HTTP requests.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * Sending malformed requests to trigger parsing errors, unexpected behavior, or denial of service.
    * Exploiting vulnerabilities in how connections are managed to exhaust server resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. [CRITICAL] Send Malformed HTTP Requests (AND) [HIGH RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/3___critical__send_malformed_http_requests__and___high_risk_path_.md)

* This involves crafting HTTP requests that deviate from the expected format or contain malicious content.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * Sending requests with invalid headers (e.g., excessively long, duplicate, or unexpected characters) to cause parsing errors or unexpected behavior in `hyper`'s header processing.
    * Sending requests with invalid methods (e.g., non-standard or unexpected methods) to trigger error handling paths in `hyper`, potentially revealing information or causing unexpected state.
    * Sending requests with invalid URI formats (e.g., malformed paths, excessive length) to cause parsing errors or bypass routing logic in the application.
    * **[CRITICAL] Send Requests with Large or Chunked Bodies (potentially malicious) [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * This specific attack vector involves sending requests with excessively large bodies or using chunked transfer encoding to send large amounts of data.
        * **Impact:** This can overwhelm `hyper`'s buffer management, leading to denial-of-service or memory exhaustion. Malicious content within the body could also exploit vulnerabilities in application-level processing.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. [CRITICAL] Exploit Connection Handling Vulnerabilities (AND) [HIGH RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/4___critical__exploit_connection_handling_vulnerabilities__and___high_risk_path_.md)

* This focuses on exploiting weaknesses in how `hyper` manages HTTP connections.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **[CRITICAL] Send a Large Number of Concurrent Requests (Connection Exhaustion) [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * The attacker sends a high volume of connection requests to the server in a short period.
        * **Impact:** This can exhaust server resources like file descriptors and memory, leading to a denial-of-service for legitimate users.
    * **[CRITICAL] Send Slowloris Attacks (gradually sending headers to keep connections open) [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * The attacker establishes multiple connections to the server and sends partial HTTP requests slowly, never completing them.
        * **Impact:** This ties up server resources, preventing it from accepting new connections and serving legitimate requests, resulting in a denial-of-service.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. [CRITICAL] Exploit Data Handling Vulnerabilities (OR) [HIGH RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/5___critical__exploit_data_handling_vulnerabilities__or___high_risk_path_.md)

* This category focuses on vulnerabilities related to how the application processes data received through `hyper`.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **[CRITICAL] Exploit Insecure Deserialization (if application deserializes data received via hyper) (AND) [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * If the application deserializes data received in request or response bodies (e.g., using libraries like `serde`), an attacker can send malicious serialized data.
        * **Impact:** Upon deserialization, this malicious data can lead to remote code execution, allowing the attacker to gain complete control over the application server. This is a critical vulnerability with severe consequences.
