# Attack Surface Analysis for tauri-apps/tauri

## Attack Surface: [Unvalidated Input in `invoke` Handlers](./attack_surfaces/unvalidated_input_in__invoke__handlers.md)

- **Description:** Backend Rust functions called via Tauri's `invoke` function do not properly validate input received from the frontend.
- **How Tauri Contributes:** Tauri facilitates direct communication and data transfer between the frontend (potentially untrusted web content) and backend Rust code through the `invoke` mechanism. This bridge can become an attack vector if input is not sanitized on the Rust side.
- **Example:** A frontend script sends a string representing a filename to a Rust function that reads the file. Without validation, a malicious frontend could send a path like `/etc/passwd` leading to unauthorized file access.
- **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (if the input is used in a system command), unauthorized file access, data manipulation.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
  - **Developer:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all data received in `invoke` handlers on the Rust side. Use whitelisting and regular expressions to validate expected input formats. Avoid directly using user-provided input in system calls or file paths without thorough checks.
  - **Developer:** Employ type checking and serialization/deserialization libraries to ensure data conforms to expected structures.

## Attack Surface: [Abuse of Tauri Native APIs](./attack_surfaces/abuse_of_tauri_native_apis.md)

- **Description:**  Malicious frontend code exploits Tauri's APIs that provide access to native system functionalities (filesystem, network, OS commands, etc.) without proper authorization or restrictions.
- **How Tauri Contributes:** Tauri's core feature is allowing web technologies to build native applications, which inherently involves granting access to native capabilities. If not carefully controlled, this access becomes a vulnerability.
- **Example:** A compromised frontend uses the Tauri filesystem API to read or write arbitrary files on the user's system, bypassing normal browser sandbox restrictions.
- **Impact:** Data theft, malware installation, system compromise, denial of service.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
  - **Developer:** Utilize Tauri's permission system to strictly define and limit the capabilities exposed to the frontend. Request only the necessary permissions.
  - **Developer:** Implement robust authorization checks within the Rust backend before performing any privileged actions based on frontend requests.
  - **Developer:**  Follow the principle of least privilege when designing API interactions.
  - **Developer:** Regularly audit the usage of Tauri's native APIs.

## Attack Surface: [`tauri://` Protocol Handler Exploits](./attack_surfaces/_tauri__protocol_handler_exploits.md)

- **Description:** Vulnerabilities in how Tauri handles the custom `tauri://` protocol can be exploited by malicious web content (e.g., within an iframe or a compromised part of the application).
- **How Tauri Contributes:** Tauri introduces the `tauri://` protocol for internal communication and accessing specific resources within the application. Weaknesses in its implementation can create new attack vectors.
- **Example:** A malicious iframe embedded in the Tauri application crafts a specific `tauri://` URL that bypasses security checks and triggers an unintended action in the backend.
- **Impact:** Privilege escalation, arbitrary code execution within the application's context.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
  - **Developer:** Carefully review and secure the implementation of all `tauri://` protocol handlers. Ensure proper validation and authorization for any actions triggered by these URLs.
  - **Developer:** Avoid exposing sensitive functionalities directly through `tauri://` URLs without strict access controls.
  - **Developer:** Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the application can load resources, mitigating the risk of malicious iframes.

## Attack Surface: [Context Isolation Issues](./attack_surfaces/context_isolation_issues.md)

- **Description:**  Lack of proper isolation between the main application's context and any embedded iframes or external web content can allow malicious content to access sensitive data or manipulate the application.
- **How Tauri Contributes:** While Tauri aims for context isolation, misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in the underlying webview or Tauri's implementation can lead to breaches in this isolation.
- **Example:** A malicious advertisement loaded in an iframe within the Tauri application gains access to the main application's JavaScript context and can call `invoke` to execute backend functions.
- **Impact:** Data theft, unauthorized actions, potential for full application compromise.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
  - **Developer:**  Ensure that context isolation is enabled and properly configured.
  - **Developer:**  Avoid embedding untrusted or potentially malicious web content within the application if possible.
  - **Developer:**  Implement robust Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the capabilities of embedded content.
  - **Developer:**  Carefully review any communication mechanisms between different web contexts within the application.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Update Mechanism](./attack_surfaces/insecure_update_mechanism.md)

- **Description:**  The mechanism used to update the Tauri application is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks or allows for the delivery of malicious updates.
- **How Tauri Contributes:** Tauri provides an update mechanism. If not implemented securely, it becomes a critical point of failure.
- **Example:** An attacker intercepts an update request and serves a malicious version of the application to the user.
- **Impact:** Installation of malware, complete compromise of the user's system.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
  - **Developer:**  Implement secure update mechanisms using HTTPS for all update communication.
  - **Developer:**  Sign application updates with a private key and verify the signature on the client-side before applying the update.
  - **Developer:**  Consider using a trusted update server and robust security measures for the update infrastructure.
  - **User:**  Ensure the application is configured to receive updates over secure channels.
