## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Webview Vulnerabilities to Execute Native Code](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_webview_vulnerabilities_to_execute_native_code.md)

**Trigger a vulnerability in the underlying webview (e.g., Chromium) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * Attackers leverage known or zero-day vulnerabilities present in the Chromium engine that Tauri uses for rendering web content.
    * These vulnerabilities can range from memory corruption bugs to logic flaws that allow for arbitrary code execution within the webview's sandbox.
    * Successful exploitation can potentially bypass the webview's security sandbox and, in conjunction with Tauri API weaknesses, lead to native code execution.

**Exploit Tauri API misconfiguration or vulnerability to bridge to native code execution [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * Even if a webview vulnerability doesn't directly allow native code execution, a flaw or insecure configuration in how the Tauri API bridges the webview's JavaScript context to the native Rust code can be exploited.
    * This could involve vulnerabilities in the message passing mechanism, insufficient input validation on the native side, or the exposure of dangerous native functions to the webview without proper safeguards.

**Achieve Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) within the Tauri application [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code into the application's web content.
    * In the context of a Tauri application, this is particularly dangerous because the JavaScript has direct access to the Tauri API.
    * Successful XSS can allow attackers to call Tauri API functions, potentially leading to native code execution or other system compromises.

**Use Tauri API to execute native commands or bypass security restrictions:**
    * Following a successful webview exploit or XSS attack, the attacker leverages the Tauri API to interact with the underlying operating system.
    * This could involve calling functions that execute shell commands, access the filesystem, or manipulate system resources, bypassing the intended security boundaries of the webview.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Tauri API Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_tauri_api_vulnerabilities.md)

**Exploit insecure configuration of Tauri API handlers [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * Developers might register API handlers that are accessible from the webview without proper authorization checks or input sanitization.
    * Attackers can then call these handlers with malicious payloads, potentially triggering unintended actions or vulnerabilities in the native code.

**Exploit vulnerabilities in the Tauri API itself [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * Bugs or flaws in the Rust code that implements the Tauri API can be directly exploited.
    * These vulnerabilities could allow attackers to bypass security checks, execute arbitrary code within the Tauri application's native context, or cause denial-of-service.

**Abuse exposed native functionality through the API:**
    * Legitimate Tauri API functions might expose powerful native capabilities.
    * If not carefully designed and used, attackers could abuse these functions with malicious arguments or in unintended sequences to compromise the system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit the Tauri Update Mechanism](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_the_tauri_update_mechanism.md)

**Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack on update server [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * If the communication between the Tauri application and the update server is not properly secured (e.g., lacking HTTPS with certificate pinning), an attacker can intercept the update process.
    * The attacker can then replace the legitimate application update with a malicious version, which the application will install.

**Compromise the update server itself [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * If an attacker gains unauthorized access to the update server infrastructure, they can directly upload and distribute malicious updates to all users of the application.

**Exploit insecure update verification process [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * If the application does not properly verify the integrity and authenticity of updates (e.g., weak or missing signature checks), an attacker can bypass these checks and install a malicious update that appears legitimate.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Tauri Plugins](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_tauri_plugins.md)

**Exploit vulnerabilities within a specific plugin's code [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * Tauri allows the use of plugins, which are often developed independently.
    * Vulnerabilities in the plugin's code, whether written in Rust or another language, can be exploited to compromise the application.

**Exploit insecure communication between the main app and a plugin [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * If the communication channel between the main Tauri application and a plugin is not properly secured, an attacker might be able to inject malicious data or commands into the communication stream, potentially compromising either the main application or the plugin.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in the Tauri Build Process](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_the_tauri_build_process.md)

**Supply Chain Attack on Tauri Dependencies [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * Attackers compromise dependencies used by the Tauri application during its build process.
    * This can involve injecting malicious code into a legitimate dependency or creating a malicious package with a similar name.
    * The malicious code is then included in the final application build without the developers' knowledge.

**Inject malicious code during the build process [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * Attackers gain unauthorized access to the development environment or build pipelines.
    * They can then directly modify build scripts or configuration files to inject malicious payloads into the application during the build process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Lack of Proper Input Sanitization in Tauri APIs](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_lack_of_proper_input_sanitization_in_tauri_apis.md)

This path represents a broad category where developers fail to adequately sanitize input received by Tauri API handlers.
* This lack of sanitization can lead to various vulnerabilities, including command injection, where an attacker can craft malicious input that, when processed by the API, results in the execution of arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system.
