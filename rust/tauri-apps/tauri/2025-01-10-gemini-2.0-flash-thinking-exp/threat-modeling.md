# Threat Model Analysis for tauri-apps/tauri

## Threat: [Malicious JavaScript Calling Backend Commands](./threats/malicious_javascript_calling_backend_commands.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts malicious JavaScript code within the application's frontend that calls backend functions via `invoke`. They could exploit vulnerabilities in these functions to execute arbitrary commands on the user's operating system. This might involve manipulating input parameters or exploiting logic flaws in the backend code.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine, potentially leading to malware installation, data theft, or system compromise.
    *   Access to sensitive files and system resources.
    *   Data exfiltration from the application or the user's system.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   `tauri::command` macro and associated backend functions defined to handle frontend `invoke` calls.
    *   The inter-process communication (IPC) bridge between the WebView and the Rust backend.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the backend for all data received via `invoke`.
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege when designing backend commands, ensuring they only perform necessary actions.
    *   Consider using type checking and data schemas for IPC messages to enforce expected data structures.
    *   Regularly audit backend command handlers for potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Insecurely Defined IPC Handlers](./threats/insecurely_defined_ipc_handlers.md)

**Description:** The Rust backend exposes command handlers via `invoke` that are overly permissive or lack proper authorization checks. An attacker could exploit this by crafting specific `invoke` calls from the frontend to access functionalities they shouldn't have access to.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Privilege escalation, where the frontend gains the ability to perform actions reserved for the backend.
    *   Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionalities.
    *   Denial of service by overloading backend resources through repeated or resource-intensive command calls.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   `tauri::command` macro and the definition of command handlers in the Rust backend.
    *   The Tauri configuration (`tauri.conf.json`) related to allowed API access.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict authorization checks within backend command handlers to verify the legitimacy of requests.
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege when defining command handlers, exposing only necessary functionalities to the frontend.
    *   Carefully review the Tauri configuration to ensure appropriate restrictions on API access.
    *   Avoid exposing overly generic or powerful commands without thorough security considerations.

## Threat: [Data Injection through IPC](./threats/data_injection_through_ipc.md)

**Description:**  An attacker manipulates data sent from the frontend to the backend via `invoke` calls. If the backend doesn't properly sanitize or validate this data, it could lead to vulnerabilities within the backend logic. This could involve injecting malicious strings, unexpected data types, or overflowing buffers.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exploitation of backend logic vulnerabilities, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or data manipulation within the backend.
    *   Data corruption within the application's state or persistent storage.
    *   Unexpected application behavior or crashes.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   The inter-process communication (IPC) bridge.
    *   Backend functions that process data received from the frontend via `invoke`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement comprehensive input validation and sanitization on the backend for all data received via IPC.
    *   Use strong typing and data schemas to enforce expected data formats.
    *   Be wary of deserialization vulnerabilities if using complex data structures for IPC.
    *   Employ secure coding practices to prevent buffer overflows and other memory-related issues.

## Threat: [Abuse of Tauri Core APIs](./threats/abuse_of_tauri_core_apis.md)

**Description:** Malicious frontend code, potentially injected or created by an attacker, leverages Tauri's core APIs (e.g., file system access, shell execution) without proper authorization or validation.
*   **Impact:**
    *   File system manipulation (reading, writing, deleting files) leading to data loss or system compromise.
    *   Execution of arbitrary system commands, potentially installing malware or performing malicious actions.
    *   Access to sensitive system information or resources.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   Tauri's core API modules (e.g., `tauri::fs`, `tauri::shell`).
    *   The Tauri configuration (`tauri.conf.json`) controlling API permissions.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully review and restrict the permissions granted to the frontend in the `tauri.conf.json` file. Follow the principle of least privilege.
    *   Implement robust authorization checks before using Tauri APIs in the backend, even if the frontend is trusted.
    *   Avoid exposing direct access to powerful APIs to the frontend if possible. Instead, create specific backend commands that perform the necessary actions with proper validation.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Tauri Plugins](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_tauri_plugins.md)

**Description:** The application utilizes third-party Tauri plugins that contain security vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could be exploited by malicious frontend code or by attackers targeting the plugin directly.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Same threats as abusing Tauri Core APIs, but originating from the vulnerable plugin.
    *   Potential for supply chain attacks if malicious plugins are used.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   Third-party Tauri plugins integrated into the application.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the severity of the plugin vulnerability (can be Critical or High).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly vet and audit all third-party plugins before integrating them into the application.
    *   Keep plugins up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege when granting permissions to plugins.
    *   Consider using sandboxing or isolation techniques for plugins if possible.

## Threat: [Insecure Update Mechanism](./threats/insecure_update_mechanism.md)

**Description:** The application's update mechanism (provided by Tauri or custom) is not properly secured, allowing attackers to push malicious updates to users. This could involve compromising the update server or manipulating the update process.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Distribution of malware or compromised versions of the application to users.
    *   Gaining control over user machines through a backdoored update.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   Tauri's built-in updater module or any custom update implementation.
    *   The update server and distribution infrastructure.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement secure update mechanisms, including code signing of updates to verify their authenticity and integrity.
    *   Use HTTPS for all communication related to updates.
    *   Ensure the update server is securely configured and protected against unauthorized access.
    *   Consider using a trusted third-party update service.

## Threat: [Lack of Code Signing or Verification (Updates)](./threats/lack_of_code_signing_or_verification__updates_.md)

**Description:** Application updates are not properly signed and verified, making it possible for attackers to distribute fake or malicious updates that users might unknowingly install.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Users installing compromised versions of the application containing malware or backdoors.
    *   Potential for widespread compromise of user systems.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   The application's update process (likely involving Tauri's updater).
    *   The build and release pipeline.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust code signing for all application releases and updates.
    *   Verify the signature of updates before installing them.
    *   Educate users about the importance of verifying the authenticity of updates.
