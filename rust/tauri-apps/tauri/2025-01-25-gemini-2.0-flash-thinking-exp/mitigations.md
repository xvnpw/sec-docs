## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization for Command Arguments (Tauri Commands)](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization_for_command_arguments__tauri_commands_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Input Validation and Sanitization for Command Arguments (Tauri Commands)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify all Tauri commands:** Review your Rust code and list all functions exposed as Tauri commands using `#[tauri::command]`. These are the entry points from the frontend to the backend.
    2.  **Analyze command arguments:** For each Tauri command, identify all arguments received from the frontend (web view). These arguments are passed through Tauri's IPC mechanism.
    3.  **Implement validation logic in Rust within Tauri commands:** Inside each `#[tauri::command]` function, before any processing, add validation checks for all arguments. This validation logic is implemented in Rust, leveraging Rust's type system and libraries.
        *   **Type checking:** Ensure arguments received via Tauri IPC match the expected Rust data types.
        *   **Range checks:** Validate numerical arguments are within acceptable ranges within the Rust command function.
        *   **Format validation:** For string arguments passed via Tauri commands, validate against expected formats (e.g., using regex in Rust).
        *   **Length limits:** Enforce maximum lengths for string inputs within the Rust command logic to prevent potential issues.
    4.  **Sanitize inputs within Tauri commands:** Sanitize string inputs received by Tauri commands in Rust to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
        *   **Path sanitization:** For file paths received as arguments in Tauri commands, ensure they are within allowed directories using Rust's path manipulation and validation capabilities. Prevent path traversal within the Rust command logic.
    5.  **Handle invalid input gracefully in Tauri commands:** If validation fails within a Tauri command, return a structured error response back to the frontend through Tauri's IPC. Log validation failures on the Rust side for monitoring.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Command Injection (High Severity):** Malicious frontend code exploiting Tauri commands to execute arbitrary backend functions or system commands due to unsanitized arguments passed via Tauri IPC.
    *   **Path Traversal (High Severity):** Exploiting Tauri commands to access files outside intended directories due to lack of path validation in Rust command handlers.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Sending large or malformed inputs via Tauri commands to crash the backend or consume excessive resources due to insufficient input validation in Rust.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Command Injection:** Significantly Reduces
    *   **Path Traversal:** Significantly Reduces
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Moderately Reduces
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented in `src-tauri/src/commands.rs`. Basic type checking might be present in some Tauri commands, but comprehensive validation and sanitization, especially for file paths handled by Tauri commands, are missing.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Comprehensive input validation and sanitization are missing for arguments of all Tauri commands, particularly those handling file paths, external processes, and data persistence accessed via Tauri commands.  Specific sanitization routines within Rust command handlers are needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege for Commands (Tauri Commands)](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_for_commands__tauri_commands_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Principle of Least Privilege for Commands (Tauri Commands)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review existing Tauri commands:** Analyze all functions exposed as Tauri commands and their functionalities.
    2.  **Identify command scope:** For each Tauri command, determine the minimum necessary actions it needs to perform within the Rust backend.
    3.  **Refactor overly broad Tauri commands:** If a Tauri command performs multiple unrelated actions, break it down into smaller, more specific Tauri commands.
    4.  **Limit Tauri command capabilities:** Ensure each Tauri command in Rust only has access to the resources and functionalities it absolutely needs. Avoid granting Tauri commands unnecessary permissions or access to sensitive data within the Rust backend.
    5.  **Document Tauri command purpose and scope:** Clearly document the intended purpose and scope of each Tauri command to ensure developers understand their limitations and avoid misuse when calling them from the frontend.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation (High Severity):** If a broad Tauri command is compromised, an attacker could leverage its extensive capabilities to perform actions beyond the intended scope, escalating their privileges within the backend through Tauri IPC.
    *   **Lateral Movement (Medium Severity):** Overly powerful Tauri commands can facilitate lateral movement within the application's backend or system if exploited via Tauri IPC.
    *   **Data Breach (High Severity):** Tauri commands with excessive access to data in the backend could be exploited to exfiltrate sensitive information through Tauri IPC.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Moderately Reduces
    *   **Lateral Movement:** Minimally Reduces
    *   **Data Breach:** Moderately Reduces
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Tauri commands are generally focused on specific tasks, but some might still have broader access than strictly necessary. For example, a file system access Tauri command might be able to read more directories than needed based on its Rust implementation.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  A systematic review and refactoring of Tauri commands to strictly adhere to the principle of least privilege is needed.  This includes further breaking down some commands and limiting their access to resources within the Rust backend.  Formal documentation of Tauri command scope is also missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Content Security Policy (CSP) Implementation (Tauri Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/content_security_policy__csp__implementation__tauri_configuration_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Content Security Policy (CSP) Implementation (Tauri Configuration)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define CSP requirements for Tauri webview:** Determine the necessary sources for your Tauri application's web view to load resources (scripts, styles, images, fonts, etc.). Identify allowed domains and protocols for the webview context within Tauri.
    2.  **Configure CSP in `tauri.conf.json`:** Set the `csp` configuration option within the `window` section of your `tauri.conf.json` file. This is the Tauri-specific way to configure CSP for the webview.
    3.  **Start with a restrictive CSP in Tauri:** Begin with a strict CSP in `tauri.conf.json` that primarily allows resources from your application's origin (`'self'`) within the Tauri webview.
    4.  **Gradually relax CSP in Tauri (if needed):** If external resources are required for the Tauri webview, carefully add specific allowed sources to your CSP directives in `tauri.conf.json` (e.g., `script-src 'self' https://cdn.example.com;`).
    5.  **Use nonces or hashes for inline scripts/styles in Tauri (if unavoidable):** If inline scripts or styles are absolutely necessary within the Tauri webview, use nonces or hashes in your CSP configuration in `tauri.conf.json` to allow only specific inline code blocks.
    6.  **Test CSP thoroughly within Tauri application:** Test your Tauri application with the implemented CSP to ensure all necessary resources are loaded correctly in the webview and no functionality is broken. Monitor browser console for CSP violations within the Tauri app and adjust the policy in `tauri.conf.json` as needed.
    7.  **Enforce CSP in Tauri production builds:** Ensure the CSP is correctly configured and enforced in production builds of your Tauri application by verifying the `tauri.conf.json` configuration.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):** CSP configured via `tauri.conf.json` significantly reduces the risk of XSS attacks within the Tauri webview by limiting resource sources and preventing malicious script execution.
    *   **Data Injection Attacks (Medium Severity):** CSP in Tauri can help mitigate certain data injection attacks by controlling the sources of data loaded into the webview context of the Tauri application.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Significantly Reduces
    *   **Data Injection Attacks:** Moderately Reduces
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. No CSP is currently defined in `tauri.conf.json`. The Tauri application's webview is running without any CSP restrictions.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  CSP needs to be implemented in `tauri.conf.json` for the Tauri application. A restrictive policy should be defined and tested specifically within the Tauri environment. Consider using nonces or hashes if inline scripts or styles are present in the Tauri webview.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Tauri and Webview Dependencies (Tauri Ecosystem)](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_tauri_and_webview_dependencies__tauri_ecosystem_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly Update Tauri and Webview Dependencies (Tauri Ecosystem)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor for Tauri ecosystem updates:** Regularly check for new releases of the Tauri framework itself, Rust dependencies used by Tauri (managed by Cargo), and the underlying webview dependencies (Chromium, WebKit) that Tauri relies on. Subscribe to Tauri release announcements and security advisories.
    2.  **Update Tauri framework using Cargo:** Use `cargo update` to update the Tauri framework and its Rust dependencies as defined in your `Cargo.toml` file. This is the standard Rust/Cargo way to update Tauri dependencies.
    3.  **Webview dependency updates via Tauri:** Tauri typically manages the webview dependencies. Ensure you are using the latest recommended Tauri version, as Tauri updates often include updates to the bundled webview components. Upgrading Tauri is the primary way to update the webview.
    4.  **Review Tauri release notes and changelogs:** Before updating Tauri and its dependencies, carefully review release notes and changelogs for Tauri itself and its dependencies to understand changes, including security fixes and potential breaking changes introduced by Tauri updates.
    5.  **Test Tauri application after updates:** After updating Tauri and its dependencies, thoroughly test your application to ensure compatibility with the new Tauri version and that no regressions or new issues have been introduced by the Tauri update. Run automated tests and perform manual testing within the Tauri application.
    6.  **Automate Tauri dependency updates (optional):** Consider using dependency update tools or CI/CD pipelines to automate the process of checking for and applying Tauri and its related dependency updates.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Outdated Tauri framework, Rust dependencies, or webview components may contain known security vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit within the Tauri application. Regularly updating mitigates this risk by incorporating security patches provided by the Tauri project and its dependencies.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities:** Significantly Reduces
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Tauri and dependency updates are performed occasionally, but not on a regular, scheduled basis.  There is no automated process specifically for monitoring Tauri ecosystem updates or automating the update process for Tauri projects.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Establish a regular schedule for Tauri ecosystem updates (e.g., monthly). Implement automated dependency vulnerability scanning specifically for Tauri project dependencies and consider automating the Tauri update process within the CI/CD pipeline.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege for File System Access (Tauri `fsAllowlist`)](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_for_file_system_access__tauri__fsallowlist__.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Principle of Least Privilege for File System Access (Tauri `fsAllowlist`)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify required file system access for Tauri app:** Analyze your Tauri application's functionality and determine the minimum necessary file system access it needs. Consider what files and directories the Tauri backend needs to interact with.
    2.  **Restrict file system access using Tauri `fsAllowlist`:** In `tauri.conf.json`, configure the `fsAllowlist` within the `security` section to explicitly define the directories and files the Tauri application is allowed to access. This is the Tauri-specific mechanism for controlling file system access.
    3.  **Avoid broad allowlists in Tauri:** Do not use wildcard allowlists (`"**"`) in `fsAllowlist` unless absolutely necessary. Be as specific as possible in defining allowed paths within the Tauri configuration.
    4.  **Use scoped access in Tauri `fsAllowlist` where possible:** If a Tauri command or feature only needs access to a specific subdirectory, configure the `fsAllowlist` to only permit access to that subdirectory, limiting the scope of access within Tauri.
    5.  **Review and minimize Tauri `fsAllowlist` regularly:** Periodically review the `fsAllowlist` in `tauri.conf.json` and remove any unnecessary entries. Ensure the allowlist remains as restrictive as possible for the Tauri application.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized File System Access (High Severity):** If the Tauri application has broad file system access due to a permissive `fsAllowlist`, vulnerabilities could be exploited to read, write, or delete sensitive files outside of the intended scope, bypassing Tauri's intended security boundaries.
    *   **Data Breach (High Severity):**  Unrestricted file system access in Tauri, due to a broad `fsAllowlist`, increases the risk of data breaches if an attacker gains control of the Tauri application.
    *   **Data Tampering (High Severity):**  Unrestricted write access to the file system via Tauri, allowed by a loose `fsAllowlist`, could allow attackers to modify critical application files or user data.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized File System Access:** Significantly Reduces
    *   **Data Breach:** Moderately Reduces
    *   **Data Tampering:** Moderately Reduces
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented.  `fsAllowlist` is configured in `tauri.conf.json`, but it currently allows access to the entire user's home directory (`"$HOME"`). This broad configuration in Tauri's `fsAllowlist` is too permissive.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  The `fsAllowlist` in `tauri.conf.json` needs to be refined to restrict file system access to only the necessary directories for the Tauri application.  Specific directories for application data and user documents should be defined and allowed in the Tauri configuration, instead of the entire home directory.  Regular review of the Tauri `fsAllowlist` configuration is also needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Code Signing for Updates (Tauri Update Mechanism)](./mitigation_strategies/code_signing_for_updates__tauri_update_mechanism_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Code Signing for Updates (Tauri Update Mechanism)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Obtain a code signing certificate for Tauri updates:** Acquire a valid code signing certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) to be used for signing Tauri application updates.
    2.  **Integrate code signing into Tauri build process:** Configure your build pipeline to automatically sign application updates during the release process specifically for Tauri applications.
    3.  **Sign Tauri application binaries:** Use the code signing certificate to sign the application binaries (executables, installers) that are distributed as updates through Tauri's update mechanism.
    4.  **Verify signature during Tauri update process:** Implement signature verification within your Tauri application's update mechanism. Before applying an update downloaded via Tauri's updater, verify the digital signature of the downloaded update package using the public key associated with your code signing certificate. This verification should be part of the Tauri update process.
    5.  **Reject updates with invalid signatures in Tauri:** If the signature verification fails during the Tauri update process, reject the update and prevent installation. Display an error message to the user within the Tauri application, indicating a potential issue with the update.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Updates (High Severity):** Without code signing for Tauri updates, attackers could potentially distribute malicious updates disguised as legitimate ones through the Tauri update mechanism, compromising user systems.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Tauri Updates (High Severity):** Code signing, combined with HTTPS for the Tauri update server, prevents man-in-the-middle attackers from tampering with update packages during transit when using Tauri's update functionality.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Updates:** Significantly Reduces
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Updates:** Significantly Reduces
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. Code signing is not currently integrated into the Tauri build process, and update packages for the Tauri application are not signed. Signature verification is not implemented within the Tauri update mechanism.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Code signing needs to be implemented for all Tauri application updates. This involves obtaining a code signing certificate, integrating signing into the Tauri build pipeline, and implementing signature verification within the Tauri update process.  This is crucial for securing the Tauri application's update mechanism.
