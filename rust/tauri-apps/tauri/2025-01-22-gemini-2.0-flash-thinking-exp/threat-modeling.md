# Threat Model Analysis for tauri-apps/tauri

## Threat: [Webview Engine Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./threats/webview_engine_remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

*   **Threat:** Webview Engine RCE
*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the underlying webview engine (WebView2, WKWebView) used by Tauri. They could craft malicious web content or manipulate application behavior to trigger the vulnerability. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's machine with the privileges of the application.
*   **Impact:** **Critical**. Full compromise of the user's system. Attackers can install malware, steal data, control the system, or perform other malicious actions.
*   **Affected Tauri Component:**  `Webview` (specifically the underlying system webview engine: WebView2 on Windows, WKWebView on macOS/iOS, and potentially others on Linux).
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** to **High**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to limit the capabilities of web content and reduce the attack surface within the webview.
        *   Minimize the exposed Tauri API surface to reduce potential attack vectors from the webview.
        *   Regularly monitor security advisories for the webview engine used on target platforms and advise users to keep their systems updated.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Keep your operating system and webview engine updated. Operating system updates often include security patches for webview components.

## Threat: [Webview Sandbox Escape](./threats/webview_sandbox_escape.md)

*   **Threat:** Webview Sandbox Escape
*   **Description:** An attacker discovers and exploits a vulnerability in Tauri's webview isolation or the underlying webview engine's sandbox implementation. This allows them to break out of the restricted webview environment and gain access to the host operating system, file system, or other resources beyond the intended application scope.
*   **Impact:** **High**.  Significant compromise of the user's system. Attackers can gain access to sensitive data, modify files, or potentially escalate privileges depending on the escape vulnerability.
*   **Affected Tauri Component:** `Webview`, `Tauri Core` (specifically the isolation mechanisms and bridge).
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Follow Tauri's security best practices and recommendations for sandboxing and isolation.
        *   Minimize the attack surface by limiting the exposed Tauri API surface and capabilities.
        *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing, specifically focusing on sandbox escape vulnerabilities.
        *   Keep Tauri and its dependencies updated to benefit from security patches.

## Threat: [Command Injection via Tauri Commands](./threats/command_injection_via_tauri_commands.md)

*   **Threat:** Command Injection via Tauri Commands
*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input from the frontend (web side) and sends it through a Tauri command to the backend (Rust side). If the backend command handler does not properly validate and sanitize this input, the attacker can inject arbitrary commands that are then executed by the Rust backend with the application's privileges.
*   **Impact:** **Critical** to **High**.  Potentially full compromise of the application and potentially the user's system, depending on the privileges of the application and the nature of the injected commands. Attackers can execute arbitrary code, access sensitive data, or modify application behavior.
*   **Affected Tauri Component:** `Tauri Commands`, `IPC (Inter-Process Communication) Bridge`.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** if commands have high privileges, **High** otherwise.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Strictly validate and sanitize all input data** received from the frontend in Tauri command handlers on the Rust backend.
        *   Use type safety and strong typing in command handlers to prevent unexpected data types.
        *   Apply the **principle of least privilege** to Tauri commands, only exposing necessary functionality and limiting the scope of each command.
        *   Implement robust input validation libraries and techniques in Rust.
        *   Avoid constructing shell commands directly from user-provided input. If necessary, use safe command execution methods that prevent injection.

## Threat: [Memory Safety Issues in Rust Backend](./threats/memory_safety_issues_in_rust_backend.md)

*   **Threat:** Memory Safety Issues in Rust Backend
*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, use-after-free, or other memory corruption issues are introduced in the Rust backend code, either through `unsafe` blocks or vulnerabilities in dependencies. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to cause crashes, unexpected behavior, or potentially achieve arbitrary code execution on the backend.
*   **Impact:** **Critical** to **High**.  Potentially full compromise of the application and user's system. Memory safety issues can lead to arbitrary code execution, data corruption, and denial of service.
*   **Affected Tauri Component:** `Rust Backend Code`, `Dependencies (Crates)`.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** to **High**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Minimize the use of `unsafe` code blocks** and carefully audit any necessary `unsafe` code.
        *   Utilize memory-safe Rust libraries and crates.
        *   Perform thorough code reviews and testing, including memory safety testing (e.g., fuzzing, static analysis).
        *   Employ static analysis tools and linters (like `clippy`) to detect potential memory safety issues.
        *   Keep Rust toolchain and dependencies updated to benefit from security patches and improvements.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attacks during Build](./threats/supply_chain_attacks_during_build.md)

*   **Threat:** Supply Chain Attacks during Build
*   **Description:** Compromised build tools, dependencies, or build environments are used to inject malicious code into the application during the build process. This could happen without the developers' direct knowledge, resulting in a compromised application being distributed to users.
*   **Impact:** **Critical**. Distribution of malware to users. Widespread compromise of user systems. Damage to reputation and trust.
*   **Affected Tauri Component:** `Build Process`, `Dependencies`, `Build Environment`.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Secure the build pipeline and environment.** Use trusted and isolated build environments.
        *   Verify checksums and signatures of dependencies and build tools.
        *   Use reputable and trusted package registries and repositories.
        *   Implement code signing for application binaries to ensure integrity and authenticity.
        *   Regularly audit the build process and dependencies for suspicious activity.
