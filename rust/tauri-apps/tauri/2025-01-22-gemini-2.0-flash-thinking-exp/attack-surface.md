# Attack Surface Analysis for tauri-apps/tauri

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Command Handling (IPC)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_command_handling__ipc_.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities arising from improperly validated or sanitized input to Tauri commands executed in the backend (Rust) based on requests from the frontend (webview).
*   **Tauri Contribution:** Tauri's core architecture relies on Inter-Process Communication (IPC) via commands to bridge the frontend and backend. This command mechanism, while essential, inherently introduces a critical attack surface if not handled with robust security measures.
*   **Example:** A Tauri application exposes a command `executeSystemCommand(command)` to the frontend. If the `command` string from the frontend is directly passed to `std::process::Command` in Rust without sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious shell commands like `command: "rm -rf /"` leading to arbitrary code execution and system compromise.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the host system, complete system compromise, data breaches, denial of service, privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization for all data received from the frontend in command handlers. Use allow-lists for expected inputs and reject anything outside of that.
        *   **Command Whitelisting:**  Instead of dynamically executing commands based on frontend input, predefine a limited set of safe commands and map frontend requests to these predefined actions.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Commands:** Design commands with the minimal necessary privileges. Avoid creating overly powerful or generic commands that could be misused.
        *   **Secure Coding Practices (Rust):**  Adhere to secure coding guidelines in Rust, especially when dealing with system calls, file operations, and external processes. Use safe Rust abstractions to minimize risks.
    *   **User:** No direct user mitigation, relies entirely on developers implementing secure command handling practices.

## Attack Surface: [WebView Vulnerabilities (Tauri Context Amplification)](./attack_surfaces/webview_vulnerabilities__tauri_context_amplification_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities within the underlying webview engine (Chromium, WebKit) which are significantly amplified in Tauri applications due to the tight integration and privileged access to the backend and host system.
*   **Tauri Contribution:** Tauri utilizes webviews to render the frontend user interface. While webview vulnerabilities exist independently, Tauri's architecture elevates their severity because a successful webview exploit can potentially bypass the webview sandbox and gain access to the powerful Rust backend and the underlying operating system.
*   **Example:** A zero-day vulnerability is discovered in the Chromium webview engine that allows for sandbox escape. In a Tauri application using this vulnerable webview, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability through malicious content in the frontend (e.g., via compromised website loaded in an iframe or XSS). Upon successful escape, the attacker could then leverage Tauri commands or APIs to interact with the backend and execute arbitrary code on the user's machine.
*   **Impact:** Sandbox escape, arbitrary code execution on the host system, backend compromise, data breaches, privilege escalation, complete system takeover.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   **Regular WebView Updates:**  Prioritize keeping the Tauri application and its dependencies, especially the webview engine, updated to the latest stable versions. This is crucial for patching known webview vulnerabilities promptly.
        *   **Strong Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a robust and restrictive Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks within the webview. A well-configured CSP can significantly limit the impact of potential webview vulnerabilities.
        *   **Minimize Webview Attack Surface:** Reduce the complexity and attack surface of the web application running within the webview. Avoid loading untrusted external content or relying on vulnerable frontend libraries.
        *   **Context Isolation Enforcement:** Ensure Tauri's context isolation features are correctly implemented and functioning as intended to prevent direct access from the webview to the backend.
    *   **User:**
        *   **Keep Application Updated:**  Ensure the Tauri application is always updated to the latest version to benefit from webview engine updates and security patches released by Tauri and the webview providers.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Update Mechanism](./attack_surfaces/insecure_update_mechanism.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in the application's update mechanism, allowing attackers to distribute and install malicious updates, potentially compromising a large number of users.
*   **Tauri Contribution:** Tauri provides built-in update mechanisms to facilitate application updates. However, if these mechanisms are not implemented and secured correctly, they become a high-severity attack vector, as they can be used to distribute malware disguised as legitimate updates.
*   **Example:** A Tauri application checks for updates over an insecure HTTP connection without proper signature verification. An attacker performing a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack could intercept the update request and replace the legitimate update package with a malicious one. When the application installs this compromised update, it infects the user's system with malware.  Alternatively, if the update server itself is compromised, attackers could directly distribute malicious updates to all users.
*   **Impact:** Mass malware distribution, widespread application compromise, system compromise affecting a large user base, supply chain attack.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   **HTTPS for All Update Channels:**  Mandatory use of HTTPS for all communication related to updates to ensure confidentiality and integrity of update packages and metadata.
        *   **Robust Signature Verification:** Implement strong cryptographic signature verification for all update packages. Digitally sign updates using a private key and verify the signature on the client-side using the corresponding public key before applying any update.
        *   **Secure Update Server Infrastructure:**  Thoroughly secure the update server infrastructure, including access controls, intrusion detection, and regular security audits. Follow secure development practices for the update server software.
        *   **Rollback Mechanism and Fallback:** Implement a reliable rollback mechanism to revert to a previous version in case an update fails or introduces critical issues. Provide a secure fallback mechanism if the update process fails.
    *   **User:**
        *   **Trust Official Sources Only:** Only download and install updates from official and trusted sources provided by the application developers. Be wary of unofficial update channels or prompts.
        *   **Automatic Updates with Verification:** If possible, enable automatic updates but ensure that the application verifies the authenticity of updates before installation (this is primarily developer responsibility, but user awareness is important).
