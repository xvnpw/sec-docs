## 4. Detailed Design

This section provides a detailed breakdown of the key components within the Tauri framework and their respective functionalities.

### 4.1. Tauri Core (Rust)

The Tauri Core, written in Rust, forms the secure and performant backbone of the application. Its responsibilities include:

*   **Window Management:** Creating, managing, and controlling application windows, including their properties and behavior.
*   **Inter-Process Communication (IPC) Management:** Establishing and managing secure communication channels between the frontend and backend, often utilizing message passing or command invocation patterns.
*   **Native API Access Control:** Providing a controlled and permissioned bridge to access operating system functionalities, limiting the frontend's direct access to potentially sensitive APIs. This includes features like file system access, network operations, and system dialogs.
*   **Event Handling and Dispatching:** Managing system-level events (e.g., window resize, focus changes) and application-defined events, facilitating communication and coordination between components.
*   **Plugin System Management:** Loading, managing, and isolating plugins to extend Tauri's capabilities in a modular and potentially sandboxed manner.
*   **Security Policy Enforcement:** Implementing and enforcing security measures such as Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS attacks and managing permissions for native API access.
*   **Updater Logic:** Orchestrating the application update process, including checking for updates, downloading new versions, and applying updates securely.

### 4.2. Frontend (Web Technologies)

The frontend of a Tauri application is constructed using standard web technologies, rendered within the system's webview:

*   **HTML:** Defines the structure and semantic content of the user interface.
*   **CSS:** Styles the visual presentation and layout of the application.
*   **JavaScript:** Implements the interactive behavior and application logic within the web view.
*   **Tauri JavaScript API Bindings:** Provides a set of JavaScript APIs that facilitate communication with the Rust backend, enabling the frontend to invoke commands and listen for events.

        B["'Tauri Core'"]
        C["'Plugin 1'"]
        D["'Plugin 2'"]
        A -- "Invoke Plugin Command" --> B
        B -- "Interact with Plugin API" --> C
        B -- "Interact with Plugin API" --> D
    end
```

### 4.6. Updater

The updater component is responsible for securely managing application updates, ensuring users are running the latest and most secure version. This process typically involves:

*   **Update Manifest Retrieval:** Securely fetching an update manifest from a remote server, detailing available updates.
