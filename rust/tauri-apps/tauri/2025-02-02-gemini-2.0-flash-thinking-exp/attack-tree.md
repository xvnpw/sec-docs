        *   **Critical Node Justification:** XSS in a Tauri application is more dangerous than in a typical web browser because it can be leveraged to interact with the native backend via Tauri APIs.
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   **2.2.1.1. Identify XSS vulnerabilities in the frontend code of the Tauri application:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Find and exploit Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities in the frontend JavaScript code.
                *   **Exploitation Steps:**
                    *   Identify input points in the frontend that are not properly sanitized or encoded.
                    *   Inject malicious JavaScript code into these input points (e.g., through URL parameters, form inputs, or data sources).
                    *   The injected script executes within the WebView context.
            *   **2.2.1.2. Exploit XSS to execute malicious JavaScript within the WebView:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Once XSS is achieved, execute malicious JavaScript code within the WebView.
                *   **Exploitation Steps:**
                    *   Use the XSS vulnerability to inject JavaScript code.
                    *   The injected JavaScript can perform actions within the WebView's context.
            *   **2.2.1.3. Leverage XSS to interact with Tauri API or native backend (beyond typical browser XSS impact):**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Use XSS to call Tauri APIs from the malicious JavaScript, bridging the gap from the frontend to the native backend and system.
                *   **Exploitation Steps:**
                    *   From the XSS-injected JavaScript, use Tauri's JavaScript API bindings to call backend functions.
                    *   This allows the attacker to leverage the native capabilities of Tauri from within the compromised WebView.
            *   **2.2.1.4. Achieve more significant compromise due to Tauri's native capabilities (e.g., file system access via API from XSS):**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Combine XSS with Tauri API access to achieve system-level compromise, such as file system access, process execution, or data exfiltration.
                *   **Exploitation Steps:**
                    *   Use XSS to call Tauri APIs related to file system access, process spawning, or other sensitive native functionalities.
                    *   Perform actions that would not be possible with typical browser-based XSS, leading to a more severe compromise of the user's system.
