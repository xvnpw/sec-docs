# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Enable developers to build cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript).
  - Provide a more secure and performant alternative to Electron for desktop application development.
  - Offer a smaller application size and reduced resource consumption compared to traditional web-based desktop application frameworks.
  - Support a wide range of desktop platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux, mobile platforms, etc.).
  - Foster a strong open-source community around the framework.
- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in the Tauri framework itself could impact all applications built with it.
  - Lack of widespread adoption could limit the ecosystem and community support.
  - Performance issues or limitations compared to native desktop applications could hinder user experience.
  - Compatibility problems across different operating systems and hardware configurations.
  - Dependence on underlying system webview components, which are outside of Tauri's direct control.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Secure development and distribution of the Tauri framework itself. If the framework is compromised, all applications built with it are potentially at risk.
  - Secure build and distribution of applications built using Tauri. Compromised build pipelines or distribution channels can lead to malware distribution.
  - Protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data processed by Tauri applications. This depends on the specific application and its functionality.

- Data Sensitivity:
  - Data processed by Tauri applications varies greatly depending on the application's purpose. Sensitivity can range from publicly available data to highly confidential personal or financial information.
  - The Tauri framework itself does not inherently handle sensitive data, but applications built with it may.
  - Configuration files and application resources may contain sensitive information if not properly managed (e.g., API keys, database credentials).
