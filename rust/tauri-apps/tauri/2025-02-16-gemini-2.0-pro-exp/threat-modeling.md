# Threat Model Analysis for tauri-apps/tauri

## Threat: [Command Injection via Frontend Compromise](./threats/command_injection_via_frontend_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains control of the webview (e.g., through a successful XSS, malicious frontend dependency, or compromised CDN). They craft malicious payloads sent to registered Tauri commands, aiming for arbitrary code execution on the host system. This is *not* just misusing intended functionality; the attacker attempts to *break* the command's intended behavior.
*   **Impact:** Complete system compromise, data exfiltration, data destruction, malware installation, privilege escalation.
*   **Affected Tauri Component:** `#[tauri::command]` decorated functions, the IPC mechanism (`invoke` and event handlers).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Command Allowlist:** Expose *only* absolutely essential commands. Avoid generic commands.
    *   **Rigorous Input Validation (Backend):** Validate *all* input parameters to commands. Use strong typing, length limits, character set restrictions, and format validation (e.g., regex). Treat *all* frontend input as untrusted.
    *   **Parameter Type Enforcement:** Use Rust's strong typing to enforce expected data types. Avoid `String` when a more specific type is appropriate.
    *   **Output Encoding (Backend):** If a command returns data, ensure proper output encoding to prevent misinterpretation as code.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the Tauri application with the lowest necessary privileges.

## Threat: [Path Traversal in File System Operations](./threats/path_traversal_in_file_system_operations.md)

*   **Description:** A Tauri command allows file system access (read/write/delete). The attacker provides a crafted file path with `../` sequences or other manipulation characters, trying to access/modify files outside the intended directory.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, data leakage, data corruption, potential system compromise (if system files are overwritten).
*   **Affected Tauri Component:** Tauri APIs for file system access (e.g., `tauri::api::path`, custom commands using `std::fs`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Path Canonicalization:** Use `std::fs::canonicalize` to resolve paths to their absolute forms *before* any file system operations.
    *   **Path Allowlist:** Define a strict allowlist of permitted directories/files. Reject any path outside this allowlist. *Never* construct paths directly from user input without thorough validation.
    *   **Input Validation (Filename):** Validate filenames separately. Reject filenames with special characters or dangerous sequences.
    *   **Sandboxing:** If possible, run the Tauri application in a sandboxed environment to restrict file system access.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Network Requests](./threats/unauthorized_network_requests.md)

*   **Description:** A Tauri command allows network requests (e.g., via `reqwest` or `tauri::api::http`). The attacker provides a malicious URL to access internal services, exfiltrate data, or perform other network attacks.
*   **Impact:** Data exfiltration, network reconnaissance, potential exploitation of internal services, denial of service.
*   **Affected Tauri Component:** Tauri APIs for network access (e.g., `tauri::api::http`, custom commands using HTTP clients).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **URL Allowlist:** Maintain a strict allowlist of permitted URLs/domains. Reject requests to URLs not on the list.
    *   **Input Validation (URL):** Validate URLs for expected formats and to ensure they don't contain malicious characters.
    *   **Network Isolation:** Consider running the application in a network-isolated environment.
    *   **Avoid Sensitive Data in URLs:** Don't include sensitive data (API keys, passwords) directly in URLs. Use headers or request bodies.

## Threat: [Malicious Update Delivery](./threats/malicious_update_delivery.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises the update server or the update process, delivering a malicious update to the Tauri application.
*   **Impact:** Complete system compromise.
*   **Affected Tauri Component:** Tauri's built-in updater (`tauri-plugin-updater`) or any custom update mechanism.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use Tauri Updater:** Prefer the built-in Tauri updater, as it includes security features like code signing verification.
    *   **Secure Update Server:** Host the update server on secure, trusted infrastructure with strong access controls and HTTPS.
    *   **Code Signing:** Digitally sign all updates with a trusted code signing certificate.
    *   **Signature Verification:** The Tauri application *must* verify the digital signature of updates before applying them (Tauri updater does this automatically).
    *   **Regular Security Audits (Update Server):** Conduct regular security audits of the update server.

## Threat: [CSP Bypass via `dangerous_disable_asset_csp_modification` Misuse](./threats/csp_bypass_via__dangerous_disable_asset_csp_modification__misuse.md)

*   **Description:** The application disables Tauri's default CSP modifications using `dangerous_disable_asset_csp_modification` without implementing a robust alternative CSP. This leaves the webview vulnerable to attacks that CSP would normally mitigate.
*   **Impact:** Increased risk of XSS, data injection, and other webview-based attacks.
*   **Affected Tauri Component:** Tauri's configuration related to Content Security Policy (`tauri.conf.json`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Disabling:** Do *not* disable Tauri's CSP modifications unless absolutely necessary.
    *   **Implement Strong Custom CSP:** If disabling is unavoidable, implement a *very* strict, custom CSP that provides equivalent or better protection. Thoroughly test the custom CSP.

## Threat: [CSP Bypass via `dangerous_allow_asset_csp_modification` Misuse](./threats/csp_bypass_via__dangerous_allow_asset_csp_modification__misuse.md)

*   **Description:** The application allows webview to modify CSP using `dangerous_allow_asset_csp_modification` without implementing a robust alternative CSP. This leaves the webview vulnerable to attacks that CSP would normally mitigate.
    *   **Impact:** Increased risk of XSS, data injection, and other webview-based attacks.
    *   **Affected Tauri Component:** Tauri's configuration related to Content Security Policy (`tauri.conf.json`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid Allowing:** Do *not* allow webview to modify Tauri's CSP modifications unless absolutely necessary and you fully understand the implications.
        *   **Implement Strong Custom CSP:** If allowing is unavoidable, implement a *very* strict, custom CSP that provides equivalent or better protection. Thoroughly test the custom CSP.
