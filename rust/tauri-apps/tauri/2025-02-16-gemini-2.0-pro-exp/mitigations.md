# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for tauri-apps/tauri

## Mitigation Strategy: [Capability-Based Security (Tauri's `allowlist`)](./mitigation_strategies/capability-based_security__tauri's__allowlist__.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Capability-Based Security (Tauri's `allowlist`)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Start with an Empty Allowlist:** Begin with a completely empty `allowlist` in your `tauri.conf.json` file. This ensures that the frontend has *no* access to any Tauri APIs by default.
        2.  **Identify Required Capabilities:** Carefully analyze your application's frontend code to determine the *minimum* set of Tauri APIs and custom commands it needs to function.
        3.  **Incrementally Add Capabilities:** Add entries to the `allowlist` *only* for the specific APIs and commands identified in step 2. Be as granular as possible.  For example, if you only need to read a specific file, allow only that file and only the `read` operation.  Use glob patterns and environment variables for flexibility, but always prioritize the most restrictive setting.
        4.  **Regular Review:** Periodically review the `allowlist` to ensure it remains minimal and reflects the current needs of the application. Remove any unused capabilities.  This should be part of your regular development workflow.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Severity: Critical):** Limits the attack surface by restricting access to potentially dangerous APIs (e.g., `shell`, `fs`, `http`).  An attacker compromising the frontend cannot directly execute arbitrary commands on the host system.
        *   **Privilege Escalation (Severity: High):** Prevents the frontend from accessing backend functionality it shouldn't have access to, even if the frontend is compromised.
        *   **Data Exfiltration (Severity: High):** Restricts access to APIs that could be used to read or write sensitive data (e.g., files, environment variables).

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **RCE:** Risk significantly reduced (the primary defense against RCE in Tauri).
        *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk significantly reduced.
        *   **Data Exfiltration:** Risk significantly reduced.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   `tauri.conf.json` contains an `allowlist` that grants access to `fs.readFile` for a specific configuration file (`$APPDATA/config.json`) and `dialog.open` for file selection.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   The `shell.open` capability is currently allowed for all URLs. This should be restricted to a allowlist of known-safe URLs or removed if not strictly necessary.
        *   Custom commands are not yet included in the allowlist; they *must* be added with specific, granular permissions.  Each custom command should be individually listed and its allowed arguments (if any) should be defined.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Context Isolation](./mitigation_strategies/context_isolation.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Context Isolation

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Enable Context Isolation:** In your `tauri.conf.json` file, set `tauri.security.contextIsolation` to `true`. This is a *critical* security setting.
        2.  **Refactor Frontend Code:**  If you were previously accessing Tauri APIs directly from the frontend context (e.g., using `window.tauri`), you *must* refactor your code to use the IPC mechanism exclusively.  The `invoke` function (from `@tauri-apps/api`) should be used to communicate with the backend.
        3.  **Preload Scripts:** Use preload scripts (`build.frontendDist` and `tauri.security.csp` in `tauri.conf.json`) to expose specific, controlled functionality to the frontend.  These scripts run in a separate context with access to the Tauri API, but they act as a bridge, limiting direct access from the main frontend.  The preload script should *only* expose the absolute minimum necessary functions.
        4. **Communicate via IPC:** All communication between the isolated frontend and the backend *must* go through the defined IPC channels.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Severity: High):** If an attacker injects malicious JavaScript into the frontend, context isolation prevents them from directly accessing the Tauri API, significantly limiting the damage.  The attacker is confined to the isolated context.
        *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Severity: Critical):** Indirectly mitigates RCE by severely limiting the attacker's ability to interact with the backend even if the frontend is compromised.  The attacker cannot directly call Tauri APIs.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **XSS:** Risk significantly reduced (attacker's capabilities are severely limited to the isolated context).
        *   **RCE:** Risk indirectly but significantly reduced.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   `tauri.conf.json` has `contextIsolation` set to `true`.
        *   A preload script (`src/preload.js`) exposes a limited set of functions for interacting with the backend via IPC.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Some frontend code still attempts to access `window.tauri` directly (legacy code). This *must* be refactored to use the IPC mechanism via the preload script.  This is a high-priority fix.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Node.js Integration (if not needed)](./mitigation_strategies/disable_node_js_integration__if_not_needed_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Disable Node.js Integration (if not needed)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Assess Node.js Requirements:** Determine if your frontend *absolutely requires* Node.js features.  If your frontend is purely web-based (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and doesn't use Node.js modules, you should disable Node.js integration.
        2.  **Set `build.withGlobalTauri`:** In your `tauri.conf.json` file, set `build.withGlobalTauri` to `false`. This prevents the injection of the global `__TAURI__` object, which provides access to Node.js APIs.
        3. **Verify WebView Settings:** Ensure that no other settings in your WebView configuration are enabling Node.js integration.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Severity: Critical):** If Node.js integration is enabled and the frontend is compromised (e.g., via XSS), the attacker could potentially use Node.js modules to execute arbitrary code on the host system. Disabling Node.js integration eliminates this risk.
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Severity: High):** Reduces the impact of XSS by preventing access to Node.js APIs that could be used for malicious purposes.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **RCE:** Risk significantly reduced (eliminates a major RCE vector if Node.js is not needed).
        *   **XSS:** Risk reduced.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   `tauri.conf.json` has `build.withGlobalTauri` set to `false`.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   None. This mitigation is fully implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid `dangerousRemoteDomainIpcAccess`](./mitigation_strategies/avoid__dangerousremotedomainipcaccess_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Avoid `dangerousRemoteDomainIpcAccess`

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Do NOT Enable:**  In your `tauri.conf.json` file, ensure that `tauri.security.dangerousRemoteDomainIpcAccess` is *not* set to `true`.  The default is `false`, and you should leave it that way unless you have an *extremely* compelling reason to change it, and you fully understand the security implications.
        2. **If Absolutely Necessary (Highly Discouraged):** If you *must* enable this setting (which is strongly discouraged), you *must* implement extremely strict origin checks and message validation on *both* the frontend and backend.  You are essentially opening up your application to cross-origin communication, which is a significant security risk.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Severity: High):** Prevents iframes from different origins from communicating with your Tauri backend, mitigating a potential XSS vector.
        *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Severity: Critical):** By preventing cross-origin IPC, you reduce the risk of an attacker in a different origin exploiting vulnerabilities in your backend.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **XSS:** Risk significantly reduced (by default).
        *   **RCE:** Risk significantly reduced (by default).

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   `tauri.conf.json` does *not* have `dangerousRemoteDomainIpcAccess` enabled (it is `false` by default).

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   None. This mitigation is fully implemented by *not* enabling the dangerous setting.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Updater Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/secure_updater_configuration.md)

* **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Updater Configuration

    * **Description:**
        1.  **Use Tauri's Built-in Updater:** Utilize the updater provided by Tauri (`@tauri-apps/api/updater`). This updater is designed with security in mind.
        2.  **Configure `tauri.conf.json`:** In the `tauri.conf.json` file, configure the `tauri.updater` section.
        3.  **Set `active` to `true`:** Enable the updater.
        4.  **Specify `endpoints`:** Provide a list of secure (HTTPS) endpoints where your update manifests are hosted.
        5.  **Set `dialog` to `true` (Optional):**  Enable the built-in update dialog to inform users about available updates.
        6.  **Configure `pubkey`:**  *Crucially*, set the `pubkey` field to the public key corresponding to the private key you use to sign your updates. This allows Tauri to verify the authenticity and integrity of downloaded updates.
        7. **Sign your updates:** Use the Tauri CLI to sign your application builds. This creates a signature file that is included in the update package.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (Severity: Critical):** Prevents attackers from intercepting and modifying update files, ensuring that users receive genuine updates.
        *   **Malicious Update Distribution (Severity: Critical):** Prevents attackers from distributing malicious updates disguised as legitimate updates.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **MitM Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced (if updates are signed and the public key is correctly configured).
        *   **Malicious Update Distribution:** Risk significantly reduced.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   `tauri.conf.json` has the `updater` section configured with `active: true`, `endpoints` pointing to a secure server, and `dialog: true`.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   The `pubkey` field is *not* yet set in `tauri.conf.json`. This is a *critical* missing piece and must be implemented before deploying updates. The application builds are not currently being signed.
