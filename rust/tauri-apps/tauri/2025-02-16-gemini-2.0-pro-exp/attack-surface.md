# Attack Surface Analysis for tauri-apps/tauri

## Attack Surface: [IPC Command Exposure (Overly Permissive `allowlist`)](./attack_surfaces/ipc_command_exposure__overly_permissive__allowlist__.md)

*   **Description:** The `tauri.conf.json` `allowlist` controls which Rust commands the frontend can invoke. Overly broad permissions grant the frontend excessive power.
    *   **How Tauri Contributes:** Tauri's core functionality relies on this IPC mechanism. The `allowlist` is Tauri's primary control point.
    *   **Example:** An `allowlist` entry like `"fs": { "scope": ["$APP/*"] }` allows the frontend to access *any* file within the application's data directory. If combined with a vulnerable command that doesn't validate file paths, this could lead to arbitrary file read/write. A more dangerous example is `"shell": { "open": true, "scope": ["*"] }`, which allows execution of any shell command.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary file read/write, code execution, privilege escalation, data exfiltration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   **Strict Allowlist:** Use the most restrictive `allowlist` possible. Only enable specific commands needed by the frontend. Avoid wildcards.
            *   **Granular Scopes:** Use fine-grained scopes for each command, limiting access to specific files, directories, or resources.
            *   **Regular Review:** Regularly review and update the `allowlist` as the application evolves. Remove unused commands.

## Attack Surface: [IPC Command Input Injection](./attack_surfaces/ipc_command_input_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Even with a restricted `allowlist`, vulnerabilities in the Rust command handlers can allow attackers to inject malicious input, leading to various attacks.
    *   **How Tauri Contributes:** Tauri facilitates the communication, but the vulnerability lies in how the Rust backend handles the data received from the frontend.
    *   **Example:** A command to read a file, `read_user_file`, takes a filename as input from the frontend. If the Rust code directly uses this filename without validation, an attacker could provide a path like `"../../etc/passwd"` to read system files (path traversal).
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary file read/write, code execution (if command injection is possible), SQL injection (if interacting with a database), data corruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   **Input Validation (Rust Side):** *Always* validate and sanitize all input received from the frontend on the Rust side. Use strong typing and parsing libraries.
            *   **Parameterized Queries:** If interacting with a database, use parameterized queries (prepared statements) to prevent SQL injection.
            *   **Safe Path Handling:** Use Rust's `Path` and `PathBuf` types and their methods to safely manipulate file paths. Avoid string concatenation.
            *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the application runs with the minimum necessary privileges.

## Attack Surface: [Tauri Filesystem API (`fs`) - Path Traversal](./attack_surfaces/tauri_filesystem_api___fs___-_path_traversal.md)

*   **Description:** The `fs` module allows file system access. If the frontend can influence file paths, attackers can attempt path traversal to access unauthorized files.
    *   **How Tauri Contributes:** Tauri provides the `fs` API, making file system interaction convenient, but also increasing the risk if misused.
    *   **Example:** An application allows users to upload images. If the backend doesn't properly sanitize the filename provided by the frontend, an attacker could upload a file named `"../../../etc/passwd"` to overwrite a system file (if permissions allow).
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary file read/write, data corruption, potential code execution (depending on the overwritten file).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   **Strict Path Validation (Rust Side):** Validate and sanitize all file paths received from the frontend. Ensure they are within the expected directory and don't contain traversal sequences (`..`).
            *   **Use of `Path` and `PathBuf`:** Leverage Rust's path manipulation tools to prevent common path traversal vulnerabilities.
            *   **Whitelist Allowed Extensions:** If accepting file uploads, enforce a strict whitelist of allowed file extensions.
            *   **Randomize File Names:** Store uploaded files with randomly generated names to prevent attackers from predicting or controlling filenames.

## Attack Surface: [Tauri Shell API (`shell`) - Command Injection](./attack_surfaces/tauri_shell_api___shell___-_command_injection.md)

*   **Description:** The `shell` API allows executing shell commands. If the frontend can influence the command or its arguments, this is a direct path to code execution.
    *   **How Tauri Contributes:** Tauri provides the `shell` API, which, while powerful, is inherently dangerous if not used with extreme caution.
    *   **Example:** An application uses the `shell` API to run a system utility. If the frontend can provide arguments to this utility, an attacker could inject malicious commands. For instance, if the command is `ls [user_input]`, an attacker could provide `"; rm -rf /; #"` to execute arbitrary commands.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, complete system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   **Avoid `shell` API if Possible:** Explore alternative solutions that don't require shell execution (e.g., Rust libraries).
            *   **Parameterized Commands:** If `shell` is unavoidable, *never* construct commands using string concatenation with user input. Use parameterized commands (e.g., `Command::new("program").arg("arg1").arg("arg2")`).
            *   **Strict Input Validation:** If arguments must be passed, rigorously validate and sanitize them. Use a whitelist of allowed characters and patterns.

## Attack Surface: [Tauri HTTP API (`http`) - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](./attack_surfaces/tauri_http_api___http___-_server-side_request_forgery__ssrf_.md)

*   **Description:** If the frontend can specify URLs for the backend to fetch, attackers can exploit this to access internal resources or interact with other services.
    *   **How Tauri Contributes:** Tauri provides the `http` API for making HTTP requests from the backend.
    *   **Example:** An application allows users to enter a URL to fetch and display its content. An attacker could enter `http://localhost:8080/admin` or `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/` (AWS metadata endpoint) to access internal services or sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:** Access to internal network resources, data exfiltration, interaction with other services on behalf of the application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   **URL Allowlist:** Implement a strict allowlist of permitted domains/URLs that the backend can access.
            *   **Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize all URLs provided by the frontend.
            *   **Avoid Fetching User-Provided URLs:** If possible, avoid fetching URLs directly provided by the user. If necessary, use a proxy or intermediary service to sanitize and validate the requests.
            * **Network Segmentation:** If possible, isolate the application from sensitive internal networks.

## Attack Surface: [Tauri Updater - Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)](./attack_surfaces/tauri_updater_-_man-in-the-middle__mitm_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers could intercept the update process to deliver a malicious update.
    *   **How Tauri Contributes:** Tauri provides a built-in updater mechanism.
    *   **Example:** An attacker intercepts the network traffic between the application and the update server and replaces the legitimate update with a malicious one.
    *   **Impact:** Installation of malicious code, complete system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   **HTTPS:** Use HTTPS for all update communication.
            *   **Code Signing:** Digitally sign updates and verify the signature before installation.
            *   **Secure Update Server:** Ensure the update server is secure and protected against compromise.

## Attack Surface: [Native Plugins - Plugin Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/native_plugins_-_plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Vulnerabilities in native plugins can lead to severe consequences, as they operate with backend privileges.
    * **How Tauri Contributes:** Tauri allows the integration of native plugins, extending functionality but also expanding the attack surface.
    * **Example:** A plugin designed to interact with a specific hardware device has a buffer overflow vulnerability. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability through the plugin's interface to execute arbitrary code.
    * **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, privilege escalation, data exfiltration, system compromise.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developer:**
            * **Thorough Vetting:** Carefully vet any third-party plugins before integrating them.
            * **Secure Coding Practices:** If developing custom plugins, follow secure coding practices, including input validation, memory safety, and error handling.
            * **Regular Audits:** Regularly audit plugin code for vulnerabilities.
            * **Sandboxing (if possible):** Explore sandboxing techniques to isolate plugins and limit their access to system resources.
