# Threat Model Analysis for ruffle-rs/ruffle

## Threat: [Code Execution Bug in SWF Parsing](./threats/code_execution_bug_in_swf_parsing.md)

**Threat:** SWF Parsing Code Execution
*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious SWF file that exploits a vulnerability in Ruffle's SWF parsing logic. When Ruffle attempts to parse this SWF, it triggers a buffer overflow, memory corruption, or other code execution vulnerability. The attacker can then execute arbitrary code on the user's machine with the privileges of the browser process.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the user's browser session and potentially the user's system. Attackers can steal data, install malware, or perform other malicious actions.
*   **Ruffle Component Affected:** SWF Parser Module (specifically, code responsible for parsing various SWF tags, actions, and data structures).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Keep Ruffle updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the capabilities of executed scripts and limit the damage from code execution.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Ensure your browser is up-to-date.
        *   Avoid running SWF files from untrusted sources.

## Threat: [Re-emergent Flash Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/re-emergent_flash_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

**Threat:** Re-emergent Flash Vulnerability
*   **Description:**  Ruffle, while aiming for security, might inadvertently reintroduce or fail to fully mitigate known vulnerabilities that existed in the original Adobe Flash Player. Attackers could exploit these re-emergent vulnerabilities using existing Flash exploits against Ruffle.
*   **Impact:**  Exploitation of known Flash vulnerabilities, potentially leading to code execution, information disclosure, or other attacks, similar to the original Flash Player vulnerabilities.
*   **Ruffle Component Affected:**  Various components depending on the specific vulnerability, but likely related to ActionScript VM, SWF parsing, or API emulation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the specific vulnerability re-emerging)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Stay informed about known Flash vulnerabilities and how Ruffle addresses them.
        *   Actively test Ruffle against known Flash exploits and vulnerability databases.
        *   Participate in or monitor Ruffle's security discussions and bug reports.
        *   Keep Ruffle updated to benefit from fixes for re-emergent vulnerabilities.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Keep your browser and Ruffle (if you are directly managing it) updated.
        *   Exercise caution with SWF content from unknown sources.

## Threat: [Novel Flash Content Exploitation via Ruffle](./threats/novel_flash_content_exploitation_via_ruffle.md)

**Threat:** Novel Flash Exploit via Ruffle
*   **Description:** Attackers create new, specifically crafted Flash content designed to exploit vulnerabilities unique to Ruffle's emulation. These vulnerabilities might not have existed in the original Flash Player but arise from differences in Ruffle's implementation or edge cases in SWF handling.
*   **Impact:**  Similar to re-emergent vulnerabilities, this could lead to code execution, information disclosure, or other attacks.
*   **Ruffle Component Affected:**  Potentially any Ruffle component, depending on the nature of the novel vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the severity of the novel vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Proactive security testing of Ruffle with a wide range of Flash content, including potentially malicious or unusual SWF files.
        *   Participate in or support Ruffle's community and bug bounty programs to encourage vulnerability discovery and reporting.
        *   Implement robust input validation and content security policies to limit the impact of malicious SWF files.
        *   Keep Ruffle updated to address newly discovered vulnerabilities.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Be extra cautious with SWF content from untrusted or unknown sources.
        *   Keep your browser and Ruffle (if applicable) updated.
