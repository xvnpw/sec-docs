# BUSINESS POSTURE

Ruffle is an open-source Flash Player emulator. Its primary business priority is to preserve Flash content and ensure it remains accessible in modern web browsers and operating systems now that Adobe Flash Player is no longer supported.

- Business Goals:
  - Preserve legacy Flash content.
  - Provide a secure and open-source alternative to Adobe Flash Player.
  - Enable users to access Flash content on modern platforms without security risks associated with outdated Flash Player.
  - Support content creators and archives in keeping Flash content alive.

- Business Risks:
  - Compatibility issues with complex or obscure Flash content.
  - Performance limitations compared to the original Flash Player.
  - Potential security vulnerabilities in the emulator itself.
  - Lack of widespread adoption or user awareness.
  - Dependence on volunteer contributors and sustainability of the open-source project.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security Controls:
  - security control: Open-source project with public code repository (GitHub). This allows for community review and contribution to security. Implemented in: GitHub repository.
  - security control: Use of Rust programming language. Rust's memory safety features reduce the risk of common vulnerabilities like buffer overflows. Implemented in: Project codebase.
  - security control: Regular code reviews by project maintainers. Implemented in: Project development process.
  - security control: Issue tracking system (GitHub Issues) for reporting and addressing bugs and potential security vulnerabilities. Implemented in: GitHub repository.
  - security control: Community contributions and peer review. Implemented in: Open-source development model.

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Potential for undiscovered vulnerabilities in the emulator code. Mitigation: Open-source nature, code reviews, and community scrutiny.
  - accepted risk: Risk of compatibility issues leading to unexpected behavior or security edge cases. Mitigation: Continuous testing and community feedback.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on volunteer effort for security maintenance and updates. Mitigation: Active project maintainers and community engagement.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated security scanning tools (SAST/DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to detect potential vulnerabilities early in the development process.
  - security control: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure policy and process to handle security reports effectively.
  - security control: Conduct regular security audits or penetration testing by external security experts.
  - security control: Implement dependency scanning and management to ensure third-party libraries are up-to-date and free from known vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Consider fuzzing to discover unexpected inputs that might lead to crashes or vulnerabilities.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not applicable. Ruffle is a player, not a service requiring user authentication.
  - Authorization: Not applicable. Ruffle's primary function is to play content, not to control access to resources. However, browser integration might involve browser's permission model.
  - Input Validation: Critical. Ruffle must rigorously validate and sanitize all input data from Flash content (SWF files) to prevent vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS), buffer overflows, and other injection attacks. Input validation should be applied at every stage of parsing and processing SWF data.
  - Cryptography: Relevant for handling encrypted Flash content (if supported) and for secure communication if Ruffle interacts with external services (though currently it primarily operates locally). If network communication is added, ensure TLS/HTTPS is used. For SWF content, handle any cryptographic operations securely, avoiding weak algorithms or insecure implementations.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Preservation of Flash content accessibility.
  - Maintaining user trust in Ruffle as a secure alternative to Flash Player.
  - Ensuring the long-term viability and maintenance of the open-source project.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Source code: High sensitivity. Confidentiality and integrity are crucial to prevent malicious modifications and maintain project trustworthiness.
  - Build artifacts (Web Player, Desktop Player, Browser Extension): High sensitivity. Integrity is paramount to ensure users download and run legitimate, untampered software.
  - User data: Low sensitivity. Ruffle primarily operates locally and does not collect significant user data. However, if telemetry or update mechanisms are added in the future, user privacy and data security will become more important.
  - SWF content: Medium sensitivity. While SWF files themselves are often publicly available, they can contain intellectual property or sensitive information. Ruffle needs to handle SWF files securely to prevent unintended information disclosure or malicious exploitation.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - Are there any plans to introduce network communication features in Ruffle (e.g., for updates, telemetry, or online services)? If so, security requirements for network communication need to be considered.
  - What is the process for handling security vulnerability reports from the community? Is there a dedicated security team or contact?
  - Are there specific types of Flash content or ActionScript features that are considered out of scope for Ruffle emulation, and what are the security implications of these limitations?
  - What are the long-term plans for funding and maintaining the Ruffle project to ensure continued security updates and support?

- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is non-commercial and focused on public good (Flash content preservation).
  - SECURITY POSTURE: The project follows standard open-source security practices. Security is a high priority, given the nature of software emulation and potential for vulnerabilities.
  - DESIGN: The architecture is primarily focused on local execution and browser integration, with minimal external dependencies or network communication in the current design. The build process utilizes standard CI/CD practices and GitHub infrastructure.
