# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for ruffle-rs/ruffle

## Mitigation Strategy: [Stay Up-to-Date and Monitor Security Advisories](./mitigation_strategies/stay_up-to-date_and_monitor_security_advisories.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Subscribe to Ruffle Releases:** Subscribe to Ruffle's official release announcements and security advisories (GitHub, mailing list, etc.).  This is crucial for receiving timely notifications about security patches.
2.  **Automated Dependency Updates:** Use a dependency management tool (e.g., `cargo` for Rust, `npm` if using Ruffle.js) to automatically check for and install Ruffle updates.  This ensures you're always running the latest, most secure version.
3.  **Vulnerability Scanning:** Integrate vulnerability scanning tools (e.g., `cargo audit`, Snyk, Dependabot) that specifically target Ruffle and its dependencies. This helps identify known vulnerabilities.
4.  **Rapid Patching Process:** Establish a process for quickly deploying Ruffle updates, especially security-related patches, to production environments.  Minimize the time between vulnerability disclosure and patch deployment.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Ruffle-Specific Vulnerabilities:** (Severity: High) - Addresses vulnerabilities discovered *within* the Ruffle codebase itself. This is the primary threat this strategy mitigates.

**Impact:**
*   **Ruffle-Specific Vulnerabilities:** Significantly reduces the risk of exploitation of Ruffle-specific bugs. The faster the update, the lower the risk.  This is a *critical* mitigation.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   *Example:* Dependency management with `cargo` is used.
*   *Example:* Basic vulnerability scanning with `cargo audit` is in place.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   *Example:* Automated deployment of Ruffle updates is not fully automated.
*   *Example:* Subscription to Ruffle security advisories needs to be formalized.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limits (Within Ruffle/WebAssembly)](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limits__within_rufflewebassembly_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **WebAssembly Memory Limits:**  When instantiating the Ruffle WebAssembly module, set a reasonable maximum memory allocation.  This is done through WebAssembly APIs (e.g., `WebAssembly.Memory` in JavaScript).  This prevents a malicious SWF from consuming all available memory.
2.  **Ruffle Configuration (if applicable):**  Check if Ruffle itself offers any configuration options to limit resource usage (e.g., maximum number of concurrent animations, limits on ActionScript execution time).  If such options exist, use them.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Resource Exhaustion (DoS via SWF):** (Severity: Medium) - Limits the impact of resource-intensive SWFs *within the Ruffle/WebAssembly context*.
*   **Ruffle-Specific Vulnerabilities:** (Severity: Medium) - Can *partially* mitigate some Ruffle vulnerabilities that might lead to excessive resource consumption.

**Impact:**
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** Reduces the likelihood of a successful DoS attack originating from within Ruffle.
*   **Ruffle-Specific Vulnerabilities:** Provides a limited degree of protection against vulnerabilities that manifest as resource exhaustion.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   *Example:* Basic WebAssembly memory limits are set in `src/ruffle_wrapper.js`.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   *Example:* Investigation into Ruffle-specific configuration options for resource limits is needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Context Separation and Output Sanitization (Within Ruffle's Interaction)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_context_separation_and_output_sanitization__within_ruffle's_interaction_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Controlled DOM Access:**  If Ruffle provides any APIs for interacting with the host page's DOM, use these APIs *very* sparingly and with extreme caution.  Avoid direct DOM manipulation from within the emulated ActionScript environment if at all possible.  If Ruffle provides specific, sandboxed methods for interacting with the DOM, *use those exclusively*.
2.  **Output Sanitization (Ruffle-to-Host):** If Ruffle outputs *any* data to the host page (e.g., text, HTML fragments), ensure that this output is passed through a robust HTML sanitization library *before* being inserted into the DOM.  This is *critical* to prevent XSS.  This sanitization should happen *as close as possible to the point where Ruffle interacts with the host*.
3.  **`ExternalInterface` Whitelisting (If Used):** If Ruffle supports `ExternalInterface` (the Flash-to-JavaScript communication mechanism), implement a *very strict* whitelist of allowed JavaScript functions that can be called from ActionScript.  *Never* allow arbitrary JavaScript execution.  Validate all data passed through `ExternalInterface` as if it were untrusted user input.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Emulated ActionScript:** (Severity: High) - Prevents malicious SWFs from injecting JavaScript into the host page through Ruffle's interaction with the DOM or `ExternalInterface`.

**Impact:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Significantly reduces the risk of XSS, provided the sanitization and whitelisting are implemented correctly and comprehensively.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   *Example:* Basic output sanitization is used in `src/ui_handler.js`, but needs to be reviewed for completeness and placed closer to Ruffle's output.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   *Example:* `ExternalInterface` whitelisting is not fully implemented.
*   *Example:* A comprehensive review of all Ruffle-to-host interaction points is needed to ensure proper sanitization.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Legacy Features and Enforce Modern Security Policies (Within Ruffle's Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/disable_legacy_features_and_enforce_modern_security_policies__within_ruffle's_configuration_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Legacy Features:** Thoroughly review Ruffle's documentation and configuration options to identify any legacy Flash features that are enabled by default but are not *absolutely essential* for the application's functionality.  Examples might include `LocalConnection`, `SharedObject`, or older network APIs.
2.  **Disable Unnecessary Features (Ruffle Config):**  Use Ruffle's configuration mechanisms (if available) to explicitly disable or restrict these unnecessary legacy features.  This reduces the attack surface.
3.  **Enforce Modern Security Policies (Ruffle Config):**  If Ruffle provides options to enforce modern security policies (like the Same-Origin Policy) even for SWFs designed for older Flash Player versions, *enable these options*. This ensures that Ruffle behaves as securely as possible, regardless of the SWF's intended environment.
4.  **Configuration Review:** Regularly review Ruffle's configuration (as the project evolves) to ensure that legacy features remain disabled and that security policies are up-to-date.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Bypassing of Same-Origin Policy (SOP):** (Severity: High) - Prevents SWFs from exploiting legacy features to bypass the Same-Origin Policy.
*   **Information Disclosure:** (Severity: Medium) - Reduces the risk of SWFs accessing local resources or communicating with unauthorized domains by leveraging deprecated features.

**Impact:**
*   **Bypassing of Same-Origin Policy (SOP):** Significantly reduces the risk by enforcing modern security restrictions at the Ruffle level.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Reduces the attack surface by limiting access to potentially sensitive features within Ruffle's emulation.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   *Example:* Some legacy features are disabled by default in Ruffle's configuration.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   *Example:* A comprehensive review of all Ruffle configuration options related to legacy features and security policies is needed.
*   *Example:* Explicit configuration to enforce modern security policies in all cases, overriding any SWF-specific settings, is needed.
