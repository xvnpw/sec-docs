# Attack Surface Analysis for ruffle-rs/ruffle

## Attack Surface: [Malicious SWF File Parsing](./attack_surfaces/malicious_swf_file_parsing.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from parsing and interpreting the complex structure of SWF files.  This is Ruffle's *primary* responsibility.

**How Ruffle Contributes:** Ruffle's core function is to parse and interpret SWF files. The SWF format is complex, with numerous potential areas for errors in parsing logic.

**Example:**
    *   A crafted SWF file contains a malformed DefineShape tag with an invalid number of shape records, leading to a buffer overflow when Ruffle attempts to read the shape data.
    *   An SWF contains deeply nested compressed data that, when decompressed, exceeds allocated memory limits, causing a denial-of-service.
    *   An SWF uses an obscure, undocumented feature of the SWF format that Ruffle doesn't handle correctly, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) - Potentially allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the browser (via WebAssembly).
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) - Crashing the browser tab or the entire browser.
    *   Information Disclosure - Potentially leaking memory contents.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Extensive Fuzzing:** Use fuzzing tools (e.g., AFL++, libFuzzer) specifically designed for binary formats to test the SWF parser with a wide range of malformed inputs. Prioritize fuzzing areas that handle complex data structures (shapes, fonts, compressed data, bytecode).
    *   **Memory Safety (Rust):** Leverage Rust's memory safety features. Minimize the use of `unsafe` code and thoroughly review any `unsafe` blocks.  Use memory-safe alternatives whenever possible.
    *   **Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation at *every* stage of parsing. Check the size and validity of *all* data fields before processing them. Reject files that violate the SWF specification.
    *   **Resource Limits:** Impose strict limits on memory allocation, recursion depth, and processing time to prevent DoS attacks.
    *   **Code Audits:** Conduct regular, in-depth security audits of the SWF parsing code, focusing on areas that handle complex data structures and external data.  Engage external security experts for these audits.

## Attack Surface: [ActionScript Virtual Machine (AVM) Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/actionscript_virtual_machine__avm__exploitation.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in the implementation of the ActionScript virtual machine (AVM1 and AVM2). This is entirely within Ruffle's codebase.

**How Ruffle Contributes:** Ruffle emulates both AVM1 and AVM2. These are complex virtual machines with their own instruction sets, object models, and security models.

**Example:**
    *   A malicious SWF uses a specific ActionScript opcode in an unexpected way, triggering a type confusion vulnerability in Ruffle's AVM implementation, leading to memory corruption.
    *   An SWF exploits a flaw in Ruffle's implementation of a built-in ActionScript function to manipulate memory outside of its allocated region.
    *   An SWF uses a combination of ActionScript instructions to create an infinite loop, causing a denial-of-service.
    *   An SWF attempts to access restricted internal Ruffle data structures through carefully crafted ActionScript.

**Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) - Potentially, through memory corruption within the WebAssembly environment.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) - Crashing the browser tab.
    *   Information Disclosure - Potentially accessing Ruffle's internal memory.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Fuzzing (ActionScript Bytecode):** Fuzz the AVM implementation by generating random or mutated ActionScript bytecode and observing Ruffle's behavior.  Focus on edge cases and interactions between different opcodes.
    *   **Sandbox Enforcement (Internal):** Even within the WebAssembly environment, maintain a strong internal sandbox.  Carefully control access to Ruffle's internal data structures and functions from ActionScript.
    *   **API Hardening:** Implement robust checks and validation for all internal functions and data structures that are accessible (even indirectly) from ActionScript.
    *   **Security Audits (AVM):** Conduct regular security audits of the AVM implementation, focusing on opcode handling, memory management, and internal sandboxing.
    *   **Test Suite:** Create a comprehensive test suite that covers a wide range of ActionScript features and edge cases, including known security vulnerabilities in Flash Player and specifically targeting Ruffle's implementation.
    *   **Resource Limits:** Implement limits on ActionScript execution time, memory usage, and recursion depth to prevent DoS attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Dependencies (Directly Used by Ruffle)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_dependencies__directly_used_by_ruffle_.md)

**Description:**  Vulnerabilities in third-party Rust crates that are *directly* used by Ruffle's core logic (parsing, AVM, rendering).  This excludes dependencies used only for build processes or testing.

**How Ruffle Contributes:** Ruffle's functionality depends on the security of the crates it uses for tasks like image decoding, XML parsing, etc.

**Example:**
    *   Ruffle uses a crate for image decoding that has a known vulnerability, allowing a malicious SWF with a crafted image to trigger a buffer overflow *within Ruffle's WebAssembly memory*.
    *   A dependency used for parsing XML data within SWFs has a vulnerability that allows for XML External Entity (XXE) attacks, potentially leading to information disclosure *from Ruffle's memory*.

**Impact:**
    *   Varies depending on the vulnerability in the dependency. Could range from DoS to RCE (within Ruffle's WebAssembly context).

**Risk Severity:** High (depending on the specific vulnerability and how the dependency is used)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Auditing:** Use tools like `cargo audit` or Dependabot to *automatically* and *continuously* check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep dependencies up-to-date to ensure you have the latest security patches.  Automate this process.
    *   **Dependency Minimization:** Minimize the number of *direct* dependencies to reduce the attack surface.  Carefully evaluate the necessity of each dependency.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use vulnerability scanners that can analyze Rust code and its dependencies, specifically looking for vulnerabilities that could be triggered by malicious SWF input.
    *   **Careful Selection:** Choose dependencies carefully, preferring well-maintained and security-conscious projects with a track record of prompt vulnerability response.
