## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Ruffle Parser [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_ruffle_parser__high-risk_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This branch focuses on vulnerabilities within Ruffle's SWF file parsing logic. The SWF format is complex, and parsing it securely is crucial. Errors in parsing can lead to memory corruption and, potentially, arbitrary code execution.

*   **SWF File Parsing Bugs:**
    *   *Description:* This is a general category encompassing any error in parsing the binary structure of the SWF file. It includes, but is not limited to, the specific vulnerabilities listed below.
    *   *Likelihood:* Medium
    *   *Impact:* High to Very High
    *   *Effort:* Medium to High
    *   *Skill Level:* Intermediate to Advanced
    *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium to Hard

*   **Buffer Overflow [CRITICAL]**
    *   *Description:* A classic vulnerability where a malicious SWF file provides data that exceeds the allocated buffer size in Ruffle's parser. This can overwrite adjacent memory, potentially leading to control over the program's execution flow. This is most likely to occur within `unsafe` blocks of Rust code.
    *   *Likelihood:* Low (due to Rust's memory safety, but higher within `unsafe` code)
    *   *Impact:* Very High (direct path to code execution)
    *   *Effort:* High (requires finding an `unsafe` block with a buffer overflow)
    *   *Skill Level:* Advanced (requires deep understanding of memory management and exploit development)
    *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Ruffle ActionScript VM [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_ruffle_actionscript_vm__high-risk_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This branch targets vulnerabilities in Ruffle's implementation of the ActionScript Virtual Machine (AVM). The AVM executes ActionScript bytecode, and errors in its implementation can lead to security issues.

*   **Type Confusion [CRITICAL]**
    *   *Description:* This vulnerability occurs when Ruffle incorrectly interprets the type of an ActionScript object. This can happen due to errors in how Ruffle handles ActionScript's dynamic typing, especially when interacting with native code (potentially through `unsafe` blocks). Misinterpreting an object's type can lead to accessing memory out of bounds or treating data as code, resulting in arbitrary code execution.
    *   *Likelihood:* Low to Medium (Rust's type system helps, but dynamic typing and `unsafe` code are risk factors)
    *   *Impact:* High (can lead to memory corruption and code execution)
    *   *Effort:* Medium to High (requires understanding Ruffle's type handling and finding a mismatch)
    *   *Skill Level:* Advanced (requires knowledge of type systems and exploit development)
    *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium to Hard

*   **Use-After-Free [CRITICAL]**
    *   *Description:* This vulnerability occurs when Ruffle accesses memory that has already been freed. This is a classic memory safety error that can lead to arbitrary code execution. While Rust's ownership system is designed to prevent this, vulnerabilities can still arise within `unsafe` code blocks if memory management is not handled correctly.
    *   *Likelihood:* Very Low (due to Rust's ownership system, but higher within `unsafe` code)
    *   *Impact:* Very High (direct path to code execution)
    *   *Effort:* Very High (requires finding a flaw in `unsafe` code)
    *   *Skill Level:* Expert (requires deep understanding of Rust's memory management)
    *   *Detection Difficulty:* Very Hard

*   **Double Frees [CRITICAL]**
    *   *Description:* This vulnerability occurs when Ruffle frees the same memory region twice. This can corrupt the memory allocator's internal data structures, leading to unpredictable behavior and, potentially, arbitrary code execution. Similar to Use-After-Free, this is primarily a concern within `unsafe` code blocks.
    *   *Likelihood:* Very Low (due to Rust's ownership system, but higher within `unsafe` code)
    *   *Impact:* Very High (direct path to code execution)
    *   *Effort:* Very High (requires finding a flaw in `unsafe` code)
    *   *Skill Level:* Expert (requires deep understanding of Rust's memory management)
    *   *Detection Difficulty:* Very Hard
