# Attack Surface Analysis for ruffle-rs/ruffle

## Attack Surface: [Malicious SWF Content Exploiting Ruffle Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/malicious_swf_content_exploiting_ruffle_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Attackers craft malicious SWF files designed to exploit vulnerabilities within Ruffle's code, leading to unintended behavior.

**How Ruffle Contributes:** Ruffle's emulation of Flash features introduces its own codebase and potential bugs that differ from the original Flash Player. These bugs can be targeted by malicious SWFs.

**Example:** A specially crafted SWF triggers a buffer overflow in Ruffle's ActionScript 3 interpreter, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's machine.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing the attacker to gain control of the user's system.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Keep Ruffle Updated: Regularly update Ruffle to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
- Sanitize SWF Sources: If accepting SWF uploads, implement strict validation and sanitization processes to filter out potentially malicious files.
- Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement a strong CSP to limit the actions that Ruffle can perform and where it can load resources from.
- Sandboxing: If feasible, run Ruffle in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of a successful exploit.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious SWF Content](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_malicious_swf_content.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into the context of the hosting web application by leveraging Ruffle's rendering of SWF content.

**How Ruffle Contributes:** If Ruffle doesn't properly sanitize or escape output when rendering certain SWF elements, malicious scripts within the SWF can be executed in the user's browser within the application's origin.

**Example:** A malicious SWF contains ActionScript that injects JavaScript into the DOM, stealing user cookies or redirecting the user to a phishing site.

**Impact:** Account takeover, data theft, defacement of the web application.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Keep Ruffle Updated: Updates may include fixes for rendering issues that could lead to XSS.
- Content Security Policy (CSP):  A properly configured CSP can restrict the execution of inline scripts and the sources from which scripts can be loaded, mitigating XSS risks.
- Input Validation on SWF Content (if applicable): While challenging, try to identify and block SWFs with suspicious scripting behaviors.
- Regular Security Audits: Conduct security audits to identify potential XSS vulnerabilities related to Ruffle's rendering.

## Attack Surface: [Ruffle-Specific Code Vulnerabilities (Beyond SWF Exploitation)](./attack_surfaces/ruffle-specific_code_vulnerabilities__beyond_swf_exploitation_.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities exist directly within Ruffle's Rust codebase, independent of the content of the SWF file being processed.

**How Ruffle Contributes:** As a software application, Ruffle's own code can contain bugs, memory safety issues (though Rust mitigates many), or logic errors that could be exploited.

**Example:** A vulnerability in Ruffle's handling of certain data structures leads to a denial-of-service when processing a valid but complex SWF, or potentially a more severe issue like memory corruption.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), unexpected application behavior, potential for memory corruption or other security flaws.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Keep Ruffle Updated: Stay current with Ruffle releases to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
- Monitor Ruffle's Security Advisories: Subscribe to Ruffle's security advisories and release notes to be informed of any reported vulnerabilities.
- Contribute to Ruffle's Security:** If possible, participate in Ruffle's development or security testing to help identify and fix vulnerabilities.
