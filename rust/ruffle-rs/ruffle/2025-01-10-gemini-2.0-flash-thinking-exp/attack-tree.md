## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Ruffle (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_ruffle__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at any of the sub-nodes represents a compromise of the application through the Ruffle component.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Malicious SWF Content (HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_malicious_swf_content__high-risk_path_start_.md)

This broad category encompasses attacks that leverage specially crafted SWF files to exploit weaknesses in Ruffle. The attacker's goal is to introduce malicious functionality through the content of the SWF file itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious ActionScript (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_actionscript__critical_node_.md)

ActionScript is the scripting language used within SWF files. Attackers aim to embed malicious ActionScript code within a SWF file that, when interpreted by Ruffle, will execute their intended actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage ActionScript vulnerabilities in Ruffle's implementation](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_actionscript_vulnerabilities_in_ruffle's_implementation.md)

This involves finding flaws in how Ruffle's ActionScript Virtual Machine (AVM) interprets and executes ActionScript code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Overflow buffers in ActionScript VM (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/overflow_buffers_in_actionscript_vm__high-risk_path_.md)

The attacker crafts ActionScript code that provides more data than the AVM's buffers can handle. This can overwrite adjacent memory, potentially allowing the attacker to control the execution flow or inject shellcode.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit logic flaws in ActionScript handling (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_logic_flaws_in_actionscript_handling__high-risk_path_.md)

This involves finding flaws in the logic of Ruffle's AVM. Attackers can craft specific ActionScript sequences that trigger unexpected behavior, leading to security vulnerabilities like information leaks or control flow manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via SWF (HIGH-RISK PATH START, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_cross-site_scripting__xss__via_swf__high-risk_path_start__critical_node_.md)

The attacker crafts a malicious SWF file that, when loaded by the application, injects malicious JavaScript into the context of the application's web page. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser, potentially stealing cookies, session tokens, or performing actions on behalf of the user.

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft SWF to inject malicious JavaScript into the application's context](./attack_tree_paths/craft_swf_to_inject_malicious_javascript_into_the_application's_context.md)

The malicious SWF is designed to output JavaScript code that the browser will then execute within the application's domain.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit vulnerabilities in Ruffle's handling of external interfaces (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_ruffle's_handling_of_external_interfaces__high-risk_path_.md)

Ruffle provides mechanisms for SWF files to interact with the outside world (e.g., through `ExternalInterface`). Attackers can exploit flaws in how Ruffle handles these interfaces to inject JavaScript. For example, improper sanitization of data passed through `ExternalInterface.call` could allow script injection.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Ruffle's SWF Parsing (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_ruffle's_swf_parsing__critical_node_.md)

Ruffle needs to parse and interpret the structure of SWF files. Vulnerabilities in this parsing process can be exploited by providing malformed or unexpected SWF data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft malformed SWF to trigger parsing errors leading to code execution (HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/craft_malformed_swf_to_trigger_parsing_errors_leading_to_code_execution__high-risk_path_start_.md)

Attackers create SWF files that intentionally violate the SWF specification or contain unexpected data. If Ruffle's parser doesn't handle these cases correctly, it can lead to exploitable errors.

## Attack Tree Path: [Overflow buffers during SWF parsing (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/overflow_buffers_during_swf_parsing__high-risk_path_.md)

When parsing the SWF file, Ruffle might allocate buffers to store data from the file. If the attacker can manipulate the SWF to specify sizes larger than expected, it can lead to buffer overflows in Ruffle's native code, potentially allowing for arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Ruffle's Implementation (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_ruffle's_implementation__critical_node_.md)

This encompasses vulnerabilities within the core C/Rust codebase of Ruffle itself, beyond just the ActionScript VM or SWF parsing.

## Attack Tree Path: [Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH START, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/memory_corruption_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_start__critical_node_.md)

These are flaws in how Ruffle manages memory. They are particularly dangerous as they can often lead to arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Buffer Overflows (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/buffer_overflows__high-risk_path_.md)

Occur when Ruffle writes data beyond the allocated boundary of a buffer in its memory. Attackers can carefully craft input data (often within the SWF file) to trigger these overflows and overwrite critical data or inject malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger overflows in Ruffle's C/Rust code when handling SWF data](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_overflows_in_ruffle's_crust_code_when_handling_swf_data.md)

This specifically refers to buffer overflows happening in the native code of Ruffle while processing data from the SWF file.

## Attack Tree Path: [Use-After-Free (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/use-after-free__high-risk_path_.md)

Occurs when Ruffle attempts to access memory that has already been freed. This can lead to crashes or, more dangerously, allow attackers to manipulate the freed memory and potentially gain control of program execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger use of freed memory due to incorrect memory management in Ruffle](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_use_of_freed_memory_due_to_incorrect_memory_management_in_ruffle.md)

This highlights that the root cause is a flaw in Ruffle's memory management logic.
