# Threat Model Analysis for ruffle-rs/ruffle

## Threat: [Malicious SWF exploiting ActionScript vulnerability](./threats/malicious_swf_exploiting_actionscript_vulnerability.md)

- **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious SWF file that leverages a known or zero-day vulnerability in the ActionScript runtime environment that Ruffle aims to emulate. Upon loading this SWF in Ruffle, the attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code within the Ruffle sandbox. They might attempt to read local storage within the sandbox, make unauthorized network requests (if allowed by Ruffle's configuration or browser policies), or cause a denial of service.
- **Impact:**  Potential for limited remote code execution within the Ruffle sandbox, unauthorized access to sandbox resources, or denial of service affecting the Ruffle instance.
- **Affected Component:** ActionScript 3 Virtual Machine (AVM2) emulation within Ruffle.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Regularly update Ruffle to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
    - Sanitize or validate any user-uploaded SWF files before allowing Ruffle to process them.
    - Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the resources Ruffle can access.
    - Monitor Ruffle for unexpected behavior or resource consumption.

## Threat: [Ruffle emulation bug leading to security bypass](./threats/ruffle_emulation_bug_leading_to_security_bypass.md)

- **Description:**  A flaw in Ruffle's emulation of specific Flash Player functionality could be exploited by a carefully crafted SWF to bypass intended security restrictions. For example, a bug in how Ruffle handles cross-domain policies or local storage access could be leveraged to access resources that should be restricted.
- **Impact:** Potential for unauthorized access to resources or data within the Ruffle sandbox or the browser environment, depending on the nature of the bypass.
- **Affected Component:** Various emulation modules within Ruffle, depending on the specific functionality being bypassed (e.g., `flash.net` package emulation).
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Stay informed about reported Ruffle issues and updates.
    - If possible, avoid relying on specific Flash features known to have emulation inconsistencies.
    - Implement robust server-side security measures to mitigate potential data breaches even if a bypass occurs.
