# Project Design Document: Ruffle - Flash Player Emulator

**Document Version:** 1.1
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Prepared By:** Gemini (AI Language Model)

## 1. Introduction

This document provides an enhanced and detailed design overview of the Ruffle project, an open-source Flash Player emulator implemented in the Rust programming language. This document is specifically crafted to serve as a robust foundation for subsequent threat modeling activities. It meticulously outlines the key components, their interactions, and the comprehensive architecture of the system.

## 2. Project Overview

Ruffle's primary objective is to deliver a secure and contemporary method for experiencing legacy Flash content (SWF files) without relying on the now-deprecated and potentially vulnerable Adobe Flash Player. It achieves this by faithfully recreating the functionality of the ActionScript 1.0/2.0 virtual machines and offering partial support for the ActionScript 3.0 virtual machine, alongside a complete rendering pipeline. Ruffle is designed for broad applicability, targeting both execution within web browsers (as a WebAssembly module) and as a standalone application on various desktop operating systems.

## 3. Goals

*   **Accurate Emulation:** To faithfully reproduce the behavior of Flash content as intended by its creators.
*   **Security and Safety:** To provide a secure alternative to the original Adobe Flash Player, mitigating known vulnerabilities.
*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** To function seamlessly across major web browsers and desktop operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).
*   **Maintainable Codebase:** To adhere to principles of clean code, ensuring ease of understanding, modification, and contribution.
*   **Performance and Efficiency:** To execute Flash content with acceptable performance and minimal resource consumption.

## 4. Target Audience

This document is primarily intended for:

*   Security engineers tasked with performing comprehensive threat modeling of the Ruffle project.
*   Software developers actively contributing to the development and maintenance of Ruffle.
*   Individuals seeking an in-depth understanding of Ruffle's internal structure and operational mechanisms.

## 5. System Architecture

Ruffle's architecture is modular and can be conceptually divided into the following core components:

*   **Core Emulation Engine (Rust):** The central component responsible for the fundamental tasks of SWF parsing, ActionScript interpretation, and display list management.
*   **WebAssembly (WASM) Module:** A pre-compiled binary representation of the core engine, specifically designed for secure and efficient execution within web browsers.
*   **Browser Extension (JavaScript):** A browser-specific component that facilitates the seamless integration and execution of the WASM module within the context of a web page.
*   **Desktop Application (Rust with UI):** A standalone application providing a dedicated environment for executing SWF files outside of a web browser. This includes platform-specific user interface elements.
*   **Renderer (Rust with Platform APIs):** The component responsible for translating the display list into visual output, utilizing platform-specific graphics APIs.
*   **Input Handling (Platform-Specific):** Manages and interprets user interactions from various input devices, adapting to the specific environment.
*   **Networking (Conditional):** Handles network requests initiated by Flash content, subject to security restrictions and configurations.
*   **Configuration and Settings:** Provides mechanisms for users to customize Ruffle's behavior and preferences.

## 6. Detailed Design

### 6.1. Core Emulation Engine

*   **SWF Parser:**
    *   Functionality:  Decodes the binary structure of SWF files, interpreting headers, tags, and embedded data.
    *   Responsibilities: Handles various SWF versions, compression algorithms (e.g., Zlib), and data structures.
*   **ActionScript Virtual Machine (AVM1/AVM2):**
    *   Functionality: Executes the ActionScript bytecode embedded within SWF files.
    *   Responsibilities: Manages the runtime environment, including variable scope, function calls, object instantiation, and event handling for both ActionScript 1.0/2.0 and (partially) ActionScript 3.0.
*   **Display List Manager:**
    *   Functionality:  Maintains a hierarchical representation of all visual objects within the Flash movie.
    *   Responsibilities: Manages the creation, manipulation (e.g., transformations, visibility), and rendering order of display objects.
*   **Resource Manager:**
    *   Functionality: Loads and manages external assets referenced by the SWF, such as images (bitmaps, JPEGs, PNGs), audio (MP3, ADPCM), and fonts.
    *   Responsibilities: Caching, decoding, and providing access to these resources.
*   **Security Sandbox:**
    *   Functionality: Enforces security boundaries to prevent malicious SWFs from compromising the user's system.
    *   Responsibilities: Restricts access to the local file system, limits network capabilities, and enforces cross-domain policies based on the SWF's origin.

### 6.2. WebAssembly Module

*   **Compilation Target:** The core emulation engine is compiled into WebAssembly bytecode using tools like `wasm-pack`.
*   **Browser Execution:**  Provides a secure and portable environment for running the core logic within web browsers.
*   **JavaScript Interoperability:**  Communicates with the browser environment and the browser extension via JavaScript APIs for tasks like rendering and input handling.

### 6.3. Browser Extension

*   **Technology:** Primarily implemented using JavaScript and browser extension APIs.
*   **Flash Content Detection:** Identifies instances of Flash content (e.g., `<embed>` or `<object>` tags) on loaded web pages.
*   **WASM Module Loading and Initialization:**  Downloads and instantiates the WebAssembly module.
*   **Communication Bridge:** Establishes a communication channel between the web page's JavaScript and the WASM module, facilitating the exchange of data and commands.
*   **Input and Output Redirection:**  Captures user input events from the webpage and forwards them to the WASM module; receives rendering commands from the WASM module and updates the webpage's display.
*   **Configuration Management:**  Provides access to and manages user-configurable settings for Ruffle.

### 6.4. Desktop Application

*   **Technology:** Built using Rust, potentially leveraging UI frameworks like `winit` for window management and `egui` or platform-native APIs for the user interface.
*   **Standalone Execution:** Offers a dedicated environment for running SWF files independently of a web browser.
*   **File Handling:**  Provides mechanisms for users to open and manage SWF files from their local file system.
*   **User Interface:** Implements controls for playback (play, pause, stop), settings adjustments, and potentially debugging features.
*   **Direct Core Integration:** Integrates the core emulation engine directly into the application process.

### 6.5. Renderer

*   **Functionality:**  Responsible for the visual representation of the Flash content.
*   **Platform Abstraction:**  Abstracts away the specifics of the underlying graphics APIs.
*   **Web Browser Implementation:** Typically utilizes WebGL for hardware-accelerated rendering within browsers.
*   **Desktop Implementation:** May use OpenGL or DirectX, depending on the target platform and configuration.
*   **Rendering Primitives:** Handles the drawing of vector graphics, bitmap images, text, and other visual elements defined in the display list.
*   **Visual Effects:** Implements blend modes, filters, and other visual effects as specified by the Flash content.

### 6.6. Input Handling

*   **Platform-Specific Implementation:**  Input handling logic is tailored to the specific environment (web browser or desktop).
*   **Event Capture:** Captures user input events such as keyboard presses, mouse movements, and clicks.
*   **Event Translation:** Translates raw input events into a standardized format that can be understood by the core emulation engine.
*   **Focus Management:**  Manages input focus within the emulated Flash content.

### 6.7. Networking

*   **Conditional Inclusion:**  Networking support is only enabled when the loaded SWF file attempts to initiate network requests.
*   **Security Restrictions:** Implements security measures to prevent malicious network activity, such as restricting cross-origin requests and potentially blocking certain types of requests.
*   **API Emulation:** Emulates Flash's networking APIs (e.g., `LoadVars`, `XML`) to handle requests made by the SWF.

### 6.8. Configuration and Settings

*   **User Customization:** Allows users to modify Ruffle's behavior according to their preferences.
*   **Setting Examples:** May include options for rendering quality, input mapping, security settings (e.g., enabling/disabling network access), and debugging features.
*   **Storage Mechanisms:** Settings are typically stored locally, such as in the browser's local storage or in configuration files on the desktop.

```

**Data Flow Description:**

*   **Web Browser:**
    *   A user accesses a **Web Page** potentially containing Flash content.
    *   The **Browser Extension (JS)** detects the presence of Flash content and receives the **SWF URL** and **Page Context**.
    *   The **Browser Extension** loads and initializes the **WASM Module**, passing the SWF URL.
    *   The **WASM Module** fetches the **SWF Data** and sends **Commands** to the **Core Emulation Engine (Rust)**.
    *   The **Core Emulation Engine** processes the SWF and sends **Rendering Commands** to the **Renderer (WebGL)**.
    *   The **Renderer** generates **Visual Output** on the **Canvas Element**.
    *   **User Input Events** are captured by the browser and relayed to the **Browser Extension**.
    *   The **Browser Extension** forwards input to the **WASM Module**.
    *   The **WASM Module** communicates with the **Core Emulation Engine** via **ActionScript Calls** and **Data**.
    *   The **Core Emulation Engine** may request **Resource Requests** from the **Browser Extension**.
    *   The **Browser Extension** provides the requested **Resource Data** back to the **WASM Module**.
*   **Desktop:**
    *   The user interacts with the **Desktop Application UI (Rust)** to open an **SWF File**.
    *   The **Desktop Application UI** passes the SWF file to the **Core Emulation Engine (Rust)**.
    *   The **Core Emulation Engine** processes the SWF and sends **Rendering Commands** to the **Renderer (OpenGL/DirectX)**.
    *   The **Renderer** generates **Visual Output** in the **Display Window**.
    *   **User Input Events** are captured by the **Desktop Application UI** and passed to the **Core Emulation Engine**.
    *   The **Core Emulation Engine** may issue **Resource Requests** to the **Desktop Application UI**.
    *   The **Desktop Application UI** provides the necessary **Resource Data** back to the **Core Emulation Engine**.

## 8. Security Considerations (Pre-Threat Modeling)

*   **SWF File Parsing Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Risk: Maliciously crafted SWF files could exploit parsing vulnerabilities to cause crashes, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution within the Ruffle process.
    *   Examples: Buffer overflows due to oversized data fields, integer overflows when calculating sizes, or incorrect handling of malformed tags.
*   **ActionScript Virtual Machine Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Risk: Bugs in the AVM1/AVM2 implementation could allow attackers to bypass security restrictions, manipulate program flow, or execute arbitrary code within the emulated environment.
    *   Examples: Type confusion errors, incorrect handling of object properties, or vulnerabilities in built-in ActionScript functions.
*   **WebAssembly Security Considerations:**
    *   Risk: While WASM provides a sandboxed environment, vulnerabilities could arise in the WASM runtime itself or in the JavaScript APIs used for communication.
    *   Examples:  Bypassing WASM sandbox restrictions, exploiting vulnerabilities in JavaScript glue code, or issues with memory management within the WASM module.
*   **Browser Extension Security Risks:**
    *   Risk: The browser extension has elevated privileges within the browser and could be targeted for attacks.
    *   Examples: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if the extension doesn't properly sanitize input, insecure communication with the WASM module, or vulnerabilities allowing malicious websites to control the extension.
*   **Desktop Application Security Risks:**
    *   Risk: Vulnerabilities in the desktop application could allow attackers to gain access to the user's system.
    *   Examples: Buffer overflows in native code, insecure handling of file paths, or vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
*   **Renderer Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Risk: Bugs in the rendering logic could potentially be exploited to cause crashes or, in some cases, lead to more serious vulnerabilities.
    *   Examples: Issues with handling specific graphics primitives, vulnerabilities in shader compilation or execution, or resource exhaustion.
*   **Networking Security Concerns:**
    *   Risk: Improper handling of network requests from SWFs could lead to security issues.
    *   Examples: Cross-site scripting (XSS) if responses are not properly sanitized, server-side request forgery (SSRF) if the SWF can make arbitrary requests, or exposure of sensitive information.
*   **Cross-Domain Policy Enforcement Weaknesses:**
    *   Risk: Failure to correctly enforce Flash's cross-domain policies could allow malicious SWFs to access data from other domains without authorization.
    *   Examples: Bypassing `crossdomain.xml` restrictions, incorrect handling of policy file requests, or vulnerabilities in the policy enforcement logic.
