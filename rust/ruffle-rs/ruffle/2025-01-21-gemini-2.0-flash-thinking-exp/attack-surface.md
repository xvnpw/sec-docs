# Attack Surface Analysis for ruffle-rs/ruffle

## Attack Surface: [Malformed SWF File Parsing](./attack_surfaces/malformed_swf_file_parsing.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from Ruffle's processing of maliciously crafted or unexpected structures within SWF files.
*   **Ruffle Contribution:** Ruffle must parse complex SWF file formats, increasing the chance of parser bugs.
*   **Example:** A specially crafted SWF file with oversized data in a header field triggers a buffer overflow in Ruffle's memory allocation during parsing, leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, Denial of Service (DoS), memory corruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement strict input validation on SWF files if the application controls SWF loading.
        *   Regularly update Ruffle to the latest version to benefit from parser bug fixes.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Avoid running SWF files from untrusted sources.
        *   Keep Ruffle updated if manually installed or used as a browser extension.

## Attack Surface: [ActionScript Virtual Machine (AVM) Sandbox Escape](./attack_surfaces/actionscript_virtual_machine__avm__sandbox_escape.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in Ruffle's ActionScript VM that allow malicious ActionScript code within a SWF to bypass the intended security sandbox and access resources outside of the Flash environment.
*   **Ruffle Contribution:** Ruffle implements an AVM to execute ActionScript, which is a complex component prone to vulnerabilities, especially during ongoing development.
*   **Example:** Malicious ActionScript code exploits a flaw in Ruffle's AVM to access browser APIs (e.g., `XMLHttpRequest`) that should be restricted within the sandbox, allowing exfiltration of user data.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, unauthorized actions on the user's system, potential for further exploitation of the host environment.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Enforce strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to limit the capabilities of the embedding page and mitigate the impact of sandbox escapes.
        *   Regularly update Ruffle to benefit from AVM security fixes.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Avoid running SWF files from untrusted sources.
        *   Be cautious about granting Ruffle browser extension permissions if applicable.

## Attack Surface: [ActionScript API Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/actionscript_api_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Flaws in Ruffle's implementation of Flash ActionScript APIs that can be exploited by malicious SWF content to perform unintended actions or access sensitive information.
*   **Ruffle Contribution:** Ruffle is actively implementing ActionScript APIs, and vulnerabilities can arise during this process due to incomplete or incorrect implementations.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability in Ruffle's implementation of the `navigateToURL` ActionScript API allows malicious SWF content to redirect the user to a phishing website without proper user confirmation or security checks.
*   **Impact:** Phishing attacks, Cross-site scripting (XSS) in Ruffle context, unauthorized actions within the application.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Carefully review and test interactions between Ruffle and the embedding application, especially when using JavaScript APIs to communicate with Ruffle.
        *   Regularly update Ruffle to benefit from API security fixes.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Exercise caution when interacting with SWF content from unknown sources.
        *   Be aware of unexpected redirects or actions triggered by SWF content.
