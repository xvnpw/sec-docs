# Threat Model Analysis for ruffle-rs/ruffle

## Threat: [Memory Safety Vulnerability](./threats/memory_safety_vulnerability.md)

* **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious SWF file or exploits a weakness in Ruffle's code to trigger a memory safety error (e.g., buffer overflow) within Ruffle. This could allow the attacker to overwrite memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
    * **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), application crash.
    * **Affected Ruffle Component:** Core Ruffle runtime (likely within SWF parser, ActionScript interpreter, or rendering engine).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update Ruffle to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        * Sanitize or validate SWF files before processing them with Ruffle (if feasible, though SWF format complexity makes this difficult).
        * Implement sandboxing or isolation techniques for Ruffle execution to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities (e.g., running Ruffle in a separate process with restricted permissions).
        * Monitor Ruffle's resource usage and error logs for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [SWF Parsing Vulnerability](./threats/swf_parsing_vulnerability.md)

* **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious SWF file with specific structures or malformed data that exploits a flaw in Ruffle's SWF parsing logic. This could lead to crashes, denial of service, or potentially code execution if the parsing vulnerability allows control over program flow.
    * **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE), application crash.
    * **Affected Ruffle Component:** SWF Parser module.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update Ruffle to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        * Implement input validation and sanitization on SWF files before processing (again, difficult due to SWF complexity).
        * Consider using a robust and well-tested SWF parsing library if integrating Ruffle at a lower level.
        * Monitor Ruffle's error logs for parsing errors that might indicate exploitation attempts.

## Threat: [Logic Error in Flash Feature Emulation](./threats/logic_error_in_flash_feature_emulation.md)

* **Description:** Ruffle's emulation of a specific Flash feature (e.g., ActionScript API, display objects, event handling) contains a logic error. An attacker crafts a malicious SWF file that leverages this logic error to achieve unintended behavior, potentially leading to security breaches.
    * **Impact:**  Varies depending on the specific logic error. Could range from information disclosure to privilege escalation or denial of service. Potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE) in worst-case scenarios.
    * **Affected Ruffle Component:** ActionScript interpreter, Flash API emulation modules, specific feature implementation within Ruffle.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update Ruffle to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and improved emulation accuracy.
        * Thoroughly test applications using Ruffle with a variety of SWF content, including potentially malicious or edge-case SWFs, to identify unexpected behavior.
        * Implement security checks and input validation within the application using Ruffle to mitigate potential abuse of Flash features.
        * Limit the Flash features exposed or enabled in Ruffle's configuration if not all features are required.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerability](./threats/dependency_vulnerability.md)

* **Description:** Ruffle relies on external Rust crates. A vulnerability is discovered in one of these dependencies. If Ruffle uses the vulnerable component in a way that is exposed to attacker-controlled input (e.g., through SWF content), it could be exploited.
    * **Impact:**  Varies depending on the dependency vulnerability. Could range from Denial of Service (DoS) to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
    * **Affected Ruffle Component:**  Indirectly affects Ruffle as a whole, but the vulnerability resides in a specific dependency crate.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update Ruffle and its dependencies to the latest versions. Ruffle's build process should include dependency updates.
        * Monitor security advisories for Rust crates used by Ruffle.
        * Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in Ruffle's dependencies.

## Threat: [JavaScript Bridge Exploit](./threats/javascript_bridge_exploit.md)

        * Implement input validation and sanitization for data used in browser API calls.
        * Follow secure coding guidelines for browser API usage.
        * Regularly update Ruffle to benefit from bug fixes and security improvements in browser API interactions.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Ruffle](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_ruffle.md)

* **Description:** A vulnerability in Ruffle allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the application through a crafted SWF file. This could occur if Ruffle incorrectly handles or renders user-controlled data from the SWF content in a way that allows script execution in the browser context.
    * **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), leading to session hijacking, defacement, information theft, and other XSS-related attacks.
    * **Affected Ruffle Component:** Rendering engine, text rendering, potentially ActionScript interpreter if it can manipulate rendered content.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update Ruffle to the latest version to benefit from XSS vulnerability fixes.
        * Implement robust output encoding and sanitization for any data rendered by Ruffle that originates from SWF content and could be reflected in the HTML page.
        * Use Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of potential XSS vulnerabilities by restricting the capabilities of JavaScript and other resources.

## Threat: [Same-Origin Policy Bypass (Potential)](./threats/same-origin_policy_bypass__potential_.md)

* **Description:** In the event of a critical vulnerability in Ruffle, particularly in its browser integration or JavaScript bridge, it could theoretically be leveraged to bypass the browser's Same-Origin Policy. This would allow malicious SWF content to access resources from different origins without authorization.
    * **Impact:**  Full compromise of web application security, unauthorized access to sensitive data, cross-site data theft, and other severe security breaches.
    * **Affected Ruffle Component:** JavaScript bridge, browser integration modules, core security mechanisms within Ruffle.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update Ruffle to the latest version to benefit from critical security fixes.
        * Implement strong input validation and sanitization for all data processed by Ruffle.
        * Employ robust security testing and code reviews of Ruffle's browser integration and JavaScript bridge components.
        * Isolate Ruffle execution as much as possible to limit the potential impact of a Same-Origin Policy bypass vulnerability.
        * Use Subresource Integrity (SRI) to ensure the integrity of Ruffle files loaded by the application.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Emulated Flash Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_emulated_flash_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Malicious SWF files are designed to exploit known vulnerabilities in the original Adobe Flash Player. Ruffle, in its effort to achieve compatibility, might accurately emulate the vulnerable behavior, even if Ruffle itself doesn't have the *original* Flash Player vulnerabilities in its own code.
    * **Impact:** Varies depending on the specific Flash vulnerability being emulated. Could range from Denial of Service (DoS) to Remote Code Execution (RCE), similar to the original Flash Player vulnerabilities.
    * **Affected Ruffle Component:** ActionScript interpreter, Flash API emulation modules, specific feature implementations that mimic vulnerable Flash behavior.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update Ruffle to the latest version. Ruffle developers may choose to patch or mitigate known *exploitable* Flash behaviors over time, even if aiming for compatibility.
        * Consider disabling or limiting the emulation of particularly risky or vulnerable Flash features if full compatibility is not strictly required.
        * Sanitize or validate SWF files (if feasible) to detect and block potentially malicious SWFs that target known Flash vulnerabilities.
        * Implement sandboxing or isolation techniques for Ruffle execution to limit the impact of potential exploits.

## Threat: [Abuse of Flash Features (Intended Functionality)](./threats/abuse_of_flash_features__intended_functionality_.md)

* **Description:** Even if Ruffle itself is secure, malicious SWF content could abuse *intended* Flash features (if enabled in Ruffle and accessible in the application's configuration) for malicious purposes. Examples include attempting to access local files (if local file access is enabled), making unauthorized network requests, or abusing Flash's capabilities for user tracking or data exfiltration.
    * **Impact:** Information disclosure, unauthorized data access, privacy violations, potentially other security breaches depending on the abused feature.
    * **Affected Ruffle Component:** Flash API emulation modules, features related to file access, networking, and other Flash capabilities.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Carefully configure Ruffle and disable or restrict Flash features that are not strictly necessary and could be abused.
        * Implement strict content security policies and permissions for SWF content executed by Ruffle.
        * Sanitize or validate SWF files (if feasible) to detect and block potentially malicious SWFs that abuse Flash features.
        * Clearly communicate to users the potential risks associated with running SWF content and the limitations of security measures.

## Threat: [Using Outdated Ruffle Versions](./threats/using_outdated_ruffle_versions.md)
