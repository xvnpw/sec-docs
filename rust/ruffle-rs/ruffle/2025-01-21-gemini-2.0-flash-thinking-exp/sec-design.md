### 2. System Architecture

Ruffle employs a modular architecture that separates the core emulation logic from platform-specific front-ends. This design promotes code reusability and cross-platform compatibility. The core emulation engine, written in Rust, is compiled to WebAssembly (WASM) for web browser environments and linked directly into native applications for desktop platforms.

*   **Components:**
    *   **"Browser Extension"**:  A browser-specific extension (available for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and potentially others) acting as the entry point for Ruffle in web browsers. It detects Flash content on web pages and orchestrates its replacement with the Ruffle player.
    *   **"JavaScript Interop Layer"**: JavaScript code residing within the browser extension. This layer facilitates communication between the browser environment and the WASM core. It manages WASM module loading, data exchange, event handling, and rendering context setup.
    *   **"WASM Core (Rust)"**: The heart of Ruffle for web-based usage. It's the core emulation engine, written in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly. It encompasses SWF parsing, ActionScript virtual machines, rendering logic, and browser-specific interfaces.
    *   **"Desktop Application"**: A standalone application providing a native user interface for playing SWF files outside of a web browser. It directly embeds the "Rust Core".
    *   **"Native UI Framework"**: Platform-dependent UI components used by the desktop application. These handle window management, user input, file selection, and application lifecycle events. Examples include GTK, Qt, or platform-native APIs.
    *   **"Rust Core"**: The foundational emulation engine written in Rust. Shared by both the WASM core and the desktop application, it contains core functionalities like SWF loading, ActionScript VMs, rendering pipelines, and abstract interfaces for storage and networking.
    *   **"SWF Loader & Parser"**: Responsible for reading and interpreting SWF files. It decodes the SWF file format, extracts bytecode instructions, embedded assets (images, sounds, fonts), and metadata necessary for emulation.
    *   **"ActionScript VM (AVM1/2)"**:  Virtual machines dedicated to executing ActionScript 1 and 2 bytecode. These VMs interpret the instruction sets of older ActionScript versions, managing runtime environments, object models, and API implementations.
    *   **"ActionScript VM (AVM2)"**: Virtual machine designed to execute ActionScript 3 bytecode. This VM handles the more complex and modern ActionScript 3 language, including its advanced object model, event system, and features.
    *   **"Renderer (WebGL/Canvas2D)"**:  The rendering engine responsible for translating graphical commands from the ActionScript VMs into visual output. It utilizes WebGL for hardware-accelerated rendering and Canvas2D as a software-based fallback, ensuring broad compatibility across different hardware and browser capabilities.
    *   **"Output Display (Canvas/Window)"**: The visual surface where rendered Flash content is presented. In browsers, this is typically a `<canvas>` element. In the desktop application, it's the application window.
    *   **"Storage Interface (Browser Storage API)"**: In the browser environment, this interface provides access to browser-provided storage mechanisms like LocalStorage, IndexedDB, or cookies, allowing Flash content to persist data.
    *   **"Network Interface (Browser Fetch API)"**:  In the browser environment, this interface leverages browser APIs like the Fetch API to handle network requests initiated by Flash content, respecting browser security policies and CORS restrictions.
    *   **"Storage Interface (File System)"**: In the desktop application, this interface provides access to the local file system, enabling Flash content to read and write files, subject to application permissions and security considerations.
    *   **"Network Interface (OS Sockets)"**: In the desktop application, this interface utilizes operating system-level socket APIs to handle network communication initiated by Flash content, allowing for more direct network access compared to the browser environment.

    subgraph "Data Flow Steps"
        B -- "1. Detects Flash Content (SWF URL in HTML)" --> C;
        C -- "2. Initiates WASM Core Load & SWF URL Transfer" --> D;

        G -- "6. Renders Pixel Data to Canvas" --> H;
        H -- "7. Displays Flash Content to User" --> A;
    end
```

*   **Data Flow Steps (Detailed):**
    1.  **"Detects Flash Content (SWF URL in HTML)"**: The "Browser Extension (Ruffle)" actively scans the HTML Document Object Model (DOM) of web pages, looking for HTML elements that typically embed Flash content, such as `<embed>`, `<object>`, or `<a>` tags with links to `.swf` files. Upon detection, it extracts the URL pointing to the SWF file.
    2.  **"Initiates WASM Core Load & SWF URL Transfer"**: The "Browser Extension" communicates with the "JavaScript Interop" layer. If the "WASM Core (Rust)" is not already loaded and initialized, the extension instructs the interop layer to load and initialize it. Subsequently, the SWF file URL is passed from the extension to the "WASM Core" via the interop layer.
    3.  **"Fetches SWF File Data (Network Request)"**: The "WASM Core", upon receiving the SWF URL, utilizes the "Network Interface (Browser Fetch API)" to initiate a network request (typically an HTTP GET request) to fetch the SWF file data from the specified URL. The browser's network stack handles the actual network communication.
    4.  **"Parses SWF Data (Bytecode, Assets)"**: Once the SWF file data is downloaded, it is passed to the "SWF Loader & Parser" component within the "WASM Core". This component parses the binary SWF file format, extracting critical information such as ActionScript bytecode, embedded assets (images, sounds, fonts, etc.), metadata, and frame data.
    5.  **"Generates Rendering Commands (Graphics API Calls)"**: The parsed SWF data is then processed by the "ActionScript VM (AVM)" (either AVM1/2 or AVM2 depending on the SWF version). The VM executes the ActionScript bytecode, interpreting instructions and managing the Flash application's logic. During execution, the VM generates rendering commands, which are essentially instructions for drawing graphics (e.g., draw a sprite, fill a shape, set color). These commands are directed towards the "Renderer (WebGL/Canvas2D)".
    6.  **"Renders Pixel Data to Canvas"**: The "Renderer (WebGL/Canvas2D)" receives the rendering commands from the "ActionScript VM". It translates these abstract commands into concrete pixel data using either WebGL (for hardware-accelerated rendering) or Canvas2D (for software rendering). The renderer manipulates the rendering context of the "Display Canvas (<canvas>)" element, writing pixel data to it.
    7.  **"Displays Flash Content to User"**: The "Display Canvas (<canvas>)" element, now containing the rendered pixel data representing the Flash content, is displayed within the "User Web Browser". The browser handles the final display and compositing of the canvas within the webpage, making the Flash content visually accessible to the user.

Throughout this process, the "ActionScript VM" may also interact with the "Storage Interface (Browser Storage API)" and "Network Interface (Browser Fetch API)" to perform storage operations (e.g., saving game progress using LSOs) or initiate further network requests as dictated by the Flash content's ActionScript code.

### 5. Security Considerations (Detailed and Expanded)

*   **ActionScript VM Vulnerabilities (Expanded):**
    *   **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation Bugs (AVM2):** If JIT compilation is employed in AVM2 for performance optimization, bugs in the JIT compiler could introduce exploitable vulnerabilities, leading to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Type Confusion & Memory Corruption:**  ActionScript's dynamic typing and complex object model can create opportunities for type confusion vulnerabilities. Improper type handling in the VM could lead to memory corruption, use-after-free, or other memory safety issues.
    *   **API Implementation Flaws:**  Bugs in the implementation of Flash APIs (especially complex or security-sensitive APIs) could be exploited to bypass security checks, gain unauthorized access, or cause unexpected behavior.
    *   **Integer Overflows & Arithmetic Errors:**  Integer overflows or other arithmetic errors in ActionScript operations or API implementations could lead to unexpected behavior, buffer overflows, or other vulnerabilities.
    *   **Sandbox Escape Mechanisms:**  Attackers may attempt to find vulnerabilities that allow them to escape the ActionScript sandbox and gain access to host system resources or browser functionalities beyond the intended restrictions.

*   **SWF Loader Vulnerabilities (Expanded):**
    *   **Parsing Complexity Exploits:** The SWF file format's complexity and historical evolution make it prone to parsing vulnerabilities. Attackers may craft malformed SWF files to exploit parsing bugs.
    *   **Buffer Overflows in Parsing:**  Improper bounds checking during SWF parsing could lead to buffer overflows when processing oversized or specially crafted data fields within the SWF file.
    *   **Format String Bugs:**  If format string vulnerabilities exist in the SWF loader (less likely in Rust, but still a consideration), they could be exploited to leak memory or potentially execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion during Parsing:**  Malicious SWF files could be designed to trigger excessive resource consumption (CPU, memory) during parsing, leading to denial-of-service.
    *   **Decompression Vulnerabilities:** SWF files can be compressed using various algorithms (e.g., Zlib). Vulnerabilities in decompression libraries or their integration could be exploited.

*   **Browser Extension Security (Expanded):**
    *   **Content Script Injection Vulnerabilities:**  If the browser extension's content scripts are not carefully written, they could be vulnerable to injection attacks, allowing malicious websites to inject code into the extension's context.
    *   **Message Handling Vulnerabilities:**  Improper handling of messages between the extension's background script and content scripts could create vulnerabilities if messages are not validated or sanitized.
    *   **Storage of Sensitive Data in Extension Storage:**  Storing sensitive user data (e.g., API keys, user credentials) in browser extension storage (LocalStorage, etc.) without proper encryption could lead to data leakage if the extension is compromised.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Extension UI:**  If the extension has a user interface (popup, options page), vulnerabilities in the UI code could lead to XSS attacks if user input or data from untrusted sources is not properly sanitized.
    *   **Permissions Creep:**  Over time, extensions may request additional permissions. Regularly review and minimize the permissions requested by the Ruffle browser extension to reduce the attack surface.

*   **WASM Core Security (Expanded):**
    *   **Logic Errors in Rust Code:**  While Rust provides memory safety, logic errors and algorithmic vulnerabilities can still exist in the Rust code of the WASM core. Thorough code reviews and testing are crucial.
    *   **Unsafe Rust Code:**  Use of `unsafe` Rust blocks bypasses Rust's memory safety guarantees. `unsafe` code must be carefully audited and minimized to prevent memory safety vulnerabilities.
    *   **Dependencies Security:**  Third-party Rust crates (dependencies) used by the WASM core could contain vulnerabilities. Regularly audit and update dependencies to address known security issues.
    *   **Build Chain Security:**  Ensure the security of the build chain used to compile Rust code to WASM. Compromised build tools could inject malicious code into the WASM module.
    *   **Side-Channel Attacks:**  Consider potential side-channel attacks (e.g., timing attacks, cache attacks) if sensitive data or cryptographic operations are performed within the WASM core.

*   **Interaction with Browser Security Model (Expanded):**
    *   **CORS Bypass Attempts:**  Malicious Flash content might attempt to bypass Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) restrictions to access resources from other origins without proper authorization. Ruffle must strictly enforce CORS.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP) Evasion:**  Ensure Ruffle does not inadvertently weaken or bypass Content Security Policy (CSP) directives set by websites. Ruffle should respect and integrate with CSP.
    *   **Permissions API Misuse:**  If Ruffle utilizes browser permissions APIs (e.g., Geolocation, Notifications), ensure these APIs are used securely and do not grant excessive privileges to Flash content.
    *   **Subframe Security:**  When embedding Ruffle in iframes, consider the security implications of iframe sandboxing and cross-document communication.
    *   **Navigation & URL Handling Security:**  Securely handle navigation requests and URL manipulations initiated by Flash content to prevent open redirects or other URL-based vulnerabilities.

*   **Resource Management (Expanded):**
    *   **CPU Exhaustion:**  Malicious SWF files could contain computationally intensive ActionScript code designed to consume excessive CPU resources, leading to browser or application slowdown or crashes. Implement CPU usage limits or throttling mechanisms.
    *   **Memory Exhaustion:**  SWF files could attempt to allocate large amounts of memory, leading to memory exhaustion and crashes. Implement memory limits and garbage collection mechanisms.
    *   **Network Bandwidth Exhaustion:**  Malicious content could initiate excessive network requests, consuming network bandwidth and potentially causing denial-of-service. Implement network request limits and rate limiting.
    *   **Graphics Resource Exhaustion:**  SWF files could generate a large number of rendering commands or load massive textures, exhausting graphics resources and causing rendering slowdowns or crashes. Implement limits on rendering complexity and texture sizes.
    *   **Infinite Loops & Script Hangs:**  ActionScript code could contain infinite loops or other logic that causes scripts to hang indefinitely, freezing the browser or application. Implement script execution timeouts and watchdog mechanisms.

*   **Data Handling and Privacy (Expanded):**
    *   **Data Minimization:**  Minimize the collection and storage of user data by Ruffle. Only collect data that is strictly necessary for functionality and security.
    *   **Data Privacy Compliance:**  Comply with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) regarding the collection, storage, and processing of user data.
    *   **Secure Data Storage:**  If user data or sensitive Flash content data is stored, ensure it is stored securely using encryption and access controls.
    *   **Transparency & User Control:**  Be transparent with users about what data Ruffle collects and how it is used. Provide users with control over their data and privacy settings.
    *   **Third-Party Data Sharing:**  Avoid sharing user data with third parties unless absolutely necessary and with user consent.

*   **Update Mechanism (Expanded):**
    *   **Secure Update Channel:**  Use a secure update channel (e.g., HTTPS) to distribute updates for the browser extension and desktop application. Prevent man-in-the-middle attacks during updates.
    *   **Code Signing & Verification:**  Sign code updates cryptographically to ensure authenticity and integrity. Verify signatures before applying updates to prevent malicious updates.
    *   **Automatic Updates (with User Control):**  Implement automatic updates to ensure users are running the latest version with security patches. Provide users with options to control update behavior (e.g., disable automatic updates, choose update schedule).
    *   **Rollback Mechanism:**  In case of problematic updates, provide a mechanism to rollback to a previous version.
    *   **Update Notifications & Changelogs:**  Notify users about updates and provide changelogs detailing security fixes and new features.
