- **Attack Surface:** SQL Injection via Raw SQL or Unsafe Operations
    - **Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into database queries, potentially allowing them to read, modify, or delete data, bypass authentication, or execute arbitrary commands on the database server.
    - **How Diesel Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Diesel provides mechanisms for executing raw SQL queries (e.g., `sql_literal!`) and allows for dynamic query construction. If developers use these features without proper input sanitization, they create a direct pathway for SQL injection attacks. Diesel's type safety is bypassed in these scenarios.
    - **Example:** Using `sql_literal!` with unsanitized user input:
        ```rust
        let untrusted_username = // ... user input ...
        let query = diesel::sql_query(format!("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '{}';", untrusted_username));
        ```
    - **Impact:** Complete compromise of the database, including data breaches, data manipulation, and potential denial of service.
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - **Avoid `sql_literal!` and raw SQL whenever possible.** Prefer Diesel's query builder for type safety and automatic escaping.
        - **If raw SQL is absolutely necessary, use parameterized queries or prepared statements.** Diesel supports these mechanisms even within raw SQL contexts.
        - **Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user-provided input** before incorporating it into any SQL query, even when using Diesel's query builder.
