## Attack Tree Path: [Channel Flooding (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/channel_flooding__dos_.md)

- **Attack Vector:** An attacker sends an excessive number of messages to a Crossbeam channel without regard for the receiver's capacity to process them.
- **Impact:** This overwhelms the receiving thread(s), leading to resource exhaustion (CPU, memory) and ultimately causing a denial of service. The application becomes unresponsive or crashes.
- **Conditions:** This is possible if the application uses unbounded channels or lacks proper backpressure mechanisms to limit the rate of incoming messages.

## Attack Tree Path: [Queue Overflow (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/queue_overflow__dos_.md)

- **Attack Vector:** Similar to channel flooding, an attacker rapidly enqueues items into a bounded Crossbeam queue, exceeding its capacity.
- **Impact:** This leads to resource exhaustion, potentially causing the application to panic or become unresponsive as it struggles to manage the overflowing queue.
- **Conditions:** This is possible if the application uses bounded queues without checking for fullness before enqueuing or if the queue's capacity is insufficient for the expected workload.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Corruption via Concurrent Access to Enqueued Data](./attack_tree_paths/data_corruption_via_concurrent_access_to_enqueued_data.md)

- **Attack Vector:** Even though Crossbeam queues provide thread-safe access to the queue structure itself, if consumers directly manipulate the data *obtained* from the queue without further synchronization, race conditions can occur.
- **Impact:** This leads to data corruption and potentially incorrect application behavior based on the corrupted data.
- **Conditions:** This occurs when developers assume that data retrieved from a queue is automatically safe to manipulate concurrently without additional protection.

## Attack Tree Path: [Race Conditions Leading to Incorrect State (Atomics)](./attack_tree_paths/race_conditions_leading_to_incorrect_state__atomics_.md)

- **Attack Vector:** While Crossbeam atomics provide atomic operations, incorrect usage or complex sequences of atomic operations can still lead to race conditions where the final state of the atomic variable is not the intended one.
- **Impact:** This can lead to subtle bugs and incorrect application logic based on the flawed atomic state.
- **Conditions:** This requires a good understanding of atomic operations and potential interleaving scenarios.

## Attack Tree Path: [Deadlocks (Abuse of Synchronization Primitives)](./attack_tree_paths/deadlocks__abuse_of_synchronization_primitives_.md)

- **Attack Vector:** An attacker manipulates thread execution to create a circular dependency where two or more threads are blocked indefinitely, each waiting for a resource held by the other. This can involve locks (mutexes), barriers, or other synchronization primitives.
- **Impact:** The affected threads become permanently blocked, halting progress and potentially causing a complete application freeze or denial of service.
- **Conditions:** This occurs when lock acquisition order is inconsistent across threads or when barrier wait conditions are not met due to malicious manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Resource Starvation via Semaphore Misuse](./attack_tree_paths/resource_starvation_via_semaphore_misuse.md)

- **Attack Vector:** An attacker gains control of threads and acquires semaphores (limiting access to shared resources) without releasing them.
- **Impact:** Other threads requiring those resources are indefinitely blocked, leading to a denial of service or significant performance degradation.
- **Conditions:** This is possible if there are vulnerabilities allowing control over thread execution or if error handling doesn't properly release semaphores.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Corruption via Unsafe Send/Receive (If applicable with custom types)](./attack_tree_paths/data_corruption_via_unsafe_sendreceive__if_applicable_with_custom_types_.md)

- **Attack Vector:** If the application uses `unsafe` code blocks when sending or receiving data through Crossbeam channels (e.g., for performance reasons), vulnerabilities in this unsafe code can lead to memory corruption or other unsafe behavior.
- **Impact:** This can have critical consequences, including data corruption, crashes, and potential security breaches.
- **Conditions:** This relies on the presence of `unsafe` code and vulnerabilities within it.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Races due to Missing Synchronization](./attack_tree_paths/data_races_due_to_missing_synchronization.md)

- **Attack Vector:** Multiple threads access and modify shared mutable data concurrently without using appropriate Crossbeam synchronization primitives (like mutexes, atomics, or channels for communication).
- **Impact:** This leads to unpredictable and potentially erroneous program behavior, including data corruption, inconsistent state, and crashes.
- **Conditions:** This is a common programming error in concurrent applications, especially when developers fail to properly protect shared mutable state.

## Attack Tree Path: [Deadlocks due to Improper Lock Ordering](./attack_tree_paths/deadlocks_due_to_improper_lock_ordering.md)

- **Attack Vector:** Similar to the previous deadlock scenario, but specifically focuses on inconsistent ordering when acquiring multiple locks. If threads acquire the same set of locks in different orders, a circular wait condition can arise.
- **Impact:** Results in a complete application freeze or denial of service.
- **Conditions:** This is a classic concurrency problem that arises from inconsistent locking strategies.
