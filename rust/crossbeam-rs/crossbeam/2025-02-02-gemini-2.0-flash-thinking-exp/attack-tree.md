# Attack Tree Analysis for crossbeam-rs/crossbeam

Objective: Compromise Application via Crossbeam Exploitation

## Attack Tree Visualization

*   **Exploit Concurrency Bugs Introduced by Crossbeam Usage** [HIGH RISK PATH]
    *   **Data Races/Race Conditions** [HIGH RISK PATH]
        *   AND
            *   Identify shared mutable state accessed by Crossbeam primitives (channels, scopes, atomics, queues)
            *   Trigger concurrent access to shared state in a vulnerable order
                *   Example: Send/Receive on unbounded channel leading to unexpected state changes
                *   Example: Incorrect atomic operation sequence leading to logical errors
    *   **Deadlocks/Livelocks** [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]
        *   AND
            *   Identify potential deadlock scenarios in Crossbeam usage (e.g., channel dependencies, mutex locking order)
            *   Trigger deadlock condition by manipulating application state or input
                *   Example: Circular channel dependencies in message passing
                *   Example: Incorrect locking order when using Crossbeam's mutexes or channels with internal locking
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (DoS) via Concurrency Features** [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]
        *   AND
            *   Identify Crossbeam features susceptible to resource exhaustion (e.g., unbounded channels, excessive thread creation)
            *   Exploit feature to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, threads)
                *   Example: Flooding an unbounded channel to cause memory exhaustion
                *   Example: Rapidly spawning scoped threads without proper resource limits
    *   **Logic Errors in Concurrent Logic** [HIGH RISK PATH]
        *   AND
            *   Understand the application's concurrent logic implemented with Crossbeam
            *   Manipulate input or application state to trigger unexpected behavior due to flawed concurrent logic
                *   Example: Incorrect message handling order in a channel-based system leading to data corruption
                *   Example: Flawed state management in scoped threads causing inconsistent application behavior
