# Threat Model Analysis for crossbeam-rs/crossbeam

## Threat: [Channel Exhaustion Denial of Service (via Unbounded Channels)](./threats/channel_exhaustion_denial_of_service__via_unbounded_channels_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits the property of `crossbeam::channel::unbounded` channels being unbounded in memory. By flooding the application with messages sent to such a channel, the attacker can cause excessive memory consumption, potentially leading to application slowdown, crashes, or system-wide resource exhaustion. The attacker achieves this by sending a high volume of requests that trigger message sending to the unbounded channel, or by compromising a message producer to send excessive messages.
*   **Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive or crashes due to excessive memory consumption or resource starvation, resulting in unavailability of the service for legitimate users.
*   **Affected Crossbeam Component:** `crossbeam::channel::unbounded` (inherent property of unbounded channels).
*   **Risk Severity:** High (when `unbounded` channels are used to handle external or untrusted input, or in performance-critical paths without proper backpressure).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid using `crossbeam::channel::unbounded` channels when handling external or untrusted input.**
    *   **Prefer `crossbeam::channel::bounded` channels with enforced limits** based on expected load and resource capacity.
    *   Implement backpressure mechanisms to control message producers, even when using bounded channels, to prevent them from filling up too quickly.
    *   Monitor channel usage and resource consumption to detect and respond to potential exhaustion attacks.

## Threat: [Queue Overflow Denial of Service (via Unbounded or Large Queues)](./threats/queue_overflow_denial_of_service__via_unbounded_or_large_queues_.md)

*   **Description:**  Similar to channel exhaustion, an attacker exploits the property of `crossbeam::queue::SegQueue` being unbounded or `crossbeam::queue::ArrayQueue` being used with a very large capacity. By flooding the application with data enqueued into these queues, the attacker can cause excessive memory consumption, leading to application instability, crashes, or system-wide resource exhaustion. This is achieved by overwhelming the application with requests that enqueue data, or by compromising a data producer to enqueue excessively.
*   **Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive or crashes due to excessive memory consumption or resource starvation, resulting in unavailability of the service.
*   **Affected Crossbeam Component:** `crossbeam::queue::SegQueue` (inherently unbounded), `crossbeam::queue::ArrayQueue` (when used with excessively large capacity).
*   **Risk Severity:** High (when unbounded or very large queues are used to handle external or untrusted input, or in performance-critical paths without proper backpressure).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid using `crossbeam::queue::SegQueue` or excessively large `crossbeam::queue::ArrayQueue` when handling external or untrusted input.**
    *   **Prefer `crossbeam::queue::ArrayQueue` with appropriately sized, enforced limits.**
    *   Implement backpressure mechanisms to control data producers, even when using bounded queues, to prevent them from filling up too quickly.
    *   Monitor queue usage and resource consumption to detect and respond to potential overflow attacks.
