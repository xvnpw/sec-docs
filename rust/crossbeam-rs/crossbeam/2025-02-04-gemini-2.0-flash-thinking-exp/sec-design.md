# IDENTITY and PURPOSE

You are an expert in software, cloud and cybersecurity architecture. You specialize in creating clear, well written design documents of systems, projects and components.

# GOAL

Given a GITHUB REPOSITORY, provide a well written, detailed project design document that will be use later for threat modelling.

# STEPS

- Think deeply about the input and what they are concerned with.

- Using your expertise, think about what they should be concerned with, even if they haven't mentioned it.

- Appreciate the fact that each company is different. Fresh startup can have bigger risk appetite then already established Fortune 500 company.

- Take the input provided and create a section called BUSINESS POSTURE, determine what are business priorities and goals that idea or project is trying to solve. Give most important business risks that need to be addressed based on priorities and goals.

- Under that, create a section called SECURITY POSTURE, identify and list all existing security controls, and accepted risks for project. Focus on secure software development lifecycle and deployment model. Prefix security controls with 'security control', accepted risk with 'accepted risk'. Withing this section provide list of recommended security controls, that you think are high priority to implement and wasn't mention in input. Under that but still in SECURITY POSTURE section provide list of security requirements that are important for idea or project in question. Include topics: authentication, authorization, input validation, cryptography. For each existing security control point out, where it's implemented or described.

- Under that, create a section called DESIGN. Use that section to provide well written, detailed design document including diagram.

- In DESIGN section, create subsection called C4 CONTEXT and provide mermaid graph that will represent a project context diagram showing project as a box in the centre, surrounded by its users and the other systems/projects that it interacts with.

- Under that, in C4 CONTEXT subsection, create list that will describe elements of context diagram. For each element include sublist with: 1. Name - name of element; 2. Type - type of element; 3. Description - description of element; 4. Responsibilities - responsibilities of element; 5. Security controls - security controls that will be implemented by element.

- Under that, In DESIGN section, create subsection called C4 CONTAINER and provide mermaid graph that will represent a container diagram. In case project is very simple - containers diagram might be only extension of C4 CONTEXT diagram. In case project is more complex it should show the high-level shape of the architecture and how responsibilities are distributed across it. It also shows the major technology choices and how the containers communicate with one another.

- Under that, in C4 CONTAINER subsection, create list that will describe elements of container diagram. For each element include sublist with: 1. Name - name of element; 2. Type - type of element; 3. Description - description of element; 4. Responsibilities - responsibilities of element; 5. Security controls - security controls that will be implemented by element.

- Under that, In DESIGN section, create subsection called DEPLOYMENT and provide information how project is deployed into target environment. Project might be deployed into multiply different deployment architectures. First list all possible solutions and pick one to descried in details. Include mermaid graph to visualize deployment. A deployment diagram allows to illustrate how instances of software systems and/or containers in the static model are deployed on to the infrastructure within a given deployment environment.

- Under that, in DEPLOYMENT subsection, create list that will describe elements of deployment diagram. For each element include sublist with: 1. Name - name of element; 2. Type - type of element; 3. Description - Description of element; 4. Responsibilities - responsibilities of element; 5. Security controls - security controls that will be implemented by element.

- Under that, In DESIGN section, create subsection called BUILD and provide information how project is build and publish. Focus on security controls of build process, e.g. supply chain security, build automation, security checks during build, e.g. SAST scanners, linters, etc. Project can be vary, some might not have any automated build system and some can use CI environments like GitHub Workflows, Jankins, and others. Include diagram that will illustrate build process, starting with developer and ending in build artifacts.

- Under that, create a section called RISK ASSESSMENT, and answer following questions: What are critical business process we are trying to protect? What data we are trying to protect and what is their sensitivity?

- Under that, create a section called QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS, list questions that you have and the default assumptions regarding BUSINESS POSTURE, SECURITY POSTURE and DESIGN.

# INPUT:

GITHUB REPOSITORY: https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam

# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide high-quality, efficient, and safe concurrency primitives for Rust developers.
  - Enable Rust developers to build concurrent and parallel applications more easily and reliably.
  - Foster the Rust ecosystem by providing essential building blocks.
  - Maintain the library as a robust and well-documented resource for the community.
- Business Risks:
  - Library defects could lead to application crashes, data corruption, or unexpected behavior in applications using crossbeam.
  - Security vulnerabilities in crossbeam could be exploited by malicious actors through applications that depend on it.
  - Poor performance or inefficiency could negatively impact the performance of applications using crossbeam.
  - Lack of maintenance or community support could lead to the library becoming outdated or unusable.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Public code repository on GitHub, allowing for community review and scrutiny. (Implemented: GitHub)
  - security control: Issue tracking system on GitHub for reporting and managing bugs and potential security issues. (Implemented: GitHub)
  - security control: Continuous Integration (CI) using GitHub Actions for automated testing on various platforms. (Implemented: GitHub Actions, see `.github/workflows`)
  - security control: Code review process through pull requests. (Implemented: GitHub)
  - security control: Version control using Git, enabling tracking of changes and rollback if necessary. (Implemented: Git/GitHub)
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: As an open-source project, the project relies on community contributions and may have vulnerabilities discovered by external parties.
  - accepted risk: Dependency on external crates (Rust libraries) introduces potential supply chain risks.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - recommended security control: Implement static analysis security testing (SAST) tools in the CI pipeline to automatically detect potential code-level vulnerabilities.
  - recommended security control: Integrate dependency scanning tools to monitor for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
  - recommended security control: Consider adding fuzz testing to discover unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities in concurrency primitives under stress.
  - recommended security control: Establish a clear process for handling security vulnerability reports, including responsible disclosure and patch management.
  - recommended security control: Perform regular security audits, potentially involving external security experts, to review the codebase and identify potential weaknesses.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to a library. Authentication is relevant in the context of development and publishing (crates.io account management, GitHub account security).
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to a library. Authorization is relevant in the context of repository access control on GitHub.
  - Input Validation: While crossbeam is a library and doesn't directly handle user input, it's crucial to ensure that internal APIs and interfaces are robust against unexpected or malicious inputs from dependent code. This is more about API design and defensive programming within the library.
  - Cryptography: Crossbeam does not appear to directly implement cryptographic functionalities. If cryptography is used in the future, standard secure crypto practices must be followed (using well-vetted libraries, proper key management, etc.).

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - The critical business processes being protected are the applications that rely on the crossbeam library for their functionality, especially those requiring concurrency and parallelism for performance or reliability. Failures in crossbeam can directly impact the availability, performance, and correctness of these applications.
- Data Sensitivity:
  - Crossbeam itself does not directly handle or store sensitive data. However, applications using crossbeam may process sensitive data. The sensitivity of data being protected depends entirely on the applications that utilize the crossbeam library. If an application using crossbeam processes personal data, financial data, or other confidential information, then the reliability and security of crossbeam become critical for protecting that data indirectly. The sensitivity level is therefore application-dependent and can range from low to high depending on the use case.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What is the intended audience and primary use cases for the crossbeam library? (Assumption: General-purpose concurrency library for Rust developers)
  - Are there any specific security compliance requirements or industry standards that the crossbeam library needs to adhere to? (Assumption: No specific compliance requirements beyond general secure development practices for open-source libraries)
  - What is the process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities in crossbeam? (Assumption: Standard open-source vulnerability reporting process through GitHub issues or security channels)
  - Are there any plans to implement more formal security testing or audits for crossbeam beyond the current CI and community review? (Assumption: Current security measures are primarily community-driven with CI testing, potential for future enhancements like SAST and fuzzing)

- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to provide a high-quality, reliable, and secure concurrency library for the Rust community.
  - SECURITY POSTURE: Standard open-source security practices are followed, including code review, testing, and community engagement. There is a willingness to improve security posture by adopting recommended security controls.
  - DESIGN: The design is focused on providing efficient and safe concurrency primitives within the constraints of the Rust language and runtime environment. Deployment context is primarily within Rust applications that depend on the library.
