# Attack Surface Analysis for crossbeam-rs/crossbeam

## Attack Surface: [Data Races (Unsafe Code Interaction)](./attack_surfaces/data_races__unsafe_code_interaction_.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrect interaction with `crossbeam` data structures from `unsafe` blocks within the application code, bypassing `crossbeam`'s safety mechanisms.
    *   **How Crossbeam Contributes:** `crossbeam` uses `unsafe` internally for performance. Application code that also uses `unsafe` and interacts incorrectly with `crossbeam`'s internal data structures can introduce data races. This is a *direct* interaction with `crossbeam`'s implementation.
    *   **Example:** Directly manipulating the underlying memory of a `crossbeam::queue::ArrayQueue` from an `unsafe` block without adhering to the queue's internal synchronization mechanisms.
    *   **Impact:** Memory corruption, undefined behavior, program crashes, potential security vulnerabilities (if the corrupted data is used in security-critical contexts).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Minimize `unsafe`:** Avoid using `unsafe` code in the application if at all possible. This is the most effective mitigation.
        *   **Isolate `unsafe`:** If `unsafe` is absolutely necessary, keep it highly localized, well-documented, and thoroughly reviewed.
        *   **Strictly Adhere to Invariants:** If interacting with `crossbeam` internals from `unsafe` code, *absolutely* ensure that all internal invariants of the `crossbeam` data structures are maintained. This requires a deep understanding of `crossbeam`'s implementation details.
        *   **Extensive Testing:** Rigorous testing, including fuzzing, stress testing, and potentially formal verification, is essential for any `unsafe` code interacting with `crossbeam`.

## Attack Surface: [Deadlocks (Locking)](./attack_surfaces/deadlocks__locking_.md)

*   **Description:** Two or more threads are blocked indefinitely, waiting for each other to release `crossbeam` synchronization primitives (locks).
    *   **How Crossbeam Contributes:** `crossbeam` provides locking primitives like `Mutex` and `ShardedLock`. Incorrect usage of these primitives, such as acquiring locks in inconsistent orders across threads, *directly* leads to deadlocks.
    *   **Example:** Thread 1 acquires a `crossbeam::sync::Mutex` for resource A, then tries to acquire another `crossbeam::sync::Mutex` for resource B. Thread 2 acquires the `crossbeam::sync::Mutex` for B, then tries to acquire the `crossbeam::sync::Mutex` for A.
    *   **Impact:** Application hangs completely, resulting in a denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Lock Ordering:** Establish a strict, consistent global order for acquiring all locks (including `crossbeam` locks) throughout the application. Always acquire locks in the same predetermined order.
        *   **Lock Hierarchy:** Design a lock hierarchy to prevent circular dependencies between locks.
        *   **Deadlock Detection Tools:** Utilize tools that can detect potential deadlocks during development and testing.
        *   **Timeouts:** Consider using lock acquisition with timeouts (if supported by the specific `crossbeam` primitive) to prevent indefinite blocking.

## Attack Surface: [Deadlocks (Channels)](./attack_surfaces/deadlocks__channels_.md)

*   **Description:** Senders and receivers on `crossbeam::channel` are blocked indefinitely, waiting for each other.
    *   **How Crossbeam Contributes:** This is a *direct* consequence of misusing `crossbeam::channel`. Incorrect channel usage patterns, such as mismatched senders and receivers, or using synchronous channels without a corresponding receiver, lead directly to deadlocks.
    *   **Example:** A sender attempts to send on a synchronous `crossbeam::channel::bounded(0)` channel, but there is no receiver currently ready to receive, causing the sender to block indefinitely.
    *   **Impact:** Application hangs, leading to a denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Careful Channel Design:** Thoroughly analyze channel usage patterns to ensure that senders and receivers are correctly paired and that the channel type (bounded, unbounded, synchronous) is appropriate for the use case.
        *   **Sufficient Capacity:** Use bounded channels with sufficient capacity to avoid unnecessarily blocking senders.
        *   **Timeouts:** Utilize `send_timeout` and `recv_timeout` methods (where available) to prevent indefinite blocking on channel operations.
        *   **Avoid Synchronous Channels When Possible:** Synchronous channels (`bounded(0)`) are particularly prone to deadlocks; prefer asynchronous channels with a small buffer unless synchronous behavior is strictly required.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (Resource Exhaustion - Unbounded Queues)](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__resource_exhaustion_-_unbounded_queues_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can cause the application to consume excessive memory by exploiting unbounded queues provided by `crossbeam`.
    *   **How Crossbeam Contributes:** `crossbeam` provides unbounded queues (e.g., `SegQueue`). Using these without limits or backpressure mechanisms *directly* exposes the application to this vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** A server uses a `crossbeam::queue::SegQueue` to queue incoming network requests. An attacker floods the server with requests, causing the queue to grow without bound until the server exhausts available memory and crashes.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Bounded Queues:** Use bounded queues (e.g., `crossbeam::queue::ArrayQueue`) whenever possible. This is the most direct and effective mitigation.
        *   **Backpressure:** Implement mechanisms to slow down or reject new inputs when queues are approaching their capacity. This might involve sending error responses to clients or delaying processing.
        *   **Monitoring:** Continuously monitor queue sizes and set alerts for excessive growth, allowing for proactive intervention.
