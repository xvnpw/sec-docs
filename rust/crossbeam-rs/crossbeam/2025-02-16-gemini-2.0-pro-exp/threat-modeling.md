# Threat Model Analysis for crossbeam-rs/crossbeam

## Threat: [Unbounded Channel Overflow](./threats/unbounded_channel_overflow.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could flood a producer thread with requests, causing it to send messages to an unbounded `crossbeam::channel` faster than the consumer can process them. The attacker doesn't need direct access to the channel; they just need to trigger the producer's behavior.
    *   **Impact:** Leads to Out-of-Memory (OOM) condition, crashing the application and causing a Denial of Service (DoS).
    *   **Affected Component:** `crossbeam::channel` (specifically unbounded channels: `crossbeam::channel::unbounded()`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use bounded channels (`crossbeam::channel::bounded()`) with a carefully chosen capacity.
        *   Implement backpressure: The producer should monitor the channel's fill level and slow down or pause if it's approaching the limit. This might involve feedback from the consumer.
        *   Rate-limit the producer's input or processing.
        *   Implement monitoring and alerting to detect excessive channel growth.

## Threat: [Deadlock in Channel Communication](./threats/deadlock_in_channel_communication.md)

*   **Description:** A poorly designed application using `crossbeam::channel` could be vulnerable to deadlock. A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are blocked indefinitely, waiting for each other to release resources (in this case, to send or receive on a channel). This can happen with complex channel interactions.
    *   **Impact:** Complete application hang, requiring a restart. This is a Denial of Service (DoS).
    *   **Affected Component:** `crossbeam::channel` (all channel types), potentially in combination with other synchronization primitives.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully analyze channel communication patterns to avoid circular dependencies.
        *   Use a deadlock detection tool during development (e.g., `parking_lot`'s deadlock detection, though external to `crossbeam`).
        *   Establish clear ownership and communication protocols between threads.
        *   Minimize the complexity of channel interactions.
        *   Consider using timeouts on send/receive operations to prevent indefinite blocking.

## Threat: [Deadlock with `Parker` and `Unparker`](./threats/deadlock_with__parker__and__unparker_.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrect usage of `crossbeam::sync::Parker` and `crossbeam::sync::Unparker` can lead to deadlocks. For example, a thread might `park()` itself without a corresponding `unpark()` call from another thread, or the `unpark()` might happen *before* the `park()`, leading to a missed wakeup.
    *   **Impact:** Application hang (DoS), potentially affecting only a subset of threads.
    *   **Affected Component:** `crossbeam::sync::Parker`, `crossbeam::sync::Unparker`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure a one-to-one correspondence between `park()` and `unpark()` calls.
        *   Carefully consider the order of operations and potential race conditions.
        *   Use higher-level synchronization primitives (e.g., channels) if possible, as they are often easier to reason about.
        *   Thoroughly test and review code that uses `Parker` and `Unparker`.

## Threat: [Data Race with Atomic Operations](./threats/data_race_with_atomic_operations.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrect use of `crossbeam::atomic` can introduce a data race. If multiple threads access and modify a shared atomic variable without using the correct memory ordering, the result can be unpredictable, leading to data corruption or inconsistent state.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, unpredictable application behavior, potential information disclosure (through corrupted data), potential for exploitation depending on the nature of the corrupted data.
    *   **Affected Component:** `crossbeam::atomic` (all atomic types and operations).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use the appropriate memory ordering (`SeqCst`, `Acquire`, `Release`, `Relaxed`, `AcqRel`) for each atomic operation. Understand the implications of each ordering.
        *   Prefer higher-level abstractions (e.g., data structures built on top of atomics) when possible.
        *   Use tools like ThreadSanitizer (part of LLVM) to detect data races during testing.

## Threat: [Use-After-Free with Epoch-Based Reclamation](./threats/use-after-free_with_epoch-based_reclamation.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrect use of `crossbeam::epoch` can lead to use-after-free vulnerabilities. If a thread accesses a memory location that has been reclaimed by another thread (because it was no longer protected by a `Guard`), it can read invalid data or cause a crash.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash (DoS), potential for arbitrary code execution (depending on the specifics of the use-after-free), data corruption.
    *   **Affected Component:** `crossbeam::epoch` (and data structures that use it, such as lock-free queues).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly adhere to the rules of epoch-based reclamation. Ensure proper synchronization between threads.
        *   Use `Guard` objects correctly to protect access to shared data. Ensure `Guard`s are dropped only when the data is no longer needed.
        *   Thoroughly test and review code that uses `crossbeam::epoch`.
        *   Consider using a memory safety checker (e.g., Miri, part of the Rust project) to detect use-after-free errors.

## Threat: [Panic-Induced Inconsistent State](./threats/panic-induced_inconsistent_state.md)

* **Description:** A thread panics while interacting with a `crossbeam` component (e.g., while holding a lock implemented using crossbeam primitives, during a channel operation, or within an epoch-protected region). If not handled, this can leave shared data structures in an inconsistent state.
    * **Impact:** Data corruption, deadlock, or other unpredictable behavior in other threads that access the same shared resources. Potentially a DoS if other threads become blocked.
    * **Affected Component:** Potentially any `crossbeam` component, as panics can occur in any code interacting with shared resources managed by or used in conjunction with `crossbeam`.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use `std::panic::catch_unwind` to catch panics within threads and attempt to recover gracefully.
        *   Ensure that shared resources are properly cleaned up or reset in case of a panic (e.g., using RAII).
        *   Log panics for debugging.
        *   Minimize the amount of code that executes while holding shared resources.
