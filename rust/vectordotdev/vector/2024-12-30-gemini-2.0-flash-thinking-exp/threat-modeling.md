### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving Vector

This list contains high and critical severity threats that directly involve the Vector data pipeline.

*   **Threat:** Configuration Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious code or commands into Vector's configuration files (TOML or YAML). This might occur if the configuration is dynamically generated based on untrusted input or if there are vulnerabilities in how the configuration is parsed *within Vector*. The attacker could manipulate configuration parameters to execute arbitrary commands on the server running Vector.
    *   **Impact:** Full system compromise, data exfiltration, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Vector Component:** Configuration Loader, potentially affecting all modules as the configuration dictates their behavior.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid dynamically generating Vector configurations based on untrusted input.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for any data used to generate configurations.
        *   Use parameterized configuration methods if available *within Vector*.
        *   Regularly review and audit Vector configurations.
        *   Employ immutable infrastructure principles where configuration changes are treated as deployments.

*   **Threat:** Sensitive Information Exposure in Configuration
    *   **Description:** Vector's configuration files might contain sensitive information such as API keys, database credentials, or internal network details. An attacker gaining unauthorized access to these files could steal this information. This could happen through insecure file permissions, accidental exposure in version control, or vulnerabilities in the system hosting Vector.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access to connected systems, lateral movement within the network.
    *   **Affected Vector Component:** Configuration Files (TOML/YAML).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store sensitive information securely using secrets management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) and integrate with Vector's secrets management capabilities if available.
        *   Avoid hardcoding sensitive information directly in Vector configuration files.
        *   Use environment variables or dedicated secret stores for sensitive data and reference them in Vector's configuration.
        *   Ensure proper file system permissions on Vector configuration files, restricting access to only necessary users and processes.
        *   Regularly scan repositories for accidentally committed secrets.

*   **Threat:** Data Tampering in Transit through Vector
    *   **Description:** If the communication channels between Vector components (e.g., between a source and Vector, or between Vector and a sink) are not properly secured using encryption (like TLS), an attacker could intercept and modify data as it flows through the pipeline *within Vector*. This could involve altering data values or injecting malicious data.
    *   **Impact:** Data integrity compromise, potential for malicious data injection into downstream systems, regulatory compliance violations.
    *   **Affected Vector Component:** Network communication between Sources, Transforms, and Sinks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce TLS encryption for all network communication involving Vector components.
        *   Configure Vector to verify TLS certificates to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
        *   Consider using secure network protocols like mTLS for enhanced authentication and authorization *within Vector's communication*.
        *   Implement integrity checks (e.g., checksums) on data being processed by Vector.

*   **Threat:** Sink Injection
    *   **Description:** If the destination sinks configured in Vector are vulnerable to injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection in a database sink, command injection in a system command sink), an attacker could craft malicious data that, when processed by Vector and sent to the sink, exploits these vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of downstream systems, data manipulation in sinks, potential for remote code execution on sink systems.
    *   **Affected Vector Component:** Sink modules (e.g., `clickhouse`, `elasticsearch`, `kafka`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow secure coding practices when developing or configuring Vector sinks.
        *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases *within Vector sinks*.
        *   Avoid constructing commands dynamically based on untrusted data when using system command sinks *within Vector*.
        *   Regularly update Vector and its sink plugins to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization *within Vector* before data reaches the sink.

*   **Threat:** Exploitation of Vector Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** Like any software, Vector might contain undiscovered vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, cause crashes, or execute arbitrary code on the server running Vector.
    *   **Impact:** Full system compromise, data breach, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Vector Component:** Potentially any module or the core Vector process.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Vector updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Subscribe to security advisories for Vector.
        *   Implement a vulnerability management program to identify and address potential weaknesses in Vector.
        *   Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) if Vector exposes any management interfaces over HTTP.

*   **Threat:** Supply Chain Attacks on Vector Dependencies
    *   **Description:** Vector relies on various dependencies. If any of these dependencies are compromised (e.g., through malicious code injection into a library), it could introduce vulnerabilities into Vector itself.
    *   **Impact:**  Potentially any impact depending on the nature of the compromised dependency, ranging from data breaches to remote code execution *within Vector*.
    *   **Affected Vector Component:** All components relying on the compromised dependency.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in Vector's dependencies.
        *   Regularly update Vector's dependencies.
        *   Consider using software bill of materials (SBOM) to track Vector's dependencies.
        *   Verify the integrity of downloaded dependencies used by Vector.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Vector Plugins/Components
    *   **Description:** Vector's extensibility through plugins introduces the risk of vulnerabilities within those plugins. A compromised or poorly written plugin could be exploited to gain unauthorized access or disrupt Vector's operation.
    *   **Impact:**  Potentially any impact depending on the plugin's functionality and the vulnerability, including data breaches and remote code execution *within Vector*.
    *   **Affected Vector Component:** Specific plugin modules.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only use trusted and well-maintained Vector plugins.
        *   Keep Vector plugins updated to the latest versions.
        *   Review the code of custom plugins for potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement security scanning for plugin code used by Vector.

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Access to Vector Management Interface
    *   **Description:** If Vector provides a management interface (e.g., an API or web UI) and access controls are not properly configured or are weak, attackers could gain unauthorized access to manage and control Vector. This could allow them to modify configurations, disrupt operations, or potentially exfiltrate data *handled by Vector*.
    *   **Impact:** Ability to disrupt operations, modify configuration, potentially exfiltrate data, full control over the Vector instance.
    *   **Affected Vector Component:** Management API, Web UI (if present).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for the Vector management interface.
        *   Use HTTPS for all communication with the management interface.
        *   Restrict access to the management interface to authorized users and networks.
        *   Regularly audit access logs for the management interface.
        *   Disable or secure any default or unnecessary management interfaces provided by Vector.
