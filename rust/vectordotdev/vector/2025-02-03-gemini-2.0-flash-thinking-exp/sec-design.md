# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, represented by the GitHub repository `vectordotdev/vector`, aims to provide a high-performance, open-source observability data pipeline. The primary business goal is to offer a reliable, efficient, and scalable solution for collecting, processing, and routing observability data (logs, metrics, traces) from various sources to diverse destinations.

Business priorities for this project are:

*   Reliability: Ensuring consistent and uninterrupted data flow is critical for observability. Data loss or pipeline downtime can severely impact monitoring and incident response capabilities.
*   Performance: High throughput and low latency are essential to handle large volumes of observability data in real-time. Performance bottlenecks can lead to data backlog and delayed insights.
*   Scalability: The solution must scale horizontally to accommodate growing data volumes and expanding infrastructure. Scalability ensures the system can adapt to future needs without significant architectural changes.
*   Security: Protecting observability data in transit and at rest is paramount. Security breaches can expose sensitive information and compromise the integrity of the observability platform.
*   Extensibility: The pipeline should be extensible to support new data sources, destinations, and processing logic. Extensibility allows users to adapt Vector to their evolving observability requirements.
*   Community Adoption: As an open-source project, community adoption is vital for long-term success. A strong community contributes to development, provides support, and ensures the project remains relevant and vibrant.

Key business risks associated with these priorities include:

*   Service disruption: Downtime or instability of the data pipeline can lead to observability gaps, hindering incident detection and resolution, potentially causing financial and reputational damage.
*   Data loss: Loss of observability data due to pipeline failures or misconfigurations can result in incomplete insights and missed critical events.
*   Data breach: Security vulnerabilities in the pipeline can be exploited to access or exfiltrate sensitive observability data, leading to compliance violations, reputational damage, and potential legal liabilities.
*   Performance degradation: Inefficient pipeline design or resource constraints can lead to performance bottlenecks, delaying data delivery and impacting real-time observability.
*   Lack of adoption: Failure to attract a strong community and user base can limit the project's growth, innovation, and long-term viability.
*   Compliance violations: Mishandling of sensitive data within the pipeline can lead to violations of data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA), resulting in fines and legal repercussions.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls and accepted risks for the Vector project, based on common open-source project practices and general cloud-native application security considerations:

*   security control: Code reviews are likely conducted for contributions to the project, although the extent and rigor may vary depending on the contributor and the complexity of the change. (Location: GitHub Pull Request process)
*   security control: Unit and integration tests are likely in place to ensure code functionality and stability. These tests may indirectly contribute to security by catching functional bugs that could have security implications. (Location: GitHub repository, CI/CD pipelines)
*   security control: Static analysis tools (linters, formatters) are likely used to enforce code quality and style, which can indirectly improve security by reducing code complexity and potential for errors. (Location: CI/CD pipelines, developer tooling)
*   security control: Dependency scanning might be in place to detect known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by Vector. (Location: CI/CD pipelines, dependency management tools)
*   security control: HTTPS is expected for communication with external services and APIs used by Vector components. (Location: Configuration and code related to HTTP clients and servers)
*   accepted risk: The depth and frequency of security-specific code reviews (focused on identifying security vulnerabilities) might be limited due to resource constraints and community-driven development.
*   accepted risk: Penetration testing and formal security audits might not be regularly conducted, especially for specific deployments or configurations.
*   accepted risk: Vulnerability disclosure and incident response processes might be informal or less mature compared to established commercial products.

Recommended security controls to implement as high priority:

*   security control: Implement a formal Security Development Lifecycle (SDLC) process, integrating security considerations into each phase of development, from design to deployment.
*   security control: Introduce regular security-focused code reviews, specifically looking for common vulnerability patterns (e.g., injection flaws, insecure deserialization, broken authentication).
*   security control: Integrate Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect potential security vulnerabilities in the codebase.
*   security control: Integrate Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) tools to test the running application for vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) to continuously monitor dependencies for known vulnerabilities and ensure timely patching.
*   security control: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure policy and incident response plan to handle security issues effectively.
*   security control: Conduct regular penetration testing and security audits, especially before major releases or significant architectural changes.
*   security control: Implement robust input validation and sanitization across all Vector components to prevent injection attacks.
*   security control: Enforce least privilege principles for Vector processes and user access to configuration and data.
*   security control: Provide secure configuration guidelines and best practices for users deploying and operating Vector in different environments.

Security requirements for the Vector project:

*   Authentication:
    *   Requirement: Vector should support secure authentication mechanisms for administrative access and control plane interactions (if applicable).
    *   Requirement: Consider supporting mutual TLS (mTLS) for secure communication between Vector components and external systems where strong authentication is needed.
*   Authorization:
    *   Requirement: Implement fine-grained authorization controls to manage access to Vector's configuration, data streams, and operational commands.
    *   Requirement: Follow the principle of least privilege, granting users and processes only the necessary permissions.
*   Input Validation:
    *   Requirement: Validate all inputs received by Vector components, including configuration parameters, data payloads, and API requests.
    *   Requirement: Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection, cross-site scripting).
    *   Requirement: Implement input validation at multiple layers (e.g., client-side, server-side) to ensure comprehensive protection.
*   Cryptography:
    *   Requirement: Use strong encryption algorithms and protocols (e.g., TLS 1.3, AES-256) to protect sensitive data in transit and at rest.
    *   Requirement: Securely manage cryptographic keys and certificates, following industry best practices for key generation, storage, and rotation.
    *   Requirement: Consider data encryption at rest for sensitive data persisted by Vector components (e.g., configuration, buffers, persistent queues).

```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developer (DEV) writes code and commits changes to Version Control (VC) system (e.g., GitHub).
2.  Upon code commit or pull request, a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) is triggered.
3.  A Build Container (BC) is initiated in the CI/CD environment, providing a consistent and isolated build environment.
4.  Unit & Integration Tests (TEST) are executed to verify code functionality and catch regressions.
5.  Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST) tools scan the codebase for potential security vulnerabilities (e.g., using linters, SAST scanners).
6.  Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools analyze project dependencies to identify known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
7.  Build Artifacts (BUILD) are created, including compiled binaries, container images, and packages.
8.  Publish Artifacts (PUBLISH) step distributes the build artifacts to container registries (e.g., Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry), package repositories (e.g., npm, crates.io), and release management systems.

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   security control: Version Control (Git): Code changes are tracked and auditable, enabling rollback and traceability. Branch protection rules can enforce code review and prevent direct commits to main branches.
*   security control: CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions): Automates the build process, reducing manual errors and ensuring consistent builds. Pipeline configuration as code allows for version control and auditability.
*   security control: Build Container: Provides a controlled and reproducible build environment, minimizing supply chain risks from build dependencies.
*   security control: Unit & Integration Tests: Help ensure code quality and catch functional bugs that could have security implications.
*   security control: Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST): Identifies potential security vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle, allowing for remediation before deployment.
*   security control: Software Composition Analysis (SCA): Detects known vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies, enabling timely patching and reducing supply chain risks.
*   security control: Secure Build Configuration: Hardening build environment, using minimal base images for containers, applying least privilege principles to build processes.
*   security control: Artifact Signing and Verification: Signing build artifacts (e.g., container images, packages) to ensure integrity and authenticity. Verification of signatures during deployment.
*   security control: Access Control for CI/CD Pipeline: Restricting access to CI/CD pipeline configuration and execution to authorized personnel.
*   security control: Audit Logging of Build Process: Logging all build steps, security scans, and publishing activities for auditability and incident investigation.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes we are trying to protect:

*   Observability Data Collection and Delivery: Ensuring continuous and reliable collection, processing, and delivery of logs, metrics, and traces is the core business process. Disruptions to this process directly impact observability capabilities.
*   Configuration Management: Secure and reliable management of Vector's configuration is crucial for maintaining pipeline functionality and security posture. Compromised configuration can lead to service disruption or security breaches.
*   Software Build and Release: Maintaining the integrity and security of the software build and release process is essential to prevent supply chain attacks and ensure users are deploying trusted software.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:

*   Observability Data (Logs, Metrics, Traces): Sensitivity varies depending on the data sources. Logs and traces can contain sensitive information such as:
    *   Personally Identifiable Information (PII): Usernames, IP addresses, email addresses, session IDs, etc.
    *   Application Secrets: API keys, passwords, tokens accidentally logged.
    *   Business Sensitive Data: Transaction details, financial information, internal system names, etc.
    *   Compliance Data: Data subject to regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS.
    Sensitivity level can range from low (public metrics) to high (logs containing PII or secrets).
*   Configuration Data: Configuration files and parameters can contain sensitive information:
    *   Credentials: Passwords, API keys, tokens for accessing data sources and destinations.
    *   Internal System Details: Network addresses, service endpoints, internal architecture information.
    Sensitivity level is generally medium to high, as exposure can lead to unauthorized access or service disruption.
*   Build Artifacts: While build artifacts themselves may not contain sensitive data, their integrity is critical:
    *   Compromised artifacts can lead to supply chain attacks and deployment of malicious software.
    Sensitivity level is medium to high in terms of integrity and availability.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   What is the intended deployment environment for Vector (cloud, on-premise, hybrid)? This will influence deployment architecture and security controls.
*   What is the expected data volume and velocity for the observability pipeline? This will impact scalability and performance requirements.
*   What are the specific compliance requirements for the organization using Vector (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS)? This will dictate data handling and security controls.
*   Is there a central control plane planned for Vector deployment, or will it be primarily agent/aggregator based? This affects the complexity of management and security architecture.
*   What is the organization's current security maturity level and existing security infrastructure? This will help tailor security recommendations and identify gaps.
*   What are the specific data sources and observability backends that Vector will integrate with? This will inform integration security requirements.

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to provide a reliable, high-performance, and secure observability data pipeline for general-purpose use. Security is a significant concern, but performance and reliability are also critical.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: The project follows common open-source security practices, but there is room for improvement in formal security processes and tooling. Security is considered important but might not be the top priority compared to functionality and performance in the initial stages.
*   DESIGN: Vector architecture is assumed to be modular, consisting of agents, aggregators, and potentially a control plane. Deployment is likely to be containerized, with Kubernetes as a common target environment. The build process is automated using CI/CD pipelines and includes basic security checks.
