## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Masking and Redaction within Vector Pipelines](./mitigation_strategies/data_masking_and_redaction_within_vector_pipelines.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify sensitive data fields (e.g., PII, secrets, financial information) that might be processed by Vector pipelines.
    2.  Utilize Vector's transform components (e.g., `remap`, `mask`, `regex_replace`) to implement data masking, redaction, or anonymization rules.
    3.  Configure transforms to modify or remove sensitive data fields *before* they are routed to sinks. This ensures sensitive data is not stored or transmitted in its original form in downstream systems.
    4.  Define clear rules and policies for data masking and redaction based on data sensitivity classifications and compliance requirements.
    5.  Regularly review and update masking/redaction rules to adapt to evolving data sensitivity requirements and new data fields.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Data Exposure in Sinks (High Severity): Sensitive data could be exposed in logging systems, monitoring platforms, or data warehouses if not properly masked or redacted before reaching these sinks.
    *   Compliance Violations (High Severity): Failure to mask or redact sensitive data can lead to violations of data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA).
    *   Insider Threats (Medium Severity): Even with internal access to sinks, masked or redacted data reduces the risk of sensitive information being misused by malicious or negligent insiders.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data Exposure in Sinks: High Reduction - Significantly reduces the risk of sensitive data exposure in downstream systems.
    *   Compliance Violations: High Reduction - Helps to meet data privacy compliance requirements by protecting sensitive data.
    *   Insider Threats: Medium Reduction - Limits the usefulness of data for malicious insiders by masking sensitive information.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic redaction of API keys and passwords in application logs is in place using `regex_replace` transforms in some pipelines.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Comprehensive data masking strategy across all pipelines. Need to expand masking to cover PII (e.g., email addresses, usernames, IP addresses) and implement more sophisticated masking techniques like tokenization or pseudonymization where appropriate.  Also, need to centralize and manage masking rules for consistency.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Sink Configurations](./mitigation_strategies/secure_sink_configurations.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Carefully review and validate the configuration of all Vector sinks to ensure data is only sent to authorized and secure destinations.
    2.  Verify sink addresses and credentials within Vector configuration to prevent accidental routing of sensitive data to incorrect or untrusted locations.
    3.  Utilize authentication and encryption mechanisms provided by sinks *and configured within Vector*. For example, enable TLS for HTTP-based sinks in Vector's configuration, configure authentication for database sinks in Vector's configuration, and use secure connection strings for message brokers in Vector's configuration.
    4.  Regularly audit sink configurations within Vector to ensure they remain secure and aligned with data handling policies.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Data Leakage to Unauthorized Sinks (High Severity): Misconfigured sinks in Vector could lead to sensitive data being sent to unintended or public destinations, resulting in data leakage.
    *   Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (Medium Severity): Unencrypted communication with sinks *configured in Vector* can expose data in transit to eavesdropping and interception.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data Leakage to Unauthorized Sinks: High Reduction - Prevents accidental data leakage due to misconfiguration in Vector.
    *   Man-in-the-Middle Attacks: Medium Reduction - Protects data in transit to sinks by using encryption *configured in Vector*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. TLS is enabled for HTTP sinks in Vector configuration. Authentication is configured for database sinks in Vector configuration.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Enforce encryption for all sink types where supported *and configurable within Vector* (e.g., message brokers).  Regular automated validation of sink configurations *within Vector* is also missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Define expected schemas and data formats for all input sources that Vector processes.
    2.  Implement input validation within Vector transforms (e.g., using `filter` or `remap` components with conditional logic) to check incoming data against defined schemas and formats.
    3.  Sanitize input data within Vector transforms to remove or neutralize potentially malicious payloads or malformed data that could cause issues. This might involve removing special characters, truncating strings, or rejecting invalid data using Vector's capabilities.
    4.  Log or discard invalid or sanitized data *using Vector's logging or routing capabilities* for auditing and debugging purposes.
    5.  Regularly review and update input validation rules *within Vector configurations* to adapt to changes in input data sources and potential attack vectors.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) - Malicious Payloads (Medium Severity): Processing oversized or malformed data can lead to resource exhaustion or crashes in Vector.
    *   Injection Attacks (Medium Severity):  If Vector processes data that is later used in other systems (e.g., dashboards, alerts), unsanitized input could potentially lead to injection attacks (e.g., log injection, dashboard injection).
    *   Unexpected Behavior and Errors (Medium Severity):  Malformed input data can cause unexpected behavior, errors, or pipeline failures in Vector.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) - Malicious Payloads: Medium Reduction - Reduces the risk of DoS attacks caused by malicious input data processed by Vector.
    *   Injection Attacks: Medium Reduction - Mitigates the risk of injection attacks by sanitizing input data within Vector before it is processed further.
    *   Unexpected Behavior and Errors: Medium Reduction - Improves the stability and reliability of Vector pipelines by handling invalid input data gracefully within Vector.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic input validation is implemented in some pipelines to filter out logs with incorrect formats using Vector's `filter` component.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Comprehensive input validation and sanitization across all pipelines and sources *using Vector's transform capabilities*. Need to define clear schemas for all input types and implement robust validation logic *within Vector configurations*.  Also, need to implement sanitization techniques to neutralize potentially malicious content in logs or metrics *using Vector's transforms*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Vector Configuration Files and Access](./mitigation_strategies/secure_vector_configuration_files_and_access.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Protect Vector configuration files from unauthorized access and modification using appropriate file system permissions.
    2.  Implement access control mechanisms to restrict who can create, modify, or deploy Vector configurations.
    3.  Store sensitive configuration data (e.g., credentials, API keys) securely, ideally using secrets management solutions and avoid embedding them directly in Vector configuration files. *This point is directly related to Vector configuration as it dictates how secrets are handled within Vector's setup.*
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Configuration Changes (High Severity):  An attacker or unauthorized user could modify Vector configurations to disrupt operations, exfiltrate data, or introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   Credential Exposure (High Severity): Storing credentials directly in Vector configuration files can lead to credential exposure if the files are compromised.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Configuration Changes: High Reduction - Prevents unauthorized modifications to Vector configurations.
    *   Credential Exposure: High Reduction - Eliminates the risk of credential exposure from Vector configuration files by using secrets management.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Configuration files are stored in version control. Secrets are partially managed using environment variables in some deployments, but direct embedding in configuration still occurs in some cases.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Full integration with a dedicated secrets management solution for all sensitive configuration data *used in Vector configurations*.  Need to implement more granular access control for configuration management workflows *related to Vector*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Vector Updates](./mitigation_strategies/regular_vector_updates.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Establish a process for regularly updating Vector to the latest stable version.
    2.  Monitor Vector's release notes, security advisories, and community channels for announcements of new versions and security patches.
    3.  Test updates in non-production environments before deploying them to production.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (High Severity): Outdated versions of Vector may contain known security vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers.
    *   Lack of Security Patches (High Severity):  Failing to update Vector means missing out on critical security patches that address newly discovered vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities: High Reduction - Significantly reduces the risk of exploitation of known vulnerabilities in Vector by patching them promptly.
    *   Lack of Security Patches: High Reduction - Ensures that Vector is protected against the latest known security threats.
*   **Currently Implemented:**  Manual updates are performed periodically, but no automated update process is in place.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Automated update process for Vector deployments. Need to implement a system for tracking Vector versions and scheduling regular updates, ideally with automated testing and rollback capabilities.  Also, need to improve monitoring of Vector security advisories.
