# Threat Model Analysis for vectordotdev/vector

## Threat: [Vulnerability Exploitation in Vector Core](./threats/vulnerability_exploitation_in_vector_core.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a known or zero-day vulnerability in the Vector binary code. This could allow execution of arbitrary code on the system running Vector.
**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), data corruption, information disclosure, full system compromise.
**Vector Component Affected:** Vector Core Binary.
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Vector updated to the latest stable version.
*   Monitor Vector security advisories.
*   Implement system hardening practices.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion (DoS)](./threats/resource_exhaustion__dos_.md)

**Description:** Misconfiguration or malicious input causes Vector to consume excessive system resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O), leading to service disruption.
**Impact:** Denial of Service for the Vector pipeline, performance degradation.
**Vector Component Affected:** Vector Process, Input/Transform/Output modules.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Configure Vector resource limits (`resource_limits`).
*   Implement resource usage monitoring and alerting.
*   Perform capacity planning and load testing.
*   Implement rate limiting at input sources.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation](./threats/privilege_escalation.md)

**Description:** An attacker who has compromised the Vector process attempts to escalate privileges on the host system, gaining higher levels of access.
**Impact:** Full system compromise, unauthorized access to sensitive data and systems.
**Vector Component Affected:** Vector Process, System Permissions.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Run Vector with least necessary privileges.
*   Implement strong host system hardening.
*   Conduct regular security audits.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Configuration](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_configuration.md)

**Description:** Vector configuration files containing sensitive information (API keys, passwords) are exposed, allowing attackers to access these credentials.
**Impact:** Compromise of external systems, unauthorized data access, data breaches.
**Vector Component Affected:** Vector Configuration Files.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Securely store configuration files with access controls.
*   Use environment variables or secret management systems for sensitive data.
*   Encrypt sensitive data in configuration if possible.

## Threat: [Configuration Injection/Tampering](./threats/configuration_injectiontampering.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious configurations or tamper with existing settings if Vector configuration is dynamically generated or lacks validation.
**Impact:** Data redirection, data manipulation, denial of service, unauthorized access.
**Vector Component Affected:** Vector Configuration Management.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Treat configuration as code and apply secure development practices.
*   Validate and sanitize external inputs for configuration.
*   Implement version control and auditing for configuration changes.

## Threat: [Data Leakage to Unauthorized Destinations](./threats/data_leakage_to_unauthorized_destinations.md)

**Description:** Misconfiguration or compromise of Vector leads to data being sent to unintended or unauthorized output destinations.
**Impact:** Data breaches, privacy violations, compliance issues.
**Vector Component Affected:** Output Modules, Vector Configuration.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully configure and verify output destinations.
*   Implement access controls for output destinations.
*   Regularly audit output configurations and data flow paths.
*   Use network segmentation to restrict Vector's network access.

## Threat: [Credential Compromise for Output Destinations](./threats/credential_compromise_for_output_destinations.md)

**Description:** Vector's credentials for output destinations are compromised, allowing attackers unauthorized access to those systems.
**Impact:** Unauthorized access to output systems, data manipulation, lateral movement.
**Vector Component Affected:** Output Modules, Credential Management.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Securely manage output destination credentials using secret management.
*   Implement least privilege access for Vector's credentials.
*   Rotate credentials regularly.
*   Monitor for unauthorized access attempts to output destinations.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Control Plane](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_control_plane.md)

**Description:** If Vector's control plane is exposed without proper authentication, attackers can gain unauthorized access to manage and monitor Vector.
**Impact:** Configuration tampering, data redirection, denial of service, information disclosure.
**Vector Component Affected:** Vector Control Plane (API, Management Interface).
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure control plane with strong authentication (API keys, mTLS).
*   Implement authorization and RBAC.
*   Limit network exposure of the control plane.
*   Audit control plane access logs.

## Threat: [Control Plane Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/control_plane_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in Vector's control plane API or management interface are exploited, potentially leading to remote code execution or administrative control.
**Impact:** Remote Code Execution on control plane, configuration manipulation, denial of service.
**Vector Component Affected:** Vector Control Plane (API, Management Interface).
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Vector and control plane components updated.
*   Perform security testing and vulnerability scanning of the control plane.
*   Follow secure development practices for control plane extensions.
