# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for vectordotdev/vector

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Configuration Storage](./mitigation_strategies/secure_configuration_storage.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify all sensitive information within `vector` configuration files (e.g., API keys, database passwords, access tokens, secrets for authentication used by `vector` sources or sinks).
    2.  Replace hardcoded sensitive values in `vector` configuration files with references to environment variables that `vector` can access. For example, instead of `api_key: "your_secret_key"`, use `api_key: "${API_KEY}"` in your `vector` configuration.
    3.  Utilize secure methods to manage and inject these environment variables into the `vector` process at runtime, ensuring `vector` can read them without exposing them in configuration files.
    4.  Ensure `vector` configuration files themselves are stored securely with restricted file system permissions, limiting access to users and processes that need to manage `vector`.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exposure of Credentials in Configuration Files (High Severity): Attackers gaining access to `vector` configuration files could directly extract sensitive credentials used by `vector`.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Exposure of Credentials in Configuration Files: High Reduction - Significantly reduces the risk of direct credential exposure in static `vector` configuration files.
    *   Unauthorized Access to Systems Integrated with Vector: Medium Reduction - Reduces the attack surface by removing easily accessible credentials from `vector` configurations.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Environment variables are used for database connection strings in some `vector` configurations, but API keys for third-party services are still sometimes hardcoded in `vector` configuration files for development environments.
