    *   **Security-Focused Alerts:**  Develop specific alerts for security-relevant events in `vector` logs, such as:
        *   Configuration changes (especially unauthorized ones).
        *   Authentication failures (if applicable).
        *   Errors related to source/sink connections (potential availability issues or attacks).
        *   Unusual data processing patterns or errors.
        *   Log tampering attempts (if detectable).
    *   **Performance Anomaly Alerts:**  Configure alerts for deviations from baseline performance metrics (CPU, memory, network, throughput) that could indicate resource exhaustion, DDoS attempts, or misconfigurations.
    *   **Customizable Dashboards:** Create dashboards that visualize key security and performance metrics for `vector`, allowing for quick identification of trends and anomalies. Dashboards should be role-based, providing relevant information to different teams (security, operations, development).
    *   **Alert Tuning and Refinement:**  Continuously monitor and tune alerts to reduce false positives and ensure alerts are actionable and relevant. Implement feedback loops to improve alert accuracy over time.

**4. Monitor `vector`'s performance metrics:**

*   **Analysis:** Performance monitoring is crucial for ensuring `vector`'s stability and identifying potential resource exhaustion attacks or misconfigurations.  Monitoring key metrics provides insights into `vector`'s health and capacity.
