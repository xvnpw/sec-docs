## Project Design Document: Vector Observability Data Pipeline - Improved

**1. Introduction**

Vector is a high-performance, open-source observability data router designed for collecting, transforming, and routing logs, metrics, and traces with speed and reliability. This document details Vector's architecture and key components to facilitate threat modeling and security analysis. It provides a comprehensive understanding of how data flows through the system and the technologies involved.

**2. Goals**

* Clearly articulate the architectural design of the Vector observability pipeline.
* Identify and describe the core components and their interactions within the system.
* Provide a detailed overview of the data flow from ingestion to delivery.
* Outline the underlying technologies and dependencies that constitute Vector.
* Serve as a definitive reference for threat modeling exercises and security assessments.

**3. Scope**

This document focuses on the core data processing pipeline of Vector, encompassing data ingestion, transformation, and routing. It covers the configuration mechanisms that define pipeline behavior. While connector examples are provided for clarity, the specific details of every individual source, transform, and sink connector are outside the scope. This document does not cover aspects like Vector's build process, community contributions, or specific deployment infrastructure details beyond general considerations.

    end
    E["'External Data Sources'"] --> A;
    C --> F["'Destination Systems'"];
```

* **External Data Sources:** Represent external systems generating observability data (e.g., application servers emitting logs, monitoring agents collecting metrics, tracing systems).
* **Vector Instance:** A single running process of the Vector application responsible for processing observability data.
* **Sources:**  Dedicated components within Vector responsible for collecting data from various external sources. Each source is tailored to a specific data source type.
* **Transforms:** Components that process and modify events as they flow through Vector. Transformations are applied based on user-defined logic.
* **Sinks:** Components responsible for delivering processed data to designated destination systems. Each sink is designed to interact with a specific type of destination.
* **Configuration:** The set of rules and parameters that define how Vector operates, including the definition and connection of sources, transforms, and sinks.
* **Destination Systems:** External systems where processed observability data is ultimately stored, analyzed, or visualized (e.g., Elasticsearch, Kafka, cloud monitoring services).

**5. Detailed Architecture and Components**

* **Sources:**
    * **Purpose:**  Ingest data from various origins.
    * **Mechanism:**  Each source implements specific logic to connect to and retrieve data from its designated source. This might involve polling, subscribing to streams, or listening on network sockets.
    * **Configuration:** Requires parameters specific to the data source, such as connection strings, file paths, API keys, and data formats.
    * **Examples:**
        * `file`: Reads log data from files.
        * `socket`: Listens for data on TCP or UDP sockets (e.g., syslog).
        * `http`: Receives data via HTTP endpoints.
        * `internal_metrics`: Collects internal metrics about Vector's performance.
        * `kafka`: Consumes messages from Kafka topics.

* **Transforms:**
    * **Purpose:** Modify and enrich events as they pass through the pipeline.
    * **Mechanism:** Apply user-defined logic, written in the Vector Remap Language (VRL), to individual events or batches of events.
    * **Configuration:**  Defines the VRL code to be executed and specifies which events the transform should operate on.
    * **Examples:**
        * `json_parser`: Parses JSON formatted data.
        * `regex_parser`: Extracts data using regular expressions.
        * `sampler`:  Samples events based on a defined rate.
        * `filter`:  Removes events based on specific criteria.
        * `rename_fields`: Changes the names of fields within events.
        * `add_fields`: Adds new fields to events.

* **Sinks:**
    * **Purpose:** Deliver processed data to external destination systems.
    * **Mechanism:**  Each sink implements the necessary logic to connect to and send data to its target destination. This might involve API calls, writing to files, or publishing to message queues.
    * **Configuration:** Requires parameters specific to the destination system, such as connection URLs, authentication credentials, data formats, and batching settings.
    * **Examples:**
        * `elasticsearch`: Sends data to an Elasticsearch cluster.
        * `kafka`: Produces messages to Kafka topics.
        * `datadog_logs`: Sends logs to Datadog.
        * `console`: Outputs data to the standard output.
        * `loki`: Sends logs to a Loki instance.

* **Configuration:**
    * **Format:** Typically defined in TOML or YAML files.
    * **Structure:**  Specifies global settings for the Vector instance and defines individual sources, transforms, and sinks, including their types and configuration options.
    * **Loading:** Vector loads the configuration at startup and can be configured to reload automatically upon changes to the configuration file.
    * **Centralized Management (Potential Future Feature):** While currently file-based, future iterations might introduce centralized configuration management.

* **Vector Remap Language (VRL):**
    * **Purpose:** A domain-specific language for defining data transformation logic.
    * **Features:** Provides functions for manipulating event data, including accessing and modifying fields, performing conditional logic, type conversions, and string manipulation.
    * **Security Implications:**  The expressiveness of VRL requires careful consideration of potential security risks associated with user-defined scripts.

* **Internal Buffering and Queues:**
    * **Purpose:**  Provide resilience and handle varying data throughput.
    * **Mechanism:**  Vector utilizes internal buffers and queues between pipeline stages (sources to transforms, transforms to sinks). This allows components to operate independently and handle temporary backpressure.

**6. Data Flow**

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["'External Data Source'"] --> B("'Source Component'");
    B -- "Raw Events" --> C("'Internal Buffer (Source -> Transform)'");
    C --> D("'Transform Component 1'");
    D -- "Transformed Events" --> E("'Internal Buffer (Transform -> Transform/Sink)'");
    E --> F("'Transform Component N'");
    F -- "Transformed Events" --> G("'Internal Buffer (Transform -> Sink)'");
    G --> H("'Sink Component'");
    H -- "Processed Data" --> I["'Destination System'"];
```

1. **Data Generation:** External systems generate observability data.
2. **Source Ingestion:** The configured source component connects to the external data source and ingests raw events.
3. **Buffering (Source to Transform):** Raw events are placed into an internal buffer, decoupling the source from downstream processing.
4. **Transformation (Stage 1):** The first transform component in the pipeline retrieves events from its input buffer and applies its configured transformations.
5. **Buffering (Transform to Transform/Sink):** Transformed events are placed into an internal buffer, allowing for further processing or delivery.
6. **Transformation (Stage N):** Subsequent transform components retrieve events from their input buffers and apply their transformations. This can be a chain of multiple transforms.
7. **Buffering (Transform to Sink):**  Final transformed events are placed into a buffer destined for the sink.
8. **Sink Delivery:** The sink component retrieves processed events from its buffer and delivers them to the configured destination system.

**7. Security Considerations (for Threat Modeling)**

* **Configuration Security:**
    * **Storage:** How are configuration files stored and protected from unauthorized access or modification?
    * **Secrets Management:** How are sensitive credentials (API keys, passwords) within the configuration handled? Are they encrypted or stored securely?
    * **Access Control:** Who has permissions to read and modify the Vector configuration?
    * **Injection Attacks:** Can malicious actors inject harmful configurations that could disrupt operations or expose sensitive data?
