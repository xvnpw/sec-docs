# Threat Model Analysis for vectordotdev/vector

## Threat: [Source Impersonation/Spoofing](./threats/source_impersonationspoofing.md)

**Threat:** Source Impersonation/Spoofing

**Description:** An attacker could craft malicious data packets or messages that mimic legitimate data sources. Vector, if not properly configured to validate sources, might ingest this fake data. This directly involves Vector's ability to authenticate and trust incoming data.

**Impact:** Inaccurate data analysis, misleading dashboards and alerts, triggering incorrect automated responses, potentially hiding actual malicious activity.

**Affected Component:** Source Module (specifically the input logic and potential lack of source validation).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement source authentication mechanisms where supported by Vector and the source (e.g., API keys, mutual TLS).
*   Utilize Vector's filtering and routing capabilities to drop data from untrusted or unexpected sources.
*   Implement anomaly detection within Vector or downstream systems to identify unusual data patterns.

## Threat: [Malicious Transform Configuration](./threats/malicious_transform_configuration.md)

**Threat:** Malicious Transform Configuration

**Description:** An attacker gaining unauthorized access to Vector's configuration could inject or modify transform configurations to manipulate data in transit. This directly targets Vector's core data processing functionality.

**Impact:** Bypassing security controls, hiding malicious activity, data corruption, potential execution of malicious code if transforms allow scripting.

**Affected Component:** Transform Module, Configuration Management.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Secure Vector's configuration files with appropriate permissions and encryption.
*   Implement access control for modifying Vector's configuration.
*   Regularly audit Vector's configuration for unauthorized changes.
*   Minimize the use of complex or scripting-heavy transforms, especially with external input.

## Threat: [Sink Impersonation/Misdirection](./threats/sink_impersonationmisdirection.md)

**Threat:** Sink Impersonation/Misdirection

**Description:** An attacker could potentially manipulate Vector's sink configuration to redirect data to an unintended destination under their control. This directly abuses Vector's routing capabilities.

**Impact:** Sensitive data being sent to unauthorized parties, potential data breaches, loss of control over data.

**Affected Component:** Sink Module, Configuration Management.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Secure Vector's configuration files and access to the management interface.
*   Implement strict access control for modifying sink configurations.
*   Regularly audit sink configurations for unauthorized changes.
*   Utilize features like mutual TLS where supported by the sink to verify the destination.

## Threat: [Credentials Compromise in Configuration](./threats/credentials_compromise_in_configuration.md)

**Threat:** Credentials Compromise in Configuration

**Description:** Vector's configuration often requires storing credentials (usernames, passwords, API keys) for accessing sources and sinks. If these credentials are stored insecurely within Vector's configuration, an attacker gaining access can compromise them. This is a direct vulnerability within Vector's configuration management.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to external systems, data breaches, ability to manipulate data in connected systems.

**Affected Component:** Configuration Management.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Utilize Vector's built-in secret management capabilities or integrate with external secret management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault).
*   Avoid storing credentials directly in plain text within configuration files.
*   Encrypt sensitive data within configuration files.
*   Implement strong access control for accessing and modifying Vector's configuration.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vector Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_vector_vulnerabilities.md)

**Threat:** Exploitation of Vector Vulnerabilities

**Description:** Like any software, Vector itself might contain security vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code within the Vector process, or cause a denial of service of the Vector application.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the Vector instance, potential access to sensitive data being processed, disruption of data pipelines.

**Affected Component:** All Vector Components (depending on the vulnerability).

**Risk Severity:** Critical (depending on the vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Keep Vector updated to the latest version with security patches.
*   Subscribe to Vector's security advisories and mailing lists.
*   Follow security best practices for deploying and running Vector (e.g., running as a non-root user, limiting network exposure).
