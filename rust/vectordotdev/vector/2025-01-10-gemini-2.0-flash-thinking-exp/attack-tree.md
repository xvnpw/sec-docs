## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities.md)

An attacker successfully exploits weaknesses in how Vector's configuration is stored, accessed, or managed. This could involve gaining unauthorized access to configuration files, leveraging default credentials, or bypassing authentication mechanisms on configuration APIs. Success at this node enables numerous downstream attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Sensitive Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/access_sensitive_configuration.md)

Attackers gain access to sensitive configuration data, such as API keys, database credentials, or internal authentication tokens used by Vector. This access can be achieved through exposed configuration files, unpatched default credentials, or vulnerabilities in configuration APIs. This node is critical due to the immediate impact of credential compromise and its role in enabling further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vector's Internal Components](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vector's_internal_components.md)

Attackers target and exploit vulnerabilities within Vector's core code or its plugins/connectors. This could involve leveraging known vulnerabilities for which patches might not be applied or discovering and exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities. Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution and full control over the Vector instance.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Vector Core](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_vector_core.md)

This is a specific instance of exploiting Vector's internal components, focusing on publicly known vulnerabilities in the core Vector application. Attackers leverage readily available exploit code or techniques to compromise the system if it's not properly patched.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities -> Access Sensitive Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities_-_access_sensitive_configuration.md)

This path involves an attacker first exploiting a general configuration vulnerability (e.g., lack of proper file permissions) to then gain access to sensitive configuration data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities -> Manipulate Configuration Remotely](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities_-_manipulate_configuration_remotely.md)

This path involves an attacker exploiting a configuration vulnerability to remotely change Vector's settings. This could be done by exploiting insecure configuration reloading mechanisms or unprotected configuration APIs, allowing them to inject malicious configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Data Processing Capabilities -> Inject Malicious Data](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_data_processing_capabilities_-_inject_malicious_data.md)

This path involves attackers injecting malicious data into the Vector pipeline. This can be achieved by compromising upstream data sources, intercepting and modifying data in transit, or exploiting input validation weaknesses within Vector's source components. The injected data can then be used to attack the application or other downstream systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Data Processing Capabilities -> Manipulate Data Routing](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_data_processing_capabilities_-_manipulate_data_routing.md)

Attackers exploit Vector's configuration (often through configuration vulnerabilities) or internal logic to redirect data to unauthorized sinks under their control, enabling data exfiltration. Alternatively, they might manipulate routing to drop or corrupt critical data streams, causing disruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vector's Internal Components -> Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Vector Core](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vector's_internal_components_-_exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_vector_core.md)

Attackers directly exploit publicly known vulnerabilities in Vector's core code to gain unauthorized access or execute arbitrary code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vector's Internal Components -> Exploit Vulnerabilities in Vector Plugins/Connectors](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vector's_internal_components_-_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_vector_pluginsconnectors.md)

Attackers target vulnerabilities within Vector's plugins or connectors to compromise Vector or systems connected through these extensions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vector's Interaction with the Application -> Manipulate Data Sent to the Application](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vector's_interaction_with_the_application_-_manipulate_data_sent_to_the_application.md)

Attackers leverage their ability to control or influence Vector to manipulate the data that Vector sends to the application. This can involve injecting malicious payloads into the data stream or altering critical data fields to manipulate the application's logic or state.
