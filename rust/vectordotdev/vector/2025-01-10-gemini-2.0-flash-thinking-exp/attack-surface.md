# Attack Surface Analysis for vectordotdev/vector

## Attack Surface: [Sensitive Data in Vector Configuration](./attack_surfaces/sensitive_data_in_vector_configuration.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Sensitive Data in Vector Configuration**
    *   Description: Vector's configuration file (e.g., `vector.toml`, YAML) might contain sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, or authentication tokens required to connect to various sources and sinks.
    *   How Vector Contributes: Vector *requires* configuration to define its behavior, including connections to external systems. This necessitates storing credentials or sensitive details within its configuration.
    *   Example: The `vector.toml` file contains the API key for a cloud monitoring service sink, allowing data to be sent to that service. If this file is compromised, the attacker gains access to the monitoring service.
    *   Impact: Unauthorized access to connected systems, data breaches, potential for further lateral movement within the infrastructure.
    *   Risk Severity: Critical
    *   Mitigation Strategies:
        *   **Developers/Users:**
            *   Avoid storing sensitive credentials directly in the configuration file.
            *   Utilize secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, environment variables with restricted access) and configure Vector to retrieve secrets from these secure stores.
            *   Implement strict access controls on the configuration file and the directory it resides in.
            *   Encrypt the configuration file at rest.
            *   Regularly rotate sensitive credentials.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Configuration Injection](./attack_surfaces/malicious_configuration_injection.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Malicious Configuration Injection**
    *   Description: If the Vector configuration is dynamically generated or influenced by external input without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious configurations to alter Vector's behavior.
    *   How Vector Contributes: Vector's flexible configuration and potential for dynamic generation make it vulnerable if input validation is lacking.
    *   Example: A web application allows users to configure data sources for Vector. If user input isn't sanitized, an attacker could inject a configuration that redirects logs to an attacker-controlled sink.
    *   Impact: Data exfiltration, resource exhaustion by configuring Vector to consume excessive resources, potential for remote code execution depending on the injected configuration and available plugins/transforms.
    *   Risk Severity: High
    *   Mitigation Strategies:
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Avoid dynamically generating Vector configurations based on untrusted input.
            *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for any external input used to influence the configuration.
            *   Use a predefined, well-audited set of configuration templates and only allow selecting from these.
            *   Implement a robust configuration validation process before applying changes.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Vector Plugins](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_vector_plugins.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Vulnerabilities in Vector Plugins**
    *   Description: Vector's plugin architecture allows for extending its functionality. However, vulnerabilities in these plugins (either official or community-developed) can introduce security risks.
    *   How Vector Contributes: Vector's extensibility *relies* on plugins, making it directly susceptible to vulnerabilities within those plugins.
    *   Example: A vulnerability exists in a specific sink plugin that allows arbitrary file write access on the Vector host. An attacker could exploit this to gain control of the system.
    *   Impact: Remote code execution on the Vector host, data breaches, denial of service.
    *   Risk Severity: High
    *   Mitigation Strategies:
        *   **Developers/Users:**
            *   Only use official and well-vetted Vector plugins.
            *   Keep Vector and its plugins updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
            *   Thoroughly research and understand the security implications of any third-party plugins before using them.
            *   Implement a process for evaluating the security of new plugins before deployment.
            *   Consider using a restricted environment for running Vector with plugins.

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Communication Channels](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_communication_channels.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Unsecured Communication Channels**
    *   Description: If Vector communicates with sources or sinks over unencrypted channels (e.g., plain HTTP, unencrypted TCP), data in transit can be intercepted and potentially modified by attackers.
    *   How Vector Contributes: Vector *manages* the communication channels for data ingestion and delivery.
    *   Example: Vector sends logs to a remote syslog server over plain TCP. An attacker on the network can eavesdrop on this communication and view sensitive log data.
    *   Impact: Confidentiality breach, potential for man-in-the-middle attacks where data is intercepted and altered.
    *   Risk Severity: High
    *   Mitigation Strategies:
        *   **Developers/Users:**
            *   Enable TLS/SSL and enforce its use for all communication with sources and sinks.
            *   Verify the TLS/SSL configuration to ensure strong ciphers are used and certificates are valid.
            *   Avoid using unencrypted protocols for sensitive data transmission.
