# Attack Surface Analysis for vectordotdev/vector

## Attack Surface: [Source Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_surfaces/source_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** Overwhelming Vector sources with excessive data to exhaust resources and disrupt service.
*   **Vector Contribution:** Vector sources listening on network ports are susceptible to high-volume data attacks. Vector's architecture, without explicit built-in rate limiting in all sources, can be vulnerable if not protected externally.
*   **Example:** An attacker floods an `http_listener` source with a large number of requests, consuming Vector's CPU and memory, causing it to become unresponsive and drop legitimate data.
*   **Impact:** Data loss, service disruption, potential cascading failures in dependent systems.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting at the network level (firewall, load balancer) in front of Vector sources. Consider if specific Vector sources offer rate limiting options and utilize them.
    *   **Resource Limits for Vector:** Configure resource limits (CPU, memory) for the Vector process using containerization or system-level tools to prevent complete system exhaustion.
    *   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Monitor Vector's resource usage and set up alerts for unusual spikes in traffic or resource consumption to detect potential DoS attacks early.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate Vector instances and sources from untrusted networks to reduce exposure to external attacks.

## Attack Surface: [VRL Sandbox Escape (Theoretical)](./attack_surfaces/vrl_sandbox_escape__theoretical_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Vector Remap Language (VRL) interpreter to bypass the sandbox and execute arbitrary code on the Vector host.
*   **Vector Contribution:** VRL is a core component of Vector's transform functionality.  A vulnerability in the VRL interpreter would directly compromise Vector's security model.
*   **Example:** An attacker, through configuration injection or by exploiting a vulnerability in Vector's configuration loading, injects malicious VRL code into a transform. This code exploits a hypothetical bug in the VRL interpreter to escape the sandbox and execute system commands, potentially gaining control of the Vector host.
*   **Impact:** Full system compromise, data breach, complete loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Vector instance and potentially the host system.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (though currently theoretical, requires vigilance)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Vector Updated:**  Immediately apply security patches released by Vector developers. Monitor Vector security advisories and release notes for any security-related updates to VRL.
    *   **Configuration Security:**  Strictly control access to Vector configuration files and prevent unauthorized modification to minimize the risk of malicious VRL injection.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run Vector with minimal necessary privileges to limit the impact if a sandbox escape were to occur.
    *   **Security Audits:** Conduct security reviews of Vector configurations and any custom VRL code to identify potential weaknesses or unexpected behaviors.

## Attack Surface: [Sink Credential Exposure](./attack_surfaces/sink_credential_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Exposure of sensitive credentials (API keys, passwords, connection strings) used to authenticate Vector with sinks.
*   **Vector Contribution:** Vector configurations often contain credentials for sinks. Insecure storage or handling of these credentials within Vector's configuration or deployment environment is a direct Vector-related risk.
*   **Example:** Sink credentials for a cloud storage service are stored in plaintext within the Vector configuration file. An attacker gains access to the configuration file and retrieves these credentials, allowing them to access and potentially compromise the cloud storage service, leading to data breaches or manipulation.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sink systems, data breaches, data manipulation in sinks, potential compromise of downstream systems.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secrets Management:** Utilize environment variables or dedicated secrets management solutions (like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Kubernetes Secrets) to store and manage sink credentials *outside* of the main Vector configuration file.
    *   **Secure Configuration Storage:** Store Vector configuration files securely with restricted access controls. Encrypt configuration files at rest if possible, although this is less effective than external secrets management.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Configuration Access:** Restrict access to Vector configuration files to only authorized users and processes, minimizing the chance of unauthorized credential access.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration Injection/Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/configuration_injectionmanipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized modification of Vector's configuration file to alter its behavior for malicious purposes.
*   **Vector Contribution:** Vector's functionality is entirely defined by its configuration.  Vulnerabilities in how Vector loads, manages, or protects its configuration directly contribute to this attack surface.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains write access to the Vector configuration file. They modify the configuration to redirect sensitive data to an attacker-controlled sink, effectively exfiltrating data processed by Vector. They could also disable critical data pipelines or introduce malicious VRL transforms.
*   **Impact:** Data exfiltration, data loss, DoS (by misconfiguration), information disclosure, potential VRL injection leading to more severe compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Configuration Storage:** Store Vector configuration files securely with strict access controls at the file system level.
    *   **Configuration File Integrity Monitoring:** Implement file integrity monitoring systems to detect unauthorized changes to the configuration file and trigger alerts.
    *   **Immutable Infrastructure:** Deploy Vector in an immutable infrastructure where configuration changes are strictly controlled through infrastructure-as-code and version control, reducing the risk of direct file manipulation.
    *   **Configuration Validation:** Implement automated validation checks for Vector configurations before deployment or reload to detect and prevent malicious or invalid configurations from being loaded.

## Attack Surface: [Vector Software Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/vector_software_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities present in the Vector software itself due to coding errors or design flaws.
*   **Vector Contribution:** As a software application, Vector's codebase may contain vulnerabilities that could be exploited. These vulnerabilities are inherent to the Vector software itself.
*   **Example:** A remote code execution vulnerability is discovered in Vector's core processing logic. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted data stream to a Vector source or by manipulating Vector's internal state through other means, gaining control of the Vector host.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, DoS, information disclosure, complete system compromise of the Vector instance and potentially the host system.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the specific vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Vector Updated:**  Regularly and promptly update Vector to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Periodically scan Vector deployments for known vulnerabilities using vulnerability scanning tools that can identify outdated software versions or known CVEs.
    *   **Security Monitoring:** Monitor Vector's logs and system behavior for suspicious activity that might indicate exploitation attempts.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run Vector with minimal necessary privileges to limit the potential impact of a software vulnerability exploitation.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities present in the third-party libraries and dependencies used by Vector.
*   **Vector Contribution:** Vector relies on numerous external libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies are indirectly part of Vector's attack surface as they can be exploited through Vector.
*   **Example:** A critical vulnerability is discovered in a widely used networking library that Vector depends on. This vulnerability could be exploited by sending malicious network traffic to a Vector source, even if Vector's core code is itself secure, leading to a compromise of the Vector instance.
*   **Impact:** Similar to Vector software vulnerabilities - Remote code execution, DoS, information disclosure, system compromise, depending on the nature of the dependency vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the severity and exploitability of the dependency vulnerability in the context of Vector)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Scanning:** Regularly scan Vector's dependencies for known vulnerabilities using dependency scanning tools that analyze Vector's dependency manifests (e.g., `Cargo.lock` in Rust projects).
    *   **Dependency Updates:** Keep Vector's dependencies updated. Vector updates often include updates to its dependencies. Prioritize updating Vector when dependency vulnerabilities are announced.
    *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Implement SCA practices to continuously monitor and manage Vector's dependencies and their security posture, enabling proactive identification and remediation of dependency vulnerabilities.
