# Threat Model Analysis for vectordotdev/vector

## Threat: [Exposed Sensitive Credentials in Configuration](./threats/exposed_sensitive_credentials_in_configuration.md)

**Description:** An attacker might gain access to Vector configuration files or environment variables containing hardcoded credentials (API keys, passwords). They could then use these credentials to access downstream systems, databases, or APIs that Vector interacts with, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, or service disruption.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access to downstream systems, service disruption, privilege escalation.
*   **Affected Vector Component:** Configuration Loading, Environment Variable Handling
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize secure secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets).
    *   Inject secrets into Vector at runtime instead of hardcoding them.
    *   Implement strict file system permissions on configuration files.
    *   Avoid storing secrets in environment variables if possible, or use secure environment variable stores.

## Threat: [Insecure Listener Configurations](./threats/insecure_listener_configurations.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit exposed Vector listeners (HTTP, TCP) lacking authentication or encryption. They might inject malicious data into Vector pipelines, bypass security controls by directly interacting with Vector, or launch denial-of-service attacks by overwhelming the listener.
*   **Impact:** Data injection, security control bypass, denial of service, unauthorized access to Vector internals.
*   **Affected Vector Component:** Listeners (e.g., `http_listener`, `tcp_listener`)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for all listeners.
    *   Enforce TLS/SSL encryption for all network communication to listeners.
    *   Restrict listener access to authorized networks and clients using firewalls or network segmentation.
    *   Regularly review and audit listener configurations.

## Threat: [Misconfigured Data Destinations](./threats/misconfigured_data_destinations.md)

**Description:** An attacker, or even accidental misconfiguration, could lead to Vector sending data to unintended or insecure destinations. This could involve sending sensitive data to public cloud storage without proper access controls or to incorrect API endpoints controlled by malicious actors.
*   **Impact:** Data leakage, compliance violations, exposure of sensitive information to unauthorized parties, potential data manipulation at unintended destinations.
*   **Affected Vector Component:** Sinks (e.g., `aws_s3`, `http`, `elasticsearch`)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly validate and test all sink configurations before deployment.
    *   Implement data validation and sanitization pipelines within Vector before data reaches sinks.
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege to sink credentials and permissions.
    *   Regularly review and audit sink configurations and data flow.

## Threat: [Data Injection through Vector Inputs](./threats/data_injection_through_vector_inputs.md)

**Description:** An attacker could craft malicious data payloads and inject them through Vector's input components (e.g., HTTP requests, log files). If input validation is insufficient, these payloads could exploit vulnerabilities in downstream systems that process the data, such as SQL injection or command injection.
*   **Impact:** Exploitation of downstream application vulnerabilities, data corruption, denial of service in downstream systems, potential for remote code execution in downstream systems.
*   **Affected Vector Component:** Inputs (e.g., `http`, `file`), Transforms (if insufficient validation)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization within Vector pipelines, especially in transforms.
    *   Use Vector's transformation capabilities to filter and sanitize data before it reaches downstream systems.
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege to Vector's access to data sources.
    *   Regularly review and update input validation rules.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Dependencies](./threats/vulnerable_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Vector, like most software, relies on third-party libraries and components. If these dependencies contain known security vulnerabilities, attackers could exploit them to compromise Vector itself.
*   **Impact:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in Vector's dependencies, potentially leading to remote code execution, denial of service, or data breaches within the Vector process or the host system.
*   **Affected Vector Component:** Dependencies (Third-party libraries)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly scan Vector's dependencies for known vulnerabilities using vulnerability scanning tools (e.g., dependency-check, Trivy).
    *   Keep Vector and its dependencies updated to the latest versions with security patches.
    *   Implement a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for Vector to track dependencies and facilitate vulnerability management.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attacks on Vector Distribution](./threats/supply_chain_attacks_on_vector_distribution.md)

**Description:** An attacker could compromise Vector's build or distribution process. This could involve injecting malicious code into Vector binaries before they are released, leading to users downloading and running compromised software.
*   **Impact:** Installation of backdoored or malicious Vector software, potentially granting attackers persistent access to systems, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities.
*   **Affected Vector Component:** Distribution Packages, Build Pipeline
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Download Vector binaries from official and trusted sources (e.g., official Vector GitHub releases, verified package repositories).
    *   Verify the integrity of downloaded binaries using checksums or digital signatures provided by the Vector project.
    *   Implement security controls throughout the software supply chain, including secure build pipelines, code signing, and release verification processes.

## Threat: [Lack of Patching and Updates](./threats/lack_of_patching_and_updates.md)

**Description:** Failing to apply security patches and updates to Vector and its underlying operating system and dependencies leaves known vulnerabilities unaddressed. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise Vector and the systems it runs on.
*   **Impact:** Exposure to known vulnerabilities, increased risk of exploitation, potential for security breaches, data breaches, and system compromise.
*   **Affected Vector Component:** Deployment Environment, Vector Software
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Establish a regular patching and update schedule for Vector, its dependencies, and the underlying operating system.
    *   Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability notifications for Vector and its dependencies.
    *   Automate patching processes where possible to ensure timely updates.
    *   Regularly audit the patch status of Vector deployments.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Vector Configuration and Management](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_vector_configuration_and_management.md)

**Description:** If access to Vector's configuration files, management interfaces (if exposed), or operational parameters is not properly controlled, unauthorized individuals could modify Vector's behavior. This could lead to data redirection, service disruption, or malicious data manipulation.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, service disruption, malicious data manipulation, unauthorized changes to Vector behavior, potential for privilege escalation.
*   **Affected Vector Component:** Configuration Loading, Management Interfaces (if any), Operational Controls
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for accessing Vector's management interfaces (if exposed).
    *   Restrict access to Vector configuration files and management tools to authorized personnel only using operating system level permissions or RBAC.
    *   Utilize Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage permissions for Vector management.
    *   Regularly review and audit access control configurations.
