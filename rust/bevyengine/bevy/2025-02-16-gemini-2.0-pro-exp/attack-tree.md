## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Bevy Application (RCE/DoS) - CRITICAL NODE](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_bevy_application__rcedos__-_critical_node.md)

This is the attacker's ultimate goal. All paths below lead to this.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Resource Loading/Asset Management Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_resource_loadingasset_management_vulnerabilities.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Load Malicious Asset (e.g., GLTF, PNG) - HIGH RISK, CRITICAL](./attack_tree_paths/load_malicious_asset__e_g___gltf__png__-_high_risk__critical.md)

**Description:** The attacker crafts a specially designed asset file (like a GLTF model or PNG image) that exploits a vulnerability in Bevy's asset parsing or handling code, or in one of the underlying libraries Bevy uses for asset loading (e.g., `gltf`, image crates). This could involve buffer overflows, format string bugs, or other memory corruption issues. The reliance on external crates for asset loading increases the attack surface.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High. Asset loading is a common attack vector, and vulnerabilities in parsing libraries are frequently discovered.
        *   **Impact:** High. Successful exploitation could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
        *   **Effort:** Medium. Requires finding or crafting an exploit payload.
        *   **Skill Level:** Medium to High. Requires knowledge of memory corruption, exploit development, and the asset format.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium. Sophisticated exploits can evade detection, but input validation and fuzzing help.
        *   **Actionable Insights:**
            *   **Input Validation:** Implement strict validation of *all* loaded assets *before* Bevy processes them. Check file headers, sizes, and internal structures. Don't rely on file extensions.
            *   **Fuzzing:** Fuzz Bevy's asset loading functions with malformed inputs. This should be part of Bevy's CI/CD.
            *   **Dependency Auditing:** Regularly audit dependencies (e.g., `gltf`, image crates) for vulnerabilities using tools like `cargo audit`. Update promptly.
            *   **Sandboxing (if possible):** Isolate the asset loading process (e.g., separate process with reduced privileges).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Bevy's Rendering Pipeline/Shader Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_bevy's_rendering_pipelineshader_vulnerabilities.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion (R3) - HIGH RISK (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service_via_resource_exhaustion__r3__-_high_risk__dos_.md)

**Description:** The attacker submits complex scenes, shaders, or other rendering-related inputs that consume excessive GPU or CPU resources, leading to a denial of service. This could involve a large number of draw calls, overly complex shaders, or huge textures.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High. Relatively easy to attempt.
        *   **Impact:** Medium. Causes the application to become unresponsive or crash.
        *   **Effort:** Low. Can be achieved with minimal effort.
        *   **Skill Level:** Low. Minimal technical expertise required.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium. Resource exhaustion is often noticeable through performance monitoring.
        *   **Actionable Insights:**
            *   **Resource Limits:** Implement limits on scene complexity, draw calls, texture sizes, and buffer sizes.
            *   **Timeout Mechanisms:** Implement timeouts to prevent shaders from running indefinitely.
            *   **Monitoring:** Monitor GPU and CPU resource usage and detect anomalies.
