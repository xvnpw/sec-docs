## Mitigation Strategy: [Robust Asset Loading (Bevy's Asset System)](./mitigation_strategies/robust_asset_loading__bevy's_asset_system_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement comprehensive validation within Bevy's asset loading pipeline.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Extend `AssetLoader`:** Create custom `AssetLoader` implementations for each asset type you use (e.g., `.gltf`, `.png`, `.ogg`).  Bevy's `AssetLoader` trait provides the interface for this.
    2.  **Whitelist Extensions:** Within each `AssetLoader`, define a whitelist of allowed file extensions. Reject any asset with an unexpected extension.
    3.  **Header/Magic Number Checks:**  In the `load` function of your `AssetLoader`, read the initial bytes of the asset file and verify the file header or magic number to confirm the file type.  This prevents attackers from disguising malicious files with incorrect extensions.
    4.  **Structure Validation:**  Parse the asset data *within* the `AssetLoader` and validate its internal structure.  This is *crucial* and Bevy-specific.  Examples:
        *   **Meshes (`.gltf`, etc.):**
            *   Check vertex counts against reasonable limits.
            *   Validate indices to ensure they are within the bounds of the vertex data.
            *   Check bounding boxes for sanity.
            *   Verify that materials and textures referenced by the mesh are also valid.
        *   **Textures (`.png`, `.dds`, etc.):**
            *   Check image dimensions against reasonable limits.
            *   Verify the pixel format is supported and appropriate.
            *   Check the number of mipmap levels.
        *   **Audio (`.ogg`, `.wav`, etc.):**
            *   Check the sample rate, bit depth, and channel count.
            *   Potentially analyze the audio data for anomalies (though this is more complex).
    5.  **Error Handling:**  If any validation step fails, return an appropriate `Err` value from the `load` function.  Bevy's asset system will handle this, preventing the corrupted asset from being used.
    6.  **Sandboxing (Advanced):**  For extremely high-security scenarios, consider loading assets in a separate, sandboxed process.  This is *not* a built-in Bevy feature, but you could potentially use a separate Rust process and communicate with it via IPC (Inter-Process Communication). This isolates any potential vulnerabilities in the asset loading code.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Code Injection via Malformed Assets (Severity: High to Critical):**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in asset parsing libraries (which Bevy uses internally) can lead to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Malformed Assets (Severity: Medium to High):**  Assets designed to cause crashes or excessive resource consumption.
    *   **Data Corruption via Malformed Assets (Severity: Medium to High):**  Invalid asset data can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **All Threats:** Risk significantly reduced by thorough asset validation within Bevy's asset loading pipeline.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   (Hypothetical) Basic file extension checks are performed.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   (Hypothetical) No header/magic number checks.
    *   (Hypothetical) No internal structure validation for meshes, textures, or audio.
    *   (Hypothetical) No sandboxing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Deserialization of Bevy Resources and Components](./mitigation_strategies/secure_deserialization_of_bevy_resources_and_components.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:**  Use `serde` safely and validate deserialized Bevy data.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **`serde` Configuration:** When using `serde` with Bevy (e.g., for save files, network messages containing Bevy components, or custom resource serialization), configure `serde` appropriately:
        *   Use `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]` on your structs and enums to prevent deserialization of unexpected data. This is a *critical* `serde` feature for security.
        *   Consider using `#[serde(rename_all = "...")]` to enforce a consistent naming convention and prevent potential issues with case sensitivity or special characters.
        *   If you have fields that should not be serialized/deserialized, use `#[serde(skip)]`.
    2.  **Post-Deserialization Validation:**  *After* deserializing Bevy resources or components using `serde`, perform additional validation:
        *   **Range Checks:**  Ensure that numerical values (e.g., positions, rotations, scales) are within reasonable bounds.
        *   **Enum Validation:**  If you have enums, verify that the deserialized values are valid enum variants.
        *   **Relationship Validation:**  If you have relationships between components (e.g., parent-child relationships), check that those relationships are valid.
        *   **Custom Validation Logic:**  Implement any other custom validation logic specific to your game's data.
    3.  **Bevy's `Reflect` Trait (Advanced):** Bevy's `Reflect` trait (which is often used with `serde`) provides some introspection capabilities. You *could* potentially use this to perform more generic validation, but this is more complex and requires careful consideration.
    4. **Avoid Untrusted Sources:** If at all possible, avoid deserializing Bevy resources or components from completely untrusted sources.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities (Severity: High to Critical):**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in `serde` or other deserialization libraries can lead to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Data Corruption (Severity: Medium to High):**  Invalid deserialized data can corrupt game state or lead to unexpected behavior.
    *   **Logic Errors (Severity: Medium):** Deserialized data that violates game logic constraints.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **All Threats:** Risk significantly reduced by using `serde` securely and performing post-deserialization validation.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   (Hypothetical) `serde` is used for save file serialization, but `deny_unknown_fields` is *not* used.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   (Hypothetical) No post-deserialization validation is performed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Plugin Vetting and Management (Bevy Plugins)](./mitigation_strategies/plugin_vetting_and_management__bevy_plugins_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:**  Thoroughly vet and manage third-party Bevy plugins. This is *directly* related to Bevy's plugin system.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Source Verification:**  Only use Bevy plugins from trusted sources (e.g., the official Bevy organization on GitHub, well-known community members).
    2.  **Code Review:**  Before adding a plugin, *carefully* review its source code.  Look for:
        *   Use of `unsafe` code (and how it's used).
        *   Input validation and sanitization practices.
        *   Dependencies (and vet those dependencies as well).
        *   Overall code quality and security best practices.
    3.  **Dependency Management:**  Treat plugin dependencies just like any other crate dependency (see general dependency management strategies). Use `cargo audit` and `cargo deny`.
    4.  **Regular Updates:**  Keep plugins updated to the latest versions to receive security fixes.
    5.  **Minimal Permissions (for your own plugins):** If you develop your *own* Bevy plugins, design them with the principle of least privilege.  Only access the Bevy resources and systems that the plugin absolutely needs.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Plugins (Severity: High to Critical):**  Plugins can introduce any type of vulnerability (memory corruption, code injection, etc.).
    *   **Malicious Plugins (Severity: High to Critical):**  A malicious plugin could intentionally compromise your application.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **All Threats:** Risk reduced by careful plugin selection, code review, and updates.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   (Hypothetical) No third-party plugins are currently used.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   (Hypothetical) No formal policy or procedure for evaluating and managing Bevy plugins.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Review Bevy's `unsafe` Usage (Advanced, Bevy-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/review_bevy's__unsafe__usage__advanced__bevy-specific_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Audit Bevy's own use of `unsafe` code (for high-security applications).

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify `unsafe` Blocks:** Use tools like `grep` or `rg` to find all instances of `unsafe` in the Bevy source code.
    2.  **Prioritize Critical Areas:** Focus on areas of Bevy's codebase that are most likely to be security-relevant:
        *   **Asset Loading:**  The code that handles loading and parsing assets.
        *   **Rendering:**  The code that interacts with the graphics API.
        *   **Networking:**  If you're using Bevy's networking features (or a third-party networking plugin).
        *   **ECS (Entity Component System):**  The core of Bevy's architecture.
    3.  **Understand the Code:**  Carefully analyze each `unsafe` block to understand:
        *   Why `unsafe` is being used.
        *   The assumptions and invariants.
        *   The potential consequences of violating those invariants.
    4.  **Look for Potential Issues:**  Look for common `unsafe` code errors, such as:
        *   Incorrect pointer arithmetic.
        *   Dangling pointers.
        *   Use-after-free errors.
        *   Data races.
    5.  **Report Issues:**  If you find any potential vulnerabilities, report them responsibly to the Bevy developers.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities in Bevy (Severity: High to Critical):**  Bugs in Bevy's `unsafe` code could be exploited.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities in Bevy:** Risk reduced by identifying and reporting potential vulnerabilities. This is a proactive measure.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   N/A (This is an advanced, optional strategy).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   N/A
