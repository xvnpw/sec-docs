# Threat Model Analysis for bevyengine/bevy

## Threat: [Threat 1: Exploitation of a Deserialization Vulnerability in `bevy_reflect`](./threats/threat_1_exploitation_of_a_deserialization_vulnerability_in__bevy_reflect_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious serialized data payload (e.g., a scene file, a saved game, or data received over the network *if* `bevy_reflect` is used for serialization there) that, when deserialized by Bevy's reflection system (`bevy_reflect`), triggers unintended code execution. This often involves exploiting type confusion or unsafe code within the deserialization process.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Critical:** Arbitrary code execution on the client (if client-side) or server (if server-side). Complete control over the application.
        *   Data breach: Potential for sensitive data theft.
        *   Denial of service: Application crash.
    *   **Bevy Component Affected:** `bevy_reflect` crate, specifically the deserialization functionality. This could also involve custom `Reflect` implementations in user code or third-party crates *if* those are used with Bevy's systems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid using `bevy_reflect` for untrusted data:**  Prioritize using a more secure serialization format (e.g., a binary format with a well-defined schema and robust parser) for data from untrusted sources.
        *   **Validate deserialized data:**  Thoroughly validate the deserialized data *after* deserialization, even if using `bevy_reflect`, to ensure it meets expected constraints. Check for unexpected types, out-of-bounds values, etc.
        *   **Use a "safe" subset of `bevy_reflect` (if available):**  Look for future Bevy versions that might offer a restricted, security-hardened subset of `bevy_reflect` for deserialization.
        *   **Regularly update Bevy:**  Stay current with Bevy releases to get any security fixes related to `bevy_reflect`.
        *   **Fuzz testing:**  Employ fuzzing to test `bevy_reflect` deserialization with various inputs to find potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Threat 2: Resource Exhaustion via Malicious Asset Loading](./threats/threat_2_resource_exhaustion_via_malicious_asset_loading.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted asset file (e.g., a model with an extremely high polygon count, a texture with an enormous resolution, or an audio file with an excessively long duration) designed to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, GPU) when loaded by Bevy, leading to a denial of service.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **High:** Application becomes unresponsive or crashes. Other applications on the system might be affected.
        *   Denial of service.
    *   **Bevy Component Affected:** Asset loading pipeline (`bevy_asset`), including specific asset loaders (e.g., `gltf` loader, image loaders that are part of the Bevy ecosystem).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Impose limits on asset size and complexity:**  Set maximum limits on polygon counts, texture resolutions, audio durations, etc. Reject assets exceeding these limits.
        *   **Validate asset metadata *before* loading:**  Check asset metadata (if available) to determine size and complexity *before* loading the full data.
        *   **Use asynchronous asset loading:**  Load assets in the background to avoid blocking the main thread. Implement timeouts to prevent indefinite loading.
        *   **Resource monitoring:**  Monitor resource usage during asset loading and take action (abort, log) if excessive consumption is detected.
        *   **Progressive loading:**  For large assets, consider progressive loading (e.g., lower-resolution versions first) to improve user experience and mitigate malicious asset impact.

## Threat: [Threat 3: Denial of Service via Excessive Entity Spawning](./threats/threat_3_denial_of_service_via_excessive_entity_spawning.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker triggers the creation of a very large number of entities, exceeding the application's capacity and causing a denial of service.  This could be through a vulnerability in game logic or by exploiting a network protocol *if* that protocol is handled within Bevy's ECS.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **High:** Application becomes unresponsive or crashes due to excessive memory or CPU usage.
    *   **Bevy Component Affected:** ECS (`bevy_ecs`), specifically entity creation and management.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Limit the number of entities:**  Set a limit on the total number of entities.
        *   **Limit entity spawning rate:**  Restrict the rate at which new entities can be created.
        *   **Resource monitoring:**  Monitor entity count and take action (log, stop accepting new entities) if the limit is approached/exceeded.
        *   **Network input validation (if applicable):**  If entity creation is triggered by network input *and* that input is handled within Bevy's systems, validate the input to prevent malicious entity spawning.

## Threat: [Threat 4: Vulnerability in a Third-Party Bevy Plugin (High-Impact)](./threats/threat_4_vulnerability_in_a_third-party_bevy_plugin__high-impact_.md)

* **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a *critical* third-party Bevy plugin (e.g., a physics engine integration tightly coupled with Bevy's ECS, a networking library wrapper *directly* interacting with Bevy's systems). The vulnerability could be in the plugin's Rust code or a native library it uses. *This is only high/critical if the plugin has deep integration with Bevy's core systems.*
    * **Impact:**
        * **High to Critical:** Depends on the plugin and vulnerability. Could range from significant logic errors to arbitrary code execution *if* the plugin has sufficient privileges within the Bevy context.
    * **Bevy Component Affected:** The specific third-party plugin *and* potentially the Bevy components it interacts with (e.g., `bevy_ecs`, `bevy_asset`).
    * **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the plugin's role)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Carefully vet plugins:** Before using a third-party plugin, thoroughly research its reputation, review its source code (if available), and check for known vulnerabilities. *Prioritize plugins with a strong security focus.*
        * **Use well-maintained plugins:** Choose plugins that are actively maintained and have a history of addressing security issues promptly.
        * **Regularly update plugins:** Keep plugins up-to-date to get security fixes.
        * **Isolate plugins (if feasible):** Consider running plugins in separate threads or processes to limit the impact of a compromised plugin. This is advanced but provides stronger isolation.
        * **Report vulnerabilities:** If you find a vulnerability, report it to the plugin maintainer.
