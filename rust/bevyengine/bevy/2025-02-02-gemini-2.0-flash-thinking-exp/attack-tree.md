## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Bevy Engine Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_bevy_engine_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting memory safety bugs within Bevy's core engine, potentially in `unsafe` Rust code or FFI interactions.
        *   **Malicious Asset (Model, Texture, Scene):** Crafting malicious assets to trigger buffer overflows or other memory corruption issues during asset loading and parsing.
        *   **Crafted Network Message:** Sending malformed network packets to networked Bevy applications to exploit buffer overflows in network handling code.
        *   **Malicious Shader Code:** Injecting malicious shader code (if custom shaders are used) to cause memory corruption during shader compilation or execution.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion:** Overloading the Bevy application by exploiting resource-intensive features.
        *   **Send Excessive Number of Entities/Components:** Flooding the application with a massive number of entities and components to exhaust memory or processing power.
        *   **Load Extremely Complex Assets:** Loading excessively complex assets (models, scenes) to overwhelm asset loading and rendering pipelines.
        *   **Trigger Computationally Expensive Physics or Rendering Scenarios:** Manipulating game logic or input to create computationally intensive physics simulations or rendering tasks, leading to performance degradation or crashes.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Bevy Ecosystem/Plugin Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_bevy_ecosystemplugin_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Vulnerable Bevy Plugins:** Exploiting vulnerabilities within Bevy plugins used by the application.
        *   **Leverage Known Vulnerability in Plugin:** Utilizing publicly known vulnerabilities in outdated or poorly maintained plugins.
        *   **Plugin Dependency Analysis (Crate versions, known vulnerabilities):** Identifying vulnerable plugins by analyzing their dependencies and known vulnerabilities in those dependencies.
    *   **Dependency Vulnerabilities in Bevy or Plugins:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Rust crates that Bevy or its plugins depend on.
        *   **Leverage Known Vulnerability in Dependency:** Utilizing publicly known vulnerabilities in outdated dependencies of Bevy or its plugins.
        *   **Dependency Scanning Tools (cargo audit, etc.):** Identifying vulnerable dependencies using automated scanning tools like `cargo audit`.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Asset Loading/Handling Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_asset_loadinghandling_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Malicious Asset Injection:** Injecting malicious assets into the application's asset loading pipeline.
        *   **Replace Legitimate Asset with Malicious Asset:** Replacing existing, legitimate assets with crafted malicious ones to be loaded by the application.
        *   **Introduce New Malicious Asset into Asset Loading Path:** Adding new malicious assets to directories or paths where the application loads assets from.
    *   **Asset Parsing Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the code that parses asset files (images, models, scenes).
        *   **Craft Malicious Asset to Exploit Parsing Logic (Buffer Overflows, Integer Overflows, etc.):** Creating specially crafted asset files designed to trigger buffer overflows, integer overflows, or other parsing errors that can lead to memory corruption or code execution.
