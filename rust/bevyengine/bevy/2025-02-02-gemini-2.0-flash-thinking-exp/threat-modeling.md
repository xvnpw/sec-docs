# Threat Model Analysis for bevyengine/bevy

## Threat: [ECS Data Corruption](./threats/ecs_data_corruption.md)

- **Description:** An attacker, through malicious code or exploiting a vulnerability, directly modifies data within Bevy's Entity Component System (ECS). This involves changing component values, adding or removing components in unauthorized ways, or creating inconsistent entity states. This directly manipulates the core game logic and data structures managed by Bevy.
- **Impact:** Game logic errors, unexpected behavior, crashes, unfair advantages in games (cheating), potential for further exploitation.
- **Bevy Component Affected:** `bevy_ecs` (component data storage and access within systems).
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all data that influences ECS state.
    - Design systems with clear responsibilities and data access boundaries to minimize unintended data modification.
    - Utilize Bevy's type system and ownership rules to enforce data integrity within the ECS.
    - Consider adding data validation checks within systems to detect and handle corrupted data at runtime.

## Threat: [Shader Vulnerabilities](./threats/shader_vulnerabilities.md)

- **Description:** If the application allows loading or using custom shaders, an attacker can inject malicious shaders that exploit vulnerabilities in the graphics driver or Bevy's shader handling. These shaders could cause crashes, denial of service by consuming excessive GPU resources, or potentially exploit deeper system vulnerabilities through the graphics pipeline. This directly leverages Bevy's rendering capabilities.
- **Impact:** Application crashes, denial of service, potential GPU driver instability, system instability in severe cases, potentially wider system compromise if driver vulnerabilities are severe.
- **Bevy Component Affected:** `bevy_render` (shader loading, processing, and GPU interaction).
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Avoid allowing user-provided shaders if possible.
    - If user shaders are necessary, implement strict validation and sanitization processes before shader compilation and loading.
    - Use shader compilers and validation tools to detect potentially malicious or problematic shader code.
    - Run shaders in a sandboxed environment or with restricted permissions if feasible to limit potential damage.
    - Regularly update graphics drivers to patch known vulnerabilities that malicious shaders might exploit.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Bevy Plugins](./threats/vulnerable_bevy_plugins.md)

- **Description:** Using third-party Bevy plugins introduces external code that could contain vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities within Bevy plugins can directly compromise the application as plugins have access to Bevy's core systems and data. Exploiting a plugin vulnerability can lead to a wide range of attacks due to the plugin's integration within the Bevy application.
- **Impact:** Wide range of potential impacts depending on the plugin vulnerability, including code execution within the Bevy application context, data breaches, denial of service, and game logic exploits.
- **Bevy Component Affected:** Bevy Plugin system (`bevy_app`), and any Bevy module or crate the vulnerable plugin interacts with.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Carefully vet and audit third-party plugins before use, examining code quality, security practices, and community reputation.
    - Keep plugins updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    - Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in plugin dependencies (crates used by the plugin).
    - Isolate plugin functionality if possible using Bevy's module system or by limiting plugin permissions to restrict potential damage.
    - Minimize the number of plugins used and prioritize plugins from trusted and reputable sources with active maintenance and security awareness.

## Threat: [Bevy Networking Vulnerabilities (if used)](./threats/bevy_networking_vulnerabilities__if_used_.md)

- **Description:** If the application utilizes Bevy's networking features or integrates external networking libraries within Bevy, vulnerabilities in these networking components can be exploited. This is specific to Bevy applications that implement networking and directly relates to how Bevy handles network communication. Exploiting these vulnerabilities can compromise game state, user data, or even the application server.
- **Impact:** Data breaches through network traffic interception or manipulation, denial of service attacks targeting network services, remote code execution on server or client depending on the vulnerability, cheating and unfair advantages in networked games, unauthorized access to game servers or client data.
- **Bevy Component Affected:** `bevy_networking` (if used), or external networking crates integrated with Bevy (e.g., `renet`, `leafwing-input-manager` networking features).
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Use secure networking protocols (e.g., TLS/SSL, WebSockets with encryption) for all network communication within the Bevy application.
    - Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to network resources and game servers.
    - Validate and sanitize all network data received and sent to prevent injection attacks and data corruption.
    - Regularly update networking libraries and Bevy itself to patch known vulnerabilities in networking components.
    - Follow secure coding practices for networking applications, including input validation, output encoding, and secure configuration of network services.
    - Perform penetration testing and security audits specifically targeting the networking aspects of the Bevy application to identify potential vulnerabilities.
