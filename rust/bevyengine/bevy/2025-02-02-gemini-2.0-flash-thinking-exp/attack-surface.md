# Attack Surface Analysis for bevyengine/bevy

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Plugins](./attack_surfaces/malicious_plugins.md)

*   **Description:**  Plugins from untrusted sources containing malicious code that can compromise the application.
    *   **Bevy Contribution:** Bevy's plugin system is a core feature designed for extensibility.  It inherently allows external code to be loaded and executed within the application's context, making it a direct entry point for malicious code if plugins are not carefully managed.
    *   **Example:** A plugin downloaded from an unofficial forum, intended to add "cool visual effects," instead contains code that steals user credentials stored by the application or installs a persistent backdoor on the user's system.
    *   **Impact:** Code Execution, Data Exfiltration, Backdoors, Full System Compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Plugin Source Control:**  **Crucially**, only use plugins from highly trusted and officially verified sources.  Prefer plugins from the official Bevy asset store or repositories with strong community vetting and developer reputation.
        *   **Mandatory Plugin Vetting and Auditing:** Implement a rigorous process for vetting and auditing plugin code before integration. This should include code review, static analysis, and potentially dynamic analysis in a sandboxed environment.
        *   **Dependency Lockdown and Review:**  Thoroughly review and lock down plugin dependencies. Ensure all plugin dependencies are also from trusted sources and are regularly updated and audited.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Plugins (Advanced):** Explore and implement mechanisms to restrict plugin permissions and capabilities.  Investigate if Bevy or Rust's features can be leveraged to sandbox plugin execution (this is a complex area and may require significant effort).
        *   **User Education:** If end-users can install plugins, provide clear warnings and guidelines about the risks of installing untrusted plugins.

## Attack Surface: [Bevy Engine Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/bevy_engine_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Undiscovered or unpatched vulnerabilities within the Bevy Engine core itself.
    *   **Bevy Contribution:** As the foundation of the application, vulnerabilities in Bevy Engine directly impact all applications built upon it.  The complexity of a game engine like Bevy means vulnerabilities are possible, especially in a relatively young and actively developed engine.
    *   **Example:** A heap buffer overflow vulnerability is discovered in Bevy's ECS system. An attacker crafts a specific game scenario or asset that triggers this overflow, leading to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine when they run the Bevy application.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), Code Execution, Undefined Behavior, Full System Compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the nature and exploitability of the vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Aggressive Bevy Updates:** **Critically**, always use the latest stable version of Bevy Engine.  Monitor Bevy's release notes and security advisories closely and update immediately when new versions are released.
        *   **Proactive Vulnerability Monitoring:**  Actively monitor security channels and vulnerability databases for reports related to Bevy Engine and its dependencies.
        *   **Community Participation and Reporting:** Encourage internal security testing and participate in the Bevy community to report any potential security issues or unexpected behavior observed during development.
        *   **Consider Beta/Nightly Builds with Caution (for advanced users):** While stable releases are recommended for production, in development, occasionally testing with beta or nightly builds (in a controlled environment) can help identify and report issues upstream, contributing to overall Bevy security, but use with caution due to instability risks.
