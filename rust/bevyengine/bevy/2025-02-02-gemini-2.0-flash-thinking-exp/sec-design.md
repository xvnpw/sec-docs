# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a free, open-source, and community-driven game engine.
  - Offer a performant and modular engine for game development.
  - Foster a thriving ecosystem around the Bevy Engine.
  - Enable game developers to create high-quality games efficiently.
  - Promote the Rust programming language in game development.
- Business Risks:
  - Community trust erosion due to security vulnerabilities in the engine.
  - Negative impact on adoption if the engine is perceived as unstable or insecure.
  - Reputational damage if games built with Bevy are easily exploitable.
  - Risk of malicious contributions to the open-source project compromising the engine.
  - Dependence on volunteer contributors and maintainers for security upkeep.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Code reviews are conducted by maintainers for pull requests (described in GitHub repository contribution guidelines).
  - security control: Automated testing is in place, including unit and integration tests (evident from GitHub Actions workflows).
  - security control: Dependency management using Cargo, Rust's package manager, which includes vulnerability scanning (crates.io and Cargo features).
  - security control: Open-source nature of the project allows for community security audits and vulnerability reporting (implicit in open-source model).
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions, which may introduce vulnerabilities.
  - accepted risk: Limited resources dedicated specifically to dedicated security audits.
  - accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement static application security testing (SAST) tools in the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect potential vulnerabilities in code changes.
  - security control: Introduce dependency scanning tools that specifically check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies and alert maintainers.
  - security control: Establish a clear vulnerability reporting and response process, including a security policy and contact information.
  - security control: Conduct periodic security audits, potentially engaging external security experts, especially before major releases.
  - security control: Implement fuzz testing to identify potential crash bugs and vulnerabilities in input handling and parsing.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: No direct user authentication is required within the Bevy Engine itself, as it is a development library.
    - Requirement: Authentication is relevant for contributors to the project via GitHub accounts.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Authorization is managed by GitHub's role-based access control for repository contributors and maintainers.
    - Requirement: Within the engine, ensure proper authorization mechanisms are in place if features are added that require access control (currently not a primary concern for a game engine library).
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Implement robust input validation for all external data sources processed by the engine, such as asset files, configuration files, and network inputs (if networking features are added).
    - Requirement: Sanitize user-provided data within game code examples and tutorials to prevent common vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS) if web-based demos are provided.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Use cryptography appropriately for features that require it, such as secure networking (if implemented) or secure storage of sensitive game data (though this is typically the game developer's responsibility, the engine should provide secure primitives if needed).
    - Requirement: Ensure proper handling of cryptographic keys and avoid hardcoding secrets in the engine's codebase.

## DEPLOYMENT

Bevy Engine itself is not "deployed" in the traditional sense of a web application or service. Instead, it is a library that game developers use to build their games. The "deployment" context here refers to how games built with Bevy Engine are deployed to end-users.

Deployment Options for Games Built with Bevy:

1. Native Desktop Applications (Windows, macOS, Linux): Games are compiled into platform-specific executables and distributed directly to users (e.g., via game stores, direct download).
2. Web Applications (WebAssembly): Games are compiled to WebAssembly and deployed as web applications, playable in web browsers.
3. Mobile Applications (Android, iOS): (Less common currently, but potentially future target) Games could be compiled for mobile platforms and deployed via app stores.

Detailed Deployment Architecture (Native Desktop Application - Example):

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes to Protect:
  - Maintaining the integrity and security of the Bevy Engine codebase.
  - Ensuring the availability and reliability of Bevy Engine crates on Crates.io.
  - Preserving community trust in the Bevy Engine project.
  - Protecting the reputation of the Bevy Engine as a secure and stable game engine.
- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Source Code: Highly sensitive. Confidentiality and integrity are critical to prevent unauthorized access, modification, or leakage of engine source code.
  - Build Artifacts (Crates, Documentation, Examples): Sensitive. Integrity is crucial to prevent supply chain attacks and ensure users download and use genuine, untampered artifacts.
  - Community Data (Issues, Discussions, Contributions): Moderately sensitive. Integrity and availability are important for maintaining a healthy and collaborative community.
  - User Game Projects: Low sensitivity from Bevy Engine's perspective (game developers are responsible for their own project data). However, vulnerabilities in Bevy could indirectly impact the security of user projects.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What is the target risk appetite for the Bevy Engine project? (e.g., startup vs. Fortune 500 context).
  - Are there any specific compliance requirements or security standards that Bevy Engine needs to adhere to?
  - Are there any known past security incidents or vulnerabilities related to Bevy Engine or similar game engines that should be considered?
  - What is the process for handling vulnerability reports from the community?
  - Is there a dedicated security team or individual responsible for security within the Bevy Engine project?
- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to provide a secure and reliable open-source game engine to the community. Security is important for adoption and community trust.
  - SECURITY POSTURE: Current security controls are primarily based on standard open-source development practices (code reviews, testing). There is room for improvement in proactive security measures like SAST and dependency scanning.
  - DESIGN: The design is modular and crate-based, which allows for some level of isolation between components. The build process is automated using GitHub Actions, providing a good foundation for implementing CI/CD security controls.
  - The threat model will primarily focus on risks related to code vulnerabilities, supply chain security, and community contributions, rather than traditional application security concerns like user data protection or authentication within the engine itself.
