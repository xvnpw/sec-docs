# Threat Model Analysis for bevyengine/bevy

## Threat: [Malicious Asset Exploiting Image Loading Vulnerability](./threats/malicious_asset_exploiting_image_loading_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a specially designed image file (e.g., PNG, JPEG) that, when loaded by Bevy's asset loading system, triggers a vulnerability in the image decoding library or Bevy's handling of image data. This could involve overflowing buffers, causing out-of-bounds reads, or triggering other memory safety issues.

**Impact:** Denial of service (application crash), potentially arbitrary code execution if the vulnerability allows overwriting executable memory.

**Affected Bevy Component:** `bevy_asset` module, specifically the image loaders within `bevy_render::texture`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update Bevy and its image decoding dependencies (e.g., `image`, `png-rs`, `jpeg-decoder`).
*   Consider using alternative, more robust image decoding libraries if available and compatible with Bevy.
*   Implement content security policies or validation checks on assets loaded from untrusted sources.
*   Explore sandboxing asset loading processes if feasible.

## Threat: [Malicious Asset Exploiting Model Loading Vulnerability](./threats/malicious_asset_exploiting_model_loading_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a crafted 3D model file (e.g., glTF, OBJ) that exploits a vulnerability in Bevy's model loading process. This could involve malformed mesh data, excessive vertex counts, or other issues that lead to crashes or resource exhaustion.

**Impact:** Denial of service (application freeze or crash), potentially arbitrary code execution if the vulnerability allows memory corruption during model parsing.

**Affected Bevy Component:** `bevy_asset` module, specifically the model loaders within `bevy_scene` and potentially `bevy_render::mesh`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update Bevy and its model loading dependencies (e.g., `gltf`, `obj`).
*   Implement validation checks on loaded model data, such as limits on vertex counts, triangle counts, and bone counts.
*   Consider using a separate process or thread for model loading to isolate potential crashes.
*   Sanitize or preprocess models from untrusted sources.

## Threat: [Component Data Manipulation via External Plugin](./threats/component_data_manipulation_via_external_plugin.md)

**Description:** A malicious or compromised external plugin gains access to the application's ECS and directly modifies component data in unintended ways, bypassing intended game logic or validation.

**Impact:** Game-breaking bugs, unfair advantages in multiplayer scenarios, corruption of game state, or denial of service if critical components are manipulated.

**Affected Bevy Component:** `bevy_ecs` module, specifically the mechanisms for accessing and modifying component data. `bevy_app` for plugin management.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Only load plugins from trusted sources.
*   Implement clear boundaries and access control for component data modification within the main application and plugins.
*   Use events or messages for controlled state changes instead of direct component manipulation where possible.
*   Consider implementing a plugin sandboxing mechanism to limit the capabilities of external plugins.

## Threat: [Malicious Plugin Loading Leading to Arbitrary Code Execution](./threats/malicious_plugin_loading_leading_to_arbitrary_code_execution.md)

**Description:** The application allows loading external plugins without proper verification or sandboxing. An attacker provides a malicious plugin containing arbitrary code that is executed within the application's process.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the application and potentially the user's system, including data theft, malware installation, and remote control.

**Affected Bevy Component:** `bevy_app` module, specifically the plugin loading mechanisms.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Only load plugins from trusted and verified sources.
*   Implement a plugin sandboxing mechanism to restrict the capabilities of loaded plugins (e.g., limiting access to system resources, network access).
*   Require plugins to have digital signatures for verification.
*   Carefully review the code of any external plugins before use.

## Threat: [Unsafe Rust Usage Leading to Memory Corruption](./threats/unsafe_rust_usage_leading_to_memory_corruption.md)

**Description:** While Rust provides memory safety, the use of `unsafe` blocks can introduce vulnerabilities if not handled correctly. Bugs in `unsafe` code can lead to memory corruption, such as buffer overflows or use-after-free errors.

**Impact:** Denial of service (crashes), potentially arbitrary code execution if the memory corruption can be controlled by an attacker.

**Affected Bevy Component:** Any part of Bevy's codebase that uses `unsafe` blocks.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Minimize the use of `unsafe` code.
*   Thoroughly audit any `unsafe` code blocks for potential memory safety issues.
*   Use memory sanitizers (e.g., AddressSanitizer, MemorySanitizer) during development and testing to detect memory errors.
