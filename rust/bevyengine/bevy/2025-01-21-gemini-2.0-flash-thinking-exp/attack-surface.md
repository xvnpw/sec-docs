# Attack Surface Analysis for bevyengine/bevy

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Asset Loading](./attack_surfaces/malicious_asset_loading.md)

**Description:** The application loads external assets (images, models, audio, scenes) that could be crafted to exploit vulnerabilities within Bevy's asset loading pipeline or its underlying asset processing libraries.

**How Bevy Contributes:** Bevy's `AssetServer` and its mechanisms for loading and managing various asset types directly facilitate the loading of these external files. Bevy relies on external libraries for decoding and processing these assets, and vulnerabilities in these libraries become part of Bevy's attack surface.

**Example:** A specially crafted PNG image could exploit a buffer overflow in the image decoding library used by Bevy, potentially leading to remote code execution. A malicious GLTF model could contain excessively complex geometry causing resource exhaustion and a denial of service.

**Impact:** Denial of service (crashes, freezes), potentially remote code execution, information disclosure (if the exploit allows reading memory).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Validate Asset Sources:**  Load assets exclusively from trusted and verified sources.
*   **Input Sanitization (Asset Paths):** If user input influences asset paths, rigorously sanitize these inputs to prevent path traversal attacks.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP) for WebGL:** When targeting WebGL, implement a strict CSP to control the origins from which assets can be loaded.
*   **Regular Dependency Updates:** Keep Bevy and its dependency crates (especially image decoders, model loaders) updated to benefit from security patches.
*   **Sandboxing:** Consider running the application in a sandboxed environment to limit the potential damage from a successful exploit.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Plugin Injection](./attack_surfaces/malicious_plugin_injection.md)

**Description:** The application loads and executes external plugins that contain malicious code, leveraging Bevy's plugin system.

**How Bevy Contributes:** Bevy's plugin system, using `App::add_plugins()`, is the direct mechanism for integrating external code and extending the engine's functionality. This inherently introduces the risk of loading untrusted code.

**Example:** A malicious plugin could register systems that access sensitive game data, manipulate the game state in unauthorized ways, or even execute arbitrary system commands on the user's machine.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the application, potentially compromising the user's system, data theft, unauthorized actions.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Only Load Trusted Plugins:**  Strictly control the source of plugins, only loading those from highly reputable and thoroughly vetted developers or sources.
*   **Plugin Sandboxing (Future Consideration):** Explore and advocate for potential sandboxing mechanisms for Bevy plugins within the Rust ecosystem.
*   **Code Review:** If feasible, conduct thorough code reviews of plugin source code before integration.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Design the application architecture to minimize the permissions and access granted to plugins.
