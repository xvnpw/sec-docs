# Threat Model Analysis for bevyengine/bevy

## Threat: [Memory Corruption via Malicious Assets](./threats/memory_corruption_via_malicious_assets.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious asset file (e.g., image, model, audio) that, when loaded by the Bevy application, exploits a vulnerability in **Bevy's** asset loading or processing code. This could involve triggering buffer overflows, use-after-free errors, or other memory safety issues within **Bevy's** codebase. The attacker might provide this asset through in-game content loading, modding systems, or even as part of the initial game download if the distribution channel is compromised.
*   **Impact:**  Memory corruption can lead to application crashes, denial of service, or, in more severe cases, arbitrary code execution on the user's machine, potentially allowing the attacker to gain control of the system.
*   **Affected Bevy Component:** `bevy_asset` module, specific asset loaders (e.g., image loaders in `bevy_render::texture`), mesh loaders in `bevy_render::mesh`.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all loaded asset data within **Bevy's** asset loading systems.
    *   Utilize memory-safe parsing libraries for asset formats within **Bevy**.
    *   Implement robust error handling during asset loading in **Bevy** to prevent crashes.
    *   Consider sandboxing or isolating the asset loading process within the application's design.
    *   Regularly update Bevy to benefit from security patches.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Excessive Resource Consumption](./threats/denial_of_service_via_excessive_resource_consumption.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates the game state or provides input that causes the **Bevy** application to consume excessive system resources (CPU, memory, GPU) due to inefficiencies or vulnerabilities within **Bevy's** core systems. This could involve creating a large number of entities through **Bevy's** ECS, loading extremely large assets using **Bevy's** asset loading, or triggering computationally expensive operations within **Bevy's** rendering pipeline. The attacker might achieve this through in-game actions, network messages (if networking is used), or by exploiting flaws in game logic interacting with **Bevy** components.
*   **Impact:** The application becomes unresponsive or crashes, effectively denying service to legitimate users. This can frustrate players and damage the application's reputation.
*   **Affected Bevy Component:** `bevy_ecs` (entity creation and management), `bevy_asset` (asset loading), `bevy_render` (rendering pipeline), game-specific systems interacting heavily with Bevy.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement resource limits and throttling mechanisms within the application's logic when interacting with **Bevy's** entity creation, asset loading, and other resource-intensive operations.
    *   Optimize game logic and rendering code that utilizes **Bevy** to minimize resource usage.
    *   Implement proper resource cleanup within systems that manage **Bevy** entities and assets.
    *   Monitor resource usage and detect anomalous behavior in relation to **Bevy's** systems.
    *   For networked applications, implement rate limiting and input validation on network messages that influence **Bevy's** state.

## Threat: [Exploitation of `unsafe` Code Blocks](./threats/exploitation_of__unsafe__code_blocks.md)

*   **Description:**  If the **Bevy** engine itself utilizes `unsafe` Rust code blocks, these sections bypass Rust's memory safety guarantees. An attacker could potentially exploit vulnerabilities within these `unsafe` blocks in **Bevy's** codebase, leading to memory corruption or other security issues. The vulnerability would reside within the specific `unsafe` block's logic within **Bevy**.
*   **Impact:** Similar to memory corruption via malicious assets, this can lead to crashes, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution.
*   **Affected Bevy Component:** Any module or function containing `unsafe` code blocks within the **Bevy** engine. This requires careful inspection of the **Bevy** codebase.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (if vulnerabilities exist)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Minimize the use of `unsafe` code within **Bevy** itself (this is primarily the responsibility of Bevy developers).
    *   Thoroughly audit and review all `unsafe` code blocks within **Bevy** for potential vulnerabilities (again, primarily Bevy developers).
    *   Provide clear justifications and safety invariants for each `unsafe` block within **Bevy**.
    *   Keep Bevy updated to benefit from security fixes in its `unsafe` code.

## Threat: [Shader Vulnerabilities Leading to GPU Crashes or Exploitation](./threats/shader_vulnerabilities_leading_to_gpu_crashes_or_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious shaders (GLSL or WGSL) that, when processed by the GPU through **Bevy's** rendering pipeline, trigger vulnerabilities in the graphics driver or the GPU itself due to how **Bevy** handles shader compilation and execution. This could involve exceeding resource limits, causing infinite loops, or exploiting driver bugs exposed through **Bevy's** rendering API usage. The attacker might introduce these shaders through custom materials, post-processing effects, or potentially through compromised asset files loaded by **Bevy**.
*   **Impact:**  Can lead to GPU crashes, system instability, or potentially even GPU-level code execution (though less common).
*   **Affected Bevy Component:** `bevy_render` module, specifically the shader compilation and rendering pipeline within **Bevy**.
*   **Risk Severity:** Medium to High (depending on the severity of the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Sanitize and validate shader code before compilation within **Bevy's** rendering system.
    *   Limit the complexity and resource usage of shaders used within the application, considering **Bevy's** rendering capabilities.
    *   Keep graphics drivers updated.
    *   Consider using a shader validation framework if integrated with **Bevy**.
    *   Report any identified shader-related crashes or issues to the Bevy developers and graphics driver vendors.
