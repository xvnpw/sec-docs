# Attack Surface Analysis for bevyengine/bevy

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Asset Loading](./attack_surfaces/malicious_asset_loading.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in asset loading processes (images, models, audio, etc.) through maliciously crafted files.
*   **How Bevy Contributes:** Bevy relies on external libraries for decoding various asset formats. Vulnerabilities in these underlying libraries are exposed through Bevy's asset loading API. Bevy's asset management might also lack sufficient validation or sandboxing.
*   **Example:** A specially crafted PNG image loaded by Bevy triggers a buffer overflow in the image decoding library, leading to a crash or potential remote code execution.
*   **Impact:** Application crash, denial of service, potential remote code execution if the underlying library vulnerability allows it.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Bevy and its dependencies (especially asset loading libraries) updated to the latest versions with security patches.
    *   Implement additional validation on loaded assets beyond what Bevy provides.
    *   Consider sandboxing asset loading processes if feasible.
    *   Avoid loading assets from untrusted sources without thorough inspection.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities Introduced by Bevy Plugins](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_introduced_by_bevy_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious or poorly written Bevy plugins introducing security flaws into the application.
*   **How Bevy Contributes:** Bevy's plugin system allows for extending engine functionality. Plugins have access to the same engine APIs and resources as the core application, potentially introducing vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** A third-party plugin directly interacts with the file system without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to read or write arbitrary files.
*   **Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the plugin's functionality, including data breaches, remote code execution, and application compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Only use plugins from trusted and reputable sources.
    *   Review the code of third-party plugins before integrating them.
    *   Utilize Bevy's plugin system features to limit plugin capabilities if possible.
    *   Regularly audit the plugins used in the application.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Network Message Handling (if using Bevy's Networking)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_network_message_handling__if_using_bevy's_networking_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in how the Bevy application handles network messages.
*   **How Bevy Contributes:** Bevy provides networking capabilities. If the application doesn't properly validate or sanitize incoming network data, it can be vulnerable to various attacks.
*   **Example:** A remote attacker sends a specially crafted network message that causes a buffer overflow in the message processing logic, leading to a crash or remote code execution.
*   **Impact:** Application crash, denial of service, remote code execution, data manipulation.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all incoming network data.
    *   Use secure network protocols (e.g., TLS).
    *   Avoid deserializing untrusted data directly without proper validation.
    *   Consider using established and well-vetted networking libraries alongside or instead of Bevy's built-in features if security is a primary concern.
