## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Bevy Application](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_bevy_application.md)

This represents the ultimate attacker goal. Success here means the attacker has achieved significant control or disruption of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit ECS (Entity Component System) Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_ecs__entity_component_system__weaknesses.md)

The ECS is the core data management system in Bevy. Compromising it can lead to manipulation of game state, logic, and potentially arbitrary code execution if vulnerabilities in component data handling are exploited.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Event Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_event_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

Event handling is a primary mechanism for communication and logic execution within Bevy. Exploiting vulnerabilities here allows attackers to influence the application's behavior by injecting, dropping, or modifying events.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Asset Loading/Management](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_asset_loadingmanagement.md)

Asset loading is a common entry point for external data. Vulnerabilities in asset loaders or the asset management system can allow attackers to introduce malicious code or consume excessive resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Plugin System (If Used)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_plugin_system__if_used_.md)

The plugin system allows for extending Bevy's functionality. If not secured, it provides a direct pathway for attackers to inject malicious code that runs with the application's privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Event Injection](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_event_injection.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker injects crafted events into the Bevy application's event queue.

**Mechanism:** This could exploit weaknesses in how event sources are validated or how the event queue is managed.

**Impact:**  Can trigger unintended game states, bypass security checks, or cause unexpected behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Event Flooding](./attack_tree_paths/event_flooding.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker floods the Bevy application's event queue with a large number of events.

**Mechanism:** This overwhelms the application's ability to process events, leading to resource exhaustion and denial of service.

**Impact:**  Causes the application to become unresponsive or crash.

## Attack Tree Path: [Load Malicious Assets](./attack_tree_paths/load_malicious_assets.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker provides specially crafted malicious assets (e.g., images, models) to the Bevy application.

**Mechanism:** Exploits vulnerabilities in the asset loading libraries (e.g., image parsing bugs) to execute arbitrary code or cause crashes when the asset is loaded.

**Impact:** Can lead to arbitrary code execution, crashes, or the introduction of harmful content into the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Resource Exhaustion via Asset Loading](./attack_tree_paths/resource_exhaustion_via_asset_loading.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker provides extremely large or numerous assets to the Bevy application.

**Mechanism:**  Forces the application to allocate excessive memory or other resources when loading these assets.

**Impact:** Leads to denial of service due to memory exhaustion or other resource limitations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Input Injection](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_input_injection.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker provides unexpected or malformed input to the Bevy application.

**Mechanism:** Exploits vulnerabilities in how input is processed and validated, leading to crashes or the triggering of unintended game logic.

**Impact:** Can cause the application to crash or allow the attacker to manipulate game state or gain unfair advantages.

## Attack Tree Path: [Load Malicious Plugins](./attack_tree_paths/load_malicious_plugins.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker loads a plugin containing malicious code into the Bevy application.

**Mechanism:** Exploits a lack of proper security checks or sandboxing in the plugin loading mechanism.

**Impact:** Grants the malicious plugin full control over the application, potentially leading to data theft, system compromise, or other malicious activities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Network Resource Exhaustion](./attack_tree_paths/network_resource_exhaustion.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker floods the Bevy application with a large number of network requests or connections.

**Mechanism:** Overwhelms the application's network handling capabilities, leading to resource exhaustion.

**Impact:** Causes denial of service, making the application unavailable to legitimate users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Load Malicious Assets](./attack_tree_paths/load_malicious_assets.md)

While the likelihood depends on specific vulnerabilities in asset loaders, the potential impact of arbitrary code execution makes this a high-risk area to monitor.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Input Injection](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_input_injection.md)

The likelihood depends on the robustness of input validation. However, the ease of attempting such attacks and the potential for crashes or logic errors make this a significant risk.
