## Mitigation Strategy: [Asset Validation within Bevy's Asset System](./mitigation_strategies/asset_validation_within_bevy's_asset_system.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Asset Validation within Bevy's Asset System

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Leverage Bevy's Asset Loading Pipeline:** Implement validation checks directly within Bevy's asset loading system. This can be done by creating custom asset loaders or modifying existing ones.
    2.  **File Type Verification using Bevy's Asset Format Detection:** Utilize Bevy's built-in asset format detection to verify file extensions before attempting to load assets. Ensure only expected file types are processed by the respective loaders.
    3.  **Size Limits within Asset Loaders:**  In custom asset loaders, add checks to enforce size limits on assets *before* they are fully loaded into memory by Bevy. This prevents Bevy from allocating excessive memory for potentially malicious assets.
    4.  **Format-Specific Checks in Custom Loaders:**  For custom asset loaders (e.g., for custom model formats), implement format-specific validation logic. Use Rust libraries within your loader to parse and validate asset data structures, ensuring they conform to expected schemas and constraints *before* Bevy uses them.
    5.  **Bevy's Error Handling for Asset Loading:** Utilize Bevy's built-in error handling mechanisms for asset loading. Ensure that asset loading failures are gracefully handled within Bevy systems, preventing application crashes and providing informative error messages through Bevy's logging system.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Assets from Untrusted Sources (High Severity):** Attackers can inject malicious code or data through crafted assets that Bevy's asset system attempts to load.
    *   **Denial of Service through Asset Manipulation (Medium Severity):**  Maliciously large or complex assets can exhaust resources when loaded by Bevy's asset system, leading to DoS.
    *   **Decompression Bombs (Medium Severity):** Specially crafted compressed images loaded through Bevy's image loaders can consume excessive resources during decompression, leading to DoS.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Assets from Untrusted Sources (High Risk Reduction):** Significantly reduces the risk by preventing Bevy from processing potentially harmful files through its asset pipeline.
    *   **Denial of Service through Asset Manipulation (Medium Risk Reduction):** Reduces the risk by limiting the impact of excessively large or complex assets on Bevy's resource usage.
    *   **Decompression Bombs (Medium Risk Reduction):** Reduces the risk by preventing resource exhaustion during image decompression within Bevy's image loading process.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Bevy's default asset loaders provide basic file type handling.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Size limits and format-specific checks within Bevy's asset loaders are missing. Decompression bomb prevention within Bevy's image loading needs to be implemented. More robust error handling within Bevy systems that rely on asset loading is needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Path Handling using Bevy's Asset Keys](./mitigation_strategies/strict_path_handling_using_bevy's_asset_keys.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Strict Path Handling using Bevy's Asset Keys

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enforce Bevy Asset Key System:**  Strictly adhere to Bevy's asset key system for all asset loading. Avoid direct file path manipulation within Bevy systems.
    2.  **Abstract Asset Paths with Bevy Asset Keys:**  Use Bevy's `AssetServer::load` with asset keys (e.g., `"textures/player.png"`) instead of constructing file paths directly from external input.
    3.  **Configuration Mapping to Bevy Asset Keys:** If external configuration is used to select assets, map configuration values to predefined Bevy asset keys. Resolve these keys internally using Bevy's asset server, ensuring paths remain within the intended asset directories managed by Bevy.
    4.  **Bevy's Asset Path Resolution:** Rely on Bevy's `AssetServer` to handle asset path resolution. Ensure that Bevy's asset paths are configured to point to secure and controlled asset directories, preventing access to arbitrary file system locations.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Path Traversal Vulnerabilities during Asset Loading (High Severity):** Attackers can bypass Bevy's intended asset loading paths and access files outside of designated asset directories by manipulating file paths if direct path handling is used instead of Bevy's asset key system.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Path Traversal Vulnerabilities during Asset Loading (High Risk Reduction):**  Effectively eliminates path traversal vulnerabilities by leveraging Bevy's asset key system and preventing direct file path manipulation within Bevy systems.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Bevy's asset key system is used for most core assets loaded through the `AssetServer`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to ensure all asset loading, including assets loaded from configuration or user selections, is done exclusively through Bevy's asset key system. Eliminate any instances of direct file path construction or manipulation within Bevy systems.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limits within Bevy Systems during Asset Loading](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limits_within_bevy_systems_during_asset_loading.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Resource Limits within Bevy Systems during Asset Loading

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Timeouts in Bevy Systems for Asset Loading:** Implement timeouts within Bevy systems that initiate asset loading. If an asset load operation initiated by a Bevy system takes too long (e.g., using `ResMut<Assets<T>>::get_handle` with a long wait), implement logic to handle timeouts and prevent indefinite blocking of Bevy systems.
    2.  **Bevy Task Pools for Asynchronous Asset Loading:** Utilize Bevy's task pools for asynchronous asset loading to prevent blocking the main Bevy thread. Ensure that resource-intensive asset loading operations are offloaded to background tasks managed by Bevy's task scheduler.
    3.  **Bevy's Event System for Asset Load Progress and Errors:** Leverage Bevy's event system to monitor asset load progress and handle errors. Bevy events can be used to track resource usage during asset loading and implement resource limits within Bevy systems based on these events.
    4.  **System Scheduling and Resource Management in Bevy:**  Utilize Bevy's system scheduling features to control the execution order and resource allocation of systems involved in asset loading. Prioritize critical systems and limit the resources available to asset loading systems if necessary to prevent DoS.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service through Asset Manipulation (Medium Severity):** Maliciously crafted assets can be designed to consume excessive resources during loading within Bevy systems, leading to DoS.
    *   **Accidental Resource Exhaustion (Low Severity):**  Even non-maliciously large or complex assets can accidentally exhaust resources if Bevy systems do not manage asset loading resources effectively.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service through Asset Manipulation (Medium Risk Reduction):** Reduces the risk by preventing malicious assets from monopolizing resources within Bevy systems indefinitely.
    *   **Accidental Resource Exhaustion (Medium Risk Reduction):** Prevents accidental crashes due to resource exhaustion during normal Bevy system operation related to asset loading.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Bevy's asynchronous asset loading and task pools are used for non-blocking asset loading.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Timeouts within Bevy systems waiting for assets are not consistently implemented. Bevy's event system is not fully utilized to monitor and manage resource usage during asset loading. System scheduling is not explicitly used for resource management related to asset loading.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Plugin Vetting and Auditing within Bevy Ecosystem](./mitigation_strategies/plugin_vetting_and_auditing_within_bevy_ecosystem.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Plugin Vetting and Auditing within Bevy Ecosystem

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Bevy Plugin Ecosystem Awareness:**  Be aware of the Bevy plugin ecosystem and the sources of plugins being used. Prioritize plugins from trusted and reputable Bevy community members or organizations.
    2.  **Bevy Plugin Code Review:**  For any third-party Bevy plugin, especially from untrusted sources, conduct a code review focusing on Bevy-specific APIs and interactions with Bevy's ECS, resources, and systems. Look for misuse of Bevy features or potential security vulnerabilities within the Bevy plugin context.
    3.  **Bevy Plugin Permission Scrutiny:**  Examine the Bevy systems, resources, and events accessed by a plugin. Ensure that the plugin only requests necessary access to Bevy components and functionalities. Be wary of plugins that request excessive or unnecessary permissions within the Bevy ECS.
    4.  **Bevy Plugin Compatibility Testing within Bevy Project:**  Thoroughly test Bevy plugins within your specific Bevy project environment. Check for compatibility issues with other Bevy plugins and the core Bevy engine version being used. Identify any unexpected interactions or conflicts within the Bevy ECS or system scheduling that could lead to vulnerabilities.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Plugins (High Severity):**  Plugins designed for Bevy from untrusted sources can contain malicious code that leverages Bevy's ECS or system access to compromise application security within the Bevy environment.
    *   **Plugin Conflicts and Unexpected Interactions within Bevy ECS (Medium Severity):**  Incompatible or poorly written Bevy plugins can introduce vulnerabilities or instability through unexpected interactions within Bevy's ECS, system scheduling, or resource management.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Plugins (High Risk Reduction):** Significantly reduces the risk of introducing malicious code into the Bevy application through plugins by focusing on Bevy-specific plugin security aspects.
    *   **Plugin Conflicts and Unexpected Interactions within Bevy ECS (Medium Risk Reduction):** Reduces the risk of vulnerabilities and instability caused by plugin conflicts within the Bevy ECS and system interactions.

*   **Currently Implemented:**  Informal vetting is performed for Bevy plugins used in core features, focusing on functionality within the Bevy context.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Formalized Bevy plugin vetting process is missing, specifically tailored to Bevy's ECS and plugin architecture. No automated tools or checklists are used for Bevy plugin security audits, focusing on Bevy-specific security concerns. Dependency analysis for Bevy plugins within the Bevy ecosystem context is not systematically performed.
