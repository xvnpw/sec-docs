# Threat Model Analysis for servo/servo

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via HTML Parsing Vulnerability](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_html_parsing_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious HTML content exploiting a parsing flaw in Servo's HTML parser. When rendered, attacker's JavaScript executes within the application's context. This can be achieved by injecting malicious HTML into a page loaded by Servo or serving a malicious HTML page.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the application's context within Servo. Attackers can steal user data, manipulate UI, perform actions on behalf of the user, or redirect to malicious sites.
*   **Servo Component Affected:** HTML Parser (likely within `html5ever` crate or parsing logic).
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Servo to patch HTML parsing vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to limit JavaScript execution and sources.
    *   Sanitize user input incorporated into Servo rendered content (application-side, but not primary defense).
    *   Conduct security audits and fuzzing of Servo's HTML parsing components.

## Threat: [Memory Corruption in CSS Rendering Engine](./threats/memory_corruption_in_css_rendering_engine.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious CSS exploiting a vulnerability in Servo's CSS rendering engine. Processing this CSS leads to memory corruption in Servo's process, potentially enabling arbitrary code execution.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within Servo, potentially leading to system compromise. Application crash and denial of service are also possible.
*   **Servo Component Affected:** CSS Rendering Engine (likely within `webrender` or style system components).
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Servo to patch CSS rendering vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement resource limits (memory, CPU) for Servo processes.
    *   Run Servo in a sandboxed environment.
    *   Focus security audits and fuzzing on Servo's CSS rendering engine.

## Threat: [JavaScript Engine Vulnerability leading to Remote Code Execution](./threats/javascript_engine_vulnerability_leading_to_remote_code_execution.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in Servo's JavaScript engine. Executing crafted JavaScript code allows remote code execution within the Servo process.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within Servo, potentially leading to system compromise, data theft, application manipulation, and denial of service.
*   **Servo Component Affected:** JavaScript Engine (component integrated for JavaScript execution).
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Servo and its JavaScript engine with security patches.
    *   Disable JavaScript execution in Servo if application functionality allows.
    *   Run Servo in a sandboxed environment.
    *   Focus security audits and fuzzing on JavaScript engine integration within Servo.

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via URL Handling in Servo](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_url_handling_in_servo.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits insufficient URL validation in Servo. By controlling URLs loaded by Servo, an attacker can force requests to internal network resources or services.
*   **Impact:** Access to internal network resources, potential data leakage, and potential exploitation of internal services. SSRF can sometimes lead to remote code execution on internal systems.
*   **Servo Component Affected:** Networking and Resource Loading components (URL handling and request processing).
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strict URL validation and sanitization before passing URLs to Servo (application-side). Implement allow-lists for domains and protocols.
    *   Network segmentation to isolate Servo processes from internal networks.
    *   Restrict Servo's outbound network access using firewalls.
    *   Run Servo processes with minimal network permissions (principle of least privilege).

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion through Complex Content](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion_through_complex_content.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides Servo with complex HTML, CSS, or JavaScript content designed to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory) during parsing and rendering, leading to application slowdown or crashes.
*   **Impact:** Application unavailability, degraded performance, and potential crashes.
*   **Servo Component Affected:** Parsing and Rendering Engines (HTML parser, CSS engine, JavaScript engine, layout engine).
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement resource limits (CPU, memory) for Servo processes at the OS level.
    *   Implement timeouts for long-running operations within Servo (parsing, rendering, JavaScript).
    *   Limit the size of content loaded by Servo.
    *   Implement rate limiting on requests triggering Servo rendering (application-side).

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerability in a Servo Library](./threats/dependency_vulnerability_in_a_servo_library.md)

*   **Description:** A critical vulnerability is discovered in a third-party library used by Servo. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability indirectly through Servo.
*   **Impact:** Impact depends on the specific dependency vulnerability, ranging from denial of service to remote code execution.
*   **Servo Component Affected:** Various Servo components, depending on the vulnerable dependency (systemic issue).
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the dependency vulnerability severity)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regular dependency scanning and management for Servo.
    *   Keep Servo's dependencies updated with security patches.
    *   Maintain a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for Servo and its dependencies.
    *   Ensure a secure build process for Servo and its dependencies.

## Threat: [IPC Vulnerability leading to Privilege Escalation (If IPC is used)](./threats/ipc_vulnerability_leading_to_privilege_escalation__if_ipc_is_used_.md)

*   **Description:** If using IPC to interact with Servo, vulnerabilities in the IPC mechanism or interface could be exploited to manipulate IPC messages, potentially leading to unauthorized control and privilege escalation.
*   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, unauthorized control over Servo and potentially the application, data manipulation, and denial of service.
*   **Servo Component Affected:** IPC interface and related components handling IPC communication.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use secure IPC mechanisms provided by the OS or vetted libraries.
    *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize data in IPC messages (both directions).
    *   Apply principle of least privilege to Servo processes and IPC access.
    *   Implement authentication and authorization for IPC communication.
