# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, Servo, aims to create a modern, embeddable web engine. It is designed to be highly parallel and written in Rust, emphasizing safety and performance. The primary business goal is to provide an alternative browser engine that can be used in various applications, potentially competing with existing engines like Blink and Gecko.

Business priorities and goals:
- Provide a secure web engine.
- Achieve high performance and efficiency.
- Offer a modern and standards-compliant web platform.
- Enable embedding Servo in diverse applications and environments.
- Foster an open-source community around the project.

Most important business risks:
- Security vulnerabilities in the engine could lead to data breaches and reputational damage.
- Performance issues might hinder adoption and user experience.
- Lack of compatibility with web standards could limit usability.
- Difficulty in embedding Servo into different platforms could restrict its market reach.
- Insufficient community support could slow down development and maintenance.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Memory safety provided by Rust language, mitigating many common classes of vulnerabilities like buffer overflows. Implemented at the language level.
- security control: Code review process for contributions. Implemented via GitHub pull requests.
- security control: Fuzzing and testing as part of continuous integration. Implemented in GitHub Workflows.
- security control: Reporting and handling of security vulnerabilities. Described in project's security policy (if available, needs verification).
- accepted risk: Reliance on external dependencies, which might introduce vulnerabilities.
- accepted risk: Complexity of the codebase, making it challenging to identify all potential security issues.
- accepted risk: Open source nature, making the codebase publicly available for vulnerability research (both by attackers and defenders).

Recommended security controls:
- security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) integration into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect potential vulnerabilities in the code.
- security control: Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) to test the running application for vulnerabilities.
- security control: Regular security audits by external security experts.
- security control: Dependency scanning and management to track and update vulnerable dependencies.
- security control: Implement and enforce secure coding guidelines and training for developers.

Security requirements:
- Authentication: Not directly applicable to a browser engine as it doesn't manage user accounts. However, security mechanisms within web pages loaded by Servo might involve authentication, which Servo needs to handle securely (e.g., handling cookies, TLS certificates).
- Authorization: Servo needs to enforce the same-origin policy and other web security models to prevent unauthorized access to resources and data between different websites. Implemented within the engine's core logic.
- Input validation:  Critical for processing untrusted web content. Servo must rigorously validate all inputs from web pages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, network responses, etc.) to prevent injection attacks (XSS, etc.) and other vulnerabilities. Implemented in parsing and processing components of the engine.
- Cryptography: Servo relies on cryptography for secure communication (HTTPS) and handling web cryptography APIs. Correct and secure implementation of cryptographic protocols and APIs is essential. Implemented in networking and JavaScript engine components.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes we are trying to protect:
- Secure rendering of web content: Ensuring that Servo can process and display web pages without introducing security vulnerabilities that could be exploited to harm users or systems.
- Integrity of the engine: Maintaining the integrity of the Servo codebase and build process to prevent malicious modifications or supply chain attacks.
- Availability of the engine: Ensuring that Servo remains available and functional for embedding applications and users.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- User data processed by web pages: This includes potentially sensitive information such as personal data entered into forms, browsing history, cookies, and data accessed by JavaScript. Sensitivity is high, as breaches could lead to privacy violations, identity theft, and other harms.
- Application data within embedding applications: If Servo is embedded in applications that handle sensitive data, vulnerabilities in Servo could potentially expose this application data. Sensitivity depends on the nature of the embedding application.
- Intellectual property of the Servo project: The source code and design of Servo are valuable intellectual property. Protecting against unauthorized access and modification is important. Sensitivity is medium to high.
