# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for servo/servo

## Mitigation Strategy: [Capability-Based Security (Servo Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/capability-based_security__servo_specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Required Servo Capabilities:** Analyze the functionalities of Servo that your application *actually* needs. Determine the minimum set of permissions and resources Servo requires to operate correctly within your application's context.
2.  **Utilize Servo Embedding API for Capability Control:** Explore and leverage Servo's embedding API (if available and exposed by your application's Servo integration library) to fine-tune Servo's capabilities. This might include disabling specific features, restricting API access, or controlling resource usage *within Servo itself*.
3.  **Restrict Network Access (via Servo Configuration):** If Servo only needs to load local content or access specific whitelisted domains, configure network restrictions *within Servo's settings or through its embedding API* to prevent it from accessing arbitrary network resources. This is distinct from OS-level firewalls and focuses on Servo's internal network handling.
4.  **Limit File System Access (via Servo Configuration):** Restrict Servo's file system access to only necessary directories *through Servo's configuration or embedding API*. Prevent write access to sensitive areas and limit read access to only required resources *as configured within Servo*. This is about controlling Servo's file system interactions, not just OS-level permissions.
**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Data Exfiltration (via Servo) - **Medium to High Severity:** Limiting network and file system access *within Servo* reduces the attacker's ability to exfiltrate sensitive data if they compromise Servo's rendering or scripting engine.
*   Resource Abuse (by Servo) - **Medium Severity:** Restricting capabilities *within Servo* can prevent an attacker from abusing system resources (network bandwidth, disk space, etc.) through a compromised Servo instance.
*   Exploitation of Unnecessary Servo Features - **Medium Severity:** Disabling unneeded features *within Servo* reduces the attack surface and potential vulnerabilities associated with those features.
**Impact:** Partially to Significantly reduces the risk of Data Exfiltration, Resource Abuse, and exploitation of unnecessary features *specifically within the Servo engine*.
**Currently Implemented:** Basic file system access restrictions are in place at the OS level, limiting Servo's write access. Network access *within Servo* is currently unrestricted.  Exploration of Servo embedding API for capability control is limited.
**Missing Implementation:** Fine-grained network access control *within Servo* based on whitelisting domains and further restriction of file system read access *within Servo's configuration* to only essential directories are missing.  In-depth exploration and utilization of Servo embedding API for capability control is needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Feature Reduction and Minimal Configuration (Servo Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/feature_reduction_and_minimal_configuration__servo_specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Analyze Required Servo Features:**  Carefully analyze the features of Servo that are *actually* required for your application's functionality. Identify any Servo features or APIs that are not essential for your use case.
2.  **Disable Unnecessary Servo Features:** Consult Servo's documentation and configuration options to determine if it's possible to disable or restrict specific features or APIs *within Servo itself* that are not needed. This could include disabling specific rendering features, JavaScript APIs, or browser functionalities.
3.  **Minimize JavaScript Usage (within Servo):** If your application's use case allows, minimize or eliminate the execution of JavaScript *within Servo*.  If JavaScript is necessary, restrict its capabilities using CSP (Content Security Policy - see separate mitigation) and other Servo-specific JavaScript control mechanisms.
4.  **Review Servo Default Configurations:** Thoroughly review Servo's default configurations and adjust them *within Servo's configuration files or embedding API* to be as secure as possible for your specific application context. Focus on settings that directly impact Servo's security posture.
**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Increased Attack Surface (within Servo) - **Medium Severity:** Reducing features and complexity *within Servo* reduces the overall attack surface of the engine itself, making it harder for attackers to find and exploit vulnerabilities in Servo.
*   Exploitation of Complex Servo Features - **Medium to High Severity:** Disabling complex or less-used features *within Servo* can eliminate potential vulnerability points within those specific Servo features.
**Impact:** Partially reduces the overall attack surface and the risk of exploiting complex features *specifically within the Servo engine*.
**Currently Implemented:** JavaScript is enabled by default in Servo. No specific feature reduction or configuration minimization *within Servo itself* has been actively pursued.
**Missing Implementation:** Analysis of required Servo features, exploration of feature disabling options *within Servo*, and configuration review for security hardening *of Servo itself* are missing. Efforts to minimize JavaScript usage *within Servo* are needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Servo and Dependency Updates](./mitigation_strategies/regular_servo_and_dependency_updates.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Establish Servo Update Monitoring:** Set up monitoring specifically for new Servo releases and security advisories. Subscribe to Servo project mailing lists, watch the Servo GitHub repository, and utilize security vulnerability databases that track browser engine vulnerabilities.
2.  **Implement Automated Servo Dependency Scanning:** Use dependency scanning tools (like `cargo audit` for Rust projects, as Servo is Rust-based) to regularly check for known vulnerabilities in Servo's *direct and indirect dependencies*. Focus on dependencies used *by Servo*.
3.  **Create a Servo Patching Process:** Define a process specifically for promptly applying security patches and updating Servo and its dependencies when vulnerabilities are discovered *in Servo or its ecosystem*. This should include testing and validation of Servo updates within your application.
4.  **Automate Servo Updates (where feasible):** Explore automating the update process for Servo and its dependencies to ensure timely patching of Servo-related vulnerabilities, while still maintaining testing and validation steps specific to your application's Servo integration.
**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Exploitation of Known Servo Vulnerabilities - **High Severity:** Regular Servo updates directly address known vulnerabilities *in Servo itself* and its dependencies, preventing attackers from exploiting them.
*   Zero-Day Vulnerabilities (indirectly related to Servo) - **Medium Severity:** While updates don't directly prevent zero-day attacks, staying up-to-date with Servo reduces the overall attack surface *of the browser engine component* and ensures that known Servo vulnerabilities are not exploitable.
**Impact:** Significantly reduces the risk of exploitation of known vulnerabilities *specifically in Servo and its dependencies*.
**Currently Implemented:** Manual checks for Servo updates are performed periodically. Dependency scanning *specifically for Servo dependencies* is not yet automated.
**Missing Implementation:** Automated monitoring for Servo updates and security advisories, automated dependency scanning *focused on Servo dependencies*, and a formalized patching process *for Servo updates* are missing. Automation of the Servo update process itself is also needed.
