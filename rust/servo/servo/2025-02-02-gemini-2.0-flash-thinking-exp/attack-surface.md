# Attack Surface Analysis for servo/servo

## Attack Surface: [JavaScript Engine (SpiderMonkey) Exploits](./attack_surfaces/javascript_engine__spidermonkey__exploits.md)

*   **Description:** Critical vulnerabilities within the SpiderMonkey JavaScript engine, embedded in Servo, can be exploited to achieve remote code execution, bypass security sandboxes, or cause denial-of-service. These vulnerabilities often stem from memory safety issues, type confusion bugs, or JIT compiler flaws within SpiderMonkey itself.
*   **Servo Contribution:** Servo directly integrates and relies on Mozilla's SpiderMonkey for JavaScript execution. Any security vulnerability present in SpiderMonkey becomes a direct attack vector for applications embedding Servo. Servo's integration provides the execution environment for SpiderMonkey within the application's context.
*   **Example:** A maliciously crafted website, rendered by Servo, contains JavaScript code that exploits a use-after-free vulnerability in SpiderMonkey's garbage collector. Upon visiting this website, the vulnerability is triggered, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the machine running the application embedding Servo, potentially gaining full control of the system.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Sandbox Escape, Full System Compromise, Data Breach
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**  **Crucially**, keep Servo updated to the latest version. Servo updates frequently include patched versions of SpiderMonkey addressing known security vulnerabilities. Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to severely restrict or ideally disable JavaScript execution from untrusted origins if feasible for the application's functionality. Employ robust process isolation to sandbox Servo and limit the damage if a SpiderMonkey exploit occurs. Regularly audit and test the application's interaction with JavaScript and ensure minimal exposure to untrusted JavaScript code.

## Attack Surface: [Image and Media Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/image_and_media_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** High severity vulnerabilities in Servo's image and media decoding and rendering libraries can be exploited by serving malicious image or media files. These vulnerabilities often manifest as buffer overflows, memory corruption issues, or format string bugs within the libraries used by Servo to process these file types. Exploitation can lead to remote code execution or denial-of-service.
*   **Servo Contribution:** Servo utilizes libraries like `image-rs` and system-level media codecs to handle various image and media formats. Servo's rendering pipeline directly processes these files using these libraries. Vulnerabilities within these libraries, when triggered by content rendered by Servo, become direct attack vectors.
*   **Example:** A website rendered by Servo serves a specially crafted TIFF image file. This file exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in the image decoding library used by Servo. When Servo attempts to render this image, the buffer overflow occurs, allowing the attacker to overwrite memory and inject malicious code. This results in remote code execution within the context of the application embedding Servo.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Memory Corruption, Denial of Service, Potential Data Exfiltration
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**  Maintain Servo at the latest version to benefit from updated and patched image and media handling libraries. Sanitize and re-encode image and media files from untrusted sources before allowing Servo to process them. Consider limiting the supported image and media formats to only those strictly necessary, reducing the attack surface. Implement input validation and size limits for image and media files processed by Servo.

## Attack Surface: [Memory Safety Issues in Unsafe Rust Code within Servo](./attack_surfaces/memory_safety_issues_in_unsafe_rust_code_within_servo.md)

*   **Description:** Despite Rust's memory safety guarantees, Servo, being a complex project, may contain `unsafe` blocks of code for performance optimization or interoperability with non-Rust libraries. Critical memory safety vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, use-after-free, or double-free issues, can arise within these `unsafe` code sections if not meticulously implemented and audited. Exploitation can lead to remote code execution and system compromise.
*   **Servo Contribution:** While Rust aims for memory safety, the presence of `unsafe` code within Servo's codebase inherently introduces the potential for memory safety vulnerabilities. Servo's architecture and performance requirements might necessitate the use of `unsafe` code in critical paths, directly contributing to this attack surface.
*   **Example:** An `unsafe` block within Servo's layout engine, responsible for positioning elements on the page, contains a buffer overflow vulnerability. A carefully crafted webpage with a complex layout triggers this overflow when processed by Servo. The attacker can then overwrite memory and inject malicious code, achieving remote code execution within the application.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Memory Corruption, System Instability, Privilege Escalation
*   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Minimize the use of `unsafe` code within the application's integration with Servo and ideally within Servo itself (though direct Servo code modification is less common for integrators). Rigorously audit and test all `unsafe` code blocks for memory safety vulnerabilities using memory safety tools and techniques.  Stay updated with Servo releases, as the Servo project actively works on reducing and securing `unsafe` code. Employ fuzzing and other security testing methodologies specifically targeting memory safety within Servo integration.

## Attack Surface: [Web API Vulnerabilities (DOM, Canvas, etc.)](./attack_surfaces/web_api_vulnerabilities__dom__canvas__etc__.md)

*   **Description:** High severity vulnerabilities in the implementation of critical Web APIs within Servo, such as the Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation APIs, Canvas 2D/WebGL, or other powerful APIs, can be exploited to bypass security restrictions, perform cross-site scripting (XSS), or gain unauthorized access to resources. These vulnerabilities often arise from incorrect implementation of API specifications, insufficient input validation, or logic errors in API handling within Servo.
*   **Servo Contribution:** Servo implements a wide range of Web APIs to enable web content functionality. Servo's implementation of these APIs directly determines the security posture of applications using these APIs through Servo. Bugs in Servo's Web API implementations become direct attack vectors.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability exists in Servo's implementation of the `Canvas 2D` API's `drawImage()` function. A malicious website leverages this vulnerability to bypass Same-Origin Policy restrictions when drawing images onto a canvas. This allows the website to read pixel data from images hosted on different origins without proper CORS authorization, leading to information leakage and potential data theft. Alternatively, a DOM API vulnerability could be exploited for persistent XSS.
*   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Same-Origin Policy Bypass, Information Leakage, Data Theft, Potential for further exploitation depending on the API.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Keep Servo updated to receive security fixes for Web API vulnerabilities. Implement robust input validation and output encoding when using Web APIs in the application, especially when handling data from untrusted sources or user input. Enforce a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to limit the capabilities of web content and mitigate XSS risks arising from Web API vulnerabilities. Carefully review and security test the application's usage of Web APIs, focusing on potential security implications of API interactions and data handling.
