    *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing for JavaScript-related vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Image Parsing Vulnerability](./threats/image_parsing_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious image file (e.g., PNG, JPEG, GIF) that exploits a vulnerability in the image decoding libraries used by Servo. When Servo attempts to parse and render this image, it could trigger a buffer overflow, memory corruption, or other vulnerability leading to crashes or code execution.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Memory Corruption:** Could lead to crashes, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Code Execution:** Attacker could gain control of the application process.
    *   **Denial of Service:** Application crashes or becomes unresponsive.
*   **Affected Servo Component:** `servo/components/media` (Image decoding and rendering), and underlying image decoding libraries.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Servo to benefit from updates to image decoding libraries.
    *   Consider Content Security Policy (CSP) to limit image sources.
    *   Utilize memory sanitization tools during development to detect memory corruption issues early.

## Threat: [Network Protocol Vulnerability (HTTP/HTTPS)](./threats/network_protocol_vulnerability__httphttps_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in Servo's implementation of HTTP or HTTPS protocols. This could involve crafting malicious HTTP requests or responses that trigger a parsing error, buffer overflow, or other vulnerability in Servo's networking stack.
