    *   **Mitigation:** Rigorous code reviews of `unsafe` blocks and FFI boundaries. Static analysis tools. Memory safety testing and fuzzing.

*   **SpiderMonkey (JavaScript Engine):**
    *   **Security Consideration:** SpiderMonkey is a complex C/C++ codebase and can contain vulnerabilities. JIT compilation in JavaScript engines is a known area for security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Mitigation:** Stay up-to-date with SpiderMonkey security patches. Implement robust sandboxing for JavaScript execution within Servo. Limit JavaScript capabilities where possible.

*   **WebRender (Rendering Engine in Rust):**
    *   **Security Benefit:** Rust's memory safety benefits apply to WebRender, reducing memory safety vulnerabilities in the rendering engine.
