# Attack Surface Analysis for servo/servo

## Attack Surface: [HTML/CSS/JavaScript Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/htmlcssjavascript_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Bugs in Servo's HTML, CSS, or JavaScript parsers can be exploited by malicious web content to cause serious security issues.
    * **Servo Contribution:** Servo's core functionality relies on parsing untrusted web content. Vulnerabilities in these parsers are direct entry points for attacks. The complexity of parsing logic inherently increases the risk of exploitable bugs.
    * **Example:** A maliciously crafted HTML document with overlapping or deeply nested tags could trigger a buffer overflow in Servo's HTML parser, leading to arbitrary code execution.
    * **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), potentially Information Disclosure.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Regularly update Servo:**  Immediately apply security patches and bug fixes released by the Servo project. This is the most critical mitigation.
        * **Fuzzing and security testing:**  Proactively employ fuzzing and rigorous security testing techniques specifically targeting Servo's parsers to identify and address vulnerabilities before they are exploited.

## Attack Surface: [JavaScript Engine (SpiderMonkey) Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/javascript_engine__spidermonkey__vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:**  Critical vulnerabilities within the integrated SpiderMonkey JavaScript engine can be exploited by malicious JavaScript code executed within Servo.
    * **Servo Contribution:** Servo directly integrates and relies on SpiderMonkey to execute JavaScript, a core component of modern web content. Any critical vulnerability in SpiderMonkey directly translates to a critical vulnerability in applications using Servo.
    * **Example:** A JavaScript exploit targeting a type confusion bug or a just-in-time (JIT) compilation vulnerability in SpiderMonkey could allow an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution on the user's machine simply by visiting a malicious website rendered by Servo.
    * **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Sandbox Escape (if Servo implements sandboxing, which may be bypassed), complete compromise of the application and potentially the user's system.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Regularly update Servo:**  Ensure Servo is updated to the latest version, as these updates will include patched versions of SpiderMonkey addressing known security vulnerabilities. This is paramount.
        * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a very strict Content Security Policy to significantly limit the capabilities of JavaScript executed by Servo. While not a complete mitigation against RCE, it can reduce the potential impact of successful exploits.

## Attack Surface: [Rendering Engine Vulnerabilities (Information Disclosure & XSS Bypass)](./attack_surfaces/rendering_engine_vulnerabilities__information_disclosure_&_xss_bypass_.md)

* **Description:**  While less likely to lead to direct code execution, vulnerabilities in Servo's rendering engine can still have high severity, particularly those leading to information disclosure or bypasses of security mechanisms like XSS protection.
    * **Servo Contribution:** Servo's rendering engine is responsible for the complex task of visually representing web pages. Bugs in this process, while often leading to crashes, can sometimes expose sensitive data or undermine security boundaries.
    * **Example:** A rendering bug triggered by specific CSS or SVG content might cause Servo to incorrectly handle memory boundaries, leading to the disclosure of sensitive data from process memory during the rendering process.  Alternatively, a rendering flaw could allow crafted HTML/CSS to bypass XSS sanitization implemented by the application.
    * **Impact:** Information Disclosure, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) bypass, potentially leading to account compromise or further attacks.
    * **Risk Severity:** High.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Regularly update Servo:** Apply updates to patch rendering engine bugs.
        * **Security audits of rendering logic:**  Focus security audits on the rendering engine code, specifically looking for logic errors that could lead to information leaks or security bypasses.

## Attack Surface: [Networking Stack Vulnerabilities (TLS/SSL & Protocol Exploits)](./attack_surfaces/networking_stack_vulnerabilities__tlsssl_&_protocol_exploits_.md)

* **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in Servo's networking stack, especially in TLS/SSL implementation or handling of web protocols, can lead to critical security breaches.
    * **Servo Contribution:** Servo's networking stack is responsible for secure communication over the internet. Flaws in this stack directly compromise the confidentiality and integrity of data transmitted and received by Servo.
    * **Example:** A vulnerability in Servo's TLS/SSL implementation could allow a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacker to decrypt HTTPS traffic, intercept sensitive data, or inject malicious content into the communication stream.  Exploits in HTTP/2 or WebSocket handling could also lead to serious vulnerabilities.
    * **Impact:** Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, Data interception and theft, Injection of malicious content, potential for further exploitation.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Regularly update Servo:**  Ensure timely updates to benefit from patches for networking stack vulnerabilities, especially those related to TLS/SSL.
        * **Strict Transport Security (HSTS):** Implement HSTS to enforce HTTPS usage and prevent downgrade attacks, reducing the window for potential TLS/SSL exploits.
        * **Monitor security advisories:**  Actively monitor security advisories related to TLS/SSL libraries and web protocols used by Servo and its dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Third-Party Dependency Vulnerabilities (High & Critical Severity)](./attack_surfaces/third-party_dependency_vulnerabilities__high_&_critical_severity_.md)

* **Description:**  Servo relies on numerous third-party libraries. High and critical severity vulnerabilities in these dependencies directly impact Servo's security posture.
    * **Servo Contribution:** Servo's functionality is built upon a foundation of third-party code. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies are inherited by Servo and can be exploited through Servo's usage of these libraries.
    * **Example:** A critical vulnerability (e.g., Remote Code Execution) in a widely used image processing library that Servo depends on could be exploited by serving a malicious image to Servo, leading to compromise of the application using Servo.
    * **Impact:** Varies depending on the dependency vulnerability, but can include Remote Code Execution (RCE), Privilege Escalation, Denial of Service (DoS), Information Disclosure.
    * **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific dependency and vulnerability).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Regularly update Servo:** Servo updates should include updates to its dependencies, incorporating security patches for known vulnerabilities.
        * **Dependency scanning and monitoring:**  Implement automated dependency scanning tools to continuously monitor Servo's dependencies for known vulnerabilities and receive alerts for new disclosures.
        * **Supply chain security practices:**  Adopt robust supply chain security practices to minimize the risk of using compromised or vulnerable dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Unsafe Rust Code Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/unsafe_rust_code_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:**  Despite Rust's memory safety, Servo's use of `unsafe` blocks can introduce memory safety vulnerabilities that are exploitable.
    * **Servo Contribution:**  While Rust provides strong memory safety guarantees, the necessary use of `unsafe` code in a complex project like Servo creates potential bypasses of these guarantees, leading to traditional memory safety issues.
    * **Example:** An incorrect memory access or lifetime management within an `unsafe` block in Servo could lead to a use-after-free or double-free vulnerability, which can be exploited for arbitrary code execution.
    * **Impact:** Memory corruption, Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), potential for privilege escalation.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Security audits of `unsafe` code:**  Prioritize rigorous security audits and code reviews specifically targeting all `unsafe` blocks within Servo's codebase.
        * **Minimize `unsafe` usage and justification:**  Continuously strive to minimize the use of `unsafe` code and ensure every instance of `unsafe` is thoroughly justified, reviewed, and tested.
        * **Memory safety testing tools:**  Utilize memory safety testing tools like AddressSanitizer (ASan) and MemorySanitizer (MSan) during development and testing to proactively detect memory safety bugs, including those in `unsafe` code.

## Attack Surface: [Platform-Specific Code Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/platform-specific_code_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in Servo's platform-specific code, which handles OS interactions, can be exploited to gain control at the operating system level.
    * **Servo Contribution:** Servo must interact with different operating systems for core functionalities. Platform-specific code introduces OS-dependent vulnerabilities that are outside of Rust's memory safety domain and can be critical.
    * **Example:** A buffer overflow in platform-specific graphics rendering code for Windows or macOS could be exploited to achieve code execution at the operating system level, potentially bypassing application sandboxes or security measures.
    * **Impact:** Operating System level Remote Code Execution (RCE), Privilege Escalation, complete compromise of the system.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Regularly update Servo:** Apply updates that include fixes for platform-specific vulnerabilities.
        * **Platform-specific security testing:**  Conduct security testing and code reviews specifically tailored to each platform Servo supports, focusing on platform-specific code and OS interactions.
        * **Operating system hardening:**  Implement operating system level security hardening measures to reduce the attack surface and limit the impact of potential platform-specific vulnerabilities in Servo.
