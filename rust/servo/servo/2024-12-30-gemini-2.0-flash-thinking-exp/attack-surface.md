*   **HTML Parsing Vulnerabilities**
    *   **Description:** Exploitable flaws in how Servo interprets and processes HTML code.
    *   **How Servo Contributes:** Servo's HTML parsing engine is responsible for converting HTML markup into a Document Object Model (DOM) for rendering. Bugs in this process can lead to unexpected behavior or memory corruption.
    *   **Example:** A specially crafted HTML tag with an extremely long attribute value could cause a buffer overflow in Servo's parser.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service (crash), potential for remote code execution if memory corruption is exploitable.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Ensure Servo is updated to the latest version with bug fixes. Avoid directly rendering untrusted HTML content without thorough sanitization on the server-side *before* it reaches Servo. Implement robust error handling for parsing failures.

*   **JavaScript Engine Vulnerabilities (SpiderMonkey)**
    *   **Description:** Exploitable flaws within the JavaScript engine (SpiderMonkey) used by Servo.
    *   **How Servo Contributes:** Servo embeds SpiderMonkey to execute JavaScript code within web pages. Vulnerabilities in SpiderMonkey directly impact the security of applications using Servo.
    *   **Example:** A type confusion bug in SpiderMonkey could be exploited by malicious JavaScript code to gain arbitrary code execution within the Servo process.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, information disclosure, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Keep Servo updated, as updates often include security patches for SpiderMonkey. Implement strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the execution of untrusted JavaScript. Carefully review and audit any JavaScript code integrated with the application.

*   **Image Decoding Vulnerabilities**
    *   **Description:** Exploitable flaws in the image decoders used by Servo to process various image formats (e.g., PNG, JPEG, GIF).
    *   **How Servo Contributes:** Servo needs to decode images for rendering. Vulnerabilities in these decoders can be triggered by maliciously crafted image files.
    *   **Example:** A specially crafted PNG file could exploit a buffer overflow in Servo's PNG decoder, leading to a crash or potentially remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, potential for remote code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Keep Servo updated. If possible, process and validate images on the server-side before they are displayed by Servo. Consider using secure image processing libraries independently.

*   **Sandbox Escape Vulnerabilities**
    *   **Description:** Exploitable flaws that allow malicious code running within Servo's rendering sandbox to break out and gain access to the underlying operating system or other sensitive resources.
    *   **How Servo Contributes:** Servo aims to isolate web content within a sandbox for security. Vulnerabilities in the sandbox implementation itself can negate this protection.
    *   **Example:** A bug in the system call filtering mechanism of Servo's sandbox could be exploited to execute arbitrary code outside the sandbox.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the user's system, access to sensitive data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Keep Servo updated, as sandbox escapes are high-priority security issues. Carefully review and understand Servo's sandbox architecture and any configuration options. Consider additional layers of security beyond Servo's built-in sandbox.

*   **Content Security Policy (CSP) Bypass Vulnerabilities**
    *   **Description:** Exploitable flaws in Servo's enforcement of Content Security Policy directives.
    *   **How Servo Contributes:** Servo is responsible for enforcing CSP, which helps prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Bugs in CSP enforcement can allow attackers to bypass these protections.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in Servo's CSP parser might allow an attacker to craft a CSP header that is incorrectly interpreted, allowing the execution of inline scripts that should be blocked.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), leading to session hijacking, data theft, and other malicious activities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Keep Servo updated. Implement strong and well-configured CSP headers on the server-side. Thoroughly test CSP implementation to ensure it is effective.
