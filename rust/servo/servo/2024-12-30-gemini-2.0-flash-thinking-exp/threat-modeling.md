*   **Threat:** Memory Corruption in Rendering Engine
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious web page with specific HTML, CSS, or image content that triggers a buffer overflow, use-after-free, or other memory corruption vulnerability within Servo's rendering engine. This could involve manipulating image decoding, font rendering, or layout calculations.
    *   **Impact:**  The application using Servo could crash, leading to a denial of service. More critically, the attacker could potentially achieve arbitrary code execution on the user's machine by carefully crafting the malicious content to overwrite return addresses or other critical data in memory.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Servo's Rendering Engine (likely components within `components/layout/`, `components/style/`, `components/gfx/`, or specific image/font decoding libraries).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Servo updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
        *   Consider running the Servo rendering process in a sandboxed environment with limited privileges.
        *   Implement robust error handling and input validation at the application level when feeding content to Servo.
        *   Utilize memory safety tools and fuzzing during Servo development to identify and fix memory corruption bugs.

*   **Threat:** JavaScript Engine Vulnerability Leading to Code Execution
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability within the SpiderMonkey JavaScript engine (used by Servo) by including malicious JavaScript code in a web page. This could involve exploiting type confusion errors, prototype pollution, or other JavaScript-specific vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the Servo process, potentially gaining control over the user's machine or accessing sensitive data.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Servo's JavaScript Engine (SpiderMonkey, specifically components related to script parsing, compilation, and execution).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure Servo is built with the latest stable version of SpiderMonkey, incorporating security fixes.
        *   Implement strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the execution of inline scripts and the sources from which scripts can be loaded.
        *   Consider disabling JavaScript execution entirely if the application's functionality allows it.
        *   Regularly review and update the application's dependencies to avoid using outdated versions with known vulnerabilities.

*   **Threat:**  Resource Exhaustion via Malicious Content
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted web page with excessive or deeply nested HTML elements, extremely complex CSS rules, or large media files that overwhelm Servo's rendering engine, causing it to consume excessive CPU, memory, or other resources.
    *   **Impact:**  The application using Servo becomes unresponsive or crashes, leading to a denial of service for the user.
    *   **Affected Component:** Servo's Rendering Engine (Layout engine, HTML parser, resource loading components).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement resource limits for the Servo rendering process (e.g., memory limits, CPU time limits).
        *   Set timeouts for resource loading and rendering operations.
        *   Implement mechanisms to detect and block requests for excessively large or complex content.
        *   Consider using a separate process for rendering to isolate resource exhaustion issues.

*   **Threat:**  Bypassing Security Headers Enforcement
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in Servo's implementation or enforcement of security-related HTTP headers like Content Security Policy (CSP), Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS), or X-Frame-Options. This could involve crafting responses that trick Servo into ignoring or misinterpreting these headers.
    *   **Impact:**  Weakened security posture of the application, potentially allowing for cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking, or other attacks that these headers are designed to prevent.
    *   **Affected Component:** Servo's Networking and HTTP handling components (within `components/net/`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure Servo is updated to the latest version, which includes fixes for known header enforcement issues.
        *   Thoroughly test the application's handling of security headers when using Servo.
        *   Configure web servers to send strong and correctly formatted security headers.

*   **Threat:**  Vulnerability in Network Protocol Handling
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a flaw in Servo's handling of network protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, WebSockets) by sending malformed requests or responses. This could involve exploiting parsing errors, buffer overflows, or other vulnerabilities in the networking stack.
    *   **Impact:**  The application could crash, leading to a denial of service. In more severe cases, it could potentially lead to information disclosure or even remote code execution if the vulnerability allows for memory corruption.
    *   **Affected Component:** Servo's Networking components (within `components/net/`, potentially libraries like `rustls` for TLS).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Servo and its networking dependencies updated.
        *   Implement robust error handling for network operations.
        *   Consider using a well-vetted and secure networking library if integrating Servo directly.
