# Attack Surface Analysis for servo/servo

## Attack Surface: [Maliciously Crafted HTML/CSS Parsing](./attack_surfaces/maliciously_crafted_htmlcss_parsing.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in Servo's HTML and CSS parsing logic to cause unexpected behavior.
*   **How Servo Contributes:** Servo is responsible for parsing and interpreting HTML and CSS content. Bugs in this process can be leveraged.
*   **Example:**  A specially crafted HTML tag with deeply nested elements could cause a stack overflow in the parser, leading to a crash. A malicious CSS rule could trigger an infinite loop in the layout engine.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), potential memory corruption leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Servo to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
    *   Consider running Servo in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of potential exploits.

## Attack Surface: [JavaScript Execution Vulnerabilities (SpiderMonkey)](./attack_surfaces/javascript_execution_vulnerabilities__spidermonkey_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities within Servo's embedded JavaScript engine (SpiderMonkey).
*   **How Servo Contributes:** Servo uses SpiderMonkey to execute JavaScript code embedded in web pages.
*   **Example:**  Exploiting a known vulnerability in SpiderMonkey (e.g., a type confusion bug) through malicious JavaScript code to achieve arbitrary code execution within the Servo process.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the Servo process, potentially allowing access to application resources or the underlying system.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Servo updated to benefit from SpiderMonkey security updates.
    *   Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded and the actions they can perform.
    *   Avoid executing untrusted JavaScript code within the Servo context if possible.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Resource Loading (Images, Fonts, etc.)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_resource_loading__images__fonts__etc__.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in how Servo loads and processes external resources like images and fonts.
*   **How Servo Contributes:** Servo handles the fetching and decoding of various resource types.
*   **Example:**  A specially crafted image file could exploit a buffer overflow in an image decoding library used by Servo, leading to a crash or code execution. A malicious font file could trigger a vulnerability in the font rendering engine.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), memory corruption, potential arbitrary code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure Servo and its dependencies (especially image and font decoding libraries) are up-to-date.
    *   Implement strict controls over the sources from which Servo can load resources (e.g., using a whitelist of allowed domains).
    *   Consider scanning downloaded resources for known malware before passing them to Servo.

## Attack Surface: [Networking Stack Vulnerabilities (within Servo's scope)](./attack_surfaces/networking_stack_vulnerabilities__within_servo's_scope_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the networking libraries or protocols used by Servo for fetching resources.
*   **How Servo Contributes:** Servo handles network requests for fetching web content and related resources.
*   **Example:**  A vulnerability in the TLS implementation used by Servo could be exploited through a man-in-the-middle attack. A bug in HTTP parsing could be triggered by a malicious server response.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, man-in-the-middle attacks, potential for remote code execution if the networking stack is compromised.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure Servo is using up-to-date and secure networking libraries.
    *   Enforce HTTPS for all resource loading to mitigate man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   Implement proper certificate validation.

## Attack Surface: [Memory Safety Issues within Servo](./attack_surfaces/memory_safety_issues_within_servo.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploiting memory safety vulnerabilities within Servo's codebase, such as use-after-free, buffer overflows, or double-frees.
*   **How Servo Contributes:** As a complex software project written in Rust, Servo is generally memory-safe, but potential bugs can still exist.
*   **Example:**  A bug in Servo's rendering logic could lead to a use-after-free vulnerability, where memory is accessed after it has been deallocated, potentially leading to code execution.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), memory corruption, arbitrary code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (if exploitable)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Rely on the inherent memory safety features of Rust, but still prioritize regular updates to benefit from bug fixes.
    *   Consider using memory sanitizers during development and testing to identify potential memory safety issues.
