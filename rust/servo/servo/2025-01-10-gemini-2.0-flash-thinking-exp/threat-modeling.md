# Threat Model Analysis for servo/servo

## Threat: [HTML/CSS/JavaScript Parsing Vulnerability Leading to Code Execution](./threats/htmlcssjavascript_parsing_vulnerability_leading_to_code_execution.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts malicious HTML, CSS, or JavaScript that exploits a vulnerability in Servo's parsing or rendering logic. Upon rendering by Servo, the vulnerability is triggered, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the Servo process.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the Servo process, potentially allowing the attacker to control the application using Servo, access sensitive data within the process's memory, or even gain access to the underlying system if the sandbox is weak or non-existent.

**Affected Servo Component:** `html5ever` (HTML parser), `selectors` (CSS selector engine), `cssparser` (CSS parser), `servo/components/script` (JavaScript engine integration), `webrender` (rendering engine).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep Servo updated to the latest version with security patches.
* Implement robust sandboxing for the Servo process to limit the impact of code execution.
* Carefully vet any external or untrusted web content rendered by Servo.

## Threat: [Memory Corruption Vulnerability Leading to Code Execution](./threats/memory_corruption_vulnerability_leading_to_code_execution.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides specially crafted input that triggers a memory corruption bug (e.g., buffer overflow, use-after-free) within Servo's Rust codebase or its dependencies. Exploiting this corruption can allow the attacker to overwrite memory and gain control of the execution flow, leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the Servo process and potentially the underlying system.

**Affected Servo Component:** Various core components of Servo, including memory management within `servo/components/layout`, `servo/components/style`, `servo/components/script`, and potentially dependencies like image decoding libraries.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Maintain up-to-date versions of Servo and all its dependencies.
* Employ memory safety analysis tools during Servo development.
* Consider fuzzing Servo with various inputs to uncover memory corruption bugs.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities to Escape the Servo Sandbox](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_to_escape_the_servo_sandbox.md)

**Description:** If the application relies on Servo's sandboxing mechanisms to isolate rendered content, an attacker could exploit vulnerabilities within the sandbox implementation itself to escape its confines.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the host system, as the attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary code outside of the restricted Servo environment.

**Affected Servo Component:** Operating system specific sandboxing implementations within Servo.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly understand the limitations and security of Servo's sandboxing architecture.
* Implement additional layers of security at the application level to mitigate the impact of a sandbox escape.
* Stay informed about security research related to browser sandbox escapes.

## Threat: [CPU Exhaustion via Maliciously Crafted Content](./threats/cpu_exhaustion_via_maliciously_crafted_content.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts web content (e.g., deeply nested HTML structures, complex CSS selectors, infinite loops in JavaScript) that causes Servo to consume excessive CPU resources while rendering.

**Impact:** Denial of service for the application using Servo, potentially leading to unresponsiveness or crashes.

**Affected Servo Component:** `html5ever`, `selectors`, `cssparser`, `servo/components/layout`, `servo/components/script`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement timeouts and resource limits for rendering tasks within the application.
* Monitor Servo's CPU usage and implement mechanisms to detect and handle excessive consumption.

## Threat: [Memory Exhaustion via Maliciously Crafted Content](./threats/memory_exhaustion_via_maliciously_crafted_content.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts web content (e.g., extremely large DOM trees, excessively large images, memory leaks in JavaScript) that causes Servo to allocate and consume excessive memory.

**Impact:** Denial of service for the application due to memory exhaustion, potentially leading to crashes or system instability.

**Affected Servo Component:** `html5ever`, `servo/components/layout`, `servo/components/style`, `servo/components/script`, `webrender`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement memory limits for the Servo process.
* Monitor Servo's memory usage and implement mechanisms to detect and handle excessive allocation.
* Regularly restart the Servo process to mitigate potential memory leaks.

## Threat: [Cross-Origin Information Leakage](./threats/cross-origin_information_leakage.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in Servo's implementation of web security features (like CORS) could allow a malicious website rendered by Servo to access data from another origin that it should not be able to access.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data from other websites or resources to the malicious website.

**Affected Servo Component:** `servo/components/net` (networking), implementation of CORS and other web security policies within various components.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep Servo updated to benefit from fixes to cross-origin security vulnerabilities.
* Carefully configure any CORS headers or other security policies enforced by the application using Servo.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Servo's Dependencies](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_servo's_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Servo relies on numerous external libraries. An attacker could exploit known vulnerabilities in these dependencies through Servo.

**Impact:** The impact depends on the nature of the vulnerability in the dependency. It could range from code execution to denial of service or information disclosure.

**Affected Servo Component:** Various components that rely on the vulnerable dependency.

**Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical depending on the vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Maintain up-to-date versions of Servo and all its dependencies.
* Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using security auditing tools.
* Monitor security advisories for Servo's dependency tree.
