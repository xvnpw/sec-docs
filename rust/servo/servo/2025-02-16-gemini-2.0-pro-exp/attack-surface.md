# Attack Surface Analysis for servo/servo

## Attack Surface: [1. HTML Parsing and DOM Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/1__html_parsing_and_dom_manipulation.md)

*Description:*  Vulnerabilities in how Servo parses HTML and constructs the Document Object Model (DOM). This is the core functionality of a browser engine and thus a large and complex attack surface.
*Servo Contribution:* Servo's core functionality is parsing and rendering HTML.  Its Rust implementation mitigates many memory safety issues, but logic errors and Rust-specific vulnerabilities are still possible. This is *the* primary attack surface of Servo.
*Example:* A crafted HTML document with deeply nested elements, unusual attributes, or malformed `<script>` tags could trigger a use-after-free, buffer overflow, or logic error in Servo's DOM manipulation code, leading to arbitrary code execution.
*Impact:*  Arbitrary code execution within the Servo process, potentially leading to complete system compromise if sandboxing is weak or bypassed.
*Risk Severity:* Critical
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Fuzzing:**  Extensive fuzz testing with tools like AFL, libFuzzer, or specialized HTML fuzzers, targeting the HTML parser and DOM implementation.  Focus on edge cases and malformed input.
    *   **Sandboxing:**  Run Servo in a tightly restricted sandbox (this is crucial, but not *specific* to Servo's internals, so it's secondary here).
    *   **Regular Updates:**  Apply Servo updates promptly to benefit from security patches.
    *   **Static Analysis:**  Use static analysis tools for Rust (e.g., Clippy, Rust's built-in borrow checker) to identify potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Input Sanitization (Defense in Depth):** Validate and sanitize HTML input *before* it reaches Servo (not a primary defense, but helpful).

## Attack Surface: [2. CSS Parsing and Styling](./attack_surfaces/2__css_parsing_and_styling.md)

*Description:*  Vulnerabilities in how Servo parses CSS and applies styles to the DOM.  Complex CSS rules and interactions can lead to exploitable bugs.
*Servo Contribution:* Servo's CSS engine is a complex component responsible for parsing, interpreting, and applying CSS rules.  This involves selector matching, layout calculations, and rendering, all of which are potential attack vectors *directly within Servo*.
*Example:* A crafted CSS file with overly complex selectors, deeply nested `@media` rules, or a "CSS bomb" (highly recursive or computationally expensive styles) could trigger a buffer overflow, logic error, or denial-of-service (DoS) in Servo's CSS engine.
*Impact:*  Denial-of-service (DoS), potentially arbitrary code execution (though less likely than with HTML parsing).
*Risk Severity:* High
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Fuzzing:**  Targeted fuzz testing of the CSS parsing and styling engine.
    *   **CSS Complexity Limits:**  Restrict the complexity of CSS allowed (e.g., limit the number of selectors, nesting depth, or use of certain CSS features).
    *   **Resource Limits:**  Implement resource limits (CPU time, memory) for CSS processing to prevent DoS attacks.
    *   **Sandboxing:** Crucial, but a general mitigation.
    *   **Regular Updates:**  Apply Servo updates promptly.

## Attack Surface: [3. JavaScript Engine (SpiderMonkey) Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/3__javascript_engine__spidermonkey__vulnerabilities.md)

*Description:*  Exploits targeting vulnerabilities in the SpiderMonkey JavaScript engine, which Servo uses.
*Servo Contribution:* Servo *integrates* SpiderMonkey, inheriting its attack surface.  The interface between Servo (Rust) and SpiderMonkey (C/C++) is a potential area of concern, making this a *direct* Servo integration risk.
*Example:* A malicious JavaScript payload could exploit a JIT compilation bug, type confusion error, or prototype pollution vulnerability in SpiderMonkey, leading to arbitrary code execution within the Servo process.
*Impact:*  Arbitrary code execution within the Servo process, potentially leading to system compromise.
*Risk Severity:* Critical
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Disable JavaScript (If Possible):**  If the application doesn't require JavaScript, disable it entirely. This drastically reduces the attack surface.
    *   **Update SpiderMonkey:**  Keep SpiderMonkey updated to the latest version, ideally independently of Servo updates if possible.
    *   **Hardened JavaScript Sandbox:** If JavaScript is required, explore using a more restrictive JavaScript execution environment.
    *   **WebAssembly (Alternative):** Use WebAssembly instead of JavaScript where possible.
    *   **Monitor Vulnerability Reports:** Actively monitor for known SpiderMonkey vulnerabilities and apply patches immediately.

## Attack Surface: [4. Image and Font Decoding (Within Servo's Control)](./attack_surfaces/4__image_and_font_decoding__within_servo's_control_.md)

*Description:* Vulnerabilities in the *handling* of image and font data *within Servo*, even if the decoding itself is offloaded. This includes how Servo manages the decoded data and interacts with the decoding libraries.
*Servo Contribution:* While Servo uses external libraries, *how* it uses them and manages the resulting data is part of Servo's attack surface.  Memory management issues in Servo related to decoded image/font data are a direct concern.
*Example:*  Even if a perfectly secure image decoder is used, a bug in Servo's code that handles the decoded image data (e.g., a buffer overflow when copying the image data to a texture) could still lead to code execution.  Similarly, incorrect handling of font metrics could lead to layout issues or vulnerabilities.
*Impact:* Arbitrary code execution within the Servo process.
*Risk Severity:* High
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Fuzzing (Servo-Specific):** Fuzz test Servo's code that handles decoded image and font data, even if the decoding libraries themselves are fuzzed separately.
    *   **Code Review:** Carefully review Servo's code that interacts with image and font decoding libraries, paying close attention to memory management.
    *   **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools to identify potential memory safety issues in Servo's image and font handling code.
    *   **Update Libraries:** Keep external libraries updated (important, but not *solely* a Servo issue).
    *   **Sandboxing:** Isolate image and font decoding (general mitigation).
