## Mitigation Strategy: [Rust-Specific Fuzzing (Servo-Tailored)](./mitigation_strategies/rust-specific_fuzzing__servo-tailored_.md)

**1. Mitigation Strategy: Rust-Specific Fuzzing (Servo-Tailored)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Servo-Specific Targets:** Focus fuzzing on Servo's core components written in Rust:
        *   **`unsafe` blocks within Servo's codebase:** Prioritize all instances of `unsafe` code, as these bypass Rust's safety guarantees.  This includes code in layout, rendering, networking, and scripting.
        *   **Servo's FFI boundaries:**  Fuzz the interfaces between Servo's Rust code and any external C/C++ libraries (e.g., graphics libraries, system libraries).
        *   **Servo's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript parsers:**  Fuzz the parsing logic for web content, including edge cases and malformed inputs.
        *   **Servo's DOM implementation:** Fuzz the Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation and event handling.
        *   **Servo's layout and rendering engine:** Fuzz the algorithms responsible for calculating layout and rendering web pages.
        *   **Servo's networking stack:** Fuzz the handling of HTTP requests and responses.
        *   **Servo's WebIDL bindings:** Fuzz the interfaces between Rust and JavaScript.
    2.  **Servo-Specific Fuzzers:** Utilize Rust-aware fuzzers like `cargo-fuzz` (libFuzzer), `AFL++` (with Rust support), and Honggfuzz, configured to understand Rust's memory model.
    3.  **Servo Build Integration:** Integrate fuzzing directly into Servo's build system and continuous integration (CI) pipeline.
    4.  **Servo-Specific Seed Corpus:** Create a seed corpus of inputs specifically designed to test Servo's features and components (e.g., valid and invalid HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Memory Corruption in Servo (High Severity):** Buffer overflows, use-after-free, etc., specifically within Servo's Rust code.
    *   **DoS in Servo (Medium to High Severity):** Inputs causing Servo to crash, hang, or consume excessive resources.
    *   **Logic Errors in Servo (Variable Severity):**  Unexpected behavior in Servo's core components.
    *   **Integer Overflows in Servo (Medium Severity):**  Especially within `unsafe` code or FFI boundaries.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Memory Corruption:** High reduction in Servo-specific memory corruption vulnerabilities (e.g., 70-90%).
    *   **DoS:** Significant reduction in Servo-specific DoS vulnerabilities (e.g., 50-80%).
    *   **Logic Errors:** Moderate reduction in Servo-specific logic errors (e.g., 30-60%).
    *   **Integer Overflows:** High reduction in Servo-specific integer overflows (e.g., 60-80%).

*   **Currently Implemented (Hypothetical):**
    *   Likely partially implemented, with some fuzzing of core components.

*   **Missing Implementation (Hypothetical):**
    *   Comprehensive fuzzing of *all* `unsafe` blocks and FFI boundaries within Servo.
    *   Dedicated, distributed fuzzing infrastructure specifically for Servo.
    *   Regular, automated triage and remediation of Servo-specific fuzzing findings.

    1.  **Servo `unsafe` Inventory:** Maintain a complete and up-to-date inventory of all `unsafe` code blocks within the Servo codebase.
    2.  **Servo-Specific Review Process:**  Implement a mandatory, multi-reviewer code review process specifically for *any* changes to `unsafe` code within Servo.  Reviewers must have deep expertise in Rust's safety model and Servo's architecture.
    3.  **Servo-Specific Justification:**  Require detailed documentation for each `unsafe` block in Servo, explaining its necessity, potential risks, and maintained invariants.
    4.  **Servo-Specific Minimization:**  Actively seek to refactor Servo's code to reduce the reliance on `unsafe` code, prioritizing safe Rust alternatives whenever feasible.
