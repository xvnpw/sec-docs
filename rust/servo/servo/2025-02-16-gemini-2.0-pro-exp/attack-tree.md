## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities in Servo [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_memory_corruption_vulnerabilities_in_servo__high_risk_.md)

**1.2 Bypass Rust's Safety Checks (Unsafe Code) [HIGH RISK]**

*   **1.2.1 Identify Vulnerabilities in `unsafe` Blocks [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:**  `unsafe` code in Rust bypasses the language's built-in memory safety guarantees.  Vulnerabilities here can lead directly to memory corruption (use-after-free, double-free, buffer overflows, etc.).
    *   **Attack Vector (1.2.1.1 Static Analysis of Servo's Codebase):**  The attacker would use static analysis tools (e.g., Clippy, manual code review) to examine the `unsafe` blocks in Servo's source code, looking for potential flaws in pointer arithmetic, memory management, or interactions with external libraries.
    *   **Mitigation:** Rigorous code review, static analysis, formal verification (where feasible).

*   **1.2.2 Exploit Logic Errors in `unsafe` Code Interactions [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** Even if the `unsafe` code itself is seemingly correct, interactions between `unsafe` and safe Rust code can introduce vulnerabilities.  This might involve incorrect assumptions about data lifetimes, race conditions, or unexpected behavior from compiler optimizations.
    *   **Attack Vector (1.2.2.1 Fuzz `unsafe` Function Calls with Malformed Data):** The attacker would use fuzzing techniques to provide a wide range of malformed or unexpected inputs to functions that use `unsafe` code, aiming to trigger crashes or unexpected behavior that reveals memory corruption.
    *   **Mitigation:** Extensive fuzzing, careful design of `unsafe` code interfaces, minimizing the scope of `unsafe` blocks.

*   **1.3 Vulnerabilities in External Crates (Dependencies) [HIGH RISK]**

    *   **1.3.1 Identify Vulnerable Dependencies**
        *   **Description:** Servo, like most software, relies on external libraries (crates).  These dependencies may contain vulnerabilities.
        *   **Attack Vector (1.3.1.1 Audit Servo's Cargo.toml and Cargo.lock):** The attacker would examine Servo's dependency files (Cargo.toml and Cargo.lock) to identify the specific versions of libraries being used.  They would then cross-reference these versions with vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE databases, RustSec Advisory Database) to find known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Mitigation:** Regular dependency audits, using tools like `cargo audit`, keeping dependencies up-to-date.

    *   **1.3.2 Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Dependencies [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** Once a vulnerable dependency is identified, the attacker can exploit it.
        *   **Attack Vector (1.3.2.1 Craft Input Targeting Specific Dependency Weaknesses):** The attacker would craft specific inputs (e.g., malformed images, specially crafted HTML) designed to trigger the known vulnerability in the dependency.  For example, if a vulnerable image parsing library is used, the attacker would provide a malicious image file.
        *   **Mitigation:**  Promptly update vulnerable dependencies, apply security patches, consider using a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Logic Errors in Servo's Core Functionality](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_logic_errors_in_servo's_core_functionality.md)

*    **2.1 Bypass Security Checks in Scripting (JavaScript)**
    *    **2.1.1 Exploit SpiderMonkey (JavaScript Engine) Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]**
        *    **Description:** Vulnerabilities within the SpiderMonkey JavaScript engine itself can be exploited.
        *    **Attack Vector (2.1.1.1 Craft Malicious JavaScript to Trigger Engine Bugs):** The attacker crafts malicious JavaScript code designed to trigger bugs or vulnerabilities within the SpiderMonkey engine. This could involve exploiting JIT compiler flaws, type confusion errors, or other engine-specific weaknesses.
        *    **Mitigation:** Keep SpiderMonkey updated to the latest version; implement robust sandboxing and isolation for JavaScript execution.

    *    **2.1.2 Escape Sandbox Restrictions (if any) [CRITICAL]**
        *    **Description:** If Servo employs sandboxing to restrict the capabilities of JavaScript code, an attacker might try to escape the sandbox.
        *    **Attack Vector (2.1.2.1 Find Weaknesses in Servo's Sandbox Implementation):** The attacker would analyze Servo's sandbox implementation (which might involve process isolation, capability restrictions, or other techniques) to find flaws that allow them to break out of the sandbox and gain access to the host system.
        *    **Mitigation:** Employ a multi-layered sandboxing approach; regularly audit and test the sandbox implementation; use well-established sandboxing technologies.

*   **2.2 Manipulate Resource Loading**

    *   **2.2.1 Bypass Same-Origin Policy (SOP) [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** The Same-Origin Policy (SOP) is a critical web security mechanism that prevents scripts from one origin (e.g., `https://example.com`) from accessing data from another origin (e.g., `https://malicious.com`). Bypassing SOP allows for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and data theft.
        *   **Attack Vector (2.2.1.1 Craft Malicious HTML/JS to Circumvent SOP Checks):** The attacker would craft malicious HTML and JavaScript code that exploits flaws in Servo's SOP implementation. This might involve finding edge cases in URL parsing, exploiting race conditions, or leveraging other browser-specific quirks.
        *   **Mitigation:** Rigorous testing of SOP implementation, adherence to web standards, using a Content Security Policy (CSP).

    *   **2.2.2 Load Malicious Resources (e.g., DLLs, shared objects) [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** If an attacker can trick Servo into loading a malicious dynamic library (DLL on Windows, shared object on Linux/macOS), they can achieve arbitrary code execution.
        *   **Attack Vector (2.2.2.1 Exploit Weaknesses in Resource Fetching Logic):** The attacker would exploit vulnerabilities in Servo's resource fetching mechanisms (e.g., URL handling, content type validation) to cause it to load a malicious library. This might involve using obscure URL schemes, exploiting path traversal vulnerabilities, or manipulating MIME types.
        *   **Mitigation:** Strict validation of resource URLs and content types, limiting the types of resources that can be loaded, using code signing and integrity checks.
