# Threat Model Analysis for servo/servo

## Threat: [Use-After-Free in DOM Manipulation](./threats/use-after-free_in_dom_manipulation.md)

*   **Threat:** Use-After-Free in DOM Manipulation

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious HTML or JavaScript that triggers a use-after-free vulnerability during DOM manipulation.  The attacker might create an element, manipulate its properties or event handlers, then free the underlying memory, and subsequently trigger code that attempts to access the freed memory.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the context of the Servo rendering process. This could lead to complete compromise of the application using Servo.
    *   **Affected Component:** Servo's DOM implementation (`servo/components/dom`), specifically functions related to element creation, modification, and destruction.  Event handling logic is also a potential target.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Rigorous code review of the DOM implementation, focusing on memory management and object lifetimes.
        *   Extensive fuzzing targeting DOM manipulation functions with various HTML and JavaScript inputs.
        *   Use of memory safety analysis tools (e.g., AddressSanitizer, Valgrind with custom suppressions if needed) during testing.
        *   Staying up-to-date with Servo releases, which will include patches for discovered vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Buffer Overflow in CSS Parsing](./threats/buffer_overflow_in_css_parsing.md)

*   **Threat:** Buffer Overflow in CSS Parsing

    *   **Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted CSS stylesheet containing overly long property values, selectors, or other constructs that cause a buffer overflow during parsing. This could overwrite adjacent memory, potentially leading to controlled data corruption or code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for arbitrary code execution or denial of service. The severity depends on the location and nature of the overflow.
    *   **Affected Component:** Servo's CSS parsing engine (`servo/components/style`), specifically functions within the parser that handle string processing and buffer allocation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Fuzzing specifically targeting the CSS parser with a wide range of valid and invalid CSS inputs.
        *   Code review of the CSS parsing logic, paying close attention to buffer handling and string manipulation.
        *   Use of memory safety analysis tools.
        *   Consider using a CSS sanitizer to limit the complexity of CSS that Servo processes, if the application doesn't control the CSS source.
        *   Staying up-to-date with Servo releases.

## Threat: [JavaScript Engine (SpiderMonkey) Type Confusion](./threats/javascript_engine__spidermonkey__type_confusion.md)

*   **Threat:** JavaScript Engine (SpiderMonkey) Type Confusion

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a type confusion vulnerability in SpiderMonkey (Servo's JavaScript engine) using malicious JavaScript. Type confusion occurs when the engine incorrectly assumes the type of a JavaScript object, leading to memory access violations.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the context of the JavaScript engine, which can then be used to attack the rest of the Servo process.
    *   **Affected Component:** SpiderMonkey (integrated within Servo), specifically the JIT compiler, garbage collector, and object representation logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep SpiderMonkey (and therefore Servo) *absolutely up-to-date*. This is the primary defense against SpiderMonkey vulnerabilities.
        *   Monitor for security advisories related to SpiderMonkey and apply patches immediately.
        *   Consider sandboxing JavaScript execution if possible, to limit the impact of a successful exploit.
        *   Use Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the capabilities of JavaScript, especially `unsafe-eval` and `unsafe-inline`.
        *   If feasible, disable JavaScript entirely if it's not strictly required by the application.

## Threat: [Data Race in Parallel Layout](./threats/data_race_in_parallel_layout.md)

*   **Threat:** Data Race in Parallel Layout

    *   **Description:** Due to Servo's highly parallel architecture, a data race could occur in the layout engine if multiple threads access and modify shared data without proper synchronization.  This could lead to inconsistent state and potentially exploitable vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Unpredictable behavior, potential crashes, or, in the worst case, exploitable memory corruption.
    *   **Affected Component:** Servo's layout engine (`servo/components/layout`), specifically code related to parallel layout calculations and shared data structures.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thorough code review of the layout engine, focusing on concurrency and synchronization primitives.
        *   Use of thread sanitizers (e.g., ThreadSanitizer) during testing to detect data races.
        *   Careful design of data structures and algorithms to minimize shared mutable state.
        *   Staying up-to-date with Servo releases.

## Threat: [Improper handling of WebSockets leading to connection hijacking.](./threats/improper_handling_of_websockets_leading_to_connection_hijacking.md)

*   **Threat:** Improper handling of WebSockets leading to connection hijacking.

    *   **Description:** If Servo is used to handle WebSocket connections, a vulnerability in the WebSocket implementation could allow an attacker to hijack or interfere with WebSocket communication.
    *   **Impact:** Data interception, modification, or injection into WebSocket communication.
    *   **Affected Component:** Servo's WebSocket implementation (likely within `servo/components/net` or a related module).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Servo's WebSocket implementation up-to-date.
        *   Implement proper authentication and authorization for WebSocket connections.
        *   Validate and sanitize all data sent and received over WebSockets.
        *   Use secure WebSockets (WSS) with TLS encryption.
