# Threat Model Analysis for valeriansaliou/sonic

## Threat: [Weak or Default Sonic Password](./threats/weak_or_default_sonic_password.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could attempt to brute-force or guess the Sonic password if it is weak or left at the default. If successful, they gain unauthorized access to Sonic's control and ingest channels, allowing them to manipulate Sonic directly.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized index manipulation (data corruption, deletion).
    *   Data loss within Sonic index.
    *   Denial of service by disrupting Sonic operations.
    *   Unauthorized access to search functionality, potentially bypassing application access controls.
*   **Sonic Component Affected:** Authentication mechanism, Control Channel, Ingest Channel.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use strong, randomly generated passwords for Sonic.
    *   Store passwords securely using environment variables or secrets management systems, not in plaintext configuration files.
    *   Regularly rotate Sonic passwords.
    *   Restrict network access to Sonic channels to only authorized IPs or networks.

## Threat: [Password Exposure in Configuration File](./threats/password_exposure_in_configuration_file.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could gain access to the Sonic configuration file (e.g., through misconfigured permissions, exposed backups, or insecure configuration management). If the Sonic password is stored in plaintext in this file, it will be compromised, granting full control over Sonic.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Full compromise of Sonic access, bypassing authentication.
    *   Unauthorized index manipulation (data corruption, deletion).
    *   Data loss within Sonic index.
    *   Denial of service by completely controlling Sonic.
    *   Unauthorized access to search functionality, bypassing all intended application security.
*   **Sonic Component Affected:** Configuration file, Authentication mechanism.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Securely store and manage the Sonic configuration file with highly restricted access permissions.
    *   Avoid storing the password directly in the configuration file. Utilize environment variables or dedicated secrets management systems.
    *   Encrypt the configuration file at rest if possible.
    *   Regularly audit access to the configuration file and the systems where it is stored.

## Threat: [Unencrypted Data Transmission](./threats/unencrypted_data_transmission.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker performing network eavesdropping could intercept plaintext data transmitted between the application and Sonic if the connection is not encrypted. This exposes sensitive data being indexed and searched through Sonic.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data breaches and confidentiality loss of indexed data transmitted to Sonic.
    *   Exposure of sensitive search queries, potentially revealing user behavior and confidential information.
*   **Sonic Component Affected:** Network communication, TCP protocol.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce encrypted communication using TLS/SSL between the application and Sonic. This can be achieved using a reverse proxy (like Nginx or HAProxy) configured for TLS termination, or by establishing a VPN between the application and Sonic server.
    *   Ensure Sonic and the application communicate over a trusted and secure network segment, minimizing exposure to untrusted networks.

## Threat: [Data Leakage through Search Results](./threats/data_leakage_through_search_results.md)

*   **Description:** If Sonic indexes data without proper consideration for access control, or if application-level authorization is insufficient, an attacker could potentially retrieve unauthorized sensitive information by crafting specific search queries. This is a direct consequence of how data is indexed and made searchable by Sonic.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized access to sensitive data through search results provided by Sonic.
    *   Privacy violations and potential data breaches due to Sonic exposing data it shouldn't for certain users.
*   **Sonic Component Affected:** Search Channel, Search functionality, Indexing process (if not considering access control during indexing).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully consider what data is indexed in Sonic and ensure sensitive data is only indexed if necessary and with appropriate access controls in mind at the application level.
    *   Implement robust application-level authorization to filter search results based on the requesting user's permissions *before* presenting them to the user.  Ensure the application logic prevents unauthorized data from being returned from Sonic searches.
    *   If possible, pre-filter data *before* indexing into Sonic to only include data that should be broadly searchable, and handle more granular access control at the application data retrieval layer, not solely relying on Sonic's search capabilities for security.

## Threat: [Sonic Server Crashes due to Bugs or Exploits](./threats/sonic_server_crashes_due_to_bugs_or_exploits.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could discover and exploit vulnerabilities within Sonic's code (e.g., memory safety issues, logic flaws, or unhandled exceptions) by sending crafted requests or data to Sonic. This could lead to the Sonic server crashing and causing a denial of service.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of service for search functionality, rendering the application's search features unavailable.
    *   Application downtime if search functionality is critical.
    *   Potential data loss or index corruption if crashes occur during write operations or index updates within Sonic.
*   **Sonic Component Affected:** Sonic server core, potentially all modules depending on the vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (potential for Critical depending on exploitability and impact)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Sonic updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
    *   Monitor Sonic server for crashes and unexpected restarts. Implement automated restart mechanisms to recover from crashes quickly.
    *   In a development or staging environment, perform security testing and vulnerability scanning against Sonic to proactively identify potential weaknesses.
    *   Consider using a process manager to monitor and manage the Sonic process, ensuring it restarts automatically upon failure.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Sonic, being written in Rust, relies on external Rust crates (dependencies). Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could indirectly affect Sonic's security. An attacker could exploit known vulnerabilities in these dependencies if they exist in the version used by Sonic.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Potential denial of service, data breaches, or even remote code execution within the Sonic server, depending on the nature and severity of the dependency vulnerability.
*   **Sonic Component Affected:** Dependencies, indirectly affecting potentially all modules that rely on the vulnerable dependency.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (potential for Critical depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly audit and update Sonic's dependencies to address known vulnerabilities. Utilize tools that can scan for known vulnerabilities in Rust crate dependencies.
    *   Stay informed about security advisories related to Rust crates used by Sonic and the Rust ecosystem in general.
    *   Consider using dependency pinning or vendoring to have more control over dependency versions and ensure consistent builds, while still regularly checking for updates.
    *   When possible, contribute to or support efforts to improve the security of the Rust crate ecosystem and report any discovered vulnerabilities in Sonic's dependencies.
