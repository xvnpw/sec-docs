# Attack Surface Analysis for valeriansaliou/sonic

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected Sonic Port Exposure](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_sonic_port_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Sonic ports (default 1491 and 1492) are directly accessible from untrusted networks (e.g., the public internet).
*   **Sonic Contribution:** Sonic is designed for network communication, and its default configuration might not include network access restrictions, leading to open ports.
*   **Example:** A Sonic instance is deployed on a cloud server, and its ports are open to the internet without firewall rules. An attacker scans the internet, finds the open ports, and attempts to connect to the Sonic Control API.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Sonic's APIs, data breaches, data manipulation, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Deploy Sonic within a private network or subnet, isolated from public networks.
    *   **Firewall Rules:** Implement strict firewall rules to allow access to Sonic ports only from trusted IP addresses or networks (e.g., application servers).
    *   **VPN/SSH Tunneling:** Access Sonic only through secure channels like VPNs or SSH tunnels when remote access is necessary.

## Attack Surface: [Unencrypted Network Communication](./attack_surfaces/unencrypted_network_communication.md)

*   **Description:** Communication between the application and Sonic over the network is not encrypted (using TLS/SSL).
*   **Sonic Contribution:** By default, Sonic communication is over plain TCP, lacking built-in encryption mechanisms.
*   **Example:** Search queries containing sensitive user data are sent from the application to Sonic over an unencrypted network. An attacker on the same network performs a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack and intercepts the queries, gaining access to the sensitive data.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, exposure of sensitive information (search queries, indexed data), potential manipulation of communication.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enable TLS Encryption:** Configure Sonic to use TLS encryption for network communication. (Refer to Sonic documentation for TLS configuration if available, or consider using network-level TLS termination if Sonic itself doesn't support it directly).
    *   **VPN/Encrypted Tunnel:** Encapsulate Sonic traffic within an encrypted VPN tunnel or other secure tunnel to protect data in transit.
    *   **Secure Network Infrastructure:** Ensure the network infrastructure itself is secure and trusted to minimize the risk of eavesdropping.

## Attack Surface: [Weak or Default Authentication](./attack_surfaces/weak_or_default_authentication.md)

*   **Description:** Sonic uses a simple password-based authentication, and weak or default passwords are used, or authentication mechanisms are bypassed.
*   **Sonic Contribution:** Sonic's authentication relies on a shared password. Weak passwords directly compromise Sonic's security.
*   **Example:** The default password for Sonic is not changed after installation. An attacker finds the default password online or through documentation and uses it to authenticate to the Sonic Control API, gaining full control.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Sonic's APIs, data breaches, data manipulation, denial of service, complete compromise of the search backend.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Passwords:** Generate and use strong, unique, and randomly generated passwords for Sonic authentication.
    *   **Password Management:** Securely store and manage Sonic passwords, avoiding hardcoding them in application code or configuration files.
    *   **Regular Password Rotation:** Implement a policy for regular password rotation for Sonic.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** If possible, limit the privileges of the authenticated user to the minimum required for the application's functionality.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in Sonic's input processing (ingestion commands, search queries) allow attackers to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the Sonic server.
*   **Sonic Contribution:** Sonic's API processes commands and data. Insufficient input validation can lead to injection vulnerabilities within Sonic's processing logic.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious `PUSH` command with specially crafted data that, when processed by Sonic, executes a system command on the Sonic server, allowing them to gain shell access.
*   **Impact:** Complete server compromise, data breaches, data manipulation, denial of service, lateral movement within the network.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize all input data sent to Sonic's APIs, including ingestion commands and search queries, on the application side *before* sending to Sonic.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Sonic Process):** Run the Sonic process with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of a successful command injection.
    *   **Security Audits and Code Reviews:** Conduct regular security audits and code reviews of Sonic's codebase (if feasible and if you have access to it) to identify and fix potential injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Sandboxing/Containerization:** Deploy Sonic within a sandboxed environment or container to limit the impact of a successful exploit.

## Attack Surface: [Data Injection and Pollution](./attack_surfaces/data_injection_and_pollution.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious or excessive data into Sonic indexes, disrupting search functionality, polluting data, or causing significant impact on application functionality.
*   **Sonic Contribution:** Sonic's ingestion API allows data to be added to indexes. Lack of proper validation or rate limiting on the application side can be exploited.
*   **Example:** An attacker repeatedly sends `PUSH` commands with spam data or malicious content to pollute the search index, causing legitimate search results to be inaccurate or compromised, impacting core application features relying on search.
*   **Impact:** Degraded search quality, inaccurate search results, data integrity issues, application logic errors, potential denial of service due to resource exhaustion, business disruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization (Data):** Validate and sanitize data *before* indexing it in Sonic to prevent injection of malicious content. Implement robust validation on the application side.
    *   **Rate Limiting (Ingestion):** Implement rate limiting on ingestion API requests on the application side to prevent excessive data injection.
    *   **Data Size Limits:** Implement limits on the size of indexed documents and overall index size on the application side to prevent resource exhaustion.
    *   **Content Security Policies:** If indexed data is displayed in the application, implement Content Security Policies (CSP) to mitigate risks from injected malicious content.
    *   **Regular Data Audits:** Periodically audit indexed data for anomalies or malicious content and implement mechanisms to clean or remove polluted data.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion via DoS](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_via_dos.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit Sonic's resource consumption patterns to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by overwhelming the service with requests or data, leading to significant application downtime.
*   **Sonic Contribution:** Sonic, like any service, has resource limits. Exploiting resource-intensive operations within Sonic's capabilities can lead to DoS.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a flood of complex search queries or large ingestion requests to Sonic, overwhelming its CPU, memory, or network resources, making it unresponsive to legitimate application requests and causing application downtime.
*   **Impact:** Service unavailability, application downtime, degraded performance for legitimate users, business disruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rate Limiting (API Requests):** Implement rate limiting on all Sonic API requests (search and ingestion) on the application side to prevent request floods.
    *   **Resource Limits (Sonic Instance):** Configure resource limits for the Sonic process (CPU, memory) at the operating system or container level.
    *   **Query Complexity Limits:** If possible, implement limits on the complexity or resource consumption of search queries on the application side.
    *   **Load Balancing and Redundancy:** Deploy Sonic behind a load balancer and in a redundant configuration to improve resilience to DoS attacks.
    *   **Network-Level DoS Protection:** Utilize network-level DoS protection mechanisms (e.g., DDoS mitigation services) to filter malicious traffic before it reaches Sonic.
