## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization for Sonic Commands](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization_for_sonic_commands.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Sonic Command Input Validation and Sanitization
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sonic command inputs:** Pinpoint all locations in your application code where user-provided data is incorporated into commands sent to the Sonic server (e.g., in `QUERY`, `PUSH`, `POP` commands).
    2.  **Define Sonic protocol validation rules:** Understand Sonic's text-based protocol syntax. Determine allowed characters and structures for command parameters like `BUCKET`, `COLLECTION`, `OBJECT`, and `TEXT`. Create whitelists for these parameters based on your application's needs.
    3.  **Implement Sonic-specific input validation:** Before sending commands to Sonic, validate all user inputs against the defined Sonic protocol rules. Use string manipulation, regular expressions, or custom validation functions to enforce these rules.
    4.  **Sanitize for Sonic protocol:** Sanitize input by escaping or encoding characters that have special meaning in Sonic's protocol (e.g., spaces, newlines, command delimiters) if they are not intended as protocol control characters. Ensure proper encoding to prevent misinterpretation by Sonic.
    5.  **Reject invalid Sonic commands:** If input validation fails for a Sonic command, reject the entire command and handle the error appropriately in your application. Do not send malformed commands to Sonic.
    6.  **Log invalid Sonic command attempts:** Log instances where input fails Sonic command validation. This helps detect potential injection attempts targeting Sonic's protocol.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Sonic Command Injection (High Severity):** Attackers could inject malicious Sonic commands by manipulating input fields, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or denial of service within Sonic.
    *   **Sonic Protocol Confusion (Medium Severity):**  Improperly formatted input could confuse Sonic, leading to unexpected behavior, errors, or potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Sonic Command Injection:** High Risk Reduction. Effectively prevents command injection attacks targeting Sonic's protocol if validation and sanitization are comprehensive.
    *   **Sonic Protocol Confusion:** Medium Risk Reduction. Reduces the risk of unexpected behavior and errors caused by malformed commands sent to Sonic.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Example Project:** Partially implemented for search queries. Basic validation exists, but might not be fully comprehensive for all Sonic command parameters and special characters.  Sanitization specifically for Sonic protocol encoding is not explicitly implemented.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Example Project:**  Validation and sanitization are not consistently applied to all input points that generate Sonic commands, especially in indexing functionalities.  Sonic protocol-specific encoding and escaping needs to be implemented to ensure robust protection against command injection.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sonic API Key Management and Least Privilege](./mitigation_strategies/sonic_api_key_management_and_least_privilege.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Sonic API Key Management and Least Privilege
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize Sonic API Keys (if authentication is enabled):** If Sonic's authentication mechanism is used, leverage API keys for controlling access to Sonic.
    2.  **Create dedicated API keys:** Generate separate API keys for different application components or functionalities that interact with Sonic. Avoid using a single, shared API key for all interactions.
    3.  **Apply Principle of Least Privilege to API Keys:** Grant each API key only the minimum necessary permissions required for its specific function. For example, a key used only for search should not have indexing or administrative privileges.
    4.  **Securely store and manage API Keys:** Store API keys securely, avoiding hardcoding them directly in application code. Use environment variables, secure configuration management systems, or dedicated secrets management solutions.
    5.  **Regularly rotate API Keys:** Implement a process for periodically rotating Sonic API keys to limit the impact of potential key compromise.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Sonic Access via API Keys (High Severity):** If API keys are compromised or overly permissive, attackers could gain unauthorized access to Sonic and its data.
    *   **Privilege Escalation within Sonic (Medium Severity):**  Overly privileged API keys could be exploited to perform actions beyond the intended scope, leading to privilege escalation within the Sonic context.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Sonic Access via API Keys:** High Risk Reduction.  Proper API key management significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access through compromised or misused keys.
    *   **Privilege Escalation within Sonic:** Medium Risk Reduction.  Applying least privilege to API keys limits the potential damage from compromised keys and reduces the attack surface for privilege escalation within Sonic.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Example Project:** API keys are not currently actively used for Sonic authentication, relying primarily on network segmentation.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Example Project:** Implementation of Sonic API key authentication and management is missing.  Generating dedicated keys with limited privileges and secure key storage/rotation processes are needed to enhance access control to Sonic itself.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sonic Resource Monitoring and Limits](./mitigation_strategies/sonic_resource_monitoring_and_limits.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Sonic Resource Monitoring and Limits
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor Sonic server resources:** Implement monitoring specifically for the Sonic server's resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network). Use system monitoring tools or explore if Sonic exposes any internal metrics that can be monitored.
    2.  **Establish baseline Sonic resource usage:** Determine normal resource consumption patterns for Sonic under typical application load to identify deviations.
    3.  **Set alerts for Sonic resource spikes:** Configure alerts to notify administrators when Sonic resource usage exceeds established thresholds. This can indicate potential DoS attacks targeting Sonic or performance issues within Sonic itself.
    4.  **Configure Sonic resource limits (if available in Sonic configuration):** Investigate Sonic's configuration options for any settings that allow limiting resource consumption, such as maximum concurrent connections, query processing limits, or memory usage limits. Configure these limits if available and applicable to your environment.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Sonic Denial of Service (DoS) (High Severity):** Protects Sonic from DoS attacks that aim to overwhelm the Sonic server with excessive requests or resource-intensive operations.
    *   **Sonic Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Prevents Sonic from becoming unstable or unresponsive due to resource exhaustion caused by legitimate but excessive load or misconfigurations within Sonic.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Sonic Denial of Service:** High Risk Reduction. Monitoring and resource limits help mitigate the impact of DoS attacks specifically targeting Sonic's resources.
    *   **Sonic Resource Exhaustion:** Medium Risk Reduction. Improves Sonic's stability and availability by preventing resource exhaustion scenarios.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Example Project:** Basic server-level resource monitoring is in place, but not specifically tailored to Sonic's internal metrics or resource consumption patterns.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Example Project:** Dedicated monitoring of Sonic-specific resource usage is missing.  Alerting based on Sonic resource spikes is not configured.  Exploration and implementation of Sonic-configurable resource limits (if available) are needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Sonic Configuration Review and Updates](./mitigation_strategies/secure_sonic_configuration_review_and_updates.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regular Sonic Configuration Review and Updates
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish a schedule for Sonic configuration reviews:** Define a regular schedule (e.g., quarterly, annually) for reviewing Sonic's configuration files and settings.
    2.  **Review Sonic configuration for security best practices:** During reviews, check for insecure settings, default configurations, or outdated parameters in Sonic's configuration. Ensure configurations align with security best practices and the principle of least privilege.
    3.  **Stay informed about Sonic security updates:** Subscribe to Sonic's release notes, security mailing lists, or monitor project repositories for security announcements and updates.
