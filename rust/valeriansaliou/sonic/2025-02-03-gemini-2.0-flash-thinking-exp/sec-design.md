  - Risk of service disruption if the search backend becomes unavailable, impacting dependent applications.
  - Risk of data integrity issues if indexed data is corrupted or tampered with, leading to incorrect search results.
  - Risk of performance degradation if the system is not properly scaled or optimized, affecting search speed and user experience.
  - Risk of reputational damage if security vulnerabilities are exploited, leading to data leaks or service outages.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security Controls:
  - security control: HTTPS for API communication (assumed, standard practice for web services). Implemented in: Network configuration and application deployment.
  - security control: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for administrative API endpoints (assumed, based on common security needs for data management systems). Implemented in: Application code and configuration.
  - security control: Input validation on API requests (assumed, standard secure coding practice). Implemented in: Application code.
  - security control: Dependency scanning for known vulnerabilities in used libraries (assumed, as part of modern software development). Implemented in: Build process (if automated).
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Lack of formal security audit by a third-party security firm.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for vulnerability discovery and patching.
  - accepted risk: Potential for zero-day vulnerabilities in dependencies or core code.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent denial-of-service attacks.
  - security control: Regularly perform static application security testing (SAST) and dynamic application security testing (DAST) on the codebase.
  - security control: Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring of security-relevant events, including API access and errors.
  - security control: Consider data-at-rest encryption for sensitive indexed data.
  - security control: Implement a robust vulnerability management process, including timely patching and security updates.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: Secure authentication mechanism for administrative API endpoints to control access to sensitive operations like index management and configuration.
    - Requirement: Consider API keys or tokens for authentication of applications accessing the search API.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Implement fine-grained authorization controls to restrict access to specific data or operations based on user roles or application permissions.
    - Requirement: Ensure that only authorized applications or users can perform administrative tasks.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Thoroughly validate all inputs to the API to prevent injection attacks (e.g., command injection, NoSQL injection).
    - Requirement: Sanitize input data before indexing to prevent stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if search results are displayed in a web context.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Use HTTPS for all API communication to protect data in transit.
    - Requirement: Consider encrypting sensitive data at rest if the indexed data warrants it.
    - Requirement: Ensure proper handling of cryptographic keys and secrets, avoiding hardcoding or insecure storage.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Providing search functionality to web and mobile applications, enabling users to find information quickly and efficiently.
  - Data ingestion and indexing process, ensuring that data is available for searching.
  - Administrative functions for managing and configuring the search backend.
- Data Sensitivity:
  - The sensitivity of data depends entirely on what data is indexed by Sonic. It could range from publicly available information to highly sensitive personal or business data.
  - If sensitive data is indexed, it requires appropriate security controls to protect its confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
  - Consider data types like: Personally Identifiable Information (PII), financial data, confidential business documents, etc.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What type of data will be indexed by Sonic in the target deployment environment? (Sensitivity level?)
  - What are the specific performance and scalability requirements for Sonic?
  - What authentication and authorization mechanisms are currently in place or planned for applications accessing Sonic?
  - Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) that need to be considered?
  - What is the expected deployment environment (cloud, on-premise, hybrid)?
- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to provide fast and reliable search functionality to enhance user experience. Availability and data integrity are important business priorities.
  - SECURITY POSTURE: HTTPS is used for API communication. Basic input validation is implemented. Role-Based Access Control is assumed for administrative functions. No formal security audits have been conducted.
  - DESIGN: Sonic is deployed as a cluster of instances behind a load balancer for high availability. Data is persisted in a file-based storage or database. The build process involves a CI/CD system with basic automated checks.
