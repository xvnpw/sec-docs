# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for valeriansaliou/sonic

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation and Sanitization for Sonic Queries](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation_and_sanitization_for_sonic_queries.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Specifically target user inputs that are directly used to construct queries for the Sonic search engine. This includes search terms, and any parameters that map to Sonic collections, buckets, or objects if exposed to users.
    2.  Define validation rules tailored to Sonic's query syntax. While currently simple, anticipate future complexity and restrict allowed characters, lengths, and formats to prevent unexpected interpretations by Sonic.
    3.  Implement server-side validation *before* passing any user input to the Sonic client library or constructing Sonic commands. This ensures that only validated and sanitized data reaches Sonic.
    4.  Sanitize input by escaping characters that might have special meaning within Sonic's query processing, even if not currently documented. This is a proactive measure against potential future injection vulnerabilities in Sonic itself.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Sonic Query Injection (High Severity):**  Prevents potential injection attacks targeting Sonic's query parsing logic, even if currently not publicly known. This is a proactive defense against future vulnerabilities in Sonic.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Malformed Sonic Queries (Medium Severity):**  Reduces the risk of sending malformed queries to Sonic that could cause errors or resource exhaustion within the Sonic engine itself.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Sonic Query Injection:** Significantly reduces the risk of future query injection vulnerabilities within Sonic by ensuring only safe and expected input is processed by the engine.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Malformed Sonic Queries:** Moderately reduces the risk of DoS by preventing Sonic from processing potentially problematic query structures.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic client-side validation exists for search terms in `src/js/search_bar.js`.
    *   Server-side validation in `backend/app/api.py` partially validates search terms before they are used in Sonic queries.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive server-side validation is needed for *all* user inputs that become part of Sonic queries, across all API endpoints interacting with Sonic.
    *   Sanitization needs to be enhanced to specifically escape characters relevant to Sonic's query processing, as a preventative measure.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting for Sonic Search Requests](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_for_sonic_search_requests.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Implement rate limiting specifically for requests that trigger searches against the Sonic engine. This focuses on controlling the volume of operations directed at Sonic.
    2.  Configure rate limits based on Sonic's performance characteristics and your application's expected search load. Monitor Sonic's resource usage to fine-tune rate limits effectively.
    3.  Apply rate limiting at the API level, before requests are forwarded to the Sonic client, to protect Sonic from being overwhelmed.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks Targeting Sonic (High Severity):**  Prevents attackers from overloading the Sonic search engine with excessive search requests, ensuring its availability and performance.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion on Sonic Server (Medium Severity):**  Protects the Sonic server from resource exhaustion due to a high volume of search operations, whether malicious or unintentional.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks Targeting Sonic:** Significantly reduces the impact of DoS attacks aimed at making the search functionality (powered by Sonic) unavailable.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion on Sonic Server:** Moderately reduces the risk of Sonic server instability or performance degradation due to excessive load.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic IP-based rate limiting is in place in `gateway/nginx.conf` for `/api/search` endpoints, indirectly protecting Sonic.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   More granular rate limiting directly tied to Sonic usage patterns could be beneficial.
    *   Consider rate limiting based on query complexity or resource consumption within Sonic, if feasible to measure.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Query Timeouts for Sonic Operations](./mitigation_strategies/query_timeouts_for_sonic_operations.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Set timeouts for all operations performed against the Sonic engine, specifically search queries and potentially indexing operations if exposed.
    2.  Configure timeouts within the application code when interacting with the Sonic client library to limit the execution time of Sonic commands.
    3.  Choose timeout values that are appropriate for typical Sonic query latencies in your environment. Monitor Sonic's performance to determine optimal timeout values.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Complex Sonic Queries (Medium Severity):**  Prevents complex or inefficient queries from consuming Sonic resources for extended periods, impacting overall Sonic performance.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion on Sonic Server due to Long Queries (Low Severity):**  Limits the resource consumption on the Sonic server caused by individual long-running queries, preventing resource starvation for other operations.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Complex Sonic Queries:** Moderately reduces the risk of DoS by preventing individual queries from monopolizing Sonic resources.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion on Sonic Server due to Long Queries:** Slightly reduces the risk of resource exhaustion on the Sonic server by limiting the duration of individual operations.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Query timeouts are set to 5 seconds in `backend/app/search_service.py` when using the Sonic client library.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Review and adjust timeout values based on observed Sonic performance and query complexity.
    *   Ensure timeouts are consistently applied to all types of interactions with Sonic, including indexing if applicable.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Access Control Lists (ACLs) within Sonic](./mitigation_strategies/access_control_lists__acls__within_sonic.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Utilize Sonic's built-in Access Control Lists (ACLs) to directly manage access to Sonic's collections, buckets, and objects.
    2.  Define ACL rules within Sonic's configuration to restrict operations based on the connecting client's IP address or, if Sonic supports it in future versions, authentication credentials.
    3.  Configure ACLs to enforce the principle of least privilege for components interacting with Sonic. For example, search components should only have read access to relevant Sonic resources.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Sonic Data (Medium Severity):**  Prevents unauthorized components or systems from accessing data indexed within Sonic, directly controlling access at the Sonic engine level.
    *   **Data Integrity Violation within Sonic (Medium Severity):**  Restricts unauthorized modification or deletion of data within Sonic by controlling write access through ACLs.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Sonic Data:** Moderately reduces the risk of data breaches or unauthorized data exposure by directly controlling access within Sonic.
    *   **Data Integrity Violation within Sonic:** Moderately reduces the risk of data corruption or loss within Sonic due to unauthorized modifications.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic ACLs in `sonic.cfg` restrict administrative access to Sonic to the application server's IP.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Implement more granular ACLs within Sonic to control access to specific collections and buckets, going beyond just administrative access.
    *   Explore if future Sonic versions offer more advanced ACL features (e.g., user-based authentication) for finer-grained control.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Sonic Configuration and Network Isolation](./mitigation_strategies/secure_sonic_configuration_and_network_isolation.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Securely configure the `sonic.cfg` file, disabling any unnecessary features or functionalities of the Sonic engine itself.
    2.  Isolate the Sonic server within a private network segment, ensuring it is not directly accessible from the public internet. This directly limits external access to the Sonic engine.
    3.  Use firewall rules to restrict network access to Sonic's port (1491) to only authorized internal IP addresses that require communication with Sonic.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Sonic Server (High Severity):**  Prevents unauthorized external access to the Sonic server and its data by limiting network exposure and securing configuration.
    *   **Data Breach via Direct Sonic Access (High Severity):**  Reduces the risk of data breaches by making it significantly harder for external attackers to directly interact with the Sonic engine and potentially extract data.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Sonic Server:** Significantly reduces the risk of external attackers gaining access to the Sonic server itself.
    *   **Data Breach via Direct Sonic Access:** Moderately reduces the risk of data breaches by limiting direct external interaction with Sonic.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Sonic is deployed in a private network, isolated from direct public internet access.
    *   Firewall rules restrict access to Sonic's port to internal application servers.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Conduct a detailed review of `sonic.cfg` to harden Sonic's configuration and disable any non-essential features.
    *   Consider further network segmentation to isolate Sonic in a dedicated, highly secure zone within the internal network.
