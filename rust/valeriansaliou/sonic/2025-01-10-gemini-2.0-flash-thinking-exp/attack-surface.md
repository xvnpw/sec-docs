# Attack Surface Analysis for valeriansaliou/sonic

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected Network Exposure of Sonic Instance](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_network_exposure_of_sonic_instance.md)

**Description:** The Sonic instance is accessible on a network beyond the application's internal trusted zone without proper network segmentation or access controls.

**How Sonic Contributes:** Sonic listens on a specific TCP port (default 1491) and, if not properly firewalled or isolated, can be directly accessed from potentially untrusted networks.

**Example:** An attacker scans network ranges and discovers the Sonic port is open. They can then attempt to connect directly and interact with the Sonic protocol.

**Impact:**  Direct access allows attackers to bypass application-level security, potentially leading to unauthorized data manipulation, denial of service, or information disclosure by interacting directly with Sonic's commands.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict firewall rules to restrict access to Sonic's port only from the application server(s).
* Deploy Sonic within an isolated network segment (e.g., a private subnet).
* Use network security groups or access control lists to further limit access.

## Attack Surface: [Weak or Default Sonic Authentication](./attack_surfaces/weak_or_default_sonic_authentication.md)

**Description:** The password used to authenticate with the Sonic instance is either the default or a weak, easily guessable password.

**How Sonic Contributes:** Sonic uses a simple password-based authentication mechanism for all administrative operations. A weak password provides a single point of failure.

**Example:** An attacker uses common default credentials or brute-force techniques to guess the Sonic password and gains administrative access.

**Impact:** Successful authentication allows attackers to perform any operation on the Sonic instance, including creating, modifying, or deleting indices, and injecting or retrieving data. This can lead to data corruption, data breaches, or denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Change the default Sonic password to a strong, unique password during deployment.
* Store the Sonic password securely (e.g., using environment variables or a secrets management system).
* Regularly rotate the Sonic password.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service via Excessive Sonic Requests](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service_via_excessive_sonic_requests.md)

**Description:** An attacker floods the Sonic instance with a large number of requests, overwhelming its resources and making it unavailable.

**How Sonic Contributes:** Sonic, like any service, has resource limits. Without proper rate limiting on the application's interaction with Sonic, an attacker can exploit this.

**Example:** An attacker scripts a process to send a massive number of search queries or indexing requests to the application, which in turn forwards them to Sonic, causing it to become overloaded and unresponsive.

**Impact:**  The search functionality of the application becomes unavailable, impacting users and potentially disrupting business operations.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement rate limiting on the application's interaction with the Sonic API (both indexing and searching).
* Monitor Sonic's resource usage (CPU, memory) and set up alerts for unusual activity.
* Consider implementing request queuing or throttling mechanisms on the application side.

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure via Overly Broad Search Functionality](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_via_overly_broad_search_functionality.md)

**Description:** The application's search functionality allows users to perform very broad searches that might expose sensitive data indexed in Sonic.

**How Sonic Contributes:** Sonic indexes the data it receives, and the application's search interface determines how users can query this data. If the application doesn't implement proper authorization and filtering on search queries, it can inadvertently expose sensitive information.

**Example:** A user performs a very general search term that returns results containing private customer data that they should not have access to.

**Impact:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive information, potentially leading to privacy violations, compliance issues, and reputational damage.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement granular access control and authorization checks on the application side before performing searches against Sonic.
* Filter search results based on user roles and permissions.
* Avoid indexing highly sensitive data in Sonic if it's not necessary for the search functionality.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sonic Configuration Details](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sonic_configuration_details.md)

**Description:** The Sonic configuration file, which contains the authentication password, is exposed due to insecure storage or access controls.

**How Sonic Contributes:** Sonic's security relies on the secrecy of its authentication password. If this is compromised, the entire instance is vulnerable.

**Example:** The Sonic configuration file is accidentally committed to a public repository or stored in a world-readable location on the server.

**Impact:**  Full compromise of the Sonic instance, allowing attackers to manipulate data, cause denial of service, or potentially gain further access to the application's environment.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Store the Sonic configuration file in a secure location with restricted access.
* Avoid hardcoding the Sonic password in the application code. Use environment variables or a secrets management system.
* Implement proper access control on the server where Sonic is deployed.
