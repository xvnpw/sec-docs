## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Channel Access Control (Sonic Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_channel_access_control__sonic_configuration_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Strict Channel Access Control (Sonic Configuration)

**Description:**
1.  **Configure Passwords:** In Sonic's `config.cfg`, set strong, unique passwords for the `search`, `push`, and `control` channels using the `[channel]` section and the `password` option.  Example:
    ```
    [channel]
    search = {
        password = "strongSearchPassword"
    }
    push = {
        password = "strongPushPassword"
    }
    control = {
        password = "strongControlPassword"
    }
    ```
2.  **Restart Sonic:** Restart the Sonic service for the password changes to take effect.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unauthorized Data Access (High Severity):** Prevents direct, unauthorized querying of the `search` channel.
*   **Unauthorized Data Modification (High Severity):** Prevents direct, unauthorized use of the `push` channel.
*   **Unauthorized Administrative Actions (Critical Severity):** Prevents direct, unauthorized use of the `control` channel.

**Impact:**
*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Risk significantly reduced (from High to Low).
*   **Unauthorized Data Modification:** Risk significantly reduced (from High to Low).
*   **Unauthorized Administrative Actions:** Risk significantly reduced (from Critical to Low).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Passwords are set for all channels in `config.cfg`.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Automated password rotation is not implemented (this would require external scripting and is not a direct Sonic configuration).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Control Channel Security (Sonic Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/control_channel_security__sonic_configuration_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Control Channel Security (Sonic Configuration)

**Description:**
1.  **Strong Control Password:** As part of the "Strict Channel Access Control," ensure the `control` channel password in `config.cfg` is exceptionally strong and unique.
2.  **Restart Sonic:** Restart the Sonic service after changing the control password.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unauthorized Administrative Actions (Critical Severity):** Prevents attackers from gaining control of the Sonic instance.

**Impact:**
*   **Unauthorized Administrative Actions:** Risk significantly reduced (from Critical to Low).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   A strong password is set for the control channel in `config.cfg`.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   No direct Sonic configuration options exist for auditing control commands (this would require modifying Sonic's source code or using a proxy).
*   Automated password rotation is not a direct Sonic configuration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configuration Hardening (Sonic `config.cfg`)](./mitigation_strategies/configuration_hardening__sonic__config_cfg__.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Configuration Hardening (Sonic `config.cfg`)

**Description:**
1.  **Review `config.cfg`:** Thoroughly review all settings in Sonic's `config.cfg` file.
2.  **`timeout_ms_*` Settings:** Configure appropriate timeouts in the `[network]` section to prevent long-running operations:
    *   `timeout_ms_connect`: Timeout for establishing a connection.
    *   `timeout_ms_read`: Timeout for reading data.
    *   `timeout_ms_write`: Timeout for writing data.
3.  **`log_path`:** Ensure the `log_path` in the `[store]` section points to a secure, restricted-access directory.
4.  **Disable Unused Features:** If any channels (search, push, control) are not used, consider disabling them (although this is primarily managed through application-level access control). There isn't a direct "disable" option in `config.cfg`, so this relies on *not* using the channel and securing it with a strong password.
5. **`tcp_keepalive_ms`:** Set tcp_keepalive_ms to prevent half-open connections.
6.  **Restart Sonic:** Restart the Sonic service after making any configuration changes.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Timeouts help prevent resource exhaustion from slow or malicious clients.
*   **Information Leakage (Medium Severity):** Secure `log_path` prevents sensitive information from being exposed in logs.

**Impact:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Risk reduced (from Medium to Low).
*   **Information Leakage:** Risk reduced (from Medium to Low).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   `log_path` is set to a secure directory.
*   Basic timeouts (`timeout_ms_read`, `timeout_ms_write`) are configured.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   A comprehensive review and optimization of all `config.cfg` settings for security has not been fully documented.
*   `tcp_keepalive_ms` is not configured.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Run as Non-Root User (System-Level)](./mitigation_strategies/run_as_non-root_user__system-level_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Run as Non-Root User (System-Level)

**Description:**
1.  **Create User:** Create a dedicated, unprivileged user account on the system (e.g., `sonicuser`).
2.  **Set Permissions:** Ensure this user has the necessary permissions to access the Sonic data directory and configuration file.
3.  **Run Service:** Configure the system's service manager (e.g., systemd, init.d) to run the Sonic service under this unprivileged user account.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Privilege Escalation (High Severity):** Limits the potential damage if Sonic is compromised.

**Impact:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk significantly reduced (from High to Low).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Sonic is running as the `sonicuser` user account. The systemd service file (`sonic.service`) is configured correctly.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   None. This is fully implemented.
