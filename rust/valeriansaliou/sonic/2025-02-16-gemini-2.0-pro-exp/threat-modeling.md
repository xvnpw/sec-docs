# Threat Model Analysis for valeriansaliou/sonic

## Threat: [Unauthorized Data Access (Read)](./threats/unauthorized_data_access__read_.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Data Access (Read)
*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized read access to the Sonic index *directly*. This implies a failure in Sonic's authentication or a network exposure allowing direct, unauthenticated access to the Sonic instance. The attacker connects directly to the Sonic port and issues `QUERY` commands.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exposure of *all* indexed data, regardless of application-level permissions.
    *   Complete loss of confidentiality for indexed data.
    *   Potential regulatory violations.
*   **Sonic Component Affected:**
    *   `sonic-server`: The main server process, specifically its network listener and authentication logic (or lack thereof).
    *   Data files on disk (e.g., `store.db`, `store.log`): If the attacker gains OS-level access, these files are directly vulnerable.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Authentication:** *Always* set a strong, unique password for Sonic using the `-p` or `--password` option. This is a *direct* Sonic mitigation.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate Sonic on a private network. This prevents direct external access.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Data Modification (Write)](./threats/unauthorized_data_modification__write_.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Data Modification (Write)
*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized write access to the Sonic index *directly*.  This means they can connect to the Sonic instance (bypassing application controls) and issue `PUSH`, `POP`, or `FLUSH` commands without proper authentication.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data corruption: The index can be rendered unusable or filled with incorrect data.
    *   Potential for denial of service by corrupting the index.
*   **Sonic Component Affected:**
    *   `sonic-server`: The main server process, specifically its network listener and authentication logic for the `ingest` channel.
    *   `ingest` channel: The channel used for write operations.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Authentication:** Enforce strong password authentication for Sonic. This is a *direct* Sonic mitigation.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate Sonic on a private network to prevent direct external access.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (Resource Exhaustion)](./threats/denial_of_service__resource_exhaustion_.md)

* **Threat:** Denial of Service (Resource Exhaustion)
* **Description:** An attacker sends a large number of requests, or crafted requests to the sonic server, exhausting resources.
* **Impact:**
    * Search functionality becomes unavailable.
    * Application downtime.
* **Sonic Component Affected:**
    *   `sonic-server`: The main server process.
    *   `search` channel: The channel used for search queries.
    *   Internal data structures (e.g., the inverted index).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Resource Allocation:**  Provision sufficient resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) for Sonic.
    *   **Monitoring and Alerting:**  Monitor Sonic's resource usage and set up alerts for unusual activity.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (Sonic-Specific Vulnerability)](./threats/denial_of_service__sonic-specific_vulnerability_.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (Sonic-Specific Vulnerability)
*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a previously unknown vulnerability *within Sonic's code* (e.g., a bug in the query parsing, indexing, or network handling) to cause a crash, hang, or other denial-of-service condition. This is *not* simply resource exhaustion, but a flaw in Sonic's logic.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Search functionality becomes unavailable.
    *   Application downtime.
*   **Sonic Component Affected:**
    *   Potentially *any* part of `sonic-server`, depending on the vulnerability. This could be the query parser, indexing engine, network code, etc.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Stay Updated:** Keep Sonic updated to the latest version. This is the *primary* direct mitigation, as it includes security patches.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use vulnerability scanners to identify known issues in Sonic's dependencies.
