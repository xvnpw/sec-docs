### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving Sonic

*   **Threat:** Malicious Data Ingestion
    *   **Description:** An attacker, potentially with access to the data ingestion pipeline, crafts malicious data payloads and sends them directly to Sonic for indexing. This data could contain specially crafted strings or characters that exploit vulnerabilities in Sonic's indexing process or data storage.
    *   **Impact:** When this malicious data is later retrieved through search queries and processed by the application, it could lead to application errors, unexpected behavior, or even vulnerabilities like stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if the application blindly renders search results. Exploiting vulnerabilities within Sonic itself during ingestion could potentially lead to remote code execution on the Sonic server.
    *   **Affected Component:** Sonic Ingester (the component responsible for processing and indexing incoming data).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all data *before* sending it to Sonic for indexing. This is the primary defense.
        *   Encode data appropriately before indexing to prevent interpretation of malicious characters *by Sonic*.
        *   Implement robust output encoding and sanitization in the application when displaying data retrieved from Sonic (secondary defense).
        *   Enforce access controls on the data ingestion pipeline to restrict who can send data to Sonic.
        *   Regularly update Sonic to the latest version to patch potential vulnerabilities in the Ingester.

*   **Threat:** Information Disclosure through Search Query Manipulation
    *   **Description:** An attacker, understanding Sonic's query syntax and the indexed data structure, crafts specific search queries that are processed directly by Sonic to potentially retrieve sensitive information that was inadvertently indexed. This bypasses application-level access controls if the application relies solely on Sonic's search results without further filtering.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data that should not be accessible to the attacker, directly due to Sonic's search functionality returning the data. This could lead to privacy breaches, compliance violations, or reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Component:** Sonic Searcher (the component responsible for processing and executing search queries).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully consider what data is being indexed in Sonic and avoid indexing highly sensitive information if possible.
        *   Implement robust authorization checks in the application *after* retrieving results from Sonic to ensure users can only access search results they are permitted to see. Do not rely solely on Sonic for access control.
        *   Sanitize or redact sensitive information from search results *after* they are returned by Sonic, before displaying them to users.
        *   Regularly review the indexed data and remove any inadvertently indexed sensitive information.

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Access to Sonic Management Interface (if exposed)
    *   **Description:** If Sonic's internal management interface (if it exists and is exposed) is not properly secured, an attacker could directly interact with Sonic's administrative functions.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker could potentially reconfigure Sonic, delete indexes, or perform other administrative actions directly on the Sonic instance, leading to data loss, service disruption, or further security compromises.
    *   **Affected Component:** Sonic's internal management components (if any are exposed).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure Sonic's management interface is *not* publicly accessible. This is paramount.
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing the management interface.
        *   If possible, disable or restrict access to the management interface to only authorized administrators from trusted networks. Use network firewalls to restrict access.

*   **Threat:** Data Corruption due to Sonic Bugs
    *   **Description:** A bug or vulnerability within Sonic's core logic could lead to the corruption of the indexed data during indexing, merging, or other internal operations. This is a risk inherent to the software itself.
    *   **Impact:** Inaccurate search results directly caused by corrupted data within Sonic, application errors when processing this corrupted data, or potential data loss if the corruption is severe.
    *   **Affected Component:** Various internal Sonic components depending on the nature of the bug (e.g., Ingester, Storage Engine).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium (While the impact can be high, the likelihood depends on the presence of exploitable bugs in Sonic). *However, if a known critical data corruption bug exists in a used version, the severity becomes Critical.*
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Stay updated with the latest Sonic releases and security patches. This is crucial for addressing known bugs.
        *   Monitor Sonic's logs for any signs of data corruption or errors.
        *   Implement regular backups of Sonic's indexed data to recover from potential corruption.
