### Key Attack Surface List: Direct Sonic Involvement (High & Critical)

Here are the key attack surfaces that directly involve Sonic, filtered for High and Critical risk severity:

*   **Attack Surface:** Sonic Query Injection
    *   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious commands or manipulate query logic by exploiting insufficient sanitization of user-provided input used in Sonic queries.
    *   **How Sonic Contributes:** Sonic processes queries based on the provided input. If the application directly incorporates unsanitized user input into these queries, it creates an entry point for injection attacks targeting Sonic's query language.
    *   **Example:** A search field allows users to search by name. An attacker enters `user:* OR tag:*` which, if not properly handled, could bypass intended search filters in Sonic and return a broader set of results.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, information leakage, potential denial of service against Sonic, or manipulation of search results.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all user-provided data before constructing Sonic queries.
        *   Utilize Sonic client libraries in a way that allows for safe parameterization of queries, preventing direct injection of malicious code.
        *   Adhere to the principle of least privilege when constructing queries, limiting the scope of potential damage from an injection.

*   **Attack Surface:** Information Leakage via Search Results
    *   **Description:** Sensitive information indexed in Sonic is inadvertently exposed through search results due to insufficient filtering or sanitization by the application.
    *   **How Sonic Contributes:** Sonic indexes the data provided to it. If the application doesn't carefully control what data is indexed and how the results are presented, Sonic can become a source of information leakage.
    *   **Example:** Internal documents containing confidential information are indexed in Sonic. The application displays all fields returned by Sonic, including those intended for internal use only, making them accessible to unauthorized users.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, potentially leading to privacy violations, reputational damage, or legal repercussions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully control what data is indexed in Sonic, avoiding the inclusion of sensitive information if not absolutely necessary for search functionality.
        *   Implement strict filtering and sanitization of search results before presenting them to the user, ensuring only intended information is displayed.
        *   Adhere to the principle of least privilege when accessing and displaying Sonic data.

*   **Attack Surface:** Insecure Sonic Configuration
    *   **Description:** Misconfigurations in Sonic itself create vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.
    *   **How Sonic Contributes:** Sonic's configuration determines its security posture. Weak or default settings can provide easy access points for attackers.
    *   **Example:** The default password for Sonic's administrative interface is not changed, allowing an attacker to gain full control over the search engine.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Sonic instance, potentially leading to data manipulation, denial of service, or use of Sonic as a pivot point for further attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow Sonic's security best practices for configuration.
        *   Change default credentials immediately upon installation.
        *   Secure access to Sonic's management interface (if enabled) with strong authentication and authorization.
        *   Restrict network access to Sonic to only authorized application servers.

*   **Attack Surface:** Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Sonic Communication
    *   **Description:** Attackers intercept and potentially modify communication between the application and Sonic if the channel is not properly authenticated and encrypted.
    *   **How Sonic Contributes:** Sonic relies on network communication. Without proper authentication and encryption, this communication is susceptible to manipulation.
    *   **Example:** An attacker intercepts a query from the application and modifies it before it reaches Sonic, causing Sonic to return incorrect or manipulated results.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized access, manipulation of search results, potentially leading to application-level vulnerabilities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use strong authentication mechanisms between the application and Sonic.
        *   Implement mutual TLS (mTLS) for enhanced security and verification of both endpoints.
        *   Verify the integrity of data exchanged with Sonic to detect any tampering.

*   **Attack Surface:** Sonic Protocol Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities exist within the Sonic protocol itself or its implementation, which attackers can exploit by sending specially crafted requests.
    *   **How Sonic Contributes:** Sonic's core functionality relies on its specific protocol for communication and data processing. Flaws in this protocol can be directly exploited.
    *   **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability in Sonic's parsing of certain commands could be exploited to gain remote code execution on the Sonic server.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Sonic instance, potentially leading to data breaches, denial of service, or use of Sonic as a launchpad for further attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Sonic updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Monitor security advisories related to Sonic for any reported vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization on the application side as a defense-in-depth measure, even though the vulnerability lies within Sonic.
