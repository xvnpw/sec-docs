### 2. Security Implications of Key Components

#### 2.1. Sonic Server API

*   **Security Implications:**
    *   **Entry Point Vulnerabilities:** As the single entry point, the Server API is a prime target for attacks. Vulnerabilities here can expose the entire Sonic backend.
    *   **Authentication and Authorization Weaknesses:** Lack of robust authentication and authorization can lead to unauthorized access to indexing and search operations, potentially allowing data breaches or manipulation.
    *   **API Abuse and DoS:** Publicly exposed API endpoints can be abused for denial-of-service attacks if not properly protected with rate limiting and resource management.
    *   **Input Validation Issues:**  Improper validation of HTTP request parameters and data can lead to injection attacks (e.g., command injection, header injection) or unexpected behavior.
    *   **Exposure of Internal Architecture:**  Error messages or API responses might inadvertently reveal internal architecture details, aiding attackers.
    *   **Session Management Vulnerabilities (if implemented):** If session management is introduced, vulnerabilities in session handling (e.g., session fixation, session hijacking) could arise.

#### 2.2. Ingest Service

*   **Security Implications:**
    *   **Data Injection during Ingestion:**  If input data is not properly sanitized and validated, malicious data could be injected into the index, potentially leading to stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in search results or other forms of data poisoning.
    *   **Text Processing Vulnerabilities:** Vulnerabilities in text processing libraries (tokenization, stemming, etc.) could be exploited to cause crashes or unexpected behavior during indexing.
    *   **Index Corruption:** Bugs or vulnerabilities in the Ingest Service could lead to corruption of the Index Storage, impacting search accuracy and availability.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion during Indexing:** Processing large or malicious indexing requests could exhaust resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) on the Ingest Service, leading to denial of service.
    *   **Access Control to Index Storage:**  Insufficient access control for the Ingest Service to the Index Storage could allow unauthorized modification of the index.

#### 2.3. Search Service

*   **Security Implications:**
    *   **Query Injection:** Although schema-less, there might be potential for query injection if search queries are not properly parsed and sanitized before being used to access the Index Storage. This is less likely in a well-designed system like Sonic, but needs consideration.
    *   **Information Disclosure through Search Results:**  Search results might inadvertently expose sensitive information if access control is not properly implemented at the data level during indexing.
    *   **Performance Degradation under Malicious Queries:**  Crafted search queries could be designed to be computationally expensive, leading to performance degradation or denial of service for legitimate users.
    *   **Access Control to Index Storage:**  Similar to the Ingest Service, the Search Service needs secure access to the Index Storage, but with read-only permissions to prevent unauthorized index modification.

#### 2.4. Index Storage

*   **Security Implications:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Index Files:** If the Index Storage is not properly secured at the operating system level, unauthorized users or processes could gain access to the index files and potentially read or modify sensitive data.
    *   **Data at Rest Confidentiality:**  Sensitive data within the index files is vulnerable if not encrypted at rest. Physical access to the server or storage media could lead to data breaches.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues:**  Disk errors, software bugs, or malicious attacks could lead to corruption of the index files, impacting data integrity and search accuracy.
    *   **Backup and Recovery Vulnerabilities:**  If backup and recovery processes are not secure, backups could be compromised, or recovery processes could be manipulated to restore a compromised state.
    *   **Lack of Audit Trails for Index Access:**  Without proper logging of access to the Index Storage, it can be difficult to detect and investigate security incidents related to data access.

### 3. Tailored Security Considerations and Mitigation Strategies for Sonic
