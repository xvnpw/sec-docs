# Attack Surface Analysis for alacritty/alacritty

## Attack Surface: [Escape Sequence Injection](./attack_surfaces/escape_sequence_injection.md)

*   **Description:**  Maliciously crafted ANSI escape sequences and control characters are injected into Alacritty, potentially exploiting vulnerabilities in the parsing and handling logic.
*   **How Alacritty Contributes:** Alacritty's core function is to interpret and render these sequences, making it a direct target.  This is the primary attack vector *directly* against Alacritty.
*   **Example:**  An attacker sends a specially crafted escape sequence through a compromised program running within Alacritty, or via `cat` of a malicious file, designed to trigger a buffer overflow or cause a denial-of-service.  `printf '\e[?1049h\e[2004h'` (bracketed paste mode and alternate screen buffer) followed by a very long string could be used to test for buffer overflows. More complex sequences could target specific parsing vulnerabilities.  OSC or DCS sequences could be abused.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS)
    *   Potential Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE) (low probability, but high impact)
    *   Information Disclosure
    *   Terminal State Manipulation
*   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical if ACE is possible)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Sanitization (Developer):**  If the application feeding data into Alacritty handles untrusted input, *strictly* sanitize and validate all input *before* it reaches Alacritty.  This is the most crucial mitigation.  Consider a whitelist of allowed sequences if possible.  This is the *developer's* responsibility if they are building an application *around* Alacritty.
    *   **Fuzzing (Developer):**  Regularly fuzz Alacritty's escape sequence parsing logic with a wide range of inputs to identify and fix vulnerabilities. This is Alacritty's developers' responsibility.
    *   **Regular Updates (User/Developer):**  Keep Alacritty and its dependencies (especially libraries related to terminal emulation) updated to the latest versions to benefit from security patches.
    *   **Avoid Untrusted Input (User):**  Be cautious about piping the output of untrusted commands or viewing untrusted files directly within Alacritty.
    *   **Sandboxing (User/Developer):** Run Alacritty in a sandboxed environment (e.g., container, restricted user account) to limit the impact of a successful exploit.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Configuration File](./attack_surfaces/malicious_configuration_file.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker gains control over Alacritty's configuration file (usually YAML), allowing them to inject malicious settings.
*   **How Alacritty Contributes:** Alacritty relies on the configuration file for its settings, including potentially security-relevant options.  The parsing and application of this configuration is entirely within Alacritty's control.
*   **Example:**  An attacker modifies the configuration file to specify a malicious program as the shell, or to enable insecure features.  For instance, changing the `shell` option to point to a malicious script, or setting `allow_hyperlinks` to a dangerous value.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Arbitrary Command Execution
    *   Denial of Service
    *   Security Misconfiguration
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **File Permissions (User):**  Ensure that the Alacritty configuration file has strict permissions, preventing unauthorized modification.  Only the user running Alacritty should have write access.
    *   **Configuration Validation (Developer):**  Implement robust validation of the configuration file within Alacritty, checking for potentially dangerous settings and rejecting invalid configurations. This is the responsibility of Alacritty's developers.
    *   **Avoid Dynamic Configuration (Developer/User):**  Avoid loading configuration files from untrusted sources or dynamically generating configuration files based on untrusted input.
    *   **Integrity Checks (User/Developer):** Consider using file integrity monitoring tools to detect unauthorized changes to the configuration file.
