# Threat Model Analysis for alacritty/alacritty

## Threat: [Escape Sequence Injection Leading to Command Execution](./threats/escape_sequence_injection_leading_to_command_execution.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input containing specific escape sequences (e.g., ANSI escape codes) that, when interpreted by the terminal, are designed to trigger unintended actions. The attacker might try to inject sequences that, *through Alacritty's parsing and handling*, could lead to unexpected behavior, even if the underlying shell is secured. This focuses on vulnerabilities *within Alacritty's escape sequence handling itself*, not just passing them to the shell.
    *   **Impact:**  Potentially severe, ranging from altering terminal behavior to, in a worst-case scenario (if a vulnerability exists in Alacritty's handling), achieving code execution *within the context of Alacritty*. This is distinct from shell command execution.
    *   **Affected Alacritty Component:**  `alacritty_terminal::Term` (the core terminal emulator), specifically the parsing and handling of ANSI escape sequences within the `Parser` and state machine logic. This is the core area where Alacritty interprets and acts upon escape sequences.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Sanitization (Application Level):** The application *must* rigorously sanitize all user-provided input *before* it reaches Alacritty. This is the primary defense, even if the goal is to prevent Alacritty-specific exploits. Use a whitelist approach.
        *   **Fuzz Testing (Alacritty Development):**  Extensive fuzz testing of Alacritty's escape sequence parser is crucial to identify and fix vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. This is a responsibility of Alacritty's developers.
        *   **Security Audits (Alacritty Development):** Regular security audits of Alacritty's codebase, focusing on the escape sequence handling, are essential.
        * **Sandboxing (System Level):** Running Alacritty in a sandboxed environment can limit the damage from a successful exploit, even if it occurs within Alacritty itself.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Character Flooding](./threats/denial_of_service_via_character_flooding.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a massive amount of data (e.g., a very long string of characters, or a rapid stream of characters) to Alacritty, aiming to overwhelm its processing capabilities and cause it to crash, freeze, or consume excessive resources. This focuses on Alacritty's ability to handle large volumes of input and rendering demands.
    *   **Impact:**  Denial of service. Alacritty becomes unresponsive, potentially disrupting the user's workflow or the functionality of the application that embeds it.  In severe cases, it could lead to resource exhaustion on the host system *due to Alacritty's behavior*.
    *   **Affected Alacritty Component:**  `alacritty_terminal::Term` (the core terminal emulator), specifically the input handling, rendering pipeline, and potentially the grid/buffer management.  The `window` module (responsible for interacting with the operating system's windowing system) could also be affected. This is about how Alacritty *internally* manages these resources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Rate Limiting (Application Level):** Implement strict rate limiting on the input stream sent to Alacritty. Limit the number of characters or escape sequences processed per unit of time. This is the primary application-level defense.
        *   **Resource Limits (System Level):** Use operating system mechanisms to restrict the resources Alacritty can consume. This is a secondary defense.
        *   **Optimized Rendering (Alacritty Development):** Alacritty's developers should continuously work to optimize the rendering pipeline to handle large amounts of data efficiently.
        *   **Robust Error Handling (Alacritty Development):** Alacritty should be designed to handle resource exhaustion gracefully, avoiding crashes or hangs whenever possible.

## Threat: [Font Rendering Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/font_rendering_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** Alacritty relies on external libraries for font rendering. If a vulnerability exists in one of these libraries, an attacker could craft a malicious font file or use specific characters that trigger the vulnerability *when rendered by Alacritty*. This threat is included because Alacritty *chooses* to use these libraries and is the point of interaction.
    *   **Impact:**  Could range from denial of service (crashing Alacritty) to arbitrary code execution, depending on the nature of the font rendering vulnerability. The code execution would occur *within the context of Alacritty* (or the font rendering library it calls).
    *   **Affected Alacritty Component:**  Indirectly affects Alacritty through its dependency on external font rendering libraries.  The `alacritty::renderer` module, which interacts with these libraries, would be the point of interaction.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical, depending on the underlying vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Dependency Management (Application/System Level):** Keep Alacritty and its dependencies (especially font rendering libraries) up to date. This is crucial.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning (System Level):** Regularly scan for vulnerabilities in libraries.
        *   **Font Sandboxing (System Level - if available):** Use OS-level font sandboxing if available.
        *  **Careful Font Selection (Alacritty/Application Configuration):** While not a complete solution, avoid using obscure or untrusted fonts.
