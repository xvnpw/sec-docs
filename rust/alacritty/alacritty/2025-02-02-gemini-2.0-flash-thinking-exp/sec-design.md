# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a fast, GPU-accelerated terminal emulator.
  - Offer a simple and configuration-centric terminal experience.
  - Maintain cross-platform compatibility (Linux, macOS, Windows).
  - Foster an open-source community and encourage contributions.
  - Prioritize performance and resource efficiency.
- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in the terminal emulator could lead to command injection or privilege escalation, damaging user trust and adoption.
  - Performance issues or instability could negatively impact user experience and adoption.
  - Lack of community support or maintainer burnout could lead to project stagnation and security vulnerabilities not being addressed promptly.
  - Compatibility issues across different operating systems could limit user base and adoption.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Open Source Development - The project is publicly accessible on GitHub, allowing for community review and scrutiny of the codebase. Implemented in: GitHub repository.
  - security control: Rust Language - Alacritty is written in Rust, a memory-safe language that reduces the risk of certain classes of vulnerabilities like buffer overflows. Implemented in: Source code.
  - security control: Input Sanitization -  Terminal emulators inherently perform some level of input sanitization to interpret control sequences and escape codes. Implemented in: Terminal emulator core logic (not explicitly documented, but assumed).
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on Community Contributions - Security vulnerabilities might be introduced by community contributors and may not be immediately identified or addressed.
  - accepted risk: Dependency Vulnerabilities - The project relies on external Rust crates, which could contain security vulnerabilities.
  - accepted risk: Complex Codebase - Terminal emulators are inherently complex software, increasing the potential for subtle security vulnerabilities.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Automated Security Scanning - Implement automated static analysis security testing (SAST) and dependency scanning in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential vulnerabilities early in the development process.
  - security control: Regular Security Audits - Conduct periodic security audits, potentially by external security experts, to identify and address vulnerabilities that might be missed by automated tools and community review.
  - security control: Fuzzing - Implement fuzzing techniques to test the terminal emulator's robustness against malformed input and identify potential crash or vulnerability scenarios.
  - security control: Secure Configuration Defaults - Ensure default configuration settings are secure and minimize potential attack surface.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Not directly applicable to a terminal emulator itself, as it relies on the underlying operating system for user authentication.
  - Authorization:
    - Not directly applicable to a terminal emulator itself, as it relies on the underlying operating system for user authorization and permissions.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Robustly validate and sanitize all input received by the terminal emulator, including user input, control sequences, and escape codes, to prevent command injection and other input-based vulnerabilities.
    - Requirement: Properly handle and escape special characters to prevent unintended execution of commands or scripts.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: While not directly handling sensitive data storage, ensure that if any cryptographic operations are introduced (e.g., for future features), they are implemented securely using well-vetted libraries and best practices.
    - Requirement: If supporting features like SSH agent forwarding, ensure secure handling of cryptographic keys and communication channels.
