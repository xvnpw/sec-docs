# Attack Surface Analysis for alacritty/alacritty

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Escape Sequence Processing](./attack_surfaces/malicious_escape_sequence_processing.md)

*   **Description:**  Alacritty's parsing of ANSI escape sequences to control terminal rendering and behavior can be vulnerable to exploitation.
*   **How Alacritty Contributes to Attack Surface:** Alacritty's core function is to interpret and render escape sequences. Flaws in its parsing logic directly create a high-risk attack surface.
*   **Example:** A crafted escape sequence with excessively long parameters triggers a buffer overflow in Alacritty's memory management during parsing, leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's system with the privileges of the Alacritty process.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Malicious sequences can crash or freeze Alacritty, disrupting terminal access.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Input Sanitization:**  Rigorously sanitize or filter terminal output from untrusted sources *before* displaying it in Alacritty. Escape or remove potentially dangerous escape sequences.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Ensure Alacritty is regularly updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches addressing escape sequence parsing vulnerabilities.
    *   **Users:**
        *   **Keep Alacritty Updated:**  Regularly update Alacritty to receive security fixes.
        *   **Cautious Output Handling:** Be extremely cautious when viewing output from untrusted or potentially malicious sources within Alacritty. Avoid piping output from unknown processes directly to Alacritty without inspection.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration File Vulnerabilities (YAML Parsing & Injection leading to Code Execution or DoS)](./attack_surfaces/configuration_file_vulnerabilities__yaml_parsing_&_injection_leading_to_code_execution_or_dos_.md)

*   **Description:**  Insecure parsing of the YAML configuration file (`alacritty.yml`) or injection of malicious configurations can lead to critical vulnerabilities.
*   **How Alacritty Contributes to Attack Surface:** Alacritty relies on parsing `alacritty.yml` for its settings. Vulnerabilities in the YAML parsing process or allowing malicious configuration injection directly expose Alacritty to risk.
*   **Example:**
    *   **YAML Parsing Vulnerability Exploitation:** A vulnerability in the YAML parsing library used by Alacritty is triggered by a specially crafted `alacritty.yml` file, leading to arbitrary code execution during configuration loading.
    *   **Malicious Configuration Injection for DoS:** An attacker modifies `alacritty.yml` to include extremely resource-intensive settings (e.g., excessively large scrollback buffer, complex font configurations), causing Alacritty to consume excessive resources and leading to denial of service.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Exploiting YAML parsing vulnerabilities can lead to code execution with Alacritty's privileges.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Malicious configurations can exhaust system resources, crashing Alacritty or impacting system performance.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (Critical if YAML parsing vulnerability leads to code execution)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Secure Configuration Generation:** If programmatically generating or modifying `alacritty.yml`, rigorously validate and sanitize all configuration data to prevent injection of malicious YAML structures or values.
        *   **Up-to-date YAML Library:** Ensure the YAML parsing library used by Alacritty is consistently updated to the latest version to mitigate known parsing vulnerabilities.
    *   **Users:**
        *   **Restrict Configuration File Access:** Limit write access to `alacritty.yml` to only trusted users and processes.
        *   **Read-Only Configuration:** In production environments or security-sensitive setups, consider using a read-only configuration file to prevent unauthorized modifications.
        *   **Configuration File Origin Awareness:** Be extremely cautious about using `alacritty.yml` files from untrusted or unknown sources. Inspect configuration files for unexpected or suspicious settings before use.
