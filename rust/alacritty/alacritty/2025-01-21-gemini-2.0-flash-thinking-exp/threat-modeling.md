# Threat Model Analysis for alacritty/alacritty

## Threat: [Malicious Escape Sequence Injection](./threats/malicious_escape_sequence_injection.md)

* **Description:** An attacker could inject specially crafted escape sequences into the output stream that is displayed by Alacritty. This could be achieved by compromising the application providing the output or by manipulating data displayed from external sources. The attacker might use these sequences to:
    *  **Manipulate the display:**  Display misleading information, hide critical warnings, or create fake prompts to trick the user into entering sensitive data.
    *  **Trigger vulnerabilities in Alacritty:** Exploit parsing errors or unexpected behavior in Alacritty's escape sequence handling, potentially leading to crashes or unexpected program behavior.
* **Impact:**
    *  **User deception:** Users might be tricked into performing actions they wouldn't normally take, such as entering credentials into a fake prompt.
    *  **Application instability:** Alacritty could crash, disrupting the application's functionality.
* **Affected Alacritty Component:** Renderer (specifically the escape sequence parsing and handling logic).
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *  **Sanitize output:** The application displaying data through Alacritty should sanitize any output originating from untrusted sources to remove or neutralize potentially malicious escape sequences. Libraries exist for this purpose.
    *  **Stay updated:** Keep Alacritty updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches related to escape sequence handling.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Compromise of Alacritty Binary](./threats/supply_chain_compromise_of_alacritty_binary.md)

* **Description:** An attacker could compromise the build or distribution process of Alacritty, leading to the distribution of a malicious binary. Users who download and use this compromised version could be at risk.
* **Impact:**
    *  **Malware infection:** The compromised binary could contain malware that could harm the user's system or steal sensitive information.
    *  **Application compromise:** If the application relies on the compromised Alacritty binary, its security could also be compromised.
* **Affected Alacritty Component:** Entire Alacritty application.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *  **Download from trusted sources:** Obtain Alacritty binaries from official releases on GitHub or trusted package managers.
    *  **Verify checksums/signatures:** Verify the integrity of downloaded binaries using checksums or digital signatures provided by the Alacritty developers.
    *  **Use reputable package managers:** Rely on well-maintained and secure package managers for installing Alacritty.
