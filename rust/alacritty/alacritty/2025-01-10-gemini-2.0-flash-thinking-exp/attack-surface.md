# Attack Surface Analysis for alacritty/alacritty

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Terminal Escape Sequences](./attack_surfaces/malicious_terminal_escape_sequences.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Malicious Terminal Escape Sequences

    *   **Description:** Alacritty's parsing and rendering engine interprets terminal escape sequences. Vulnerabilities in this interpretation can be exploited by malicious sequences.
    *   **How Alacritty Contributes:** Alacritty's specific implementation of the escape sequence parser and rendering logic determines its susceptibility to these attacks. Bugs or incomplete adherence to standards can create vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A sequence designed to cause an infinite loop within Alacritty's rendering engine, leading to a denial-of-service by freezing the terminal. Another example is a sequence that triggers a buffer overflow in Alacritty's memory management during rendering.
    *   **Impact:** Denial-of-service (freezing or crashing Alacritty), potential arbitrary code execution if a memory safety vulnerability exists within Alacritty's escape sequence handling.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust, well-tested, and secure parsing logic for terminal escape sequences, strictly adhering to standards like ECMA-48. Employ thorough fuzz testing of Alacritty's escape sequence parser with a wide range of inputs, including potentially malicious and edge-case sequences. Implement resource limits within Alacritty to prevent excessive processing of escape sequences from consuming excessive resources.
        *   **Users:** Exercise caution when running commands or scripts from untrusted sources within Alacritty, as these may contain crafted escape sequences designed to exploit vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Launching External Processes via Hyperlinks or Escape Sequences](./attack_surfaces/launching_external_processes_via_hyperlinks_or_escape_sequences.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Launching External Processes via Hyperlinks or Escape Sequences

    *   **Description:** Alacritty's feature to launch external applications via clickable hyperlinks or specific terminal escape sequences can be exploited if not handled securely by Alacritty.
    *   **How Alacritty Contributes:** Alacritty's logic for identifying, validating, and launching these external applications is the primary point of vulnerability. Insufficient sanitization or validation within Alacritty can lead to exploitation.
    *   **Example:** A malicious website displayed within Alacritty containing a hyperlink that, when clicked, executes a harmful command on the user's system due to Alacritty's insufficient URL validation. Alternatively, a crafted escape sequence processed by Alacritty that triggers the execution of an arbitrary program without proper user confirmation or sandboxing.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on the user's system with the privileges of the Alacritty process.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strict validation and sanitization of URLs and commands before Alacritty launches external processes. Provide clear and prominent warnings to the user before Alacritty initiates the launch of any external application. Consider implementing sandboxing or limiting the capabilities of processes launched by Alacritty.
        *   **Users:** Be extremely cautious about clicking on links or running commands from untrusted sources within Alacritty. Understand the potential risks before allowing Alacritty to launch external applications.
