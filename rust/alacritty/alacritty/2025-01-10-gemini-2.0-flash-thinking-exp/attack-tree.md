## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Alacritty](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_alacritty.md)

This represents the attacker's ultimate goal and encompasses all the following high-risk paths and critical nodes. Successful achievement signifies a significant security breach.

## Attack Tree Path: [Send Crafted Text with Escape Sequences](./attack_tree_paths/send_crafted_text_with_escape_sequences.md)

Attackers send specially crafted text containing escape sequences to Alacritty. These sequences are intended to manipulate terminal behavior but can be exploited if Alacritty's parsing or rendering logic has vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Logic Errors in Escape Sequence Parsing](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_logic_errors_in_escape_sequence_parsing.md)

This path involves exploiting subtle flaws in how Alacritty interprets and processes escape sequences. By sending carefully crafted sequences that trigger these logic errors, attackers might cause unexpected behavior, potentially leading to DoS or information disclosure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Expose Sensitive Information through Crafted Output](./attack_tree_paths/expose_sensitive_information_through_crafted_output.md)

If the application using Alacritty doesn't properly sanitize or control the output displayed in the terminal, attackers can craft escape sequences that, when rendered, expose sensitive information that might otherwise be hidden or formatted differently.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities in Alacritty](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_handling_vulnerabilities_in_alacritty.md)

This path focuses on weaknesses in how Alacritty receives, processes, and forwards user input. Vulnerabilities here can allow attackers to inject malicious commands or manipulate the application's state.

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft Input with Malicious Escape Sequences](./attack_tree_paths/craft_input_with_malicious_escape_sequences.md)

Attackers craft input strings containing malicious escape sequences. These sequences are designed to exploit vulnerabilities in Alacritty's input processing logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Commands into the Underlying Shell](./attack_tree_paths/inject_commands_into_the_underlying_shell.md)

This path involves crafting escape sequences that, when processed by Alacritty and passed to the underlying shell, are interpreted as commands. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Command Injection in the Application](./attack_tree_paths/command_injection_in_the_application.md)

Attackers leverage Alacritty's input handling to bypass the application's input sanitization mechanisms. Malicious input, potentially including commands, is passed through Alacritty and is then executed by the application due to insufficient sanitization.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Configuration File (if accessible)](./attack_tree_paths/modify_configuration_file__if_accessible_.md)

If an attacker gains write access to Alacritty's configuration file (typically `alacritty.yml`), they can modify its contents to execute arbitrary commands or change Alacritty's behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Commands in `program` setting](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_commands_in__program__setting.md)

A specific and highly impactful configuration vulnerability involves modifying the `program` setting in Alacritty's configuration file. This setting defines the shell or program that Alacritty launches. By injecting a malicious command or script here, the attacker can achieve arbitrary command execution when Alacritty starts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Exfiltration](./attack_tree_paths/data_exfiltration.md)

If the application allows it, attackers can use Alacritty's capabilities (like piping output) to exfiltrate sensitive data to external locations. This relies on the application not restricting such operations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Buffer Overflow in Escape Sequence Handling](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_buffer_overflow_in_escape_sequence_handling.md)

A memory corruption vulnerability where an excessively long or malformed escape sequence overwrites memory buffers, potentially leading to code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Code Execution on Host Machine](./attack_tree_paths/code_execution_on_host_machine.md)

The attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary code on the system running the application, leading to complete compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Commands into the Underlying Shell](./attack_tree_paths/inject_commands_into_the_underlying_shell.md)

The attacker successfully injects and executes arbitrary commands within the shell process managed by Alacritty.

## Attack Tree Path: [Command Injection in the Application](./attack_tree_paths/command_injection_in_the_application.md)

The attacker is able to execute arbitrary commands within the context of the application itself, potentially leading to data breaches or system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Escape the Terminal Sandbox (if applicable)](./attack_tree_paths/escape_the_terminal_sandbox__if_applicable_.md)

In sandboxed environments, this node represents a successful breach of the sandbox, allowing the attacker to access resources and functionalities outside the intended restrictions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Configuration File (if accessible)](./attack_tree_paths/modify_configuration_file__if_accessible_.md)

Gaining write access to the configuration file is a critical step as it enables various malicious actions, most notably arbitrary command execution upon Alacritty startup.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Commands in `program` setting](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_commands_in__program__setting.md)

Directly leads to arbitrary command execution when Alacritty is launched, making it a highly critical point of compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Arbitrary Command Execution](./attack_tree_paths/arbitrary_command_execution.md)

The attacker gains the ability to execute any command on the underlying operating system with the privileges of the user running Alacritty.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in PTY Handling](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_pty_handling.md)

Vulnerabilities in how Alacritty manages pseudo-terminals (PTYs) can be exploited to inject code or manipulate the communication between Alacritty and the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Privilege Escalation](./attack_tree_paths/privilege_escalation.md)

The attacker gains elevated privileges on the system, allowing them to perform actions they were not initially authorized to do.

## Attack Tree Path: [Code Execution (via Dependencies)](./attack_tree_paths/code_execution__via_dependencies_.md)

A vulnerability in one of Alacritty's dependencies is exploited, leading to the ability to execute arbitrary code within the application's context.
