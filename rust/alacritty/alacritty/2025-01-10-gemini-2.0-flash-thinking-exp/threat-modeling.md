# Threat Model Analysis for alacritty/alacritty

## Threat: [Malicious Escape Sequence Injection](./threats/malicious_escape_sequence_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends specially crafted escape sequences to the Alacritty terminal. Alacritty's parser might incorrectly interpret these sequences, leading to unintended actions. This could involve manipulating the terminal display in a misleading way, causing a denial of service by overloading the renderer, or potentially exploiting vulnerabilities in the parsing logic to achieve code execution within the context of the Alacritty process.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (terminal becomes unresponsive), Information Disclosure (potentially leaking data displayed on the terminal), Misleading User Interface (attacker can manipulate the display to trick users), Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution within the Alacritty process.

**Affected Component:** Escape Sequence Parser (within the `tty` or `renderer` modules), Terminal Renderer.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Regularly update Alacritty to benefit from security patches that address escape sequence parsing vulnerabilities.
- Sanitize or filter terminal output from untrusted sources before displaying it in Alacritty to remove or neutralize malicious escape sequences.
- Implement robust input validation on any data that will be displayed in the terminal to prevent the introduction of unexpected escape sequences.

## Threat: [Malicious Configuration File](./threats/malicious_configuration_file.md)

**Description:** If the application allows users to provide custom Alacritty configuration files (e.g., `alacritty.yml`), a malicious user could craft a configuration that includes commands or settings that compromise security. This could involve configuring shell integrations to execute arbitrary commands on the user's system when the terminal is launched or when specific actions are performed within the terminal.

**Impact:** Arbitrary Code Execution on the user's system with the privileges of the user running Alacritty, Unexpected or Malicious Terminal Behavior that could be used for social engineering or to hide malicious activity.

**Affected Component:** Configuration Loader (within Alacritty's initialization process).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Avoid allowing users to directly provide arbitrary Alacritty configuration files.
- If custom configurations are necessary, carefully validate and sanitize them, restricting potentially dangerous options such as shell commands or integrations.
- Run Alacritty with the least necessary privileges to limit the impact of potential configuration-based attacks.

## Threat: [Using Outdated Alacritty Version](./threats/using_outdated_alacritty_version.md)

**Description:** Using an outdated version of Alacritty exposes the application to known security vulnerabilities that have been fixed in later versions. These vulnerabilities could be in the core Alacritty code or in its dependencies, and could allow attackers to perform actions like remote code execution or denial of service.

**Impact:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability being exploited, ranging from Denial of Service to potential Remote Code Execution within the context of the Alacritty process or the user's system.

**Affected Component:** Various components depending on the specific vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Regularly update Alacritty to the latest stable version to patch known security flaws.
- Implement automated checks for new Alacritty releases and notify users or administrators to update.
