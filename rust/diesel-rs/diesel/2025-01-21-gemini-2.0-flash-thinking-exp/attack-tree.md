# Attack Tree Analysis for diesel-rs/diesel

Objective: Attacker's Goal: Gain Unauthorized Data Access and/or Modification within the application by exploiting vulnerabilities related to the Diesel ORM (focusing on high-risk areas).

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities (Critical Node & Start of High-Risk Paths):](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_sql_injection_vulnerabilities__critical_node_&_start_of_high-risk_paths_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the application's SQL queries to inject malicious SQL code. This can allow them to bypass security measures, access sensitive data, modify data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server.
*   **Diesel Relevance:** While Diesel aims to prevent SQL injection through parameterized queries, developers can still introduce vulnerabilities through:
    *   Incorrectly using string interpolation to build queries.
    *   Using raw SQL (`sql_query`) without proper sanitization.
    *   Dynamically building queries without adequate input validation.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Parameter Injection (Critical Node & Part of High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/2__parameter_injection__critical_node_&_part_of_high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate user-supplied data that is directly used in Diesel queries without proper parameterization. The application fails to treat user input as data, instead interpreting it as part of the SQL command.
*   **Diesel Relevance:** Occurs when developers bypass Diesel's parameterization features and directly embed user input into query strings.
*   **Example Attack Steps:**
    *   Identify vulnerable Diesel query using user-supplied data.
    *   Craft malicious input to inject SQL (e.g., `' OR '1'='1`).

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Raw SQL Injection (Critical Node if used & Part of High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/3__raw_sql_injection__critical_node_if_used_&_part_of_high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** If the application uses Diesel's `sql_query` or similar methods to execute raw SQL, and this raw SQL incorporates unsanitized user input, it becomes vulnerable to SQL injection.
*   **Diesel Relevance:** This highlights the risk of opting out of Diesel's safety features when using raw SQL.
*   **Example Attack Steps:**
    *   Application uses `sql_query` or similar raw SQL methods.
    *   Craft malicious raw SQL query (e.g., `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'attacker' --`).

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Deserialization Issues (High-Risk Node due to potential for RCE):](./attack_tree_paths/4__deserialization_issues__high-risk_node_due_to_potential_for_rce_.md)

*   **Description:** If the application uses Diesel to deserialize data from untrusted sources (e.g., external APIs, user uploads), vulnerabilities in the deserialization process can be exploited. Maliciously crafted data can be injected during deserialization to execute arbitrary code on the server or gain unauthorized access.
*   **Diesel Relevance:** While Diesel itself doesn't handle deserialization directly, the application using Diesel might be vulnerable if it deserializes untrusted data into Diesel models.
*   **Example Attack Steps:**
    *   Application uses Diesel to deserialize data from untrusted sources.
    *   Inject malicious data during deserialization to execute code or gain access (this depends on the specific deserialization library and vulnerabilities).

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Connection String Injection (Critical Node):](./attack_tree_paths/5__connection_string_injection__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** If the application dynamically builds the database connection string using user-provided input, an attacker could inject malicious connection parameters. This could allow them to connect to a rogue database under their control or attempt to elevate privileges on the legitimate database.
*   **Diesel Relevance:** This highlights the importance of securely managing database credentials and avoiding dynamic construction of connection strings based on untrusted input.
*   **Example Attack Steps:**
    *   Application dynamically builds connection strings using user input.
    *   Inject malicious connection parameters to connect to a rogue database or gain elevated privileges (e.g., modifying the `host` or adding `options` parameters).
