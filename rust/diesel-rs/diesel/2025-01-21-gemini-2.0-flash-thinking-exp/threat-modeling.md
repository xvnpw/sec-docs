# Threat Model Analysis for diesel-rs/diesel

## Threat: [Unsanitized Input Leading to SQL Injection via `sql_query`](./threats/unsanitized_input_leading_to_sql_injection_via__sql_query_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious SQL code by providing unsanitized input that is directly incorporated into a raw SQL query constructed using Diesel's `diesel::sql_query` function. The attacker might manipulate the query to bypass authentication, access unauthorized data, modify or delete data, or even execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database server.
    *   **Impact:**  Critical. Potential for complete compromise of the database, including data breaches, data corruption, and denial of service.
    *   **Affected Diesel Component:** `diesel::sql_query` function within the `sql_types` module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Prioritize Parameterized Queries:  Always use Diesel's query builder methods or the `bind` functionality with `sql_query` to ensure user input is treated as data, not executable code.
        *   Avoid String Interpolation:  Never directly embed user input into SQL strings using string formatting or concatenation when using `sql_query`.
        *   Input Validation: Implement robust input validation on the application layer to restrict the types and formats of data accepted from users before it reaches the database interaction layer.

## Threat: [Logical SQL Injection through Dynamic Query Building](./threats/logical_sql_injection_through_dynamic_query_building.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate the application's logic for dynamically constructing queries using Diesel's query builder. By providing specific input, they might alter the intended query structure, leading to unintended data access or modification. For example, manipulating conditions in a `where` clause to bypass access controls or retrieve more data than intended.
    *   **Impact:** High. Potential for unauthorized data access, data modification, or information disclosure.
    *   **Affected Diesel Component:**  The query builder API (e.g., methods like `filter`, `order`, `limit`, `offset`) within various modules like `query_dsl`, `expression_methods`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Careful Query Construction Logic:  Thoroughly review and test all code that dynamically builds queries based on user input. Ensure that all possible input combinations are handled securely.
        *   Principle of Least Privilege in Queries: Design queries to only access the necessary data and perform the required operations. Avoid overly broad queries.
        *   Consider Type-Safe Query Building:** Leverage Diesel's type system to ensure that query components are used in a safe and expected manner, reducing the risk of logical errors.

## Threat: [Hardcoded Database Credentials in Connection String](./threats/hardcoded_database_credentials_in_connection_string.md)

*   **Description:** Developers might inadvertently hardcode database credentials directly into the application code or configuration files used by Diesel's connection management. An attacker gaining access to the application's source code or configuration files could retrieve these credentials and gain unauthorized access to the database.
    *   **Impact:** Critical. Complete compromise of the database is possible.
    *   **Affected Diesel Component:**  Connection management functions, likely within the `connection` module or functions used to establish database connections.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Environment Variables: Store database credentials in environment variables, which are generally more secure than hardcoding.
        *   Secure Configuration Management: Utilize secure configuration management tools or services that support encryption and access control for sensitive data.
        *   Avoid Committing Secrets to Version Control:  Ensure that sensitive credentials are not committed to version control systems.

## Threat: [Insecure Handling of Database URLs](./threats/insecure_handling_of_database_urls.md)

*   **Description:** If the database URL used by Diesel is constructed based on user input or external sources without proper validation, an attacker could potentially inject malicious parameters or alter the URL to connect to a different database server or manipulate connection options.
    *   **Impact:** High. Could lead to connection to unauthorized databases, data breaches, or denial of service if the attacker can control connection parameters.
    *   **Affected Diesel Component:**  Functions responsible for parsing and handling database connection URLs, likely within the `connection` module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid Dynamic URL Construction:  Minimize or eliminate the need to dynamically construct database URLs based on external input.
        *   Strict Input Validation: If dynamic construction is unavoidable, rigorously validate all input used in the URL to ensure it conforms to expected formats and does not contain malicious characters or parameters.
        *   Use Secure Configuration Methods:  Store the base database URL securely and avoid allowing user-provided input to directly modify it.

## Threat: [Malicious Schema Migrations](./threats/malicious_schema_migrations.md)

*   **Description:** If the process of applying database schema migrations is not properly secured, an attacker with access to the migration files or the deployment process could inject malicious migration scripts. These scripts could alter the database schema in harmful ways, such as adding backdoors, modifying data, or causing data loss.
    *   **Impact:** High. Potential for significant data corruption, data loss, or the introduction of persistent vulnerabilities.
    *   **Affected Diesel Component:**  The migration functionality provided by Diesel, likely within the `migrations` module or related command-line tools.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure Migration Management: Implement strict access controls to ensure only authorized personnel can create and apply database migrations.
        *   Code Review for Migrations: Treat migration scripts as code and subject them to thorough code review before application.
        *   Version Control for Migrations: Store migration scripts in version control to track changes and facilitate rollback if necessary.
        *   Automated Migration Application with Secure Pipelines: Integrate migration application into secure deployment pipelines with appropriate authorization and auditing.
