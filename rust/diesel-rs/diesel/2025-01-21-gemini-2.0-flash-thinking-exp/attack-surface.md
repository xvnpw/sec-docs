# Attack Surface Analysis for diesel-rs/diesel

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious SQL code into queries, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
    *   **How Diesel Contributes:** Diesel's allowance of executing raw SQL queries (`execute()` or `sql_query()`) and the potential for using string formatting within queries bypass its built-in protections if not handled with extreme care.
    *   **Example:**
        *   **Vulnerable Raw SQL:** `diesel::sql_query(format!("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '{}'", untrusted_username)).execute(conn)?;`
        *   **Malicious Input:** `untrusted_username` could be `' OR '1'='1` leading to `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1'`.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, privilege escalation, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Prefer Diesel's Query Builder:**  Strictly adhere to Diesel's query builder, which inherently uses parameterization to prevent SQL injection.
        *   **Avoid Raw SQL:**  Minimize or completely eliminate the use of `execute()` and `sql_query()`. If absolutely necessary, implement robust input validation and sanitization, and strongly prefer prepared statements with bound parameters.
        *   **Never Use String Formatting for Query Building:**  Avoid using `format!()` or similar string manipulation techniques to construct SQL queries with user-provided data.

## Attack Surface: [Database Connection Security](./attack_surfaces/database_connection_security.md)

*   **Description:** Insecure handling of database connection credentials can lead to unauthorized access to the database.
    *   **How Diesel Contributes:** Diesel requires a database URL or connection parameters. The way these are configured and managed directly impacts security.
    *   **Example:**
        *   **Hardcoded Credentials in Diesel Configuration:**  Storing plaintext credentials directly in the code where the Diesel connection is established.
        *   **Insecure Connection String Construction:** Building the database URL using unsanitized user input or external data.
    *   **Impact:** Complete database compromise, data breach, data manipulation, service disruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Utilize Environment Variables:** Store database credentials securely in environment variables and access them through Diesel's configuration mechanisms.
        *   **Secrets Management Integration:** Integrate with secrets management systems to retrieve database credentials securely at runtime.
        *   **Avoid Hardcoding Credentials:** Never embed credentials directly within the application code or configuration files.

## Attack Surface: [Schema Management Risks](./attack_surfaces/schema_management_risks.md)

*   **Description:** Improper handling of database schema migrations can lead to unintended database changes or vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Diesel Contributes:** Diesel provides a migration system. The process of creating, applying, and managing these migrations introduces potential risks if not handled securely.
    *   **Example:**
        *   **Applying Untrusted Migrations:**  Automatically applying migrations from untrusted sources or without proper review.
        *   **Migration Files Containing Vulnerabilities:**  A malicious actor could introduce a migration that alters data or schema in a harmful way.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, unintended schema changes, potential for introducing vulnerabilities directly into the database structure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Controlled Migration Application:**  Implement a rigorous process for reviewing and applying migrations, especially in production environments. Avoid automatic application of migrations without human oversight.
        *   **Secure Migration File Storage:** Protect migration files from unauthorized access and modification.
        *   **Version Control for Migrations:**  Treat migration files as code and manage them using version control systems.

## Attack Surface: [Data Handling and Mapping Issues](./attack_surfaces/data_handling_and_mapping_issues.md)

*   **Description:** Mismatches between Rust types and database schema or insecure handling of data retrieved by Diesel can lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Diesel Contributes:** Diesel's mapping of database columns to Rust structs is crucial. Incorrect mappings or assumptions about data types can lead to vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:**
        *   **Incorrect Type Mapping:** Mapping a database column with a maximum length to a Rust `String` without enforcing that limit in the application, potentially leading to buffer overflows or unexpected database behavior if overly long data is inserted.
        *   **Assuming Data Integrity:**  Blindly trusting data retrieved from the database without validation, potentially leading to issues if the database has been compromised or contains invalid data.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, application errors, potential for exploiting vulnerabilities if assumptions about data are incorrect.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Accurate Type Mapping and Validation:** Ensure Rust types accurately reflect database schema constraints and implement validation logic to enforce these constraints within the application.
        *   **Sanitize and Validate Retrieved Data:**  Do not blindly trust data retrieved from the database. Implement validation and sanitization routines to ensure data integrity before using it in critical operations.
        *   **Be Mindful of Database Constraints:**  Understand and respect database constraints (e.g., data types, lengths, nullability) when working with Diesel.
