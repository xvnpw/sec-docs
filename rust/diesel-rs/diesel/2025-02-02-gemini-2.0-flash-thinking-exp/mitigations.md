# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for diesel-rs/diesel

## Mitigation Strategy: [Parameterized Queries (Diesel Query Builder)](./mitigation_strategies/parameterized_queries__diesel_query_builder_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Utilize Diesel's Query Builder:**  Primarily construct database queries using Diesel's built-in query builder methods (e.g., `filter`, `find`, `insert_into`, `update`). These methods inherently parameterize queries, preventing SQL injection.
2.  **Bind Parameters in Raw SQL (if necessary):** If raw SQL (`sql_query`) is unavoidable, *always* use Diesel's `bind::<DataType, _>(user_input)` method to bind user-provided data as parameters.  Never perform string concatenation to include user input directly in raw SQL.
3.  **Code Review for `sql_query` Usage:**  Specifically review any instances of `sql_query` in the codebase. Verify that parameterization is correctly implemented using `bind` and that the use of raw SQL is justified and secure.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   SQL Injection (High Severity): Attackers can inject malicious SQL code through user inputs if queries are not properly parameterized, leading to data breaches, manipulation, or unauthorized access.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   SQL Injection: High - Effectively eliminates SQL injection vulnerabilities when consistently using Diesel's query builder or parameterized raw SQL.
    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Largely implemented in `src/db_access/` and `src/api_handlers/` where Diesel's query builder is the standard approach for database interactions.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Review and refactor any legacy code, particularly in modules like `src/reporting/legacy_reports.rs`, to ensure no unparameterized `sql_query` usage exists. Enforce parameterized queries as the standard for all new Diesel interactions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Diesel Migrations Management](./mitigation_strategies/secure_diesel_migrations_management.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Version Control for Migrations:**  Manage Diesel migration files (`migrations/`) under version control (e.g., Git) alongside application code. This ensures traceability and facilitates rollbacks.
2.  **Test Migrations in Non-Production Environments:**  Thoroughly test Diesel migrations in development and staging environments before applying them to production databases. This helps identify potential issues before they impact live data.
3.  **Review Migration Scripts:**  Conduct code reviews of all Diesel migration scripts, especially those modifying sensitive data or schema structures. Focus on the logic and potential unintended consequences of schema changes introduced by Diesel migrations.
4.  **Utilize Diesel Migration Rollback:**  Understand and practice using Diesel's built-in migration rollback functionality. Have a tested rollback plan in case a migration needs to be reverted in production.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Data Integrity Issues (Medium Severity):  Incorrectly written Diesel migrations can lead to data corruption or inconsistencies within the database managed by Diesel.
        *   Service Disruption (Medium Severity):  Failed or problematic Diesel migrations can cause application downtime if database schema changes are not applied correctly.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data Integrity Issues: Medium - Reduces the risk of data corruption from migration errors by emphasizing testing and reviews of Diesel migration scripts.
        *   Service Disruption: Medium - Minimizes downtime by ensuring Diesel migrations are tested and rollback procedures are in place.
    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Diesel migrations are version controlled in the project's `migrations/` directory. Basic testing occurs in development.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Formalize Diesel migration testing in a dedicated staging environment. Implement mandatory code reviews specifically for Diesel migration files. Document and test the Diesel migration rollback process.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Optimize Diesel Queries for Performance](./mitigation_strategies/optimize_diesel_queries_for_performance.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Effective Indexing for Diesel Queries:**  Ensure database tables have appropriate indexes for columns frequently used in `WHERE` clauses, `JOIN` conditions, and `ORDER BY` clauses within Diesel queries. Optimize indexes based on Diesel query patterns.
2.  **Pagination with Diesel's `LIMIT` and `OFFSET`:**  Always use Diesel's `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` for paginating results when querying potentially large datasets using Diesel. Avoid loading excessive data into memory.
3.  **Diesel Query Profiling:**  Utilize Diesel's query logging or database profiling tools to identify slow or inefficient Diesel queries. Analyze generated SQL from Diesel to understand performance bottlenecks.
4.  **Eager Loading in Diesel (when appropriate):**  Use Diesel's `.eager_load()` feature to optimize data retrieval for related models when needed, reducing N+1 query problems common in ORM usage. However, avoid over-eager loading which can also degrade performance.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium to High Severity):  Inefficient Diesel queries can consume excessive database resources, leading to performance degradation and potential service unavailability.
        *   Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity): Retrieving large datasets without pagination in Diesel queries can exhaust server memory and database resources.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   DoS: Medium to High - Reduces DoS risk by improving Diesel query performance and resource utilization through optimization techniques.
        *   Resource Exhaustion: Medium - Prevents resource exhaustion by limiting data retrieval in Diesel queries through pagination and optimized data loading.
    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Basic pagination is used in some API endpoints. Indexes are generally created based on initial schema design, but not actively optimized for Diesel query patterns.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Regular Diesel query profiling is not performed. Index optimization based on Diesel query analysis is not a continuous process. Consistent pagination across all list endpoints using Diesel is needed.  Strategic use of Diesel's eager loading should be reviewed and implemented where beneficial.
