# Threat Model Analysis for diesel-rs/diesel

## Threat: [Raw SQL Injection](./threats/raw_sql_injection.md)

* **Description:** An attacker injects malicious SQL code through user-controlled input that is directly incorporated into raw SQL queries executed by Diesel's `sql_query` function or similar raw SQL features. The attacker can manipulate the database by bypassing application logic, reading sensitive data, modifying data, or even executing administrative commands on the database server.
* **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, data loss, unauthorized access, potential database server compromise.
* **Diesel Component Affected:** `diesel::sql_query`, raw SQL execution features.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Avoid Raw SQL:**  Prefer Diesel's query builder and type-safe APIs whenever possible to construct queries.
    * **Parameterization:** If raw SQL is absolutely necessary, use Diesel's parameterization features (e.g., `bind` function) to properly sanitize and escape user input.
    * **Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user inputs before incorporating them into any SQL query, even parameterized ones, to prevent unexpected data types or formats.

## Threat: [Improper Parameterization Bypass](./threats/improper_parameterization_bypass.md)

* **Description:** An attacker crafts input that exploits edge cases or vulnerabilities in how Diesel's parameterization is used, or finds ways to bypass parameterization in complex or dynamically constructed queries. This allows malicious SQL code to be injected despite the intended use of parameterization.
* **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, data loss, unauthorized access.
* **Diesel Component Affected:** Diesel's parameterization mechanisms, query builder in complex scenarios.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Review Complex Queries:** Carefully review and test complex queries, especially those with dynamic parts or conditional logic, to ensure parameterization is consistently applied and effective.
    * **Static Analysis:** Utilize static analysis tools to detect potential parameterization issues in Diesel queries.
    * **Security Testing:** Conduct thorough security testing, including penetration testing, to identify potential SQL injection vulnerabilities, even when using ORM features.
    * **Stay Updated:** Keep Diesel and its dependencies updated to benefit from bug fixes and security patches that might address parameterization vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Diesel Crate Vulnerabilities](./threats/diesel_crate_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Security vulnerabilities are discovered in the Diesel crate itself. Using outdated versions of Diesel with known vulnerabilities exposes the application to potential exploits.
* **Impact:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, could range from information disclosure to remote code execution.
* **Diesel Component Affected:** Diesel crate itself, core ORM logic.
* **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical to High depending on the vulnerability)
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Regular Updates:** Regularly update Diesel to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
    * **Security Advisories:** Monitor security advisories for Diesel and related Rust crates.
    * **Dependency Scanning:** Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in Diesel and its dependencies.
    * **Vulnerability Patching:** Apply security patches promptly when vulnerabilities are disclosed.
