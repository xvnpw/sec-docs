# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, Diesel, is an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) written in Rust. Its primary business goal is to provide a safe, performant, and productive way for Rust developers to interact with databases. By abstracting away the complexities of raw SQL, Diesel aims to increase developer efficiency and reduce the likelihood of database-related errors in Rust applications.

The main business priorities for Diesel are:
- Developer Productivity: Simplifying database interactions for Rust developers, allowing them to focus on application logic rather than database intricacies.
- Performance: Ensuring efficient database queries and operations, minimizing overhead introduced by the ORM.
- Data Integrity: Providing compile-time safety and runtime checks to prevent common database errors and maintain data consistency.
- Database Agnosticism: Supporting multiple database systems (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite) to offer flexibility to developers.
- Community Support: Building a strong and active community to ensure the project's long-term sustainability and improvement.

The most important business risks associated with Diesel are:
- Data Breaches: Vulnerabilities in Diesel or its usage could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in databases.
- Application Downtime: Bugs or performance issues in Diesel could cause application failures or slowdowns, impacting business operations.
- Data Corruption: Errors in data mapping or query generation could lead to data inconsistencies or corruption.
- Security Vulnerabilities in Dependencies: Diesel relies on external crates and database drivers, which could introduce security vulnerabilities if not properly managed.
- Adoption Risk: If developers perceive Diesel as too complex, insecure, or underperforming, adoption rates may be low, hindering its business goals.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls for the Diesel project and its ecosystem include:
- security control: Rust's Memory Safety: Rust's core language features prevent many common memory safety vulnerabilities like buffer overflows and use-after-free errors, which can indirectly improve the security of applications using Diesel. Implemented by Rust compiler.
- security control: Database Security Mechanisms: Relies on underlying database systems for access control, authentication, and authorization. Described in database documentation.
- security control: Secure Coding Practices: The Diesel project aims to follow secure coding practices in its development. Evident in code reviews and issue discussions in the GitHub repository.
- security control: Dependency Management: Cargo, Rust's package manager, helps manage dependencies and their versions. Described in Cargo documentation.

Accepted risks for the Diesel project include:
- accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in Diesel Library: Despite best efforts, vulnerabilities might be discovered in the Diesel library itself. Mitigation relies on community security audits and timely patching.
- accepted risk: Insecure Application Code: Developers using Diesel might still write insecure application code that bypasses or misuses Diesel's features, leading to vulnerabilities. Mitigation relies on developer education and secure coding guidelines.
- accepted risk: Supply Chain Attacks: Dependencies of Diesel or its build process could be compromised, leading to supply chain attacks. Mitigation relies on dependency scanning and build process security.

Recommended security controls to implement for Diesel and projects using it:
- recommended security control: Static Analysis: Integrate static analysis tools (e.g., `cargo clippy`, `rustsec`) into the Diesel development and CI process to automatically detect potential security issues and coding flaws.
- recommended security control: Dependency Scanning: Regularly scan Diesel's dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `cargo audit` and integrate this into the CI process.
- recommended security control: Security Audits: Conduct periodic security audits of the Diesel codebase by external security experts to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
- recommended security control: Input Validation Guidance: Provide clear guidance and examples in Diesel documentation on how to perform input validation when using Diesel to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- recommended security control: Secure Configuration Examples: Offer secure configuration examples for common database setups and Diesel usage scenarios in the documentation.
- recommended security control: Fuzzing: Implement fuzzing techniques to automatically test Diesel's robustness and identify potential crash bugs or vulnerabilities.

Security requirements for Diesel and applications using it:
- Authentication:
    - Requirement: Diesel itself does not handle authentication. Authentication is delegated to the underlying database system. Applications using Diesel must configure database authentication properly.
    - Requirement: Applications should use strong authentication mechanisms provided by the database (e.g., password policies, multi-factor authentication where supported).
- Authorization:
    - Requirement: Diesel does not enforce authorization. Authorization logic must be implemented within the application code using Diesel.
    - Requirement: Applications should implement fine-grained authorization controls to ensure users only have access to the data and operations they are permitted to perform.
    - Requirement: Consider using database-level roles and permissions in conjunction with application-level authorization.
- Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Diesel helps prevent SQL injection by using parameterized queries. Developers must use Diesel's query builder and avoid constructing raw SQL queries from user input.
    - Requirement: Applications must validate all user inputs before using them in Diesel queries, even when using parameterized queries, to prevent other types of input-related vulnerabilities.
    - Requirement: Diesel documentation should provide clear guidelines and examples on how to perform input validation effectively.
- Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Diesel itself does not provide cryptographic functions. If applications need to handle sensitive data that requires encryption, they should use Rust's cryptographic libraries (e.g., `ring`, `rust-crypto`).
    - Requirement: When storing sensitive data in the database, consider using database-level encryption features or encrypting data at the application level before storing it using Diesel.
    - Requirement: Ensure secure handling of cryptographic keys and secrets used for encryption.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process being protected:
- Secure and reliable data access for Rust applications using Diesel. This includes data persistence, retrieval, and manipulation.

Data being protected and its sensitivity:
- Application data stored in databases accessed through Diesel. The sensitivity of this data depends entirely on the applications using Diesel. It can range from publicly available information to highly sensitive personal or financial data.
- Diesel library code itself. Protecting the integrity and security of the Diesel library is crucial to prevent vulnerabilities in applications that depend on it.

Data sensitivity levels can be categorized as:
- Public: Non-sensitive data, publicly accessible.
- Internal: Data intended for internal use within an organization, not publicly accessible.
- Confidential: Sensitive data that requires strict access control and confidentiality, such as personal data, financial records, or trade secrets.

The risk assessment should be performed in the context of the specific application using Diesel, considering the sensitivity of the data it handles and the potential impact of security breaches.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- What is the organization's risk appetite regarding security vulnerabilities in open-source libraries?
- Are there any existing security policies or guidelines that applications using Diesel must adhere to?

Assumptions:
- Applications using Diesel will handle some level of sensitive data, requiring appropriate security measures.
- The target deployment environment is likely to include cloud environments and containerization.
- Security is a significant concern for projects using Diesel, and proactive security measures are desired.
- Developers using Diesel are expected to follow secure coding practices and utilize Diesel's security features correctly.
- The organization deploying applications using Diesel has a moderate to high risk awareness and is willing to invest in security controls.
