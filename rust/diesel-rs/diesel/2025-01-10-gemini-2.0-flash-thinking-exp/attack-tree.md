## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Diesel ORM Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_diesel_orm_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

**Description:** The ultimate goal of the attacker is to compromise the application by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the Diesel ORM or its usage. This can manifest in various ways, including gaining unauthorized access, manipulating data, or disrupting service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_sql_injection_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

**Description:**  This category of attacks involves injecting malicious SQL code into database queries executed by the application. Successful exploitation can allow attackers to bypass security measures, access sensitive data, modify data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious SQL via Raw SQL Queries [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_sql_via_raw_sql_queries__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

**Description:** When developers use Diesel's `sql_query` or similar functions to execute raw SQL, they bypass Diesel's built-in safety mechanisms. If user-provided data is directly concatenated into these raw SQL strings without proper sanitization or parameterization, it creates a classic SQL injection vulnerability.
* **Attacker Action:** An attacker provides malicious input that, when incorporated into the raw SQL query, alters the query's intent. This could involve adding `OR 1=1` conditions to bypass authentication, injecting `DROP TABLE` statements, or executing arbitrary SQL commands.
* **Mitigation:** Avoid using raw SQL whenever possible. If necessary, always use parameterized queries with `bind` to ensure user input is treated as data, not executable code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious SQL via Query Builder Misuse [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_sql_via_query_builder_misuse__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

**Description:** Even when using Diesel's query builder, vulnerabilities can arise from improper usage. Dynamically constructing table or column names from user input without proper validation can lead to injection. Incorrect use of `bind` or relying on string interpolation within the query builder can also be risky.
* **Attacker Action:** An attacker crafts input that manipulates the generated SQL. For example, providing a malicious table name could lead to querying unintended tables.
* **Mitigation:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize any user input used to influence query structure (table names, column names). Understand the nuances of `bind` and use it correctly. Keep Diesel updated to benefit from bug fixes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Information Disclosure [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/information_disclosure__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

**Description:** This attack aims to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information stored within the application's database. This can be achieved through various means, but SQL injection is a primary concern in the context of Diesel.

## Attack Tree Path: [Extract Sensitive Data via SQL Injection [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/extract_sensitive_data_via_sql_injection__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

**Description:** As a direct consequence of successful SQL injection, an attacker can craft queries to retrieve any data stored in the database, including usernames, passwords, personal information, financial records, or other confidential data.
* **Attacker Action:** The attacker uses SQL injection techniques to query and retrieve unauthorized data.
* **Mitigation:** Prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities through proper input validation and parameterized queries.

## Attack Tree Path: [Dependency Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/dependency_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

**Description:** Diesel relies on underlying database drivers and other crates. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can indirectly affect applications using Diesel.
* **Attacker Action:** The attacker exploits known vulnerabilities in Diesel's dependencies.
* **Mitigation:** Regularly update Diesel and its dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities. Use vulnerability scanning tools to identify vulnerable dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Data Integrity [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_data_integrity__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

**Description:** This attack aims to alter or corrupt the data stored in the application's database. This can have severe consequences, leading to incorrect application behavior, financial losses, or reputational damage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce Malicious Data [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_malicious_data__high-risk_path_.md)

**Description:** Through SQL injection or other vulnerabilities, an attacker can insert or update database records with malicious content. This could involve injecting scripts, altering financial data, or planting backdoors.
* **Attacker Action:** The attacker uses vulnerabilities to inject malicious data into the database.
* **Mitigation:** Prevent SQL injection and other data modification vulnerabilities. Implement input validation and sanitization.
