# Attack Surface Analysis for diesel-rs/diesel

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection via Raw SQL Queries](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_via_raw_sql_queries.md)

*   **Description:**  Executing arbitrary SQL commands by injecting malicious code into raw SQL strings.
*   **How Diesel Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Diesel allows the execution of raw SQL queries using methods like `execute()` and `get_results()`. If user-provided data is directly concatenated or interpolated into these strings without proper sanitization, it creates an entry point for SQL injection. Diesel's query builder inherently prevents this by using parameterized queries.
*   **Example:** A web form takes a user's search term. The application constructs a raw SQL query like `connection.execute(format!("SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE '%{}%'", user_input))`. If `user_input` is `%'; DROP TABLE users; --`, this malicious SQL will be executed.
*   **Impact:**  Complete database compromise, including data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. Potential for executing operating system commands if database permissions allow.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always prefer Diesel's query builder:** Utilize Diesel's built-in methods for constructing queries, which automatically handle parameterization.
    *   **Never directly embed user input into raw SQL strings:**  If raw SQL is absolutely necessary, use parameterized queries or prepared statements provided by the underlying database driver.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection via Dynamic Predicates and Filters](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_via_dynamic_predicates_and_filters.md)

*   **Description:** Constructing dynamic `WHERE` clauses or other query parts based on user input without proper validation, leading to the injection of malicious SQL.
*   **How Diesel Contributes to the Attack Surface:** While Diesel's query builder offers safety, developers might dynamically construct parts of the query based on user choices (e.g., filtering by a specific column). If the column name or comparison operator is directly taken from user input without validation, it can be exploited.
*   **Example:** A filtering feature allows users to select a column to filter by. The application might build a query like `users.filter(dsl::column(&user_selected_column).eq("some_value"))`. If `user_selected_column` is crafted maliciously (e.g., `users.id); DELETE FROM users WHERE`), it can inject unwanted SQL.
*   **Impact:**  Potentially unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion depending on the injected SQL.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Whitelist allowed column names and operators:**  Only allow filtering or ordering by predefined, safe columns and operators.
    *   **Use enums or predefined structures:**  Represent filterable fields and operators with enums or other strongly typed structures to prevent arbitrary user input.
    *   **Avoid directly using user input to determine query structure:**  Instead, map user selections to predefined query components.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Migrations](./attack_surfaces/malicious_migrations.md)

*   **Description:** Introducing malicious changes to the database schema through compromised or intentionally crafted database migrations.
*   **How Diesel Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Diesel provides a migration system to manage database schema changes. If the migration process is not secured, an attacker could introduce migrations that alter the database structure in harmful ways.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the migration files or the deployment pipeline and adds a migration that drops critical tables, adds backdoors, or modifies data in a way that compromises the application's integrity.
*   **Impact:** Data loss, data corruption, privilege escalation (e.g., adding new administrative users), denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure the migration process:** Implement strict access controls on migration files and the deployment pipeline.
    *   **Code review migrations:** Treat migrations like any other code and subject them to thorough code reviews before execution.
    *   **Use separate environments:** Develop and test migrations in non-production environments before applying them to production.
    *   **Implement rollback procedures:** Have a clear process for rolling back migrations in case of errors or malicious changes.
