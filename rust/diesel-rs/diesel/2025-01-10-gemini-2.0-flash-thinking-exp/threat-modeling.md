# Threat Model Analysis for diesel-rs/diesel

## Threat: [SQL Injection through Raw SQL](./threats/sql_injection_through_raw_sql.md)

* **Threat:** SQL Injection through Raw SQL
    * **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious SQL code by exploiting areas where the application uses Diesel's `sql_query` or similar functions to execute raw SQL queries without proper sanitization of user-provided input. The attacker could manipulate the query to access, modify, or delete data they are not authorized to interact with, or even execute arbitrary database commands. This directly involves Diesel's mechanism for executing raw SQL.
    * **Impact:** Data breach, data modification, data deletion, potential for privilege escalation within the database, denial of service.
    * **Affected Diesel Component:** `diesel::sql_query` function, any function allowing direct execution of SQL.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Avoid using raw SQL queries whenever possible.** Prefer Diesel's query builder for safe parameterization.
        * **If raw SQL is absolutely necessary, use Diesel's parameterized query capabilities** to ensure user input is treated as data, not executable code.
        * **Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user-provided input** before incorporating it into any SQL query, even when using parameterization as a defense-in-depth measure.

## Threat: [SQL Injection through Unsafe Interpolation in Query Builder](./threats/sql_injection_through_unsafe_interpolation_in_query_builder.md)

* **Threat:** SQL Injection through Unsafe Interpolation in Query Builder
    * **Description:** Even when using Diesel's query builder, developers might inadvertently introduce SQL injection vulnerabilities by using string interpolation or formatting to insert user-provided data into query fragments instead of relying on Diesel's parameterization mechanisms. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL by exploiting how the query is constructed within Diesel.
    * **Impact:** Data breach, data modification, data deletion, potential for privilege escalation within the database, denial of service.
    * **Affected Diesel Component:** Diesel's query builder, specifically where developers might manually construct parts of the query using string manipulation.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Always use Diesel's provided methods for filtering and data insertion** within the query builder, which handle parameterization correctly.
        * **Avoid string interpolation or formatting for user-provided data within query builder expressions.**
        * **Educate developers on secure query building practices with Diesel.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Threat:** Dependency Vulnerabilities
    * **Description:** Diesel relies on other Rust crates. Security vulnerabilities in these dependencies could indirectly affect applications using Diesel. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities if they exist in Diesel's transitive dependencies, impacting the security of the Diesel library itself.
    * **Impact:**  Depends on the nature of the vulnerability in the dependency, could range from information disclosure to remote code execution.
    * **Affected Diesel Component:** Diesel's dependency management.
    * **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be high or critical depending on the dependency vulnerability).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Regularly update Diesel and its dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.**
        * **Use tools like `cargo audit` to identify and address known security vulnerabilities in dependencies.**
        * **Monitor security advisories for Diesel and its dependencies.**
