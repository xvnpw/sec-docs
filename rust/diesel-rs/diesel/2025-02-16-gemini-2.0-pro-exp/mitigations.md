# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for diesel-rs/diesel

## Mitigation Strategy: [Prepared Statements and Query Builder Preference](./mitigation_strategies/prepared_statements_and_query_builder_preference.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Prioritize the Query Builder:** Developers should primarily use Diesel's query builder methods (e.g., `.filter()`, `.select()`, `.insert()`, `.update()`, `.delete()`) for constructing database queries. These methods automatically generate parameterized SQL queries (prepared statements).
    2.  **Minimize `sql_query`:** The `sql_query` function, which allows raw SQL execution, should be used *only* when absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.
    3.  **Safe Parameter Binding (for `sql_query`):** If `sql_query` is unavoidable:
        *   *Never* interpolate user-provided data directly into the SQL string.
        *   Use Diesel's `bind` method to pass parameters separately.  Specify the correct `diesel::sql_types` for each parameter.
        *   Example (Correct):
            ```rust
            let user_id = get_user_input(); // Assume this gets user input
            let results = sql_query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?")
                .bind::<diesel::sql_types::Integer, _>(user_id)
                .load::<User>(&mut conn)?;
            ```
        *   Example (Incorrect):
            ```rust
            let user_id = get_user_input();
            let results = sql_query(format!("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {}", user_id))
                .load::<User>(&mut conn)?;
            ```

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **SQL Injection (Severity: Critical):** The primary threat. Attackers can inject malicious SQL code to bypass authentication, steal data, modify data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** Risk reduced from Critical to Very Low (assuming proper implementation).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   *Example:* Query builder is used for 95% of queries. `sql_query` is used in `src/legacy_reports.rs`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   *Example:* The `src/legacy_reports.rs` code needs review and refactoring to use the query builder or safer parameter binding.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Schema Validation and Type Safety (Diesel-Specific Aspects)](./mitigation_strategies/schema_validation_and_type_safety__diesel-specific_aspects_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Diesel Migrations:** *All* database schema changes must be managed through Diesel's migration system. Developers should use `diesel migration generate <migration_name>` to create new migrations and `diesel migration run` to apply them.
    2.  **`schema.rs` Generation:** After each migration, developers must run `diesel print-schema > src/schema.rs` to update the `schema.rs` file. This file should be committed to version control. The build process should fail if `schema.rs` is outdated.
    3.  **Enum Mapping (if applicable):** If the database uses enums, ensure they are correctly mapped to Rust enums using Diesel's features (e.g., `#[derive(DbEnum)]`). Document the mapping clearly.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Corruption (Severity: High):** Mismatches between the application's expected schema and the actual schema can lead to incorrect data being written.
    *   **Application Errors/Crashes (Severity: Medium):** Schema mismatches can cause runtime errors.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Corruption:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Application Errors/Crashes:** Risk reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   *Example:* Diesel migrations are used consistently. `schema.rs` is generated and committed.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   *Example:* Enum mapping is not explicitly documented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Over-Fetching and Under-Fetching Prevention (Diesel-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/over-fetching_and_under-fetching_prevention__diesel-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Selective `SELECT` Statements:** Use the `.select()` method in Diesel's query builder to explicitly specify the columns to retrieve. Avoid `SELECT *` unless all columns are genuinely required.
    2.  **Targeted Structs:** Define Rust structs that represent only the data needed for a specific operation. Use these structs with `.select()` to avoid fetching unnecessary data.
    3.  **Association Management:** Carefully manage database associations (e.g., `belongs_to`, `has_many`). Use eager loading (e.g., `.load()`, `.get_results()`) or lazy loading (e.g., `.load_iter()`) appropriately.
    4.  **Pagination:** For queries that might return large result sets, implement pagination using Diesel's `.limit()` and `.offset()` methods.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Exposure (Severity: Medium):** Over-fetching can inadvertently expose sensitive data.
    *   **Performance Degradation (Severity: Medium):** Fetching unnecessary data increases database load.
    *   **Application Errors (Severity: Low):** Under-fetching can lead to errors.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Exposure:** Risk reduced.
    *   **Performance Degradation:** Risk reduced.
    *   **Application Errors:** Risk reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   *Example:* `.select()` is used in some queries. Pagination is implemented for some list views.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   *Example:* `SELECT *` is still used in many queries. Pagination is missing for several large data sets.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Transaction Management (Diesel-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/transaction_management__diesel-specific_.md)

* **Description:**
    1.  **Explicit Transactions:** Use `connection.transaction(|| { ... })` or `connection.build_transaction().run(|| { ... })` to wrap database operations that must be executed atomically.
    2.  **Isolation Levels:**  When using `build_transaction()`, explicitly set the desired isolation level using methods like `.read_committed()`, `.repeatable_read()`, or `.serializable()`.  Understand the implications of each level and document the choice.
    3. **Error Handling within Transactions:** Diesel's `transaction` method automatically handles rollbacks on error, ensure that custom error types implement the necessary traits for proper rollback.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Inconsistency (Severity: High):** Incorrect transaction handling can lead to partial updates.
    *   **Race Conditions (Severity: High):** Concurrent transactions without proper isolation can lead to race conditions.

* **Impact:**
    *   **Data Inconsistency:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Race Conditions:** Risk reduced.

* **Currently Implemented:**
    *   *Example:* `connection.transaction()` is used for some multi-step operations.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    *   *Example:* Isolation levels are not explicitly considered or documented.
