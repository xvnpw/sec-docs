Okay, let's craft a deep analysis of the specified attack tree path, focusing on the `diesel::sql_query` vulnerability.

## Deep Analysis: `diesel::sql_query` with Untrusted Input (Attack Tree Path 1.1.1)

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the risks associated with using `diesel::sql_query` with untrusted input, identify the root causes of the vulnerability, explore various exploitation scenarios, and provide concrete, actionable recommendations for mitigation and prevention.  We aim to provide the development team with the knowledge necessary to avoid this vulnerability and to build secure database interactions.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on the following:

*   The `diesel::sql_query` function and any other Diesel functions that execute raw SQL queries (e.g., functions that might be used internally by `sql_query`).
*   The Rust programming language and the Diesel ORM framework.
*   The context of web application development where user input is commonly received and processed.
*   SQL injection vulnerabilities arising from improper handling of untrusted input within raw SQL queries.
*   PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite databases, as these are the databases officially supported by Diesel.  While the core vulnerability is database-agnostic, specific exploitation techniques might vary slightly between database systems.
*   Mitigation strategies that are directly applicable within the Diesel framework and Rust ecosystem.

**Methodology:**

The analysis will employ the following methodologies:

1.  **Code Review:**  We will examine the Diesel source code (if necessary, though the documentation is generally sufficient for this high-level analysis) and example code snippets to understand how `sql_query` processes input and interacts with the database.
2.  **Vulnerability Analysis:** We will analyze the known characteristics of SQL injection vulnerabilities and how they manifest in the context of `diesel::sql_query`.
3.  **Exploitation Scenario Development:** We will construct realistic attack scenarios demonstrating how an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to achieve various malicious objectives.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Evaluation:** We will evaluate the effectiveness of different mitigation strategies, including parameterized queries, input validation, and other security best practices.  We will prioritize mitigations that are directly supported by Diesel.
5.  **Threat Modeling:** We will consider the attacker's perspective, including their motivations, capabilities, and potential attack vectors.
6.  **Documentation Review:** We will thoroughly review the official Diesel documentation to identify any warnings, best practices, or security recommendations related to raw SQL queries.

### 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.1.1

**2.1 Vulnerability Description and Root Cause:**

The vulnerability, as described in the attack tree, is a classic SQL injection.  The root cause is the *direct concatenation of untrusted user input into a raw SQL query string*.  This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code that alters the intended logic of the query.  The `diesel::sql_query` function, while powerful, is inherently dangerous if misused in this way.  It's designed for executing arbitrary SQL, and it trusts that the provided SQL string is safe.  It does *not* perform any automatic sanitization or escaping.

**2.2 Exploitation Scenarios:**

Let's expand on the provided example and explore several exploitation scenarios:

*   **Data Exfiltration (Retrieving all users):**
    *   **Vulnerable Code:**
        ```rust
        let user_input = req.params().get("username").unwrap(); // Untrusted input
        let query = format!("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '{}'", user_input);
        let results = diesel::sql_query(query).load::<User>(&mut conn);
        ```
    *   **Attacker Input:** `' OR 1=1; --`
    *   **Resulting SQL:** `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR 1=1; --'`
    *   **Explanation:** The `OR 1=1` condition is always true, bypassing the username check.  The `--` comments out any remaining part of the original query.  This retrieves all rows from the `users` table.

*   **Data Exfiltration (Retrieving specific data):**
    *   **Attacker Input:** `' UNION SELECT email, password FROM users; --`
    *   **Resulting SQL:** `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' UNION SELECT email, password FROM users; --'`
    *   **Explanation:**  The `UNION` operator combines the results of two `SELECT` statements.  The attacker can retrieve arbitrary columns from the table, potentially including sensitive data like email addresses and hashed passwords.  This works if the number of columns and their types are compatible between the original query and the injected query.

*   **Data Modification (Updating a user's password):**
    *   **Attacker Input:** `'; UPDATE users SET password = 'new_password' WHERE username = 'admin'; --`
    *   **Resulting SQL:** `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ''; UPDATE users SET password = 'new_password' WHERE username = 'admin'; --'`
    *   **Explanation:** The attacker terminates the original query with a semicolon and then injects an `UPDATE` statement to change the password of the 'admin' user.

*   **Data Deletion (Dropping a table):**
    *   **Attacker Input:** `'; DROP TABLE users; --`
    *   **Resulting SQL:** `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ''; DROP TABLE users; --'`
    *   **Explanation:**  The attacker terminates the original query and injects a `DROP TABLE` statement, potentially causing significant data loss.

*   **Database Enumeration (Information Gathering):**
    *   **Attacker Input (MySQL):** `'; SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables; --`
    *   **Resulting SQL (MySQL):** `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ''; SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables; --'`
    *   **Explanation:** The attacker can query system tables (like `information_schema` in MySQL or `pg_catalog` in PostgreSQL) to discover database structure, table names, column names, and other valuable information for further attacks.

*   **Bypassing Authentication:**
    *   **Attacker Input:** `' OR '1'='1`
    *   **Resulting SQL:** `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1'`
    *   **Explanation:** Similar to the first example, this bypasses any username/password check by injecting a condition that is always true.

* **Stacked Queries (Multiple Statements):**
    * **Attacker Input:** `'; INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES ('attacker', 'password'); --`
    * **Resulting SQL:** `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ''; INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES ('attacker', 'password'); --`
    * **Explanation:** The attacker adds a new user to the database. Whether this works depends on the database configuration and whether multiple statements are allowed in a single query. MySQL, by default, *does not* allow this unless explicitly configured. PostgreSQL *does* allow it. This highlights the importance of understanding database-specific behaviors.

**2.3 Mitigation Strategies (Detailed):**

*   **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements) - Primary and Preferred:**

    *   **Mechanism:**  Parameterized queries separate the SQL code from the data.  The query contains placeholders (e.g., `?` in Diesel), and the data is provided separately through a binding mechanism.  The database driver is responsible for safely escaping and inserting the data into the query, preventing SQL injection.
    *   **Diesel Implementation:**
        ```rust
        // SAFER CODE (using parameterized query)
        let user_input = req.params().get("username").unwrap();
        let results = diesel::sql_query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?")
            .bind::<diesel::sql_types::Text, _>(user_input)
            .load::<User>(&mut conn);
        ```
        *   **Explanation:** The `?` is a placeholder.  The `.bind::<diesel::sql_types::Text, _>(user_input)` call tells Diesel to bind the `user_input` as a text value to the first placeholder.  Diesel and the underlying database driver handle the escaping.  The `diesel::sql_types::Text` specifies the expected data type, providing an additional layer of validation.
        * **Advantages:** This is the most effective and recommended defense against SQL injection. It's database-agnostic and handles escaping correctly, regardless of the specific characters in the input.
        * **Limitations:** Requires understanding the correct Diesel syntax for binding parameters.

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization - Tertiary (Defense in Depth):**

    *   **Mechanism:**  Before even considering using user input in a query, validate and sanitize it.  Validation checks if the input conforms to expected rules (e.g., length, character set, format).  Sanitization removes or escapes potentially dangerous characters.
    *   **Example (Conceptual - Specific implementation depends on requirements):**
        ```rust
        let user_input = req.params().get("username").unwrap();

        // Validation: Check if the username is alphanumeric and within a length limit.
        if !is_valid_username(user_input) {
            return Err("Invalid username format");
        }

        // Sanitization (Less effective than parameterized queries, but still useful)
        let sanitized_input = sanitize_for_sql(user_input);

        // ... (Use parameterized query with sanitized_input) ...
        ```
    *   **Advantages:** Provides an additional layer of defense.  Can help prevent other types of attacks (e.g., cross-site scripting) if the input is used in other contexts.
    *   **Limitations:**  *Extremely difficult to get right*.  It's easy to miss edge cases or create new vulnerabilities through incorrect sanitization.  It's also database-specific; escaping rules vary between database systems.  *This should never be the primary defense against SQL injection.*

*   **Least Privilege Principle:**

    *   **Mechanism:** Ensure that the database user account used by the application has only the necessary privileges.  Don't use a superuser or administrator account.  Grant only `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` privileges on specific tables as needed.
    *   **Advantages:** Limits the potential damage from a successful SQL injection attack.  Even if an attacker can inject code, they won't be able to drop tables, create new users, or access other databases if the application's user account doesn't have those privileges.
    *   **Limitations:** Doesn't prevent SQL injection itself, but mitigates the impact.

*   **Error Handling:**

    *   **Mechanism:** Avoid displaying detailed database error messages to the user.  These messages can reveal information about the database structure and make it easier for an attacker to craft successful exploits.  Log errors internally for debugging, but present generic error messages to the user.
    *   **Advantages:** Reduces information leakage.
    *   **Limitations:** Doesn't prevent SQL injection.

*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**

    *   **Mechanism:** A WAF can be configured to detect and block common SQL injection patterns.
    *   **Advantages:** Provides an external layer of defense.
    *   **Limitations:** Can be bypassed by sophisticated attackers.  Should not be the only line of defense.

**2.4 Detection:**

*   **Static Analysis Tools:** Tools like Clippy (for Rust) can often detect potential string concatenation vulnerabilities. More specialized security-focused static analysis tools can perform more in-depth analysis.
*   **Code Review:** Manual code review by experienced developers is crucial for identifying this type of vulnerability.
*   **Penetration Testing:**  Ethical hackers can attempt to exploit the application using SQL injection techniques to identify vulnerabilities.
*   **Dynamic Analysis:** Tools that monitor database queries at runtime can detect suspicious patterns.
*   **Database Auditing:**  Enable database auditing to log all SQL queries.  This can help detect and investigate successful attacks.

**2.5 Recommendations:**

1.  **Mandatory Use of Parameterized Queries:**  Enforce a strict policy that *all* database interactions using `diesel::sql_query` (or any raw SQL function) *must* use parameterized queries.  Code reviews should specifically check for this.
2.  **Input Validation as Secondary Defense:** Implement robust input validation to ensure that user input conforms to expected formats and constraints.
3.  **Least Privilege:** Configure the database user account with the minimum necessary privileges.
4.  **Secure Error Handling:**  Avoid displaying detailed database error messages to users.
5.  **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security assessments to identify and address vulnerabilities.
6.  **Training:** Provide developers with training on secure coding practices, including SQL injection prevention.
7.  **Consider Alternatives to `sql_query`:** If possible, use Diesel's query builder API instead of raw SQL. The query builder provides a more type-safe and less error-prone way to construct queries. While it doesn't inherently prevent all forms of SQL injection if misused (e.g., by concatenating strings within the query builder), it encourages safer practices.

### 3. Conclusion

The `diesel::sql_query` function, when used with untrusted input without proper parameterization, presents a severe SQL injection vulnerability.  This vulnerability can lead to complete database compromise, including data exfiltration, modification, and deletion.  The primary mitigation is the consistent and correct use of parameterized queries.  Input validation, least privilege, and secure error handling provide additional layers of defense.  Regular security audits and developer training are essential for preventing this vulnerability. By following these recommendations, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of SQL injection and build a more secure application.
