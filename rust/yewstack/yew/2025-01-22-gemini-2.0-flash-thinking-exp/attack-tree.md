## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Client-Side Rendering Vulnerabilities -> Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Yew Rendering -> Inject Malicious Script through User Input -> Unescaped User Input in Yew Components](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_client-side_rendering_vulnerabilities_-_cross-site_scripting__xss__via_yew_rendering_-_injec_b3e065ff.md)

*   **Attack Step:** Unescaped User Input in Yew Components [CRITICAL NODE]
    *   **Description:**  The application renders user-provided data in Yew components without proper escaping or sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium-High
    *   **Impact:** Significant-Critical (Full compromise of user accounts, data theft, malware distribution, website defacement)
    *   **Effort:** Low-Medium (Easily exploitable if vulnerability exists, many automated tools available)
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner-Intermediate (Basic understanding of HTML and JavaScript injection)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Can be detected with web vulnerability scanners and code reviews, but may be missed if input contexts are complex)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Primary Mitigation:**  Always use Yew's `html!` macro for rendering user-provided data, which automatically escapes HTML entities.
        *   **Secondary Mitigation:** If raw HTML rendering is absolutely necessary (highly discouraged), use a trusted and actively maintained HTML sanitization library *before* rendering with `html!`.
        *   **Further Mitigation:** Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to reduce the impact of XSS even if it occurs by limiting the sources from which the browser can load resources and restricting inline script execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities -> Outdated Yew Version or Dependencies -> Using Vulnerable Yew Version -> Exploiting Known Yew Framework Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities_-_outdated_yew_version_or_dependencies_-_using_vulnerable_yew_ver_ca8bd396.md)

*   **Attack Step:** Exploiting Known Yew Framework Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** The application uses an outdated version of the Yew framework that contains known security vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit these publicly known vulnerabilities to compromise the application.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low-Medium (Depends on how outdated the Yew version is and if public exploits are available)
    *   **Impact:** Significant-Critical (Depends on the specific vulnerability in Yew, could range from DoS to Remote Code Execution)
    *   **Effort:** Low-Medium (If public exploits exist, exploitation is relatively easy)
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner-Intermediate (If public exploits exist, requires basic understanding of exploit execution)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy-Medium (Vulnerability scanners can easily detect outdated Yew versions)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Primary Mitigation:** Regularly update the Yew framework to the latest stable version.
        *   **Secondary Mitigation:** Subscribe to Yew project security advisories and release notes to be informed of any reported vulnerabilities and updates.
        *   **Further Mitigation:** Implement automated dependency update checks and alerts within the CI/CD pipeline.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities -> Outdated Yew Version or Dependencies -> Using Vulnerable Rust Crates (Dependencies) -> Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Rust Crates Used by Yew Application](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities_-_outdated_yew_version_or_dependencies_-_using_vulnerable_rust_cr_c7343b95.md)

*   **Attack Step:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Rust Crates Used by Yew Application [CRITICAL NODE]
    *   **Description:** The application depends on Rust crates (libraries) that contain known security vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities in the dependencies to compromise the application.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Rust crate vulnerabilities are discovered and disclosed regularly)
    *   **Impact:** Significant (Depends on the vulnerable crate and the nature of the vulnerability, could lead to data breaches, DoS, or other forms of compromise)
    *   **Effort:** Low-Medium (If public exploits or vulnerability details are available, exploitation is relatively easy)
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner-Intermediate (If public exploits or vulnerability details are available, requires basic understanding of exploit execution)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy-Medium (Vulnerability scanners like `cargo audit` and dependency scanning tools can detect known crate vulnerabilities)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Primary Mitigation:** Regularly audit and update Rust crate dependencies using tools like `cargo audit`.
        *   **Secondary Mitigation:** Monitor security advisories for Rust crates used in the application.
        *   **Further Mitigation:** Implement a dependency management policy that includes regular vulnerability scanning and prioritized updates. Consider using dependency pinning or lock files to ensure consistent and auditable dependency versions.
