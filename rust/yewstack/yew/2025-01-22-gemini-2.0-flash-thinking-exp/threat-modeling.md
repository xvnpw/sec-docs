# Threat Model Analysis for yewstack/yew

## Threat: [XSS via Virtual DOM Vulnerability](./threats/xss_via_virtual_dom_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could craft malicious data or interactions that exploit a bug in Yew's Virtual DOM diffing or patching logic. This allows them to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code into the application's DOM, potentially stealing user credentials, session tokens, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Impact:** Critical. Full compromise of user accounts, data theft, website defacement, malware distribution.
*   **Yew Component Affected:** `yew::virtual_dom` module, specifically diffing and patching algorithms.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Yew to the latest stable version to benefit from bug fixes.
    *   Thoroughly test application with various inputs, especially user-provided data rendered in the DOM.
    *   Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict the execution of inline scripts and the sources from which resources can be loaded, limiting the impact of XSS even if it occurs.
    *   Report any suspected XSS vulnerabilities in Yew to the maintainers.

## Threat: [Memory Safety Issues in Yew Core](./threats/memory_safety_issues_in_yew_core.md)

*   **Description:**  A vulnerability in Yew's Rust code, potentially within `unsafe` blocks or core logic, could lead to memory corruption or other memory-related errors in the compiled WebAssembly. An attacker might exploit this to cause application crashes, unexpected behavior, or potentially gain control over the application's execution flow.
*   **Impact:** High. Application instability, Denial of Service, potential for more severe exploits depending on the nature of the memory safety issue.
*   **Yew Component Affected:** `yew` core library, potentially affecting various modules depending on the specific vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Rely on Rust's memory safety guarantees and the Yew community's code quality focus.
    *   Monitor for application crashes or unexpected behavior that might indicate memory issues.
    *   Report any suspected memory safety issues in Yew to the maintainers.
    *   In development, use memory sanitizers and fuzzing tools to detect potential memory safety issues early.
