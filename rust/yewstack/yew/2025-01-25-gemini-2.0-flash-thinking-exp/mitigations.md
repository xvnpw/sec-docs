# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for yewstack/yew

## Mitigation Strategy: [Context-Aware Output Escaping in Yew Components](./mitigation_strategies/context-aware_output_escaping_in_yew_components.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Dynamic Content Rendering:** Locate all instances in your Yew components where you are dynamically rendering content based on user input or external data. This includes using variables within the `html!` macro, setting attributes dynamically, and handling text nodes.
2.  **Utilize Yew's Built-in Escaping:**  Leverage Yew's `html!` macro for automatic escaping of text content. When rendering text nodes within `html!`, Yew generally escapes HTML entities by default. Ensure you are using `html!` for rendering dynamic text wherever possible.
3.  **Exercise Caution with Attribute Binding:** When dynamically setting HTML attributes using Yew's attribute binding (e.g., `class`, `href`, `style`), ensure that the values being bound are properly escaped or sanitized if they originate from user input.  Yew's attribute binding provides some level of protection, but careful usage is still required. Avoid directly concatenating strings into attribute values if those strings are user-controlled.
4.  **Be Wary of `dangerously_set_inner_html`:**  Avoid using `dangerously_set_inner_html` or similar methods in Yew components unless absolutely necessary. This method bypasses Yew's built-in escaping and directly manipulates the DOM, creating a high risk of XSS vulnerabilities if used with unsanitized user input. If you must use it, perform extremely rigorous sanitization *before* passing data to this method.
5.  **Validate and Sanitize Before Rendering (Client-Side):** While server-side sanitization is preferred, if you are handling user input directly within your Yew components before rendering, implement client-side validation and sanitization steps *before* the data is used in the `html!` macro or for attribute binding. This adds an extra layer of defense within the Yew application itself.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Reflected (High Severity):** Mitigates reflected XSS attacks where malicious scripts are injected through user input and immediately rendered by Yew components without proper escaping.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Stored (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of stored XSS attacks if data stored in the backend is later rendered by Yew components without proper escaping.
*   **HTML Injection (Medium Severity):** Prevents attackers from injecting arbitrary HTML into the page through Yew component rendering, potentially altering the application's UI or functionality.

**Impact:**
*   **XSS (Reflected & Stored): Significantly Reduces Risk:**  Correctly utilizing Yew's escaping mechanisms is a primary defense against XSS vulnerabilities within the Yew application's rendering logic.
*   **HTML Injection: Moderately Reduces Risk:** Yew's escaping helps prevent basic HTML injection when rendering dynamic content.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   **Yew's built-in escaping in `html!` macro:**  Generally implemented throughout the application where `html!` is used for rendering dynamic text content. Developers are mostly relying on this default escaping.
*   **Basic attribute binding:** Yew's attribute binding is used in components, offering some inherent protection, but explicit escaping considerations for dynamic attributes might be lacking in some areas.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   **Explicit review of attribute escaping:**  A systematic review of all dynamic attribute bindings in Yew components is needed to ensure proper escaping or sanitization of user-controlled values used in attributes.
*   **Guidelines against `dangerously_set_inner_html`:**  Clearer development guidelines and code review practices are needed to discourage the use of `dangerously_set_inner_html` and emphasize secure alternatives within Yew components.
*   **Client-side sanitization before rendering:**  Client-side sanitization within Yew components, as a fallback or additional layer, is not consistently implemented for all user inputs before they are rendered. Developers are primarily relying on backend sanitization (which might be insufficient in all cases for client-side rendering context).
