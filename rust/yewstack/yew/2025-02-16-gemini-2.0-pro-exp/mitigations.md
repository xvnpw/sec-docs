# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for yewstack/yew

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize Unsafe Rust Code (within Yew Components)](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_unsafe_rust_code__within_yew_components_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Prefer Yew Abstractions:** Prioritize using Yew's built-in components, hooks (like `use_state`, `use_effect`), and event handling mechanisms (`onclick`, `oninput`, etc.) over directly interacting with the DOM using `web-sys` and `unsafe` code.
2.  **Component-Level Isolation:** If `unsafe` is absolutely necessary within a component, encapsulate it within that component's logic. Avoid exposing `unsafe` details to other parts of the application.
3.  **`NodeRef` Usage:** When direct DOM access is needed, use `NodeRef` correctly. Ensure that you're only accessing the referenced element *after* it has been rendered (typically within a `use_effect` hook with appropriate dependencies). Avoid holding onto `NodeRef` instances longer than necessary.
4.  **Review `unsafe` in Yew Callbacks:** Pay close attention to any `unsafe` code used within Yew event handlers or callbacks. These are often points where interaction with JavaScript occurs, increasing the risk.
5. **Testing Yew Components with `unsafe`:** Write specific unit tests for Yew components that contain `unsafe` blocks, focusing on the interaction points and potential memory safety issues. Use Yew's testing utilities to simulate user interactions and verify the component's behavior.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Memory Corruption within Yew Components (Severity: High):** `unsafe` code within a Yew component can introduce memory safety issues, potentially leading to crashes or exploitable conditions within the component's context.
*   **Undefined Behavior within Components (Severity: Medium):** Incorrect use of `unsafe` can lead to undefined behavior, causing unpredictable component behavior.

**Impact:**
*   **Memory Corruption:** Significantly reduces the risk by limiting and carefully managing `unsafe` code within components.
*   **Undefined Behavior:** Reduces the likelihood of undefined behavior by promoting safe practices within Yew's framework.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Yew's component model is used extensively, minimizing direct DOM manipulation.
*   `NodeRef` is used for accessing specific DOM elements.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Some older components still use direct `web-sys` calls and `unsafe` blocks for DOM manipulation. These need to be refactored to use Yew's higher-level APIs.
*   No specific unit tests focus solely on the `unsafe` parts of Yew components.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Careful Handling of JavaScript Interop (within Yew's Context)](./mitigation_strategies/careful_handling_of_javascript_interop__within_yew's_context_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Yew's Event Handlers:** When using Yew's event handlers (e.g., `onclick`, `oninput`), validate and sanitize any data received from the event *within the Rust callback*. Don't assume the event data is safe.
2.  **`Scope::callback` and `Scope::callback_once`:** When creating callbacks to pass to JavaScript (e.g., for interacting with third-party libraries), ensure that the data passed to the callback is properly validated and sanitized *before* it's used within the Yew component's logic.
3.  **`web-sys` and `js-sys` Usage:** If you *must* use `web-sys` and `js-sys` directly within a Yew component, treat any data received from JavaScript as untrusted. Implement strict validation and sanitization.
4.  **Type Safety with `wasm-bindgen`:** Leverage `wasm-bindgen`'s type-checking capabilities to ensure that the data passed between Rust and JavaScript is of the expected type. Define clear interfaces for your JavaScript interop functions.
5. **Avoid `gloo`'s `eval`:** The `gloo` crate, often used with Yew, has an `eval` function. Avoid using this function with any untrusted input.
6. **Component Boundaries:** Treat component boundaries as trust boundaries. If a component receives data from JavaScript, validate it thoroughly before passing it to child components or using it to update the component's state.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Yew Event Handlers (Severity: High):** Improperly handled event data can be a vector for XSS.
*   **Data Corruption within Components (Severity: Medium):** Passing invalid data from JavaScript to Rust can lead to unexpected component behavior.

**Impact:**
*   **XSS:** Significantly reduces the risk of XSS by enforcing validation and sanitization within Yew's event handling system.
*   **Data Corruption:** Reduces the risk of data corruption by promoting type safety and validation.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   `wasm-bindgen` is used for defining JavaScript interop functions.
*   Yew's event handlers are used for most user interactions.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Some custom event handlers (using `web-sys` directly) lack proper input validation.
*   No consistent pattern for validating data received from JavaScript callbacks created using `Scope::callback`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Yew Component State Management](./mitigation_strategies/secure_yew_component_state_management.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Avoid Direct `web-sys` State Manipulation:** Do not directly manipulate the DOM outside of Yew's component lifecycle and rendering system. This can lead to inconsistencies between Yew's virtual DOM and the actual DOM, potentially creating vulnerabilities.
2.  **Yew's State Management:** Use Yew's built-in state management mechanisms (hooks like `use_state`, `use_reducer`, `use_context`) or a dedicated state management library (like `yewdux`) to manage your component's state. Avoid storing state directly in global variables or using ad-hoc methods.
3.  **Input Validation for State Updates:** When updating a component's state based on user input (e.g., from a form), validate the input *before* updating the state. This prevents attackers from injecting malicious data into the component's state.
4.  **Controlled Components:** Use controlled components for form inputs. This means that the component's state is the single source of truth for the input's value, and Yew's event handlers are used to update the state.
5. **Sanitize State Before Rendering:** If component state is used to render HTML content (e.g., displaying user-provided text), ensure that the content is properly sanitized or escaped *before* it's rendered. Yew's virtual DOM generally handles this, but be cautious if you're using any custom rendering logic.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Component State (Severity: High):** If unsanitized user input is stored in component state and then rendered without proper escaping, it can lead to XSS.
*   **State-Based Logic Errors (Severity: Medium):** Inconsistent or improperly managed state can lead to unexpected component behavior and potential vulnerabilities.

**Impact:**
*   **XSS:** Significantly reduces the risk of XSS by promoting input validation and safe rendering practices within Yew's component model.
*   **State-Based Logic Errors:** Reduces the risk of logic errors by encouraging structured state management.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   `use_state` and `use_reducer` are used for managing component state.
*   Controlled components are used for most form inputs.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Some components directly update their state without proper input validation.
*   No comprehensive review of how state is used in rendering to ensure proper escaping.
