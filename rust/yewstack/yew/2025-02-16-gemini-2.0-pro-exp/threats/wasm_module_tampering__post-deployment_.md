# Deep Analysis: Wasm Module Tampering (Post-Deployment) for Yew Applications

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the "Wasm Module Tampering (Post-Deployment)" threat, understand its implications specifically within the context of a Yew application, and evaluate the effectiveness of proposed mitigation strategies.  We aim to provide actionable recommendations for developers to secure their Yew applications against this critical vulnerability.  The analysis will go beyond the surface level and delve into the technical details of how the threat manifests and how mitigations work.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the scenario where an attacker has gained unauthorized access to the web server *after* the Yew application has been deployed and is able to modify the compiled `.wasm` file.  We are *not* considering attacks during the development or build process (those are separate threats).  The scope includes:

*   The Yew application's compiled `.wasm` module.
*   The HTML file that loads the `.wasm` module (specifically the `<script>` tag).
*   Relevant HTTP headers (CSP, SRI).
*   Server-side file integrity monitoring systems.
*   Secure deployment practices related to preventing unauthorized file modification.

We will *not* cover:

*   Client-side attacks that do not involve modifying the `.wasm` file.
*   Vulnerabilities within the Rust code itself (e.g., memory safety issues) that could be exploited *after* successful tampering.  This analysis assumes the Rust code is well-written and free of such vulnerabilities *before* compilation.
*   Network-level attacks (e.g., Man-in-the-Middle attacks) â€“ those are separate threat vectors.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Threat Modeling Review:**  Reiterate the threat description and impact from the provided threat model, ensuring a clear understanding of the attack vector.
2.  **Technical Deep Dive:**  Explain the technical mechanisms of how Wasm module tampering works, including how the browser executes Wasm and the implications of malicious code injection.
3.  **Mitigation Analysis:**  Evaluate each proposed mitigation strategy in detail:
    *   **Subresource Integrity (SRI):**  Explain how SRI works, how to generate SRI hashes, and potential limitations.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Explain how CSP can be used to restrict Wasm loading and execution, provide example CSP directives, and discuss potential bypasses.
    *   **Server-Side File Integrity Monitoring:**  Discuss different approaches to server-side monitoring, including tools and techniques.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

### 2.1 Threat Modeling Review (Recap)

**Threat:** Wasm Module Tampering (Post-Deployment)

**Description:** An attacker with write access to the web server modifies the `.wasm` file of a deployed Yew application, injecting malicious code.  This code is then executed by the user's browser, leading to various harmful consequences.

**Impact:** Data breaches, compromised accounts, malware distribution, reputational damage, loss of trust.

**Affected Component:** The compiled `.wasm` module.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

### 2.2 Technical Deep Dive: Wasm Execution and Tampering

WebAssembly (Wasm) is a binary instruction format designed for efficient execution in web browsers.  Yew compiles Rust code into a `.wasm` file, which is then loaded and executed by the browser's JavaScript engine.  This execution happens within a sandboxed environment, but this sandbox is primarily designed to protect the *host system* (the user's computer), not necessarily to prevent the Wasm module from interacting with the web page in malicious ways if it has been tampered with.

Here's how the tampering works:

1.  **Attacker Access:** The attacker gains write access to the web server, typically through vulnerabilities in the server software, compromised credentials, or other security breaches.
2.  **Modification:** The attacker modifies the `.wasm` file.  They can use tools to disassemble the Wasm, inject their malicious code (which could be written in any language that compiles to Wasm), and then reassemble it.  The injected code could:
    *   **Steal Data:**  Access and exfiltrate data entered into forms, cookies, local storage, or session storage.
    *   **Redirect Users:**  Redirect the user to a phishing site that mimics the legitimate application.
    *   **Bypass Client-Side Validation:**  Disable or modify client-side validation logic, allowing the attacker to submit invalid data to the server.
    *   **Modify DOM:**  Alter the content of the web page, displaying false information or injecting malicious scripts.
    *   **Keylogging:** Capture user keystrokes.
    *   **Cryptojacking:** Use the user's CPU to mine cryptocurrency.
3.  **Browser Execution:** When a user visits the website, the browser downloads the modified `.wasm` file.  Without SRI or other protections, the browser has *no way* of knowing that the file has been tampered with.  It executes the malicious code as if it were part of the legitimate application.

The critical point is that the browser trusts the `.wasm` file it receives from the server.  This trust is exploited by the attacker.

### 2.3 Mitigation Analysis

#### 2.3.1 Subresource Integrity (SRI)

**How it Works:**

SRI is the *primary* defense against Wasm module tampering.  It works by embedding a cryptographic hash of the `.wasm` file directly into the HTML `<script>` tag that loads the file.  The browser then:

1.  Downloads the `.wasm` file.
2.  Calculates the hash of the downloaded file.
3.  Compares the calculated hash to the hash provided in the `integrity` attribute of the `<script>` tag.
4.  If the hashes match, the browser executes the Wasm code.  If they *don't* match, the browser *refuses* to execute the code and throws an error.

**Generating SRI Hashes:**

You can generate SRI hashes using command-line tools like `openssl` or `shasum`.  The recommended hash algorithm is SHA-384 (although SHA-256 and SHA-512 are also supported).

Example (using `openssl`):

```bash
openssl dgst -sha384 -binary dist/my_yew_app.wasm | openssl base64 -A
```

This command:

1.  `openssl dgst -sha384 -binary dist/my_yew_app.wasm`: Calculates the SHA-384 hash of the `my_yew_app.wasm` file (assuming it's in the `dist` directory) in binary format.
2.  `| openssl base64 -A`: Pipes the binary output to `openssl base64 -A`, which encodes the hash in Base64 format (required for the `integrity` attribute).

The output will be a string like: `sha384-+/M6srwAAQ...`.  You then include this in your HTML:

```html
<script src="dist/my_yew_app.js"></script>
<script
    src="dist/my_yew_app.wasm"
    integrity="sha384-+/M6srwAAQ..."
    crossorigin="anonymous"
></script>
```

**Important Considerations:**

*   **`crossorigin="anonymous"`:**  This attribute is *required* for SRI to work with Wasm.  It tells the browser to fetch the Wasm file without sending any credentials (cookies, etc.), which is necessary for security reasons.
*   **Automation:**  The hash generation and inclusion in the HTML should be automated as part of your build process.  There are tools and libraries (e.g., Webpack plugins) that can do this automatically.
*   **Limitations:** SRI protects against *modification* of the file, but it doesn't protect against *replacement* with an entirely different file (as long as the attacker also updates the `integrity` attribute).  This is where CSP comes in.

#### 2.3.2 Content Security Policy (CSP)

**How it Works:**

CSP is a security mechanism that allows you to control the resources the browser is allowed to load and execute.  It's implemented via an HTTP response header (`Content-Security-Policy`).  For Wasm, CSP can be used to:

*   **Restrict Wasm Source:**  Specify the origins from which Wasm files can be loaded.  Ideally, this should be limited to your own domain (`'self'`).
*   **Restrict Wasm Execution:**  Control whether Wasm can be executed at all, and potentially restrict the capabilities of the Wasm code (although this is less common).

**Example CSP Directives:**

```http
Content-Security-Policy:
    script-src 'self' 'wasm-unsafe-eval';
    object-src 'none';
```

Explanation:

*   `script-src 'self' 'wasm-unsafe-eval';`:
    *   `'self'`:  Allows scripts (including the JavaScript that loads the Wasm) to be loaded from the same origin as the document.
    *   `'wasm-unsafe-eval'`:  This is *required* to allow Wasm to be loaded and executed.  Without this, the browser will block Wasm execution.  The name is somewhat misleading; it doesn't inherently make Wasm *unsafe*, but it does allow Wasm to use certain features that *could* be used maliciously (like dynamic code generation).  It's a necessary evil for most Yew applications.
*  `object-src 'none';`: Prevents loading of plugins via `<object>`, `<embed>`, or `<applet>` tags. This is a general security best practice.

**Defense-in-Depth:**

CSP provides defense-in-depth.  Even if an attacker manages to replace the `.wasm` file *and* update the SRI hash (which would require compromising your build process or server in a more significant way), CSP can still prevent the malicious Wasm from being loaded if it's hosted on a different origin.

**Potential Bypasses:**

CSP is a complex mechanism, and there have been bypasses discovered in the past.  However, a well-configured CSP is still a valuable layer of defense.  It's crucial to:

*   **Use a Strict CSP:**  Avoid using overly permissive directives like `'unsafe-inline'` or wildcard origins (`*`).
*   **Test Thoroughly:**  Use browser developer tools and online CSP validators to ensure your CSP is working as intended.
*   **Stay Updated:**  Keep your browser and server software up-to-date to benefit from the latest CSP features and security fixes.

#### 2.3.3 Server-Side File Integrity Monitoring

**How it Works:**

Server-side file integrity monitoring (FIM) involves continuously monitoring critical files (like your `.wasm` file) for unauthorized changes.  This can be done using:

*   **Dedicated FIM Tools:**  There are commercial and open-source FIM tools available (e.g., OSSEC, Tripwire, Samhain).  These tools typically work by:
    *   Creating a baseline of file hashes.
    *   Periodically checking the current file hashes against the baseline.
    *   Generating alerts if any discrepancies are found.
*   **Custom Scripts:**  You can write custom scripts (e.g., in Bash, Python) to periodically calculate and compare file hashes.
*   **System Auditing Tools:**  Operating systems often have built-in auditing capabilities that can be used to monitor file changes.

**Benefits:**

*   **Early Detection:**  FIM can detect unauthorized changes quickly, allowing you to respond before significant damage is done.
*   **Alerting and Automation:**  FIM tools can be configured to send alerts (e.g., via email, Slack) and trigger automated responses (e.g., restoring the file from a backup).

**Limitations:**

*   **Performance Overhead:**  Continuous monitoring can introduce some performance overhead, especially on high-traffic servers.
*   **False Positives:**  Legitimate file updates (e.g., during deployments) can trigger false positives.  You need to carefully configure the FIM system to exclude expected changes.
*   **Doesn't Prevent Modification:** FIM *detects* changes, but it doesn't *prevent* them.  It's a reactive measure, not a proactive one.

#### 2.3.4 Secure Deployment Practices

**How it Works:**

Secure deployment practices aim to minimize the risk of unauthorized access to your server and prevent attackers from modifying files during the deployment process.  Key practices include:

*   **CI/CD Pipelines:**  Use a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate the build, testing, and deployment process.  This reduces the risk of manual errors and ensures consistency.
*   **Strong Access Controls:**  Implement the principle of least privilege.  Only grant necessary permissions to users and services involved in the deployment process.  Use strong passwords and multi-factor authentication.
*   **Auditing:**  Enable detailed logging and auditing of all deployment activities.  This allows you to track who made changes and when.
*   **Immutable Infrastructure:**  Consider using immutable infrastructure, where servers are never modified after deployment.  Instead, new servers are created with the updated application code.
*   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of your server infrastructure and deployment processes.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the web server process itself runs with the *minimum* necessary privileges. It should *not* have write access to the directory containing the `.wasm` file *except* during the deployment process itself. This is crucial. If the web server process is compromised (e.g., through a different vulnerability), the attacker will not be able to modify the `.wasm` file if the process doesn't have write permissions.

### 2.4 Residual Risk Assessment

Even with all the mitigations in place, some residual risk remains:

*   **Zero-Day Exploits:**  There's always a possibility of undiscovered vulnerabilities in the browser, server software, or FIM tools that could be exploited to bypass the mitigations.
*   **Compromised Build Process:**  If an attacker compromises your build process (e.g., your CI/CD pipeline), they could inject malicious code *before* the SRI hash is generated.
*   **Sophisticated Attacks:**  Highly skilled attackers might find ways to circumvent the mitigations, especially if they have a deep understanding of the system.
* **Social Engineering:** If attacker can trick stuff to change .wasm file, or change SRI hash.

### 2.5 Recommendations

1.  **Implement SRI:**  This is the *most important* mitigation.  Make SRI hash generation and inclusion an integral part of your build process.
2.  **Use a Strict CSP:**  Configure a CSP that restricts Wasm loading to your own domain (`'self'`) and uses `'wasm-unsafe-eval'`.
3.  **Implement Server-Side FIM:**  Use a FIM tool or custom scripts to monitor the `.wasm` file for unauthorized changes.
4.  **Secure Your Deployment Pipeline:**  Use a CI/CD pipeline with strong access controls, auditing, and the principle of least privilege.  Ensure the web server process has minimal write permissions.
5.  **Regularly Update:**  Keep your server software, browser, and FIM tools up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.
6.  **Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of your entire system.
7.  **Educate Developers:**  Ensure your development team understands the risks of Wasm module tampering and the importance of the mitigation strategies.
8.  **Consider Immutable Infrastructure:** If feasible, explore using immutable infrastructure to further reduce the attack surface.

By implementing these recommendations, you can significantly reduce the risk of Wasm module tampering and protect your Yew application and its users. Remember that security is a continuous process, and you should regularly review and update your security measures.
