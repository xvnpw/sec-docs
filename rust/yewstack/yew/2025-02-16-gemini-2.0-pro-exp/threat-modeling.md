# Threat Model Analysis for yewstack/yew

## Threat: [Wasm Module Tampering (Post-Deployment)](./threats/wasm_module_tampering__post-deployment_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the web server hosting the Yew application and modifies the compiled `.wasm` file. They could inject malicious code to steal user data, redirect users to phishing sites, bypass client-side validation, or perform other harmful actions. The attacker leverages the fact that the browser executes the Wasm code, and this is *directly* related to Yew because Yew compiles to Wasm.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data breaches (user credentials, personal information).
        *   Compromised user accounts.
        *   Malware distribution.
        *   Reputational damage.
        *   Loss of user trust.
    *   **Affected Yew Component:** The entire compiled `.wasm` module. This is the core of the Yew application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Subresource Integrity (SRI):**  Use SRI tags in the HTML `<script>` tag that loads the Wasm.  Generate a cryptographic hash of the `.wasm` file and include it in the `integrity` attribute.  The browser will verify the hash before executing the code. This is the *primary* defense.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Use a strict CSP to restrict the sources from which Wasm can be loaded (e.g., `script-src 'self' https://cdn.example.com;`).  Also, restrict the actions the Wasm can perform (e.g., `connect-src 'self' https://api.example.com;`). This provides defense-in-depth.
        *   **Server-Side File Integrity Monitoring:** Implement server-side monitoring to detect unauthorized changes to the `.wasm` file. This can trigger alerts and automated responses.
        *   **Secure Deployment Practices:**  Use secure deployment pipelines (e.g., CI/CD) with strong access controls and auditing to prevent unauthorized modifications during the deployment process.

## Threat: [Component State Manipulation (via External JS)](./threats/component_state_manipulation__via_external_js_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manages to inject malicious JavaScript code into the page (e.g., through a separate XSS vulnerability or a compromised third-party library). This injected code then attempts to interact with and modify the internal state of Yew components directly, bypassing Yew's intended state management mechanisms.  While the *entry point* is a general web vulnerability (XSS), the *target* and the potential impact are specific to how Yew manages state. This is less likely than direct DOM manipulation in a non-framework application, but the attacker could potentially disrupt Yew's virtual DOM diffing or alter component behavior in unexpected ways.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unpredictable application behavior.
        *   Data corruption.
        *   Bypass of security checks.
        *   Potential for further exploitation.
    *   **Affected Yew Component:**  Any `Component` implementation, specifically its internal state. The attacker would likely target the `Scope` or the underlying data structures used to manage the component's state. This is Yew-specific because it targets Yew's component model.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Prevent JavaScript Injection:**  The *primary* mitigation is to prevent JavaScript injection vulnerabilities (XSS) in the first place. This is a general web security best practice, but it's crucial here.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Use a strict CSP to limit the execution of inline scripts and restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded.
        *   **Robust State Management:** Use a robust state management solution (e.g., Redux, Yew's context API, or a custom solution) that provides additional layers of protection against unauthorized state changes.  Consider using immutable data structures.
        *   **Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent malicious data from being stored in the component state.
