# Attack Surface Analysis for yewstack/yew

## Attack Surface: [Unsafe HTML Rendering (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS)](./attack_surfaces/unsafe_html_rendering__cross-site_scripting_-_xss_.md)

*   **Description:** Rendering user-supplied or untrusted data directly as HTML without proper sanitization or escaping, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts.
    *   **How Yew Contributes:** Yew provides mechanisms for dynamically rendering content. The direct use of these mechanisms (e.g., embedding strings in HTML templates or `dangerously_set_inner_html`) without sanitization introduces this vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Stealing user session cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, defacing the website, performing actions on behalf of the user.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Always sanitize user input before rendering it as HTML using appropriate escaping techniques.
            *   Avoid `dangerously_set_inner_html` unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution after thorough sanitization.
            *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers.

## Attack Surface: [Event Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/event_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in how Yew handles user-initiated events.
    *   **How Yew Contributes:** Yew's event system connects user interactions to Rust code. If event handlers process user input without proper validation, vulnerabilities can be introduced that directly impact the application's behavior within the Yew framework.
    *   **Impact:** Executing arbitrary code (if combined with other vulnerabilities), triggering unintended application behavior.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user input received through event handlers before using it in any further processing.
            *   Be cautious when using dynamically generated event handlers based on user input.

## Attack Surface: [Third-Party Crate Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/third-party_crate_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities present in the external Rust crates (libraries) used by the Yew application.
    *   **How Yew Contributes:** Yew applications rely on the Rust ecosystem and its crates. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies directly impact the security of the Yew application's runtime environment.
    *   **Impact:** Can range from denial of service and data breaches to remote code execution, depending on the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Can be Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Regularly audit and update dependencies to their latest secure versions.
            *   Use tools like `cargo audit` to identify known vulnerabilities.
            *   Carefully evaluate the security of third-party crates before inclusion.
