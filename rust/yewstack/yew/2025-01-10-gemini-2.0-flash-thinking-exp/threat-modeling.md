# Threat Model Analysis for yewstack/yew

## Threat: [Unsafe JavaScript Interop](./threats/unsafe_javascript_interop.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in JavaScript code that Yew components interact with through `wasm_bindgen`. This might involve crafting malicious input that, when passed to JavaScript functions, triggers unintended behavior or allows execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the browser context.

**Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), where the attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser, potentially stealing cookies, session tokens, or redirecting the user to malicious sites. It could also lead to data breaches if sensitive information is exposed through the JavaScript bridge.

**Affected Yew Component:**  `wasm_bindgen` crate, any Yew `Component` that uses `wasm_bindgen` to interact with JavaScript functions. Specifically, functions marked with `#[wasm_bindgen]` that are called from Rust code or JavaScript functions called from Rust.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly sanitize and validate all data received from JavaScript before using it in Rust code.
*   Treat all data received from JavaScript as untrusted.
*   Use secure coding practices in the JavaScript code that Yew interacts with.
*   Regularly audit and update JavaScript dependencies.
*   Consider using safer alternatives to direct JavaScript calls if possible.

## Threat: [Insecure State Management Patterns](./threats/insecure_state_management_patterns.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in how application state is managed, especially if using global state management solutions within a Yew application. This might involve finding ways to directly manipulate the state outside of intended mechanisms, potentially bypassing security checks or corrupting data.

**Impact:**  Data breaches, data corruption, circumvention of application logic, or privilege escalation if state management controls access to sensitive features.

**Affected Yew Component:**  Global state management solutions used with Yew (e.g., Context API, external state management libraries integrated with Yew).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Follow secure state management principles, ensuring that state updates are controlled and validated.
*   Avoid exposing the entire application state directly.
*   Implement access control mechanisms for state updates if necessary.
*   Thoroughly audit and test state management logic.
