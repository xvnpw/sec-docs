## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Yew's Virtual DOM Handling](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_yew's_virtual_dom_handling.md)

*   Attack Vector: Inject Malicious HTML/SVG through Component Rendering [CRITICAL]
    *   Goal: Execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser (XSS).
    *   How: A Yew component renders user-controlled data or server-provided data without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML or SVG containing `<script>` tags or event handlers (e.g., `onload`, `onerror`). When the browser renders this injected content, the malicious JavaScript executes.
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: High
    *   Effort: Low to Medium
    *   Skill Level: Low to Medium
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Yew's JavaScript Interoperability (wasm-bindgen)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_yew's_javascript_interoperability__wasm-bindgen_.md)

*   Attack Vector: Inject Malicious JavaScript through `JsValue` [CRITICAL]
    *   Goal: Execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser (XSS).
    *   How: A Yew component receives data from JavaScript via `JsValue`. If this data is then used to manipulate the DOM or perform other actions without proper sanitization within the Rust/WASM code, it can lead to XSS vulnerabilities. The attacker injects malicious JavaScript through the JavaScript side, which is then passed to the Yew application and unsafely rendered.
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: High
    *   Effort: Low to Medium
    *   Skill Level: Low to Medium
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium

*   Attack Vector: Abuse `wasm-bindgen` Function Calls for Privilege Escalation [CRITICAL]
    *   Goal: Execute privileged JavaScript functions or access sensitive browser APIs.
    *   How: The Yew application exposes JavaScript functions via `wasm-bindgen`. If these functions perform privileged actions (e.g., accessing local storage, making cross-origin requests with specific credentials) without proper authorization checks within the Rust/WASM code, an attacker can find ways to call these functions and gain unauthorized access to sensitive browser features or data.
    *   Likelihood: Low to Medium
    *   Impact: Medium to High
    *   Effort: Medium
    *   Skill Level: Medium
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Yew's Routing Mechanism](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_yew's_routing_mechanism.md)

*   Attack Vector: Manipulate Router State to Access Unauthorized Pages
    *   Goal: Bypass authorization checks and access restricted parts of the application.
    *   How: The application's routing logic relies solely on client-side checks, or the router state can be manipulated by the user. Attackers can directly manipulate the URL, browser history, or other client-side mechanisms to navigate to routes that should be protected by authorization. If the server doesn't enforce authorization, the attacker gains access.
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: Medium to High
    *   Effort: Low
    *   Skill Level: Low
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
