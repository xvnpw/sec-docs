## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Client-Side Rendering Vulnerabilities -> Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Yew Rendering](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_client-side_rendering_vulnerabilities_-_cross-site_scripting__xss__via_yew_rendering.md)

*   **Critical Node: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Yew Rendering**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious scripts that are rendered by Yew and executed in the user's browser.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium-High
    *   **Impact:** Significant-Critical
    *   **Effort:** Low-Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner-Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Implement proper escaping/sanitization of user inputs in Yew components using `html!` macro's escaping features or dedicated sanitization libraries.
        *   Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) to limit script execution sources.
        *   Regularly audit and update third-party Yew components.

    *   **Critical Node: Unescaped User Input in Yew Components**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Failing to properly escape or sanitize user-provided data before rendering it in Yew components, leading to XSS.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium-High
        *   **Impact:** Significant-Critical
        *   **Effort:** Low-Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Beginner-Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Always use Yew's `html!` macro for rendering user input, which provides automatic escaping.
            *   If raw HTML rendering is absolutely necessary, sanitize input using a trusted sanitization library *before* rendering.
            *   Avoid `dangerously_set_inner_html` unless with extreme caution and proper sanitization.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities -> Outdated Yew Version or Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities_-_outdated_yew_version_or_dependencies.md)

*   **Critical Node: Outdated Yew Version or Dependencies**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities present in outdated versions of the Yew framework or its Rust crate dependencies.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Overall, considering both Yew and crate dependencies)
    *   **Impact:** Significant-Critical (Depends on the specific vulnerability)
    *   **Effort:** Low-Medium (If public exploits exist for known vulnerabilities)
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner-Intermediate (If public exploits exist)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy-Medium (Vulnerability scanners can detect known dependency vulnerabilities)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Critical Node: Using Vulnerable Yew Version**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Running an outdated version of the Yew framework with known security vulnerabilities.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low-Medium (Depends on how outdated the Yew version is)
            *   **Impact:** Significant-Critical (Depends on the specific Yew vulnerability)
            *   **Effort:** Low-Medium (If exploits are publicly available)
            *   **Skill Level:** Beginner-Intermediate (If exploits are publicly available)
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy-Medium (Vulnerability scanners can detect outdated Yew versions)
            *   **Mitigation:**
                *   Regularly update the Yew framework to the latest stable version.
                *   Subscribe to Yew security advisories and release notes.

        *   **Critical Node: Using Vulnerable Rust Crates (Dependencies)**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Using vulnerable Rust crates (dependencies) in the Yew application.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Rust crate vulnerabilities are regularly discovered)
            *   **Impact:** Significant (Depends on the vulnerable crate and the specific vulnerability)
            *   **Effort:** Low-Medium (If exploits are publicly available)
            *   **Skill Level:** Beginner-Intermediate (If exploits are publicly available)
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy-Medium (Tools like `cargo audit` can detect known crate vulnerabilities)
            *   **Mitigation:**
                *   Regularly audit and update Rust crate dependencies using `cargo audit`.
                *   Monitor security advisories for Rust crates used in the application.
                *   Implement a dependency management strategy for timely updates.
