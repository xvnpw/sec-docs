# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Enable developers to build high-performance, client-side web applications using Rust and WebAssembly.
  - Provide a component-based framework that promotes code reusability and maintainability.
  - Offer a modern and efficient alternative to JavaScript frameworks for web development.
  - Foster a strong community and ecosystem around Rust-based web development.
  - Facilitate the creation of web applications that can run across different platforms due to WebAssembly's portability.

- Business Risks:
  - Adoption risk: Developers may be hesitant to adopt a new framework, especially one based on Rust, which has a steeper learning curve compared to JavaScript.
  - Ecosystem maturity risk: The Rust WebAssembly ecosystem, while growing, might not be as mature as the JavaScript ecosystem in terms of available libraries and tooling.
  - Security risks inherent in web applications: Web applications built with Yew are still susceptible to common web security vulnerabilities like XSS, CSRF, and others if not developed securely.
  - Performance risks: While WebAssembly is generally performant, inefficient Rust or Yew code can still lead to performance issues in the browser.
  - Dependency risk: Reliance on Rust toolchain, WebAssembly standards, and browser compatibility.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Rust's memory safety features inherently reduce vulnerabilities like buffer overflows and dangling pointers. Implemented in: Rust compiler and language design.
  - security control: WebAssembly's sandboxed environment in the browser limits the access of Yew applications to system resources. Implemented in: Web browsers and WebAssembly runtime.
  - security control: Standard web security practices are applicable to Yew applications, such as HTTPS for communication security and Content Security Policy (CSP) for mitigating XSS. Implemented in: Web server configuration and application code.
  - security control: Open source nature of the project allows for community review and identification of potential vulnerabilities. Implemented in: GitHub repository and community contributions.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on third-party Rust crates (libraries) introduces supply chain risks. Accepted risk is mitigated by community review and crate ecosystem practices.
  - accepted risk: Security vulnerabilities in the Rust compiler or WebAssembly runtime could impact Yew applications. Accepted risk is managed by the Rust and WebAssembly communities' security efforts.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline for Yew applications to detect potential vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle.
  - security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of Yew applications, especially before major releases or when handling sensitive data.
  - security control: Provide security guidelines and best practices for Yew developers to build secure applications, including input validation, output encoding, and secure state management.
  - security control: Establish a process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities in Yew framework and related crates.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: Yew applications that require user authentication should integrate with standard web authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, session-based authentication).
    - Requirement: Securely store and manage user credentials or tokens if authentication is handled within the Yew application.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Implement role-based or attribute-based access control to manage user permissions and access to different parts of the application.
    - Requirement: Enforce the principle of least privilege, granting users only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Validate all user inputs on the client-side (Yew application) and server-side (if applicable) to prevent injection attacks (e.g., XSS, SQL injection if backend is involved).
    - Requirement: Sanitize user inputs before displaying them in the UI to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Use HTTPS for all communication between the browser and the server to protect data in transit.
    - Requirement: Employ appropriate cryptographic techniques for storing sensitive data at rest, if applicable (e.g., encryption of local storage or IndexedDB data).
    - Requirement: When using cryptography in Yew applications, leverage well-vetted and secure Rust crates for cryptographic operations.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - For Yew framework itself: Ensuring the integrity and availability of the framework for developers. Maintaining the open-source community and project health.
  - For applications built with Yew: The critical business processes depend on the specific application. Generally, these include providing intended functionality to users, maintaining data integrity and confidentiality, and ensuring application availability.

- Data Sensitivity:
  - For Yew framework itself: Primarily code and project metadata, which is publicly available on GitHub. Sensitivity is low in terms of confidentiality, but integrity and availability are important for the developer community.
  - For applications built with Yew: Data sensitivity depends entirely on the application. It can range from publicly accessible data to highly sensitive personal or financial information. The sensitivity level needs to be assessed for each specific Yew application.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What type of applications are being built with Yew? (e.g., public websites, internal dashboards, e-commerce platforms). This would help to refine the security requirements and risk assessment.
  - What is the intended deployment environment for Yew applications? (e.g., static hosting, server-side rendering, specific cloud providers). This impacts deployment security considerations.
  - Are there any specific compliance requirements for applications built with Yew (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS)? This would dictate additional security controls.
  - What is the organization's risk appetite regarding open-source software and supply chain security? This influences the level of scrutiny applied to dependencies and build processes.

- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to provide a secure and reliable framework for building web applications. Adoption and community growth are important business drivers.
  - SECURITY POSTURE: Standard web security best practices are applicable to Yew applications. Security is a concern, but performance and developer experience are also high priorities. Open-source security principles are followed.
  - DESIGN: Yew applications are primarily client-side rendered and deployed as static files. The build process involves standard Rust and WebAssembly toolchains. CI/CD practices are assumed for automated builds and deployments.
