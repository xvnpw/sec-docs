# Threat Model Analysis for yewstack/yew

## Threat: [Yew Framework Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/yew_framework_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker discovers and exploits a security vulnerability within the Yew framework itself. This could be a bug in component rendering, virtual DOM handling, event system, or any other part of the framework's core logic. Exploitation could lead to XSS, application crashes, or other unexpected behaviors.
*   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), application crashes, denial of service, potential for data manipulation or information disclosure depending on the vulnerability.
*   **Affected Yew Component:** Yew Framework Core (various modules like `yew::html`, `yew::virtual_dom`, `yew::events`)
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Yew framework updated to the latest stable version.
    *   Monitor Yew project's security advisories and release notes for vulnerability announcements and patches.
    *   Contribute to the Yew community by reporting potential security issues and participating in security discussions.

## Threat: [Client-Side XSS via Yew Rendering Bugs](./threats/client-side_xss_via_yew_rendering_bugs.md)

*   **Description:**  A vulnerability in Yew's rendering logic allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the application's output. This could occur if Yew fails to properly sanitize user-provided data or if there are flaws in how Yew handles certain HTML or SVG structures.
*   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), allowing attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser, steal cookies, hijack sessions, deface the application, or redirect users to malicious websites.
*   **Affected Yew Component:** `yew::html` macro, Virtual DOM rendering engine
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Follow secure coding practices when using Yew, especially when rendering user-provided data.
    *   Utilize Yew's built-in mechanisms for escaping and sanitizing user inputs within HTML templates.
    *   Regularly review and test Yew components for potential XSS vulnerabilities, especially when handling dynamic content.

## Threat: [Unsafe Rust Interop Vulnerabilities](./threats/unsafe_rust_interop_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Developers use `unsafe` Rust blocks to interact with JavaScript or browser APIs from Yew. Errors in `unsafe` code, such as memory safety violations or incorrect assumptions about JavaScript API behavior, can introduce vulnerabilities. An attacker might exploit these vulnerabilities to cause crashes, memory corruption, or potentially gain control over the application's execution. While the *use* of unsafe is by the developer, the *context* is within a Yew application and related to Yew's interop needs.
*   **Impact:** Memory corruption, application crashes, denial of service, potential for arbitrary code execution if `unsafe` code leads to exploitable conditions.
*   **Affected Yew Component:** Interop layer (specifically `wasm_bindgen` and `js_sys` crates, and developer-written `unsafe` code within Yew components)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Minimize the use of `unsafe` code in Yew applications.
    *   Thoroughly audit and test all `unsafe` blocks for memory safety and correctness.
    *   Use safe Rust abstractions and libraries for interop whenever possible to reduce reliance on `unsafe`.
    *   Employ memory safety tools and techniques during development and testing to detect potential issues in `unsafe` code.
