# BUSINESS POSTURE

The Nushell project aims to provide a modern, structured shell that is easier to use and more powerful than traditional shells like bash or zsh. It focuses on handling data as structured information, enabling users to manipulate and transform data effectively through a pipeline.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Enhance user productivity by providing a more intuitive and efficient command-line experience.
- Improve data manipulation capabilities in the shell environment.
- Offer a cross-platform shell that works consistently across different operating systems.
- Foster a strong community around Nushell and encourage contributions.
- Provide a robust and reliable shell for daily use.

Business Risks:
- Data breaches due to vulnerabilities in Nushell that could be exploited to access sensitive information.
- System compromise if malicious code is injected into Nushell or its dependencies.
- Reputational damage if Nushell is perceived as insecure or unreliable.
- Loss of user trust if security incidents occur.
- Slow adoption if security concerns are not adequately addressed.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Code review process for contributions, implemented through GitHub pull requests.
- security control: Open source nature allows for community scrutiny and vulnerability discovery, described in project's public repository.
- security control: Use of Rust programming language, which provides memory safety and reduces the risk of certain types of vulnerabilities, inherent to Rust language design.

Accepted Risks:
- accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities to be introduced by community contributions, mitigated by code review but not entirely eliminated.
- accepted risk: Reliance on external dependencies, which may have their own vulnerabilities, mitigated by dependency management but not fully controlled.
- accepted risk: Security vulnerabilities might be discovered after release, requiring patching and updates.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code.
- security control: Implement automated Dependency Scanning to detect known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
- security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to proactively identify and address security weaknesses.
- security control: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure and response process to handle security issues effectively.
- security control: Provide security training for core developers and contributors to promote secure coding practices.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication: Not directly applicable to Nushell itself as a shell. Authentication is handled by the underlying operating system. However, if Nushell interacts with external services or resources that require authentication, it should support secure authentication mechanisms provided by those services.
- Authorization: Nushell must respect and enforce the operating system's authorization mechanisms, such as file system permissions. When interacting with external systems, Nushell should adhere to the authorization policies of those systems.
- Input Validation: Nushell needs robust input validation to prevent command injection and other input-related vulnerabilities. This applies to shell commands, script arguments, and data processed from external sources.
- Cryptography: If Nushell handles sensitive data or communicates over networks, it should utilize appropriate cryptographic measures to protect confidentiality and integrity. This might include secure storage of credentials, encrypted network communication, and secure handling of cryptographic keys if needed for plugins or extensions.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- User's daily command-line workflows and scripting tasks.
- Data manipulation and processing performed using Nushell.
- Automation scripts and workflows built with Nushell.

Data Sensitivity:
- User data processed by Nushell can vary in sensitivity. It can include:
    - File system paths and contents (potentially sensitive documents, configuration files).
    - Command history (may contain sensitive commands and arguments).
    - Environment variables (could include credentials or API keys).
    - Data processed through pipelines (can be any type of data, including sensitive information).
- Sensitivity level depends heavily on the user's context and the data they are working with. In general, Nushell should be considered as potentially handling sensitive data.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What is the intended user base for Nushell? (General users, developers, specific industries?)
- Are there any specific compliance requirements that Nushell needs to meet? (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS - unlikely for a shell, but good to consider for context).
- Are there any plans for enterprise adoption or commercialization of Nushell?
- What is the process for handling security vulnerabilities reported by the community?
- Are there any specific security features planned for future releases?

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE: Nushell is primarily focused on providing a better user experience and improving productivity for command-line users. Security is important for user trust and adoption, but not necessarily the primary driver in the early stages.
- SECURITY POSTURE: Current security controls are basic open-source best practices (code review, community scrutiny). There is room for improvement in automated security testing and vulnerability management. Security is a growing concern as the project matures.
- DESIGN: Nushell is designed as a standalone application for local user deployment. The architecture is modular with a core engine, parser, plugin system, and standard library. The build process is automated using GitHub Actions.
