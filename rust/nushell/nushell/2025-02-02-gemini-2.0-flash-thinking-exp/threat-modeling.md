# Threat Model Analysis for nushell/nushell

## Threat: [Command Injection via Nushell](./threats/command_injection_via_nushell.md)

*   **Threat:** Command Injection via Nushell
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious commands into Nushell command strings constructed by the application. This is done by manipulating user-controlled input that is not properly sanitized before being used in Nushell commands. The attacker can execute arbitrary system commands with the privileges of the Nushell process.
    *   **Impact:**  **Critical**. Full system compromise, data breach, data manipulation, denial of service, and unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
    *   **Nushell Component Affected:** `extern` commands, `run_external`, string interpolation, command substitution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Input Sanitization and Validation:  Strictly validate and sanitize all user inputs before incorporating them into Nushell commands. Use allow-lists for acceptable characters and input formats.
        *   Parameterization (with caution): Explore Nushell's parameterization features, but understand their limitations and ensure they are used securely.
        *   Principle of Least Privilege: Run Nushell processes with minimal necessary privileges.
        *   Command Whitelisting: Restrict the set of allowed Nushell commands to a predefined whitelist.
        *   Code Review: Conduct thorough code reviews of all code paths that construct and execute Nushell commands.
        *   Avoid Dynamic Command Construction: Minimize or eliminate the dynamic construction of Nushell commands based on user input if possible.

## Threat: [Arbitrary Code Execution via Nushell Scripts](./threats/arbitrary_code_execution_via_nushell_scripts.md)

*   **Threat:** Arbitrary Code Execution via Nushell Scripts
    *   **Description:** An attacker uploads or provides a malicious Nushell script that the application executes. The attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the Nushell process.
    *   **Impact:** **Critical**. Full system compromise, data breach, data manipulation, denial of service, and unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
    *   **Nushell Component Affected:** `source`, `module` loading, script execution engine.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid User-Provided Script Execution:  Ideally, prevent users from uploading or providing arbitrary Nushell scripts for execution.
        *   Sandboxing and Isolation: If script execution is necessary, implement robust sandboxing using containers or virtual machines to limit script access.
        *   Script Analysis and Validation (Limited Effectiveness): Attempt static analysis of scripts, but recognize its limitations in preventing sophisticated attacks.
        *   Limited Script Functionality: Restrict available Nushell commands and modules within user-provided scripts. Disable dangerous commands.
        *   Code Review (Script Generation Logic): If scripts are dynamically generated, rigorously review the generation logic for vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Path Traversal and File System Access](./threats/path_traversal_and_file_system_access.md)

*   **Threat:** Path Traversal and File System Access
    *   **Description:** An attacker manipulates user-controlled input to specify file paths in Nushell commands like `open`, `save`, or `ls`. By using path traversal techniques (e.g., `../`), the attacker can access or manipulate files outside the intended application directory.
    *   **Impact:** **High**. Unauthorized access to sensitive files, data leakage, data manipulation, and potentially code execution if writable paths are accessed.
    *   **Nushell Component Affected:** `open`, `save`, `ls`, file system commands, path resolution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Path Sanitization and Validation:  Strictly validate and sanitize all user-provided file paths. Use allow-lists for allowed directories and file extensions.
        *   Canonicalization: Canonicalize paths to resolve symbolic links and relative paths before using them in Nushell commands.
        *   Chroot or Jails: Run Nushell processes within a chroot jail to restrict file system access.
        *   Principle of Least Privilege (File System Permissions): Grant minimal file system permissions to the Nushell process.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Nushell Resource Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_nushell_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) via Nushell Resource Exhaustion
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious Nushell commands or scripts that consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O), leading to a denial of service for legitimate users.
    *   **Impact:** **High**. Application unavailability, service disruption, and potential infrastructure instability.
    *   **Nushell Component Affected:** Script execution engine, `extern` commands, plugins, resource management.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Resource Limits: Implement resource limits (CPU time, memory, execution time) for Nushell processes using OS mechanisms or containerization.
        *   Rate Limiting: Rate limit the execution of Nushell commands or scripts, especially those triggered by user input.
        *   Input Validation and Complexity Limits: Validate user inputs to prevent overly complex or resource-intensive commands or scripts.
        *   Plugin Security Review: Carefully review the resource usage and security of Nushell plugins.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Nushell and Plugins](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_nushell_and_plugins.md)

*   **Threat:** Dependency Vulnerabilities in Nushell and Plugins
    *   **Description:** Nushell or its plugins may have vulnerabilities in their dependencies. An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities indirectly through the application's use of Nushell.
    *   **Impact:** **High**.  Impact depends on the specific vulnerability. Could range from information disclosure to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Nushell Component Affected:** Nushell core, plugin system, dependency management.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Dependency Scanning and Management: Regularly scan Nushell and its plugins for known vulnerabilities in dependencies using security scanning tools.
        *   Keep Nushell and Plugins Updated:  Maintain Nushell and plugins at the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Vulnerability Monitoring: Monitor security advisories for Nushell and its dependencies.
        *   Plugin Source Review:  Carefully evaluate the source and trustworthiness of plugins before use. Prefer reputable and actively maintained plugins.
