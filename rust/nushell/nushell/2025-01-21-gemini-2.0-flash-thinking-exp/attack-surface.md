# Attack Surface Analysis for nushell/nushell

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via Nushell Scripting](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_nushell_scripting.md)

- **Description:** Attackers inject malicious commands into Nushell scripts executed by the application, gaining control over the application's execution environment or the underlying system.
- **How Nushell contributes:** Nushell's scripting capabilities and ability to execute external commands (`^`) make it a powerful tool that, if misused with unsanitized user input, can lead to command injection.
- **Example:** An application uses user input to construct a Nushell `where` clause for filtering data. A malicious user inputs `; rm -rf /` which, if not properly escaped, could be executed by Nushell, deleting files on the server.
- **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, data breach, system compromise, denial of service.
- **Risk Severity:** **Critical** to **High**
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Input Sanitization and Validation:**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user inputs before incorporating them into Nushell commands. Use allow-lists and escape special characters relevant to Nushell syntax.
    - **Parameterization:** Utilize Nushell's parameterization features to separate user input from command structure, preventing direct injection.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run Nushell processes with minimal necessary privileges to limit the damage from successful injection.

## Attack Surface: [Arbitrary Code Execution through Nushell Scripts](./attack_surfaces/arbitrary_code_execution_through_nushell_scripts.md)

- **Description:** Attackers provide entire malicious Nushell scripts that the application executes, allowing them to run arbitrary code within the application's context.
- **How Nushell contributes:** Nushell is designed to execute scripts. If the application allows users to upload or provide scripts, it inherently exposes itself to the risk of executing malicious code contained within those scripts.
- **Example:** An application allows users to upload Nushell scripts for custom data processing. A malicious user uploads a script that uses `http get` to exfiltrate sensitive data from the application's server to an external attacker-controlled server.
- **Impact:** Full application compromise, data breach, system takeover, malicious operations within the application's environment.
- **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Avoid User-Provided Scripts:**  The most secure approach is to avoid allowing users to provide arbitrary Nushell scripts.
    - **Script Sandboxing and Isolation:** If scriptability is essential, implement strong sandboxing and isolation mechanisms (e.g., containers, VMs) to restrict script capabilities and resource access.
    - **Script Review and Static Analysis:** If user scripts are permitted, implement a mandatory review process and use static analysis tools to detect potentially malicious code patterns before execution.

## Attack Surface: [Unsafe Nushell Built-in Commands and Modules Misuse](./attack_surfaces/unsafe_nushell_built-in_commands_and_modules_misuse.md)

- **Description:** Attackers exploit the functionality of Nushell's built-in commands or modules (especially those interacting with the OS, file system, or network) to perform unauthorized actions.
- **How Nushell contributes:** Nushell's rich set of built-in commands, while powerful, includes commands that can be misused if not carefully controlled within the application's context.
- **Example:** An application uses Nushell to process files based on user input. If the application uses `open` and `save` commands with user-controlled file paths without proper validation, an attacker could potentially read or overwrite arbitrary files on the server.
- **Impact:** Unauthorized file access, data modification, system manipulation, denial of service.
- **Risk Severity:** **High**
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Restrict Command Usage:** Limit the set of Nushell commands available within the application's context. Disable or restrict access to potentially dangerous commands like `exec`, `rm`, `cp`, `http`, `open`, `save` if they are not strictly required.
    - **Careful Command Argument Handling:**  When using Nushell commands programmatically, meticulously validate and sanitize arguments, especially those derived from user input, to prevent unintended actions.

## Attack Surface: [Data Injection through Nushell Data Structures and Parsing (Parser Vulnerabilities)](./attack_surfaces/data_injection_through_nushell_data_structures_and_parsing__parser_vulnerabilities_.md)

- **Description:** Attackers inject malicious data into formats parsed by Nushell (CSV, JSON, TOML, etc.) to exploit vulnerabilities in Nushell's parsing logic, potentially leading to code execution or denial of service.
- **How Nushell contributes:** Nushell's ability to parse various data formats makes it a potential entry point for data injection attacks if parsing logic has vulnerabilities.
- **Example:** An application uses Nushell to parse user-uploaded CSV files. A malicious user uploads a CSV file with excessively long fields or deeply nested structures that triggers a buffer overflow vulnerability in Nushell's CSV parser, leading to denial of service or potentially code execution.
- **Impact:** Denial of service, unexpected application behavior, potential code execution, data corruption.
- **Risk Severity:** **High**
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Data Format Validation and Schema Enforcement:** Strictly validate the format and schema of user-provided data before processing it with Nushell. Enforce expected data types, lengths, and structures.
    - **Input Sanitization for Data Formats:** Sanitize user input intended for parsing by Nushell to remove or escape potentially malicious characters or structures specific to the data format.
    - **Resource Limits for Parsing:** Implement resource limits (e.g., memory, processing time) for Nushell parsing operations to prevent denial-of-service attacks caused by maliciously crafted data.
    - **Regular Nushell Updates:** Keep Nushell updated to benefit from security patches that may address parser vulnerabilities.
