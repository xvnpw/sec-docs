# Threat Model Analysis for nushell/nushell

## Threat: [Command Injection](./threats/command_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious Nushell commands by manipulating user-controlled input that is used to construct shell commands. This is possible due to Nushell's nature as a shell and its powerful command execution capabilities. Insufficient input sanitization or lack of parameterization when building Nushell commands dynamically allows attackers to execute arbitrary system commands on the server.
**Impact:**  Full system compromise, data breach, denial of service, malware installation, unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
**Affected Nushell Component:** `extern` commands, string interpolation, script execution, custom modules that execute shell commands, Nushell parser interpreting malicious input.
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Input Sanitization:**  Strictly validate and sanitize all user inputs before using them in Nushell commands. Use allow-lists and escape special characters relevant to Nushell syntax.
*   **Parameterization:**  Avoid dynamic command construction. Pass user data as arguments to pre-defined Nushell scripts or functions instead of building commands on the fly.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run Nushell processes with minimal necessary privileges.
*   **Sandboxing:**  Execute Nushell in a sandboxed environment (containers, VMs) to limit the impact of successful command injection.
*   **Code Review:** Regularly review code that constructs and executes Nushell commands for potential injection vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Shell Escape/Breakout](./threats/shell_escapebreakout.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits features or vulnerabilities within Nushell itself to escape the intended execution context. This allows them to execute commands outside the application's intended scope, potentially gaining access to the underlying operating system or other parts of the server. This could be achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in Nushell's core functionalities, parser, or through misconfigurations in the application's Nushell usage that expose unintended Nushell features.
**Impact:**  Unauthorized access to the server, data exfiltration, system modification, privilege escalation, further exploitation of the infrastructure.
**Affected Nushell Component:** Core Nushell functionalities, `cd`, `sudo` (if enabled/accessible), `exec`, `os`, `sys`, custom modules that provide access to system functionalities, vulnerabilities in Nushell's parser or execution engine, Nushell's permission model.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Restrict Nushell Capabilities:** Disable or restrict access to potentially dangerous Nushell commands and functionalities (e.g., `cd`, `sudo`, `exec`, file system access) if they are not essential for the application. Consider using Nushell's configuration options to limit available commands.
*   **Secure Script Execution Environment:**  If executing user-provided or dynamic Nushell scripts, run them in a secure, isolated environment with limited permissions and resource quotas.
*   **Regular Nushell Updates:** Keep Nushell updated to the latest version to patch known security vulnerabilities within Nushell itself.
*   **Code Review and Security Audits:** Thoroughly review application code and conduct security audits to identify potential shell escape vulnerabilities related to Nushell integration and configuration.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Nushell relies on external dependencies. Attackers can exploit known vulnerabilities *within Nushell's own dependencies* to compromise the application. This is a direct threat stemming from Nushell's software composition. Exploiting these vulnerabilities targets the Nushell application through its reliance on external code.
**Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, depending on the nature of the vulnerability in the dependency, directly impacting the Nushell application's security.
**Affected Nushell Component:**  External dependencies used by Nushell (e.g., crates in Rust ecosystem), Nushell's build process, Nushell's dependency management, Nushell's reliance on vulnerable libraries.
**Risk Severity:** Medium to High (depending on the vulnerability, but can be High if RCE is possible) - *Considering this can lead to RCE via Nushell, we will classify as High for this filtered list.*
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Dependency Management:** Maintain a clear inventory of Nushell's dependencies and their versions.
*   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan Nushell and its dependencies for known vulnerabilities using vulnerability scanning tools and dependency checkers. Focus on scanning Nushell's direct and transitive dependencies.
*   **Patching and Updates:** Promptly apply security patches and updates for Nushell and its dependencies. Subscribe to security advisories related to Nushell's ecosystem and Rust crates.
*   **Supply Chain Security:** Use trusted sources for Nushell and its dependencies. Verify checksums and signatures when downloading Nushell binaries or dependencies. Consider using dependency pinning to manage and control dependency versions.
