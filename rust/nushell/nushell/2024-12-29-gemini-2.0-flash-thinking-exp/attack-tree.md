## Threat Model: Compromising Application via Nushell Exploitation - High-Risk Sub-Tree

**Attacker's Goal:** To execute arbitrary code within the application's environment by exploiting vulnerabilities or weaknesses in the way the application uses Nushell.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

Compromise Application via Nushell **[CRITICAL NODE]**
* [HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Command Injection Vulnerabilities **[CRITICAL NODE]**
    * [HIGH-RISK PATH] Direct Injection via User Input **[CRITICAL NODE]**
        * [HIGH-RISK PATH] Insufficient Input Sanitization
            * ***Execute Malicious Nushell Commands*** **[CRITICAL NODE]**
        * [HIGH-RISK PATH] Bypass Input Filters
            * ***Execute Malicious Nushell Commands*** **[CRITICAL NODE]**
    * [HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploiting Nushell Features for Injection
        * [HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploiting `eval` or Similar Commands
            * ***Inject and Execute Arbitrary Code*** **[CRITICAL NODE]**

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**1. Compromise Application via Nushell [CRITICAL NODE]:**

* This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents a successful breach of the application's security through vulnerabilities related to its use of Nushell.

**2. Exploit Command Injection Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:**

* This represents a broad category of attacks where the attacker aims to inject and execute arbitrary commands within the Nushell environment running within the application. This is a high-risk area due to the potential for complete system compromise.

**3. Direct Injection via User Input [CRITICAL NODE]:**

* This attack vector occurs when the application takes user-provided input and directly incorporates it into Nushell commands without proper sanitization or validation. This is a common and often easily exploitable vulnerability.

**4. Insufficient Input Sanitization [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**

* This specific attack step within the "Direct Injection" path highlights the failure of the application to adequately remove or escape characters that have special meaning in Nushell. This allows attackers to inject malicious commands directly.
    * **Attack Vector:** An attacker provides input containing malicious Nushell commands (e.g., using semicolons to separate commands, pipes to chain commands, or redirection operators) that are then executed by Nushell.
    * **Example:**  A user input field might be vulnerable to an input like `; rm -rf /`.

**5. Execute Malicious Nushell Commands [CRITICAL NODE]:**

* This node signifies the successful execution of attacker-controlled commands within the Nushell environment. This is a critical point as it allows the attacker to perform various malicious actions, such as reading sensitive files, modifying data, or even gaining control of the underlying system.

**6. Bypass Input Filters [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**

* Even if some input filtering is in place, attackers may attempt to circumvent these filters to inject malicious commands.
    * **Attack Vector:** Attackers use techniques like encoding (e.g., URL encoding, base64), obfuscation, or exploiting weaknesses in the filter's logic to bypass the intended security measures.
    * **Example:** An attacker might use URL encoding for special characters or find a specific character sequence that the filter doesn't block but Nushell interprets as a command separator.

**7. Exploiting Nushell Features for Injection [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**

* This category of attacks leverages specific features of Nushell itself to achieve command injection.

**8. Exploiting `eval` or Similar Commands [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**

* If the application uses Nushell's `eval` command (or similar mechanisms for dynamic code execution) with untrusted data, it creates a direct and significant vulnerability.
    * **Attack Vector:** An attacker can inject arbitrary Nushell code into the data that is then passed to the `eval` command, causing it to be executed.
    * **Example:** If the application constructs a Nushell command like `eval $"ls {user_input}"` and `user_input` is attacker-controlled, they can inject malicious code within the curly braces.

**9. Inject and Execute Arbitrary Code [CRITICAL NODE]:**

* This node represents the successful exploitation of `eval` or similar commands, resulting in the execution of arbitrary code within the Nushell environment. This has the same critical impact as directly executing malicious commands.
