### High and Critical Nushell Threats

Here are the high and critical threats that directly involve Nushell:

*   **Threat:** Arbitrary Code Execution via Script Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious Nushell code into input fields or data streams that are subsequently executed by the application's Nushell interpreter. This could involve crafting input that, when processed by Nushell, executes unintended commands.
    *   **Impact:** Complete control over the application's execution environment, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service. The attacker could read sensitive files, modify data, or execute arbitrary system commands.
    *   **Affected Component:** Nushell interpreter, specifically the parsing and execution engine for Nushell scripts.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid directly incorporating user-provided input into Nushell scripts.
        *   If user input must be used, implement strict input validation and sanitization to remove or escape potentially malicious code.
        *   Consider using parameterized queries or pre-defined Nushell scripts with controlled input parameters.

*   **Threat:** Command Injection via `extern` or other commands
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts input that, when used in conjunction with Nushell's `extern` command or other commands that execute external programs, results in the execution of arbitrary system commands. This bypasses the application's intended functionality.
    *   **Impact:**  Similar to arbitrary code execution, this can lead to system compromise, data breaches, or denial of service by allowing the attacker to execute commands with the privileges of the Nushell process.
    *   **Affected Component:** Nushell's `extern` command, and potentially other commands that interact with the operating system (e.g., `sys`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid constructing `extern` commands or other system command executions directly from user input.
        *   Maintain a strict whitelist of allowed external commands and validate user input against this whitelist.
        *   If possible, use safer alternatives to `extern` or limit its capabilities through configuration or sandboxing.
        *   Apply the principle of least privilege to the Nushell process, limiting its access to system resources.

*   **Threat:** Data Exfiltration through Nushell Output
    *   **Description:** An attacker manipulates the application or Nushell scripts to output sensitive data that can be intercepted or accessed. This could involve redirecting output to a file or network location controlled by the attacker.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information, such as user credentials, API keys, internal data, or application secrets.
    *   **Affected Component:** Nushell's output mechanisms (e.g., `print`, file redirection), and potentially commands that interact with network resources (e.g., if custom commands are involved).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize Nushell's output before displaying it to users or logging it.
        *   Restrict Nushell's ability to write to arbitrary files or network locations.
        *   Implement secure logging practices and ensure logs containing sensitive information are protected.
        *   Monitor Nushell's output for suspicious activity.

*   **Threat:** Compromised Nushell Binaries or Packages
    *   **Description:** The Nushell binaries or packages used by the application could be compromised, containing malicious code.
    *   **Impact:**  If the Nushell executable itself is compromised, attackers could gain complete control over the application's execution environment.
    *   **Affected Component:** The Nushell executable and associated libraries.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Obtain Nushell from trusted sources and verify the integrity of the downloaded files (e.g., using checksums).
        *   Implement security measures to protect the application's deployment environment from tampering.
