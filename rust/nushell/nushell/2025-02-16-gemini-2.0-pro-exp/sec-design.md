Okay, let's create a design document for the Nushell project, focusing on aspects relevant for threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Nushell is a new type of shell, aiming to provide a modern, powerful, and cross-platform shell experience.  It's open-source and community-driven.  Given its nature as a shell, it directly interacts with the operating system and user data, making security paramount.

Priorities:

*   Provide a user-friendly and productive shell experience.
*   Ensure cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux).
*   Maintain a robust and extensible plugin system.
*   Offer a secure environment for executing commands and scripts.
*   Foster a welcoming and active open-source community.

Goals:

*   Become a viable alternative to traditional shells (bash, zsh, PowerShell).
*   Attract a large user base and developer community.
*   Provide a secure and reliable platform for system administration and scripting.

Business Risks:

*   _Malicious Code Execution_: As a shell, Nushell executes user-provided commands.  A vulnerability could allow malicious code to be executed with the user's privileges, potentially leading to system compromise.
*   _Data Leakage_:  Nushell handles sensitive data (environment variables, command history, file contents).  A vulnerability could expose this data to unauthorized access.
*   _Denial of Service_:  A bug or vulnerability could cause Nushell to crash or become unresponsive, disrupting the user's workflow.
*   _Plugin Vulnerabilities_:  The plugin system, while powerful, introduces a risk of vulnerabilities in third-party plugins.  A malicious or poorly written plugin could compromise the security of Nushell.
*   _Supply Chain Attacks_: Compromise of the build or distribution process could lead to the insertion of malicious code into Nushell releases.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls (based on the GitHub repository and general knowledge of secure coding practices):

*   _security control_: Code Reviews: The project uses pull requests on GitHub, implying code reviews are part of the development process. (Described in GitHub repository's contribution guidelines).
*   _security control_: Static Analysis (Likely): Given the use of Rust, it's highly probable that tools like Clippy (linter) and Cargo's built-in checks are used to identify potential bugs and security issues. (Implicit in the use of Rust and Cargo).
*   _security control_: Memory Safety (Rust): The use of Rust as the primary programming language provides inherent memory safety guarantees, mitigating common vulnerabilities like buffer overflows and use-after-free errors. (Fundamental to the Rust language).
*   _security control_: Dependency Management (Cargo): Rust's package manager, Cargo, helps manage dependencies and track versions, reducing the risk of using outdated or vulnerable libraries. (Implicit in the use of Rust and Cargo).
*   _security control_: Testing: The repository contains tests, indicating an effort to ensure code correctness and prevent regressions. (Visible in the GitHub repository's test suite).
*   _security control_: Fuzzing (Possible): While not explicitly mentioned, the nature of the project (handling user input) makes fuzzing a likely and recommended practice.

Accepted Risks:

*   _accepted risk_: User Error: Nushell, like any shell, relies on the user to exercise caution when executing commands.  It cannot prevent users from running malicious commands they obtain from untrusted sources.
*   _accepted risk_: Plugin Responsibility: While Nushell aims to provide a secure plugin API, the ultimate responsibility for the security of a plugin lies with its developer.  Nushell can provide sandboxing and permission control mechanisms, but cannot guarantee the absence of vulnerabilities in third-party plugins.
*   _accepted risk_: Operating System Vulnerabilities: Nushell relies on the underlying operating system for many of its functions.  Vulnerabilities in the OS kernel or system libraries could impact Nushell's security.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   _security control_: Explicit Sandboxing for Plugins: Implement a robust sandboxing mechanism for plugins, limiting their access to system resources and data.  This could involve using technologies like WebAssembly or OS-level sandboxing features.
*   _security control_: Input Validation and Sanitization:  Rigorously validate and sanitize all user input, including command arguments, environment variables, and data read from files.
*   _security control_: Security Audits: Conduct regular security audits, both internal and external, to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
*   _security control_: Fuzzing: Implement continuous fuzzing to test Nushell's input handling and identify potential crashes or vulnerabilities.
*   _security control_: Supply Chain Security Measures: Implement measures to secure the build and distribution process, such as code signing, software bill of materials (SBOM), and vulnerability scanning of dependencies.
*   _security control_: Content Security Policy (CSP) or Similar: If Nushell incorporates any web-based components (e.g., for documentation or a plugin marketplace), implement CSP to mitigate XSS vulnerabilities.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Nushell itself does not handle user authentication; this is managed by the operating system.
    *   Plugins that require authentication should use secure methods and avoid storing credentials insecurely.

*   Authorization:
    *   Nushell should respect the operating system's user permissions and access controls.
    *   The plugin system should implement a permission model to restrict plugin access to specific resources and capabilities.

*   Input Validation:
    *   All user input should be validated and sanitized to prevent command injection and other injection vulnerabilities.
    *   Regular expressions used for parsing should be carefully reviewed to avoid ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) vulnerabilities.

*   Cryptography:
    *   If Nushell handles sensitive data (e.g., encryption keys, passwords), it should use strong, well-vetted cryptographic libraries and algorithms.
    *   Cryptographic keys should be stored securely, leveraging OS-provided key management mechanisms where possible.

```
Security Controls in the Build Process:

*   _security control_: Automated Build: GitHub Actions automates the build process, ensuring consistency and reducing the risk of manual errors.
*   _security control_: Dependency Management: Cargo manages dependencies, ensuring that specific versions are used and tracked.
*   _security control_: Static Analysis: Clippy (likely used) performs static analysis to identify potential bugs and security issues.
*   _security control_: Testing: Cargo Test runs the test suite, ensuring code correctness and preventing regressions.
*   _security control_: (Recommended) Software Bill of Materials (SBOM): Generate an SBOM during the build process to track all dependencies and their versions.
*   _security control_: (Recommended) Code Signing: Digitally sign the build artifacts to ensure their integrity and authenticity.
*   _security control_: (Recommended) Vulnerability Scanning: Scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities during the build process.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   _Command Execution_: The core function of Nushell is to execute user commands.  Compromise of this process could lead to arbitrary code execution with the user's privileges.
*   _Plugin Management_: The ability to extend Nushell with plugins is a key feature.  Vulnerabilities in the plugin system could allow malicious plugins to compromise the shell.
*   _Data Handling_: Nushell handles user data, including command history, environment variables, and file contents.  Data leakage or corruption could have significant consequences.

Data Sensitivity:

*   _Command History_: Contains a record of all commands executed by the user, which may include sensitive information (e.g., passwords entered accidentally). Sensitivity: **High**
*   _Environment Variables_: May contain API keys, passwords, and other sensitive configuration data. Sensitivity: **High**
*   _File Contents_: Nushell can read and write files, potentially accessing sensitive data stored on the user's system. Sensitivity: **Variable (depends on the files accessed)**
*   _Plugin Data_: Plugins may store their own data, which could include sensitive information depending on the plugin's functionality. Sensitivity: **Variable (depends on the plugin)**
*   _Configuration Files_: Nushell's configuration files may contain user preferences and customizations, which could be considered sensitive in some contexts. Sensitivity: **Low to Medium**

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS
