## Attack Tree Path: [1. Execute Arbitrary Code](./attack_tree_paths/1__execute_arbitrary_code.md)

*   **1.1 Inject Malicious Nushell Commands [HIGH RISK]**
    *   Description: The attacker crafts malicious input that, when processed by Nushell, executes unintended commands. This is the primary attack vector.
    *   Mitigation: Rigorous input sanitization, whitelisting, and the principle of least privilege.

    *   **1.1.1 Exploit Command Injection Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]**
        *   Description: This is the core vulnerability that enables command injection. It stems from insufficient validation of user-supplied input.
        *   Mitigation:  Implement strict input validation, preferably using a whitelist approach.  Reject any input that does not conform to the expected format.

        *   **1.1.1.1 Bypass Input Sanitization (if any) [CRITICAL]**
            *   Description: The attacker attempts to circumvent any existing input sanitization measures.
            *   Mitigation:  Ensure that input sanitization is robust and cannot be bypassed using techniques like character encoding, double encoding, or exploiting flaws in the sanitization logic.

            *   **1.1.1.1.1 Use Metacharacters (; | & > < ` $() ) [HIGH RISK]**
                *   Description: The attacker uses common shell metacharacters to inject additional commands.
                *   Mitigation:  Sanitize or escape these metacharacters effectively.  Whitelisting is preferred.

            *   **1.1.1.1.4 Leverage Nushell's Built-in Commands for Malicious Purposes [HIGH RISK]**
                *   Description: The attacker uses Nushell's built-in commands in unexpected or malicious ways.
                *   Mitigation:  Restrict the use of potentially dangerous commands (e.g., `run-external`, `open`, `save`) through configuration or by running Nushell with limited privileges.

                *   **1.1.1.1.4.1 `run-external` with malicious arguments [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]**
                    *   Description: The attacker uses the `run-external` command to execute arbitrary system commands.
                    *   Mitigation:  Disable `run-external` if possible. If it must be used, strictly validate and sanitize *all* arguments passed to it.  Consider using a whitelist of allowed external commands.

                *   **1.1.1.1.4.3 `save` with malicious file paths (e.g., create a webshell) [HIGH RISK]**
                    *   Description: The attacker uses the `save` command to write malicious content to a file, potentially creating a webshell or overwriting critical system files.
                    *   Mitigation:  Strictly control the file paths that can be used with `save`.  Run the application with limited file system write permissions.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exfiltrate Sensitive Data](./attack_tree_paths/2__exfiltrate_sensitive_data.md)

*   **2.1 Inject Nushell Commands to Read Sensitive Data [HIGH RISK]**
    *   Description: The attacker uses Nushell commands to access sensitive information.
    *   Mitigation:  Restrict file system access, avoid storing secrets in environment variables accessible to Nushell, and monitor for suspicious file access patterns.

    *   **2.1.1 Access Files Containing Sensitive Data [CRITICAL]**
        *   Description: The attacker attempts to read sensitive files using Nushell's file access capabilities.
        *   Mitigation:  Enforce strict file system permissions.  Ensure that the Nushell process runs with the least necessary privileges.

        *   **2.1.1.1 Use `open` with paths to sensitive files (e.g., /etc/passwd, config files) [HIGH RISK]**
            *   Description: The attacker uses the `open` command to read sensitive files.
            *   Mitigation:  Restrict the file paths that can be accessed with `open`.  Monitor file access logs for suspicious activity.

    *   **2.1.2 Access Environment Variables [CRITICAL]**
        *   Description: The attacker attempts to read sensitive environment variables.
        *   Mitigation:  Do not store secrets in environment variables that are accessible to the Nushell process. Use a secure secret management solution.

        *   **2.1.2.1 Use `$env` to read environment variables containing secrets [HIGH RISK]**
            *   Description: The attacker uses the `$env` variable to access environment variables.
            *   Mitigation:  Avoid storing sensitive information in environment variables.

*   **2.2 Transmit Data to Attacker-Controlled Location [HIGH RISK]**
    *   Description: The attacker uses Nushell commands to send exfiltrated data to a remote server.
    *   Mitigation:  Restrict network access for the Nushell process.  Monitor network traffic for suspicious connections.

    *   **2.2.1 Use `http post` to send data to an attacker-controlled server [HIGH RISK]**
        *   Description: The attacker uses the `http post` command to send data to a remote server.
        *   Mitigation:  Restrict the use of `http post` or limit the destinations it can connect to.  Monitor network traffic.

    *   **2.2.3 Use `run-external` to execute a command that sends data (e.g., `curl`, `netcat`) [HIGH RISK]**
        *   Description: The attacker uses `run-external` to execute commands like `curl` or `netcat` to exfiltrate data.
        *   Mitigation:  Disable `run-external` if possible. If it must be used, strictly control its arguments and monitor for suspicious external commands.
