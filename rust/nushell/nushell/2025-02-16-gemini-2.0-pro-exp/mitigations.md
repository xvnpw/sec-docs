## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Plugin Allowlist and Nushell Plugin API Usage Control](./mitigation_strategies/strict_plugin_allowlist_and_nushell_plugin_api_usage_control.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Strict Plugin Allowlist and Nushell Plugin API Usage Control

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Plugin Allowlist:** Maintain a configuration file (e.g., `plugins.toml`) that explicitly lists *approved* Nushell plugins. This list should include the plugin name, version, and ideally a cryptographic hash (e.g., SHA-256) of the plugin file.
    2.  **Strict Enforcement:** Modify the Nushell invocation or wrapper script to *absolutely prevent* loading any plugin *not* present in the allowlist.  This should be a hard block, not a warning.  This might involve pre-processing the Nushell environment or using a custom script to load Nushell with only the allowed plugins.
    3. **API Usage Restrictions (Future/Conceptual):** If Nushell ever offers a mechanism to restrict the capabilities of plugins (e.g., a permission system), use it to limit what plugins can do. For example, deny a plugin access to the network if it doesn't need it. This is a *future-proofing* step, dependent on Nushell's development.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Plugin Execution (Severity: Critical):** Prevents unauthorized plugins from running.
    *   **Compromised Plugin Execution (Severity: Critical):** Limits the damage from a compromised, but previously approved, plugin.
    *   **Unintentional Command Execution (Severity: High):** Reduces the risk of plugins accidentally executing harmful commands.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious/Compromised Plugin Execution:** Risk reduction: Very High.
    *   **Unintentional Command Execution:** Risk reduction: High.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Plugin Allowlist:** Partially implemented. A basic allowlist exists in `config/plugins.toml`, but it's not strictly enforced.
    *   **Strict Enforcement:** Not implemented.
    *   **API Usage Restrictions:** Not implemented (dependent on future Nushell features).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Strict Allowlist Enforcement:** The application's Nushell loading mechanism needs to be modified to *strictly* enforce the allowlist. This might involve a wrapper script or changes to how Nushell is invoked.
    *   **API Usage Restrictions:** Monitor Nushell development for any future features related to plugin permissions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Script Handling and Input Sanitization within Nushell](./mitigation_strategies/secure_script_handling_and_input_sanitization_within_nushell.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Script Handling and Input Sanitization within Nushell

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Trusted Script Sources:** Load Nushell scripts (`.nu` files) *only* from directories that are:
        *   Under the direct control of the development team.
        *   Protected with strict file system permissions (read-only for most users, write access only for authorized developers).
    2.  **No User-Supplied Scripts:**  *Never* execute Nushell scripts directly provided by users or loaded from untrusted sources.
    3.  **Input Sanitization (within Nushell, if unavoidable):** If user input *must* be incorporated into Nushell commands (highly discouraged), use Nushell's built-in string manipulation functions to sanitize the input *within the Nushell script itself*.
        *   **`str replace` (with caution):** Use `str replace` to remove or replace potentially dangerous characters.  This is *less secure* than allowlisting.
        *   **`parse` (with caution):** If the input is expected to have a specific structure, use `parse` to validate it.  However, be aware of potential parsing vulnerabilities.
        *   **Custom Validation Functions:** Write custom Nushell functions to perform more complex validation logic, focusing on allowlisting safe patterns.
        *   **Parameterization (Ideal, if supported by future Nushell):** If Nushell introduces a mechanism for parameterized commands (similar to prepared statements in SQL), use it to separate user input from the command structure. This is the *safest* approach.
    4. **Integrity Checks (using Nushell):** Within the Nushell script that loads other scripts, calculate the checksum (e.g., using a custom Nushell function or a future built-in command) of the loaded script and compare it to a known good value.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Script Execution (Severity: Critical):** Prevents execution of untrusted scripts.
    *   **Command Injection (Severity: Critical):** Mitigates injection attacks through user input.
    *   **Script Tampering (Severity: High):** Detects unauthorized modifications to scripts.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Script Execution:** Risk reduction: Very High.
    *   **Command Injection:** Risk reduction: High (with robust sanitization/parameterization), Moderate (with basic `str replace`).
    *   **Script Tampering:** Risk reduction: High.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Trusted Script Sources:** Partially implemented. Scripts are loaded from a designated directory, but access controls could be tighter.
    *   **No User-Supplied Scripts:** Implemented.
    *   **Input Sanitization (within Nushell):** Partially implemented. Some basic string replacement is used, but it's not comprehensive. Located within `src/input_handler.nu`.
    *   **Integrity Checks (using Nushell):** Not implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Stricter Access Controls (for script directory):** Improve file system permissions.
    *   **Comprehensive Input Sanitization:** Implement more robust sanitization using allowlisting, custom validation functions, or (ideally) parameterization if Nushell supports it in the future.
    *   **Nushell-Based Integrity Checks:** Write Nushell code to calculate and verify script checksums before execution.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Nushell Configuration and Environment Variable Handling](./mitigation_strategies/secure_nushell_configuration_and_environment_variable_handling.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Nushell Configuration and Environment Variable Handling

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Minimize `NU_` Environment Variables:** Carefully review all environment variables starting with `NU_` (Nushell-specific variables).  Only set those that are *absolutely required* for the application's functionality.  Unset any unnecessary `NU_` variables.
    2.  **Secure Configuration File Handling:**
        *   **Permissions:** Ensure Nushell configuration files (e.g., `config.nu`, `env.nu`) have strict file system permissions (read-only for most users, write access only for authorized developers).
        *   **No Secrets in Config Files:** *Never* store sensitive data (API keys, passwords) directly in Nushell configuration files.
    3.  **Safe Handling of Sensitive Data (within Nushell):**
        *   **Environment Variables (preferred):** Access sensitive data through environment variables (set securely outside of Nushell). Use Nushell's `$env` to access them.
        *   **Avoid `load-env` with Untrusted Files:** Do *not* use the `load-env` command with files from untrusted sources.
        *   **Secure Input Methods (Future/Conceptual):** If Nushell introduces secure input methods (e.g., prompting for passwords without echoing them to the console), use them.
    4. **Configuration Validation (within Nushell):** Write Nushell code to validate the configuration loaded from files or environment variables. Check for:
        *   **Expected Data Types:** Ensure values have the correct data types (e.g., strings, numbers, booleans).
        *   **Allowed Values:** Verify that values fall within expected ranges or belong to a set of allowed options.
        *   **Missing Values:** Check for required configuration values that are missing.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exposure of Sensitive Information (Severity: High):** Prevents leakage of secrets through misconfigured Nushell settings.
    *   **Configuration-Based Attacks (Severity: Variable):** Reduces the risk of attacks exploiting incorrect or malicious configuration.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** Risk reduction: High.
    *   **Configuration-Based Attacks:** Risk reduction: Moderate to High.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Minimize `NU_` Environment Variables:** Partially implemented. Some unnecessary `NU_` variables might still be set.
    *   **Secure Configuration File Handling:** Partially implemented. File permissions could be stricter.
    *   **No Secrets in Config Files:** Implemented.
    *   **Environment Variables (for secrets):** Partially implemented. Secrets are accessed via `$env`, but the environment variables themselves are not managed securely enough.
    *   **Safe Handling of Sensitive Data:** Partially implemented.
    *   **Configuration Validation (within Nushell):** Not implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Review and Unset Unnecessary `NU_` Variables:** Thoroughly examine and remove any unneeded `NU_` environment variables.
    *   **Stricter File Permissions:** Tighten file system permissions on Nushell configuration files.
    *   **Secure Environment Variable Management:** Use a more secure method for setting and managing environment variables (e.g., a secrets management tool).
    *   **Nushell-Based Configuration Validation:** Write Nushell code to validate the configuration at runtime.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limits and Timeouts *within* Nushell (Future/Conceptual)](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limits_and_timeouts_within_nushell__futureconceptual_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Resource Limits and Timeouts *within* Nushell (Future/Conceptual)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Built-in Resource Limits (Future):** If Nushell introduces built-in mechanisms for limiting resource consumption (CPU, memory, file descriptors) *within* a script or pipeline, use them. This would be preferable to relying solely on external OS-level controls.
    2.  **Built-in Timeouts (Future):** If Nushell provides a built-in `timeout` command or similar functionality to limit the execution time of commands or pipelines, use it to prevent long-running or infinite loops.
    3. **Custom Timeout Logic (using Nushell, if possible):** If built-in timeouts are not available, explore the possibility of implementing custom timeout logic *within* Nushell scripts using loops, timers (if available), and conditional checks. This is likely to be complex and less reliable than a built-in solution.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: High):** Prevents resource exhaustion attacks originating from within Nushell scripts.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Risk reduction: High (if built-in features are available), Moderate (with custom logic).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Built-in Resource Limits:** Not implemented (dependent on future Nushell features).
    *   **Built-in Timeouts:** Not implemented (dependent on future Nushell features).
    *   **Custom Timeout Logic:** Not implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Monitor Nushell Development:** Track the Nushell project for any new features related to resource limits and timeouts.
    *   **Explore Custom Timeout Logic (if necessary):** If built-in features are not available, investigate the feasibility of implementing custom timeout logic within Nushell scripts.
