# Attack Surface Analysis for nushell/nushell

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via Unsanitized Input](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_unsanitized_input.md)

**Description:** An attacker can inject arbitrary Nushell commands into the application if user-provided input is directly used to construct Nushell commands without proper sanitization.

**How Nushell Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Nushell's syntax allows for the execution of various commands, including system commands, making it a powerful tool for attackers if input is not controlled.

**Example:** An application takes a filename from user input and constructs a Nushell command like `nu -c "open '$filename' | to json"`. If the user inputs `file.txt; rm -rf /`, Nushell will execute both `open 'file.txt'` and `rm -rf /`.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, data breach, system compromise, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Parameterization:**  If possible, use Nushell features or application design patterns that allow passing data as parameters rather than embedding it directly into the command string.
*   **Input Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user-provided input before incorporating it into Nushell commands. Escape special characters that have meaning in Nushell syntax.
*   **Avoid Dynamic Command Construction:**  Minimize or eliminate the need to dynamically construct Nushell commands based on user input. Prefer predefined commands or safer alternatives.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run Nushell processes with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of a successful injection.

## Attack Surface: [Uncontrolled Execution of External Commands](./attack_surfaces/uncontrolled_execution_of_external_commands.md)

**Description:** Nushell allows execution of external system commands. If the application allows Nushell to execute commands based on user input or configuration without strict control, attackers can execute malicious binaries.

**How Nushell Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Nushell's core functionality includes the ability to shell out and execute external programs directly.

**Example:** An application allows users to specify a program to run via a configuration setting, which is then used in a Nushell command like `nu -c "run $configured_program"`. An attacker could change the configuration to execute a malicious script.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, system compromise, data exfiltration, malware installation.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Whitelisting:**  Maintain a strict whitelist of allowed external commands that Nushell can execute.
*   **Input Validation:**  If the external command or its arguments are based on user input, rigorously validate and sanitize them.
*   **Sandboxing:**  Consider running Nushell in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of executed external commands.
*   **Disable External Command Execution (If Possible):** If the application's functionality doesn't require executing external commands via Nushell, consider disabling this capability if Nushell allows it or restructuring the application.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion through Nushell Processes](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_through_nushell_processes.md)

**Description:**  An attacker can cause a denial of service by triggering the creation of numerous Nushell processes or by making existing processes consume excessive resources.

**How Nushell Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Nushell processes consume system resources. If the application spawns Nushell processes in response to user actions or external events without proper limits, it can be vulnerable to resource exhaustion attacks.

**Example:** An application launches a new Nushell process for each incoming user request. An attacker could flood the application with requests, leading to a large number of Nushell processes consuming all available CPU and memory.

**Impact:** Denial of service, application unavailability, system instability.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Resource Limits:** Implement limits on the number of concurrent Nushell processes that can be spawned.
*   **Timeouts:** Set timeouts for Nushell operations to prevent long-running processes from consuming resources indefinitely.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on user actions that trigger Nushell process creation.
*   **Process Monitoring:** Monitor the resource consumption of Nushell processes and implement alerts for unusual activity.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Nushell Data Structures](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_nushell_data_structures.md)

**Description:** If the application passes complex data structures (e.g., JSON, YAML) to Nushell without proper validation, vulnerabilities in Nushell's deserialization logic could be exploited.

**How Nushell Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Nushell's ability to parse various data formats (JSON, YAML, etc.) introduces potential vulnerabilities if the parsing logic has flaws.

**Example:** An application sends user-controlled JSON data to Nushell using the `from json` command. A vulnerability in Nushell's JSON parsing could allow an attacker to craft malicious JSON that leads to code execution or a crash.

**Impact:** Code execution, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Schema Validation:** Validate the structure and content of data being passed to Nushell using schemas or other validation techniques.
*   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize data before passing it to Nushell's deserialization commands.
*   **Keep Nushell Updated:** Ensure Nushell is updated to the latest version to patch known deserialization vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Manipulation of Nushell Environment Variables](./attack_surfaces/manipulation_of_nushell_environment_variables.md)

**Description:** If the application allows modification of environment variables accessible to Nushell, attackers might be able to influence Nushell's behavior or the behavior of external commands executed by Nushell.

**How Nushell Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Nushell inherits and uses environment variables, which can affect its behavior and the behavior of child processes.

**Example:** An application allows users to set environment variables that are then passed to Nushell. An attacker could set `PATH` to point to a directory containing malicious executables, which Nushell might then execute.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, altered application behavior.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Restrict Environment Variable Modification:**  Limit the ability to modify environment variables that are passed to Nushell.
*   **Sanitize Environment Variable Values:** If environment variables are set based on user input, sanitize their values to prevent malicious content.
*   **Use Secure Defaults:**  Ensure that default environment variables used by Nushell are secure.
