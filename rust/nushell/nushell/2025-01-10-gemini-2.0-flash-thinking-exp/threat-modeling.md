# Threat Model Analysis for nushell/nushell

## Threat: [Command Injection via Unsanitized Input](./threats/command_injection_via_unsanitized_input.md)

**Description:** An attacker can inject malicious commands that Nushell will execute if the application constructs Nushell commands by directly embedding unsanitized user input or data from untrusted sources. This exploits Nushell's command parsing and execution engine. For example, if a user-provided filename is directly inserted into an `ls` command without proper escaping, an attacker could inject commands like `; rm -rf /`.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the application's execution environment. The attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the Nushell process, potentially leading to data breaches, system takeover, or denial of service.

**Affected Nushell Component:** Command Execution Engine (specifically the parsing and execution of strings as commands).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Strict Input Sanitization:** Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user-provided input and external data before incorporating it into Nushell commands. Use allow-lists rather than block-lists for acceptable characters and patterns.
* **Parameterization (where possible):** Explore if the specific Nushell command or feature being used allows for safe parameter passing mechanisms to avoid direct string interpolation.
* **Command Whitelisting:** Restrict the set of allowed Nushell commands that the application can execute. Only permit necessary and well-understood commands.
* **Sandboxing:** Execute Nushell commands in a sandboxed environment with limited access to system resources and sensitive data.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the Nushell process with the minimum necessary privileges to reduce the impact of successful command injection.

## Threat: [File System Access Exploitation](./threats/file_system_access_exploitation.md)

**Description:** An attacker can manipulate file paths or operations if the application uses Nushell's file system commands (like `open`, `save`, `rm`) based on user-controlled input without proper validation. This allows for reading, writing, or deleting arbitrary files accessible to the Nushell process. For instance, if a user provides a filename for download, and the application uses Nushell's `open` command with that unsanitized filename, an attacker could provide paths like `../../../../etc/passwd`.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information, modification or deletion of critical files, potentially leading to data breaches, system instability, or denial of service.

**Affected Nushell Component:** File System Operations (commands like `open`, `save`, `rm`, `mv`, etc.).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Path Sanitization and Validation:** Strictly sanitize and validate all file paths provided by users or external sources. Ensure paths are within expected boundaries and do not contain relative path traversal sequences (e.g., `..`).
* **Restricted File Access:** Limit the directories and files that the Nushell process can access through operating system-level permissions or sandboxing.
* **Chroot Jails or Containers:** Utilize chroot jails or containerization technologies to isolate the Nushell environment and restrict its file system access.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the Nushell process runs with minimal file system permissions.

## Threat: [Potential for High/Critical Vulnerabilities in Nushell Itself](./threats/potential_for_highcritical_vulnerabilities_in_nushell_itself.md)

**Description:**  Like any software, Nushell might contain undiscovered vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. These vulnerabilities could reside in various parts of the Nushell codebase, potentially allowing for arbitrary code execution or other severe impacts.

**Impact:**  Depending on the nature of the vulnerability, the impact could range from information disclosure and denial of service to remote code execution with the privileges of the Nushell process.

**Affected Nushell Component:** Various components depending on the specific vulnerability (e.g., parsing engine, command execution, internal functions).

**Risk Severity:** High (potential to be Critical depending on the specific vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Keep Nushell Updated:** Regularly update Nushell to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
* **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about security advisories and vulnerability disclosures related to Nushell.
* **Consider Using Stable Releases:** Opt for stable releases of Nushell over development or nightly builds in production environments.
* **Vulnerability Scanning:** If possible, incorporate vulnerability scanning tools into the development and deployment pipeline to identify potential issues in Nushell and its dependencies.
