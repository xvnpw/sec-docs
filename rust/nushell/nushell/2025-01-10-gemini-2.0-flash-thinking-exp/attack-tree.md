## Attack Tree Path: [AND Execute Arbitrary Code through Nushell (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/and_execute_arbitrary_code_through_nushell__critical_node_.md)

**Description:** This is the ultimate goal for an attacker seeking to gain full control over the application via Nushell. Achieving arbitrary code execution allows the attacker to run any commands they choose on the server where the application is running.
*   **Impact:** Critical. Successful exploitation leads to complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying system. Attackers can steal data, modify data, disrupt operations, install malware, and pivot to other systems.
*   **Why it's Critical:** This node is critical because it's the gateway to the most severe consequences. Once an attacker achieves arbitrary code execution, the possibilities for malicious actions are virtually limitless. It also serves as a central point for various attack vectors.

## Attack Tree Path: [OR Command Injection (HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/or_command_injection__high-risk_path_start_.md)

**Description:** Command injection occurs when an attacker can influence the commands that Nushell executes. This is a particularly dangerous category of vulnerabilities when dealing with shell environments.
*   **Impact:** Critical. Successful command injection typically leads to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Why it's High-Risk:** Command injection is a well-understood and frequently exploited vulnerability. It often arises from simple mistakes in handling external input.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Unsanitized Input Passed to Nushell (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_unsanitized_input_passed_to_nushell__critical_node_.md)

**Description:** This node represents the failure to properly sanitize or validate data before using it in Nushell commands. This is the primary mechanism for command injection.
*   **Impact:** Critical. Failure to sanitize input directly enables command injection and arbitrary code execution.
*   **Why it's Critical:** This is a critical control point. If input is properly sanitized, many command injection attacks can be prevented.

## Attack Tree Path: [User-Provided Input (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/user-provided_input__high-risk_path_.md)

**Description:** This is the most common and often easiest way for attackers to inject malicious commands. If the application takes user input (from forms, API requests, etc.) and uses it in Nushell commands without proper sanitization, it's highly vulnerable.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts malicious input that, when processed by Nushell, executes unintended commands.
    *   **Example:** If the application uses `nu -c "ls '$user_input'"` and the user inputs `file.txt; rm -rf /`, the application will execute `ls 'file.txt'; rm -rf /`.
*   **Likelihood:** High. This type of vulnerability is common in applications that dynamically construct shell commands from user input.
*   **Impact:** Critical. Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Effort:** Minimal. Exploiting this vulnerability often requires very little effort, especially for basic command injection.
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner. Basic command injection techniques are widely known and easily learned.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate. While basic command injection can be detected, more sophisticated injection techniques can be harder to identify.
