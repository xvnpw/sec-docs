## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Malicious Model [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/supply_malicious_model__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker aims to replace a legitimate machine learning model used by the application with a malicious one. This malicious model, when loaded and executed by the application, can perform actions unintended by the developers, leading to compromise.
* **High-Risk Path:** This is a high-risk path because successfully supplying a malicious model often leads to immediate and severe consequences, such as remote code execution or data exfiltration.
* **Critical Node:** This is a critical node because the model is a core component of the application's functionality, and its compromise can have widespread impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Model Storage/Source (AND) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_model_storagesource__and___critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker gains unauthorized access to the location where the application stores or retrieves its machine learning models. This could be a file system, a cloud storage bucket, or a model registry.
* **High-Risk Path:** This is a crucial step in supplying a malicious model. If successful, it directly enables the replacement of legitimate models.
* **Critical Node:** This is a critical node because it's a central point of control for the models used by the application. Compromising it opens the door to widespread model tampering.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Model Deserialization Vulnerabilities (AND) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_model_deserialization_vulnerabilities__and___critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker crafts a specially designed malicious model file that exploits vulnerabilities in the way Candle (or underlying libraries) deserializes or loads model data. This can lead to arbitrary code execution during the model loading process.
* **High-Risk Path:** This is a direct path to achieving remote code execution, bypassing the need to compromise the model storage location.
* **Critical Node:** This is a critical node because it directly leads to a severe security breach during a fundamental operation (model loading).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Model Format Vulnerabilities (AND) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_model_format_vulnerabilities__and___critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers leverage inherent weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the specific file format used to store the machine learning model (e.g., if Candle indirectly uses formats like ONNX). These vulnerabilities can be exploited during the model loading or inference process to cause unexpected behavior, potentially leading to code execution or information disclosure.
* **High-Risk Path:** This path can lead directly to critical impact by exploiting flaws in the model's structure itself.
* **Critical Node:** This is a critical node because it targets the fundamental structure of the model file, potentially bypassing other security measures.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Inference Execution Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_inference_execution_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Attackers target vulnerabilities that arise during the actual execution of the machine learning model by Candle. This often involves exploiting weaknesses in the underlying libraries that Candle relies on for numerical computation or hardware acceleration.
* **High-Risk Path:** Successful exploitation here can lead to direct control over the application's execution environment.
* **Critical Node:** This is a critical node because it targets the core processing logic of the application involving the ML model.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Vulnerabilities in Underlying Libraries (AND) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_vulnerabilities_in_underlying_libraries__and___critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Candle relies on lower-level libraries for tasks like linear algebra and hardware acceleration. Attackers can craft specific inputs or trigger certain model operations that expose known vulnerabilities in these underlying libraries, leading to consequences like remote code execution.
* **High-Risk Path:** This is a high-risk path because vulnerabilities in widely used libraries can have a significant impact.
* **Critical Node:** This is a critical node because it highlights the risk associated with the dependency chain of Candle.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Output Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_output_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers focus on how the application processes and uses the output generated by the Candle model. If the output is not properly sanitized or validated, it can be manipulated to cause harm in downstream systems or influence application logic in malicious ways.
* **High-Risk Path:** This path can lead to significant impact by compromising other parts of the application or connected systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Output Injection into Downstream Systems (AND)](./attack_tree_paths/output_injection_into_downstream_systems__and_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker manipulates the model's output in a way that, when processed by subsequent parts of the application or external systems, injects malicious commands or data. This is similar to traditional injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection) but leverages the model's output as the injection vector.
* **High-Risk Path:** This path demonstrates how a compromised ML component can be used to attack other parts of the infrastructure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies of Candle [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies_of_candle__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers target vulnerabilities in the external Rust crates (libraries) that Candle depends on. If a dependency has a known security flaw, attackers can exploit it to compromise the application using Candle.
* **High-Risk Path:** This is a common and effective attack vector in modern software development.
* **Critical Node:** This is a critical node because it highlights the inherent risks of relying on external code and the importance of dependency management.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerable Crates (AND) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerable_crates__and___critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers identify and exploit known vulnerabilities (often with CVE identifiers) in the Rust crates that Candle uses. This can lead to various forms of compromise, including remote code execution.
* **High-Risk Path:** This is a significant high-risk path because it leverages publicly known vulnerabilities, making it easier for attackers to exploit.
* **Critical Node:** This is a critical node because it directly exposes the application to known security weaknesses in its dependencies.
