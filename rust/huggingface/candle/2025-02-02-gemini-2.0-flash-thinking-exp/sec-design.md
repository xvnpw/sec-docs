# BUSINESS POSTURE

The `candle` project is a minimalist machine learning framework written in Rust, with a focus on performance and ease of use. It aims to provide a leaner alternative to existing Python-centric frameworks, particularly for inference workloads.

- Business priorities and goals:
  - Provide a high-performance, low-resource consumption machine learning inference framework.
  - Offer an easy-to-use API for developers familiar with Rust and machine learning concepts.
  - Enable efficient deployment of machine learning models in resource-constrained environments (edge devices, embedded systems).
  - Foster a community around Rust-based machine learning.
  - Potentially reduce the operational costs associated with machine learning inference by improving efficiency.

- Most important business risks:
  - Slower adoption compared to established Python frameworks due to the Rust ecosystem being less mature in machine learning.
  - Performance bottlenecks or vulnerabilities discovered after wider adoption, impacting user trust.
  - Lack of community support and contributions, hindering project growth and maintenance.
  - Security vulnerabilities in dependencies or the core framework code, leading to potential exploits in applications using `candle`.
  - Compatibility issues with various hardware and software environments, limiting deployment options.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security controls:
  - security control: Code is written in Rust, which inherently provides memory safety and reduces the risk of certain classes of vulnerabilities like buffer overflows. Implemented in: Project codebase (Rust language features).
  - security control: Use of `unsafe` Rust blocks is minimized. Implemented in: Project codebase (code review and Rust language features).
  - security control: Standard software development practices are likely followed, including version control (Git), issue tracking (GitHub Issues), and pull requests. Implemented in: GitHub repository and development workflow.

- Accepted risks:
  - accepted risk: Limited formal security audits or penetration testing, especially in the early stages of the project.
  - accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies used by the framework.
  - accepted risk: Security vulnerabilities might be discovered as the project matures and is used in more diverse environments.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for bug fixes and security patches, which might have variable response times.

- Recommended security controls:
  - recommended security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential vulnerabilities in the codebase.
  - recommended security control: Implement automated Dependency Scanning to identify known vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
  - recommended security control: Conduct regular security code reviews, especially for critical components and contributions from external developers.
  - recommended security control: Establish a vulnerability disclosure policy and process to handle security reports from the community.
  - recommended security control: Consider fuzz testing to identify unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities in input processing.

- Security requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to a machine learning framework library. Authentication is the responsibility of the applications that use `candle`.
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to a machine learning framework library. Authorization is the responsibility of the applications that use `candle`.
  - Input validation: The framework should perform robust input validation on any external data it processes, such as model weights, input tensors, and configuration parameters, to prevent unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities. Implemented in: Framework code, specifically in data loading and processing modules.
  - Cryptography: If `candle` implements or uses cryptographic operations (e.g., for secure model loading or communication), ensure that well-vetted and secure cryptographic libraries are used correctly. Implemented in: Framework code, specifically in modules related to cryptography if applicable.

  - Build artifacts (binaries, libraries) (integrity, availability). Sensitivity: Medium.
  - Machine learning models used with `candle` (confidentiality, integrity, availability - depending on the model and data it's trained on). Sensitivity: Variable, potentially High if models are proprietary or trained on sensitive data.
  - User data processed by applications using `candle` (confidentiality, integrity, availability - highly sensitive depending on the application). Sensitivity: Variable, potentially High.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What is the intended scope of security for the `candle` project? Is it primarily focused on the framework itself, or also on providing guidance for secure application development using `candle`?
  - Are there any specific compliance requirements or industry standards that the `candle` project needs to adhere to?
  - What is the process for handling security vulnerabilities reported by the community? Is there a dedicated security team or point of contact?
  - Are there plans for formal security audits or penetration testing of the `candle` framework in the future?
  - What is the expected level of security expertise among the target users of `candle`? Should the framework provide built-in security features or rely on users to implement security measures in their applications?

- Assumptions:
  - The `candle` project is developed with a general awareness of secure coding practices, but formal security processes might be limited in the early stages.
  - The primary focus of the project is currently on functionality and performance, with security being a secondary but important consideration.
  - The project relies on the inherent security benefits of Rust, but additional security measures are needed to address a broader range of threats.
  - Users of `candle` are expected to implement application-level security controls to protect their applications and data.
  - The project is open to community contributions and feedback, including security-related suggestions and reports.
