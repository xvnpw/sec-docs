    *   Likelihood: Low to Medium
    *   Impact: High (Code execution, system compromise)
    *   Effort: Medium to High
    *   Skill Level: Advanced
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
    *   Actionable Insight: Conduct static analysis of Candle code for potential memory management issues. Review and audit `unsafe` code blocks in Candle.

*   **1.3. Critical Node: Vulnerabilities in Dependency Crates**
    *   Attack Vector:
        *   Any input that triggers dependency code paths: Exploiting known vulnerabilities in crates that Candle depends on. This could be triggered by various inputs depending on the specific dependency and vulnerability.
    *   Attack Type: Dependency Vulnerability Exploitation

    *   Impact: High (Depends on the vulnerability, could be code execution, data breaches, DoS)
    *   Effort: Low to Medium
    *   Skill Level: Beginner to Intermediate
    *   Detection Difficulty: Low to Medium
    *   Actionable Insight: Regularly audit and update Candle's dependencies. Use tools to scan for known vulnerabilities in dependencies (e.g., `cargo audit`). Implement dependency pinning and reproducible builds.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Model Loading/Parsing](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_model_loadingparsing.md)

*   **2.1. Critical Node: Malicious Model File Parsing**
    *   Attack Vector:
        *   Crafted Model File (e.g., ONNX, safetensors, custom formats): Providing a deliberately malformed or malicious model file to the application for loading and parsing.
    *   Attack Type:
        *   Buffer Overflow during parsing
        *   Path Traversal during file loading (if applicable)
        *   Denial of Service via resource exhaustion (e.g., excessively large model, infinite loops in parsing)
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: High (Buffer Overflow/Path Traversal), Medium (DoS) (Code execution, system access, service disruption)
    *   Effort: Medium
    *   Skill Level: Intermediate to Advanced (Buffer Overflow), Intermediate (DoS)
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
    *   Actionable Insight: Implement robust model file parsing with input validation and size limits. Use secure parsing libraries if available. Fuzz test model parsing logic with malformed and malicious model files.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Data Input Handling to Candle](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_data_input_handling_to_candle.md)
