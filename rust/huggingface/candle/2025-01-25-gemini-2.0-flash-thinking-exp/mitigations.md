## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Dependency Pinning for Candle and its Dependencies](./mitigation_strategies/strict_dependency_pinning_for_candle_and_its_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Open your project's `Cargo.toml` file.
    2.  Locate the `candle` dependency and explicitly specify the exact version number instead of using version ranges (e.g., `candle = "0.3.0"` instead of `candle = "0.3"` or `candle = "^0.3"`).
    3.  Examine `candle`'s dependencies listed in its `Cargo.toml` (available on the `candle` GitHub repository).  Pin the versions of these dependencies in your project's `Cargo.toml` if you are directly depending on them or if you want to have tighter control over the entire dependency tree.
    4.  Run `cargo update --locked` to ensure that the `Cargo.lock` file is updated with the pinned versions for `candle` and its dependencies.
    5.  Commit both `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock` to your version control system.
    6.  When updating `candle`, do so in a controlled manner. Update `candle` and its relevant dependencies together, test your application thoroughly, and then update the pinned versions in `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock`.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Dependency Confusion/Substitution Attacks targeting Candle or its dependencies (High Severity):** Prevents using unintended or malicious versions of `candle` or its underlying crates.
        *   **Introduction of Vulnerable Dependencies through Automatic Candle Updates (Medium Severity):**  Reduces the risk of unknowingly incorporating vulnerabilities from new versions of `candle`'s dependencies when `candle` itself is updated.
        *   **Supply Chain Compromise of Candle or its Dependencies (Medium Severity):** Limits the impact if a specific version of `candle` or one of its dependencies is compromised, by controlling exactly which versions are used.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Dependency Confusion/Substitution Attacks:** Significantly reduces risk for `candle` and its direct dependencies.
        *   **Introduction of Vulnerable Dependencies through Automatic Candle Updates:** Significantly reduces risk.
        *   **Supply Chain Compromise:** Partially reduces risk (controls versions, but doesn't prevent initial compromise of a pinned version).

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Partially implemented by Rust's `Cargo.lock` mechanism, which records dependency versions. However, explicit pinning in `Cargo.toml` for `candle` and its dependencies is often not enforced.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Enforcing strict version pinning for `candle` and its critical dependencies in `Cargo.toml`.
        *   Documented process for controlled updates of `candle` and its dependencies.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dependency Vulnerability Scanning for Candle Dependencies](./mitigation_strategies/dependency_vulnerability_scanning_for_candle_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Integrate a dependency scanning tool specifically configured for Rust projects (like `cargo audit` or tools that understand `Cargo.lock`) into your CI/CD pipeline.
    2.  Configure the tool to scan your `Cargo.lock` file, focusing on vulnerabilities within `candle`'s dependency tree.
    3.  Set up automated scans to run regularly (e.g., daily or on each commit) to detect newly disclosed vulnerabilities in `candle`'s dependencies.
    4.  Configure alerts to notify developers specifically when vulnerabilities are detected in `candle` or its dependencies.
    5.  Establish a process to prioritize and remediate vulnerabilities reported for `candle`'s dependencies, which might involve updating `candle` to a newer version that uses patched dependencies, or patching dependencies directly if feasible and safe.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Candle's Dependencies (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of attackers exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities present in the Rust crates that `candle` relies upon.
        *   **Indirect Vulnerabilities through Candle's Dependency Chain (Medium Severity):**  Catches vulnerabilities that might not be directly in `candle`'s code, but are present in crates it depends on, which could still be exploited through `candle`'s functionality.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Candle's Dependencies:** Significantly reduces risk.
        *   **Indirect Vulnerabilities through Candle's Dependency Chain:** Significantly reduces risk.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   May be partially implemented if general dependency scanning is used in the project. However, specific focus on `candle`'s dependencies and tailored alerts for them might be missing.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   CI/CD integration of Rust-specific vulnerability scanning focused on `candle`'s dependency tree.
        *   Alerting mechanisms specifically highlighting vulnerabilities in `candle`'s dependencies.
        *   Defined process for patching or updating `candle` dependencies when vulnerabilities are found.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Model Origin Validation for Candle Model Loading](./mitigation_strategies/model_origin_validation_for_candle_model_loading.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  When your application loads models using `candle`'s model loading functions, implement a validation step to verify the origin and integrity of the model file.
    2.  If models are downloaded from a remote source, ensure the download happens over HTTPS to protect against man-in-the-middle attacks during download.
    3.  Use cryptographic checksums (e.g., SHA256) provided by the model source (if available) to verify the integrity of the downloaded model file *before* loading it with `candle`. Compare the calculated checksum with the trusted checksum.
    4.  If models are stored locally, consider using file system permissions to restrict write access to the model storage location, preventing unauthorized modification of model files used by `candle`.
    5.  For highly sensitive applications, explore using digital signatures for models, if the model providers offer them, and implement signature verification before loading models with `candle`.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Malicious Model Injection/Substitution for Candle (High Severity):** Prevents loading of tampered or malicious models that could be designed to cause harm when used with `candle` (e.g., produce incorrect outputs, trigger vulnerabilities in downstream systems, or leak sensitive data).
        *   **Model Corruption during Download/Storage for Candle (Medium Severity):** Ensures that `candle` loads intact models and not corrupted ones that could lead to unpredictable behavior or errors.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Malicious Model Injection/Substitution for Candle:** Significantly reduces risk.
        *   **Model Corruption during Download/Storage for Candle:** Significantly reduces risk.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Often missing. Applications might load models using `candle` without explicit origin or integrity checks. HTTPS for download might be used, but checksum or signature verification is less common for ML models in application code.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Checksum or signature verification logic integrated into the model loading process when using `candle`.
        *   Secure model download mechanisms (HTTPS).
        *   Documentation and guidelines for developers on secure model loading practices with `candle`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limits During Candle Inference](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limits_during_candle_inference.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  When performing inference using `candle`, implement resource limits to prevent excessive consumption of system resources.
    2.  Set limits on CPU time, memory usage, and (if applicable) GPU memory allocation for each inference operation performed by `candle`.
    3.  Utilize operating system-level mechanisms (e.g., process resource limits, cgroups) or Rust libraries for resource management to enforce these limits.
    4.  Monitor resource usage during `candle` inference. If resource limits are approached or exceeded, gracefully terminate the inference process and handle the error appropriately in your application.
    5.  Consider implementing rate limiting for inference requests if your application exposes `candle` inference as a service, to prevent DoS attacks that exploit resource-intensive inference operations.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion during Candle Inference (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from overwhelming the system by triggering resource-intensive `candle` inference operations, making the application unavailable.
        *   **Unintentional Resource Exhaustion due to Large Models or Inputs in Candle (Medium Severity):** Protects against accidental resource exhaustion caused by legitimate but resource-heavy models or user inputs processed by `candle`.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion during Candle Inference:** Significantly reduces risk.
        *   **Unintentional Resource Exhaustion due to Large Models or Inputs in Candle:** Significantly reduces risk.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Often partially implemented at the system level (e.g., OS resource limits). However, application-specific resource limits tailored to `candle` inference and graceful error handling are frequently missing.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Application-level resource limit enforcement specifically for `candle` inference operations.
        *   Monitoring of resource usage during `candle` inference within the application.
        *   Graceful error handling and fallback mechanisms when `candle` inference exceeds resource limits.
