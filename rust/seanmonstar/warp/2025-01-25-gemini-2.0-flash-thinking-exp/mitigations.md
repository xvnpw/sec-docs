## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Route Parameter Validation](./mitigation_strategies/strict_route_parameter_validation.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Strict Route Parameter Validation
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Leverage `warp::path::param()` and `warp::query()`:**  Utilize `warp`'s built-in extractors `warp::path::param()` for path segments and `warp::query()` for query parameters to access route parameters.
    2.  **Implement Validation Filters:** Create custom `warp` filters that encapsulate validation logic. Chain these filters after parameter extraction using `.and_then()` or `.map()` to validate the extracted parameters.
    3.  **Utilize Rust's Type System and Validation Crates:** Within your validation filters, use Rust's strong type system and consider integrating validation crates like `validator` to define and enforce data type, format, and range constraints on parameters.
    4.  **Return `warp::reject::custom()` for Invalid Parameters:** If validation fails within a filter, use `warp::reject::custom()` to return a specific rejection type (e.g., `warp::reject::bad_request()`). `warp`'s error handling mechanism will then manage the response.
    5.  **Example using `warp::Filter`:** Create a reusable filter that validates a user ID parameter extracted using `warp::path::param::<u32>()`, ensuring it's a positive integer before proceeding.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Path Traversal (High Severity):** Prevents manipulation of path parameters to access unauthorized resources, by validating path segments extracted by `warp::path::param()`.
    *   **SQL Injection (High Severity):** Reduces risk if parameters extracted by `warp::path::param()` or `warp::query()` are used in database queries, by ensuring they are validated before use.
    *   **Command Injection (High Severity):** Prevents injection if parameters from `warp` extractors are used in system commands, through validation.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Medium Severity):** Reduces risk if parameters are reflected in responses, by validating and sanitizing parameters extracted by `warp` before rendering.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Prevents exploitation of vulnerabilities caused by unexpected parameter values handled by `warp` routes, through validation.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Path Traversal:** Risk reduced significantly (High to Low).
    *   **SQL Injection:** Risk reduced significantly (High to Low).
    *   **Command Injection:** Risk reduced significantly (High to Low).
    *   **XSS:** Risk reduced moderately (Medium to Low).
    *   **DoS:** Risk reduced moderately (Medium to Low).
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented in the user authentication module where user IDs are validated to be integers using `warp::path::param::<u32>()` and basic checks. Implemented in `src/auth.rs` and used in routes under `/api/user/{user_id}`.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Missing in API endpoints that handle file uploads, search queries, and form submissions. Specifically, routes under `/api/files`, `/api/search`, and `/api/submit` lack comprehensive parameter validation using `warp`'s filter system.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Body Payload Validation and Size Limits using Warp Extractors](./mitigation_strategies/body_payload_validation_and_size_limits_using_warp_extractors.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Body Payload Validation and Size Limits
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize `warp::body::json()`, `warp::body::form()`, and `warp::body::bytes()`:**  Employ `warp`'s body extractors to handle different content types. `warp::body::json()` for JSON, `warp::body::form()` for form data, and `warp::body::bytes()` for raw bytes.
    2.  **Schema Validation with `serde` and `validator`:**  Use `serde` for deserialization when using `warp::body::json()` or `warp::body::form()`. Integrate `validator` or custom validation logic *after* deserialization within your `warp` filter chain to validate the structure and content of the deserialized data.
    3.  **Enforce Size Limits with `warp::body::content_length_limit()`:**  Apply `warp::body::content_length_limit()` *before* body extraction filters in your route definition to restrict the maximum allowed size of request bodies. This is a `warp`-specific filter for DoS prevention.
    4.  **Handle `warp::Rejection` for Validation Errors:**  `warp::body::json()` and `warp::body::form()` can return `warp::Rejection` if deserialization fails. Your custom error handler (using `warp::recover()`) should handle these rejections appropriately. Validation errors from `validator` or custom logic should also be converted to `warp::Rejection` for consistent error handling.
    5.  **Example using `warp::Filter` Chain:** Define a route that uses `warp::body::content_length_limit()` followed by `warp::body::json::<MyData>()` and then a custom validation filter to ensure the JSON payload conforms to `MyData` schema and business rules.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (High Severity):** `warp::body::content_length_limit()` directly mitigates DoS by preventing large payloads.
    *   **Data Injection Attacks (SQL, Command, NoSQL) (High Severity):** Schema validation after `warp::body::json()` or `warp::body::form()` reduces injection risks by ensuring data structure and content are as expected.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Medium Severity):** Reduces risk if body data processed by `warp` extractors is reflected in responses, through validation and sanitization.
    *   **Business Logic Bypass (Medium Severity):** Schema validation after `warp` body extraction helps prevent bypass by ensuring data conforms to expected formats.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Risk reduced significantly (High to Low).
    *   **Data Injection Attacks:** Risk reduced significantly (High to Low).
    *   **XSS:** Risk reduced moderately (Medium to Low).
    *   **Business Logic Bypass:** Risk reduced moderately (Medium to Low).
*   **Currently Implemented:** Content length limits are globally set to 1MB for all API endpoints in `src/main.rs` using `warp::body::content_length_limit(1024 * 1024)`. JSON payload validation is implemented for user registration and login endpoints in `src/auth.rs` using `warp::body::json()` and custom validation functions.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Schema validation is missing for file upload endpoints, profile update endpoints, and any API endpoints that accept form data.  Specifically, validation needs to be implemented in `src/files.rs` and `src/profile.rs` using `warp`'s body extractors and validation filters.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Custom Error Handling with `warp::recover()`](./mitigation_strategies/custom_error_handling_with__warprecover___.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Custom Error Handling for Minimal Information Leakage
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement a `warp::Filter` Error Handler Function:** Create a function that takes a `warp::reject::Rejection` as input and returns a `Result<warp::reply::Reply, warp::Rejection>`. This function will define your custom error handling logic.
    2.  **Use `warp::recover(your_error_handler_function)`:**  Wrap your entire route definition with `warp::recover(your_error_handler_function)`. This registers your custom function to handle any `warp::Rejection` that propagates up the filter chain.
    3.  **Categorize `warp::Rejection` Types:** Within your error handler, use pattern matching or `is_of::<RejectionType>()` to identify different types of `warp::Rejection` (e.g., `warp::reject::NotFound`, `warp::reject::BadRequest`, custom rejections you define).
    4.  **Log Detailed Errors (Server-Side):** Log detailed error information based on the `warp::Rejection` type. This logging is for server-side debugging and monitoring, not for client responses.
    5.  **Return Generic `warp::reply::Reply` for Clients:**  For each `warp::Rejection` type, construct a generic, user-friendly `warp::reply::Reply` (e.g., using `warp::reply::with_status()` and `warp::reply::json()`). Avoid exposing internal details in these client-facing responses.
    6.  **Example using `warp::Filter` and `warp::reply`:**  In your error handler, if you catch a `warp::reject::NotFound`, log "Resource not found" server-side, but return a client response like `warp::reply::with_status(warp::reply::json(&{"error": "Not Found"}), warp::http::StatusCode::NOT_FOUND)`.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** `warp::recover()` allows you to control error responses, preventing leakage of internal details that `warp`'s default error handling might expose.
    *   **Security Misconfiguration (Low Severity):** Reduces risk of unintentional information exposure by overriding default `warp` behavior with controlled error responses.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced moderately (Medium to Low).
    *   **Security Misconfiguration:** Risk reduced slightly (Low to Very Low).
*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic custom error handling is implemented in `src/main.rs` using `warp::recover()`. It logs error messages but still returns default Warp error responses in some cases.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Detailed error categorization based on `warp::Rejection` types, secure logging of errors within the `warp::recover()` handler, and truly generic user-facing error messages using `warp::reply` are missing. The error handler needs to be enhanced to fully leverage `warp`'s rejection system for controlled responses.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Authentication and Authorization Middleware using Warp Filters](./mitigation_strategies/authentication_and_authorization_middleware_using_warp_filters.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Authentication and Authorization Middleware
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Create Authentication `warp::Filter`:**  Develop a `warp::Filter` that performs authentication. This filter should:
        *   Extract credentials from the request (e.g., using `warp::header::headers_cloned()` or `warp::cookie::cookie()`).
        *   Validate credentials (e.g., JWT verification, session lookup).
        *   If authentication succeeds, return a `warp::Filter` that provides user identity (e.g., using `warp::any().map(move || user_identity)`).
        *   If authentication fails, return `warp::reject::unauthorized()`.
    2.  **Create Authorization `warp::Filter`:** Develop a `warp::Filter` for authorization. This filter should:
        *   Depend on the authentication filter (using `.and()`) to obtain user identity.
        *   Check user permissions against the requested resource or action.
        *   If authorized, return a `warp::Filter::empty()` to allow the request to proceed.
        *   If unauthorized, return `warp::reject::forbidden()`.
    3.  **Combine Filters with `and()` and `or()`:** Use `warp`'s filter combinators (`.and()`, `.or()`) to chain authentication and authorization filters with your route handlers. Apply these filter chains to protected routes.
    4.  **Example Filter Chain:** `warp::path!("protected" / segment) .and(authenticate_filter) .and(authorize_filter) .and_then(protected_handler)`. This chain ensures `authenticate_filter` and `authorize_filter` are executed before `protected_handler`.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** `warp` filters for authentication and authorization directly prevent unauthorized access to routes they protect.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (High Severity):** Authorization filters within `warp` ensure users only access permitted resources, preventing privilege escalation.
    *   **Data Breaches (High Severity):** By controlling access using `warp` filters, authentication and authorization are fundamental to preventing data breaches.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduced significantly (High to Low).
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduced significantly (High to Low).
    *   **Data Breaches:** Risk reduced significantly (High to Low).
*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic JWT-based authentication is implemented for user login and registration in `src/auth.rs` using custom `warp::Filter`s. An authentication filter verifies JWT tokens for routes under `/api/protected`.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Authorization is not yet implemented using `warp::Filter`s.  There are no filters to check user permissions. Authorization filters need to be implemented and applied to all protected routes, especially in `src/files.rs`, `src/profile.rs`, and `src/admin.rs` (if it exists) using `warp`'s filter system.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting Middleware using Warp Filters](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_middleware_using_warp_filters.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Rate Limiting and Request Throttling
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose a Rate Limiting Library Compatible with `warp`:** Select a Rust rate limiting library (e.g., `governor`, `ratelimit`) that can be integrated into `warp` filters.
    2.  **Create a Rate Limiting `warp::Filter`:** Develop a `warp::Filter` that implements rate limiting. This filter should:
        *   Identify the client (e.g., by IP address using `warp::filters::addr::remote()`, or authenticated user ID from an authentication filter).
        *   Use the chosen rate limiting library to track request counts and enforce limits.
        *   If the rate limit is exceeded, return `warp::reject::too_many_requests()`.
        *   Otherwise, return `warp::Filter::empty()` to allow the request to proceed.
    3.  **Configure Rate Limits within the Filter:**  Parameterize your rate limiting filter to allow configuration of different rate limits for different routes or client types.
    4.  **Apply Rate Limiting Filter Globally or Selectively:** Use `warp`'s filter combination to apply the rate limiting filter either globally to all routes (using `.and()` at the top level of your route definition) or selectively to specific routes that require rate limiting.
    5.  **Example Filter Application:** `let api_routes = api_routes.and(rate_limit_filter).or(...);`  This applies `rate_limit_filter` to all routes defined within `api_routes`.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (High Severity):** `warp` filters for rate limiting directly prevent DoS attacks by limiting request frequency.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (Medium Severity):** Rate limiting filters in `warp` reduce the effectiveness of brute-force attacks by slowing down attempts.
    *   **API Abuse (Medium Severity):** `warp` rate limiting prevents excessive API usage, protecting resources.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Risk reduced significantly (High to Low).
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Risk reduced moderately (Medium to Low).
    *   **API Abuse:** Risk reduced moderately (Medium to Low).
*   **Currently Implemented:** No rate limiting is currently implemented in the project using `warp` filters.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Rate limiting needs to be implemented using a `warp::Filter`. This is a critical missing security feature, especially for public-facing APIs. Implementation should be prioritized in `src/main.rs` and potentially configured differently for various API routes using `warp`'s filter system.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Security Headers using `warp::reply::with_header()`](./mitigation_strategies/implement_security_headers_using__warpreplywith_header___.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Security Headers
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Security Headers:** Determine the necessary security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.) for your application.
    2.  **Create a Middleware `warp::Filter` for Headers:** Develop a `warp::Filter` that adds security headers to responses. Use `warp::reply::with_header()` within this filter to set each header.
    3.  **Configure Header Values in the Filter:**  Set the values of each security header within the filter based on your application's security policy. For CSP, carefully define directives.
    4.  **Apply Header Filter Globally:** Use `warp`'s filter combination to apply the security header filter globally to all routes. This can be done by wrapping your entire route definition with the header filter using `.map(|reply| header_filter(reply))`.
    5.  **Example Header Filter:** Create a filter that uses `warp::reply::with_header()` multiple times to add CSP, X-Frame-Options, and other headers to any `warp::reply::Reply` it receives.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):** CSP header set using `warp::reply::with_header()` significantly reduces XSS risk.
    *   **Clickjacking (Medium Severity):** X-Frame-Options header set by `warp::reply::with_header()` prevents clickjacking.
    *   **MIME Sniffing Attacks (Medium Severity):** X-Content-Type-Options header via `warp::reply::with_header()` prevents MIME sniffing.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (Medium Severity):** HSTS header set using `warp::reply::with_header()` enforces HTTPS.
    *   **Information Leakage (Low Severity):** Referrer-Policy header via `warp::reply::with_header()` controls referrer information.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Risk reduced significantly (High to Low).
    *   **Clickjacking:** Risk reduced moderately (Medium to Low).
    *   **MIME Sniffing Attacks:** Risk reduced moderately (Medium to Low).
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Risk reduced moderately (Medium to Low).
    *   **Information Leakage:** Risk reduced slightly (Low to Very Low).
*   **Currently Implemented:**  HSTS header is partially implemented in `src/main.rs` using `warp::reply::with_header()` but only for specific routes and not configured for production.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, and Permissions-Policy headers are not implemented using `warp::reply::with_header()`. HSTS needs to be fully configured for production. A comprehensive security headers middleware filter needs to be implemented and applied globally in `src/main.rs` using `warp`'s filter system.
