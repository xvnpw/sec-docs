# Attack Surface Analysis for seanmonstar/warp

## Attack Surface: [Complex Filter Chains & Logic Errors (Direct `warp` Feature)](./attack_surfaces/complex_filter_chains_&_logic_errors__direct__warp__feature_.md)

*Description:* Intricate `warp` filter compositions, especially with custom filters, can introduce logical flaws leading to bypasses or unexpected behavior. This is *directly* tied to `warp`'s filter-based architecture.
*How `warp` Contributes:* `warp`'s core design *is* composing filters. The framework's flexibility allows for complex configurations, making this a direct concern.
*Example:* A filter intended to block access to `/admin` is incorrectly ordered, allowing unauthorized access. A custom filter using a flawed regular expression allows bypass of intended restrictions.
*Impact:* Authentication/Authorization bypass, Information disclosure, potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE) if a filter interacts with the system unsafely.
*Risk Severity:* **Critical** to **High** (depending on the specific logic flaw).
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Simplify Filters:** Keep filter chains as simple and linear as possible.
    *   **Unit Testing:** Thoroughly unit test each filter individually *and* in combination.
    *   **Code Review:** Mandatory code review of filter chain logic.
    *   **Input Validation (Early):** Validate *before* complex filter logic.
    *   **"Fail Closed" Design:** Filters should deny access by default.

## Attack Surface: [Unbounded Request Body Handling (Direct `warp` Interaction)](./attack_surfaces/unbounded_request_body_handling__direct__warp__interaction_.md)

*Description:* Failure to limit request body sizes can lead to Denial of Service (DoS). This is a direct interaction with how `warp` handles incoming data.
*How `warp` Contributes:* `warp` (via `hyper`) handles request bodies. While it *provides* limiting mechanisms, not using them is a direct vulnerability within `warp`'s usage.
*Example:* An endpoint accepting uploads doesn't use `warp`'s `body::content_length_limit()`, allowing a massive upload to consume resources.
*Impact:* Denial of Service (DoS).
*Risk Severity:* **High**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **`body::content_length_limit()`:** *Always* use `warp`'s `body::content_length_limit()` filter. This is a direct `warp` mitigation.
    *   **Streaming with Limits (If Applicable):** For very large uploads, use streaming *with* `warp`'s limits.

## Attack Surface: [WebSocket Security - CSWSH (Direct `warp` Feature)](./attack_surfaces/websocket_security_-_cswsh__direct__warp__feature_.md)

*Description:* `warp`'s WebSocket support introduces risks related to Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH) if origin validation is not correctly implemented *within the `warp` filter*.
*How `warp` Contributes:* `warp` provides the WebSocket functionality.  The framework provides the upgrade mechanism, and the developer must use `warp`'s features to validate the origin.
*Example:* A WebSocket endpoint doesn't use `warp`'s capabilities to check the `Origin` header, allowing a malicious site to connect.
*Impact:* Unauthorized actions, data theft, session hijacking.
*Risk Severity:* **High** to **Critical**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **`warp::ws()` Origin Validation:** *Strictly* validate the `Origin` header *within the `warp::ws()` filter setup*. This is a direct use of `warp`'s features for security.
    * **Authentication within WebSocket Context:** Implement authentication *after* the WebSocket upgrade, using `warp`'s context to manage the authenticated session.
