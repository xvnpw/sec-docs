# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a robust, high-performance, and easy-to-use web server framework for the Rust ecosystem.
*   Enable developers to build and deploy web applications and services with speed and confidence.
*   Maintain a strong focus on correctness, safety, and performance, leveraging Rust's language features.
*   Foster a vibrant community and ecosystem around the framework.
*   Offer a compelling alternative to web frameworks in other languages.

Business Risks:

*   Security vulnerabilities in the framework could expose applications built with Warp to attacks, leading to data breaches, service disruptions, and reputational damage.
*   Performance bottlenecks or instability in the framework could negatively impact the performance and reliability of applications built with Warp.
*   Lack of adoption or a decline in community engagement could hinder the long-term viability of the project.
*   Competition from other web frameworks in Rust and other languages could limit Warp's market share.
*   Inability to keep up with evolving web standards and security best practices could render the framework obsolete or insecure.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: The project is written in Rust, a memory-safe language, which inherently prevents many common security vulnerabilities like buffer overflows and use-after-free errors. (Described in the project's README and inherent to the choice of Rust).
*   security control: The project uses `hyper` as its HTTP implementation, which itself is a well-vetted and security-conscious library. (Described in the project's dependencies).
*   security control: The project has a `SECURITY.md` file outlining the process for reporting vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Regular dependency updates to address known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries. (Visible in the project's commit history).
*   security control: Use of CI (GitHub Actions) to automate testing and linting. (Visible in the `.github/workflows` directory).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: The framework is relatively young, and undiscovered vulnerabilities may exist.
*   accepted risk: Reliance on external dependencies (like `hyper`) introduces the risk of vulnerabilities in those dependencies.
*   accepted risk: The complexity of asynchronous programming in Rust can introduce subtle bugs that may have security implications.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement fuzzing to proactively discover potential vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.
*   security control: Integrate a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool to identify and track vulnerabilities in dependencies.
*   security control: Consider implementing a Content Security Policy (CSP) and other HTTP security headers by default or providing easy configuration options.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   The framework should provide mechanisms or guidance for implementing secure authentication protocols (e.g., OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect).
    *   Support for secure session management is crucial.
*   Authorization:
    *   The framework should facilitate the implementation of role-based access control (RBAC) or other authorization models.
    *   Mechanisms for protecting against unauthorized access to resources are necessary.
*   Input Validation:
    *   The framework should encourage or provide built-in mechanisms for validating all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., XSS, SQL injection).
    *   Clear guidance on handling different data types and encodings is needed.
*   Cryptography:
    *   The framework should utilize secure cryptographic libraries and practices for handling sensitive data (e.g., passwords, API keys).
    *   Guidance on using HTTPS and managing TLS certificates is essential.

    Developer["Developer"] -- "Code Commit" --> Git["Git Repository"]
    Git -- "Webhook Trigger" --> CI["CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)"]
    CI -- "Checkout Code" --> BuildServer["Build Server"]

    BuildServer -- "Dependency Check (cargo audit)" --> BuildServer
    BuildServer -- "Create Docker Image" --> BuildServer
    BuildServer -- "Push Image" --> DockerRegistry["Docker Registry"]
```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developer commits code to the Git repository.
2.  A webhook triggers the CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions).
3.  The CI pipeline checks out the code onto a build server.
4.  The code is compiled using `cargo build --release`.
5.  Tests are run using `cargo test`.
6.  Linting is performed using `clippy`.
7.  Dependency vulnerabilities are checked using `cargo audit` or a similar tool.
8.  A Docker image is created, packaging the compiled binary and any necessary runtime dependencies.
9.  The Docker image is pushed to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, Amazon ECR).

Security Controls:

*   security control: Use of a CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions) ensures consistent and automated builds.
*   security control: Automated testing (`cargo test`) helps catch bugs early.
*   security control: Linting (`clippy`) enforces code style and helps prevent potential errors.
*   security control: Dependency checking (`cargo audit`) identifies known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
*   security control: Building a Docker image provides a consistent and isolated runtime environment.
*   security control: Pushing the image to a secure container registry protects the built artifact.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Serving web requests and API responses reliably and efficiently.
*   Protecting user data and ensuring privacy.
*   Maintaining the availability and integrity of the service.

Data Sensitivity:

*   Depending on the specific application built with Warp, the data handled could range from non-sensitive public data to highly sensitive personal or financial information.  The design document should be updated with specifics once the application's purpose is defined.
*   Example: If the Warp application handles user authentication, then user credentials (hashed passwords, tokens) would be considered highly sensitive.
*   Example: If the application processes payments, then credit card details and transaction data would be highly sensitive.
*   Example: If the application stores user-generated content, the sensitivity would depend on the nature of the content.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   What specific types of applications are anticipated to be built with Warp? (This will significantly impact data sensitivity and security requirements.)
*   What are the expected traffic patterns and scaling requirements?
*   What external services will Warp applications typically interact with?
*   What level of security certification or compliance is required (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA)?
*   Are there any specific performance benchmarks or targets?
