## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application (RCE or DoS) {CN}](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application__rce_or_dos__{cn}.md)

*   **Description:** This is the ultimate objective of the attacker.  They aim to either execute arbitrary code on the server (RCE) or render the application unavailable (DoS). This node is critical because all attack paths lead to it.
    *   **Likelihood:** (Dependent on the success of lower-level attacks)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (Complete system compromise or service unavailability)
    *   **Effort:** (Variable, depends on the exploited vulnerability)
    *   **Skill Level:** (Variable, depends on the exploited vulnerability)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** (Variable, depends on the exploited vulnerability and monitoring systems)

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Warp Misconfigurations/Misuse [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_warp_misconfigurationsmisuse__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** This branch represents attacks that leverage incorrect configurations or improper use of the Warp framework.  These are often easier to exploit than code vulnerabilities and are a common source of security breaches.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (Due to the prevalence of human error in configuration)
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High (Depending on the specific misconfiguration)
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Often requires less technical expertise than exploiting code vulnerabilities)
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium (Depending on the specific misconfiguration and monitoring)

## Attack Tree Path: [Improper Filter Configuration {CN} [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/improper_filter_configuration_{cn}__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** This node represents a critical area of misconfiguration.  Warp's filters are essential for security (authentication, authorization, rate limiting, etc.).  Incorrectly configured or missing filters create significant vulnerabilities.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (Common developer error)
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High (Can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or DoS)
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium (Depending on the specific misconfiguration)

## Attack Tree Path: [4.1 Missing Authentication/Authorization Filters [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/4_1_missing_authenticationauthorization_filters__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the most critical and high-risk specific misconfiguration.  If authentication (verifying user identity) and authorization (determining what a user is allowed to do) filters are missing or bypassed, an attacker can gain unrestricted access to protected resources and functionality.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Common developer error, especially in complex applications)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (Complete compromise of sensitive data and functionality)
    *   **Effort:** Very Low (If the filters are missing, exploitation is trivial)
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice (Requires minimal technical skill)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (If the attacker can access protected resources without credentials)
        *   **Example Attack Scenarios:**
            *   Directly accessing administrative endpoints without providing credentials.
            *   Modifying or deleting data belonging to other users.
            *   Accessing internal APIs that should only be accessible to authenticated users.
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
            *   **"Deny by Default":**  Implement a security policy where access is denied unless explicitly granted.
            *   **Comprehensive Testing:**  Thoroughly test all routes and endpoints to ensure that authentication and authorization are enforced.
            *   **Centralized Authentication/Authorization:**  Use a consistent and well-tested mechanism for handling authentication and authorization across the application.
            *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits to identify and address any missing or misconfigured filters.
            * **Principle of Least Privilege**: Ensure that users and services have only the minimum necessary permissions.
