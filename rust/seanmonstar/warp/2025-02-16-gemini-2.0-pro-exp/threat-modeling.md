# Threat Model Analysis for seanmonstar/warp

## Threat: [Route Hijacking via Filter Misconfiguration](./threats/route_hijacking_via_filter_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious requests that exploit overly broad or incorrectly defined `warp` filters. They might use unexpected path traversals (`../`), URL encoding tricks, or manipulate query parameters to match routes intended to be private or restricted. The attacker aims to bypass intended access controls, leveraging `warp`'s filter flexibility against it.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality, potentially leading to data breaches, privilege escalation, or system compromise.
*   **Warp Component Affected:** `warp::Filter` combinators (especially `or`, `path`, `path!`), custom filter logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the sensitivity of the exposed routes).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Rigorously test all filter combinations, especially those with `or` and complex path matching. Use a "deny-by-default" approach, explicitly allowing only intended routes. Employ unit and integration tests to verify filter behavior. Use static analysis tools to detect overly broad filters.

## Threat: [Header Manipulation to Bypass Filters (When Headers are Used for Critical Security)](./threats/header_manipulation_to_bypass_filters__when_headers_are_used_for_critical_security_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects or modifies HTTP headers to bypass filters that rely on header values for *critical* security decisions (e.g., authentication, authorization). They might spoof headers like `X-Forwarded-For`, or custom headers intended for internal use, directly exploiting `warp`'s header filtering mechanism.
*   **Impact:** Bypass of authentication or authorization checks, access to internal resources, potential privilege escalation.
*   **Warp Component Affected:** `warp::header()`, custom filters relying on header values for *critical* security.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (specifically when headers are misused for critical security).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** *Avoid* relying solely on client-provided headers for critical security decisions. If headers are absolutely necessary, validate them thoroughly and combine them with other, more robust authentication mechanisms (e.g., JWTs, server-side session management). Be aware of header injection vulnerabilities in upstream proxies.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Unbounded Request Bodies](./threats/denial_of_service_via_unbounded_request_bodies.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a very large request body to a `warp` endpoint that does not have a content length limit enforced using `warp::body::content_length_limit()`. This consumes excessive server resources (memory, CPU), potentially causing the application to become unresponsive, directly exploiting the lack of built-in body size limits in `warp`.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, making the application unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **Warp Component Affected:** Any filter that accepts a request body *without* using `warp::body::content_length_limit()`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Use `warp::body::content_length_limit()` on *all* routes that accept request bodies, setting a reasonable maximum size. Consider streaming body processing for large uploads (if applicable).

## Threat: [Filter Ordering Leading to Authorization Bypass](./threats/filter_ordering_leading_to_authorization_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits the order of `warp` filters to bypass authorization checks. If an action (e.g., database write, file access) is performed by a filter *before* the authorization filter, the attacker might be able to trigger the action without being authorized, directly misusing `warp`'s filter chaining mechanism.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized execution of actions, potential data modification or deletion, privilege escalation.
*   **Warp Component Affected:** The entire filter chain; the order of `warp::Filter` application.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the action being bypassed).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Carefully review the order of filters. Ensure authorization checks are performed *before* any actions requiring authorization. Use a consistent pattern for filter ordering (e.g., authorization filters first). Employ integration tests to verify authorization enforcement.
