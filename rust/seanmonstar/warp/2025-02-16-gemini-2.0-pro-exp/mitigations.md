## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Filter Composition and Routing Logic Validation (Warp-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_filter_composition_and_routing_logic_validation__warp-specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Modular Filter Design:** Break down complex routing logic into smaller, single-responsibility `warp::Filter` implementations.  This improves readability and testability.
2.  **Filter Composition Review:** During code reviews, meticulously examine the `warp::Filter` chain, paying close attention to the order of operations and how filters are combined using `and`, `or`, `and_then`, etc. Trace the execution path.
3.  **Unit Testing of Individual Filters:** Write unit tests for *each* `warp::Filter` in isolation, using `warp::test::request()` to simulate requests and verify the filter's behavior.
4.  **Integration Testing of Filter Chains:** Write integration tests that use `warp::test::request()` to simulate complete HTTP requests and verify that the *entire* `warp::Filter` chain (as composed in your routes) behaves as expected.
5.  **Property-Based Testing (with `warp::test`):** Use `proptest` in conjunction with `warp::test::request()` to generate a wide range of inputs and automatically test your `warp::Filter` chains.
6.  **Regular Expression Review (within `warp::path` filters):** If using `warp::path` with regular expressions (e.g., `warp::path::param().and_then(...)`), carefully review the regex for ReDoS vulnerabilities.
7.  **Explicit Error Handling with `warp::reject`:** Ensure that all filter rejections (using `warp::reject`) result in consistent, well-defined HTTP responses. Use custom rejections (`warp::reject::custom`) for specific error types.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Authentication Bypass:** (Severity: **Critical**)
*   **Authorization Bypass:** (Severity: **Critical**)
*   **Unintended Route Exposure:** (Severity: **High**)
*   **Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) (within `warp::path`):** (Severity: **High**)
*   **Information Leakage (via `warp::reject`):** (Severity: **Medium**)

**Impact:** (Same as previous, but focused on the `warp`-specific aspects)
*   **Authentication/Authorization Bypass:** Risk reduced from **Critical** to **Low**.
*   **Unintended Route Exposure:** Risk reduced from **High** to **Low**.
*   **ReDoS:** Risk reduced from **High** to **Low**.
*   **Information Leakage:** Risk reduced from **Medium** to **Low**.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Robust Request Body Handling (Warp-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/robust_request_body_handling__warp-specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Implement `warp::body::content_length_limit`:** Use `warp::body::content_length_limit()` on *all* routes that accept request bodies.  Set the limit based on your application's requirements.  Example: `warp::body::content_length_limit(1024 * 16) // 16KB limit`.
2.  **Streaming with `warp::body::stream`:** For large bodies or when you don't need the entire body in memory, use `warp::body::stream()` to process the body as a stream of `Bytes`.  This is crucial for file uploads or large data processing.
3.  **Combine with Timeouts (using `tokio::time::timeout`):** Wrap your body handling logic (whether using `warp::body::bytes` or `warp::body::stream`) within a `tokio::time::timeout` to prevent slowloris attacks.  Example:
    ```rust
    use tokio::time::timeout;
    use std::time::Duration;

    // ... inside your filter ...
    .and_then(|body: warp::hyper::Body| async move {
        timeout(Duration::from_secs(30), async {
            // Process the body here (e.g., collect bytes, stream to a file)
            let bytes = warp::hyper::body::to_bytes(body).await?;
            // ...
            Ok::<_, warp::Rejection>(...) // Return a result
        }).await
        .map_err(|_| warp::reject::reject()) // Handle timeout as a rejection
        .and_then(|result| async move { result }) // Flatten the Result
    })
    ```
4. **Test with `warp::test`:** Use `warp::test::request().body(...)` to send large and slowly-delivered request bodies in your tests.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Large Requests:** (Severity: **High**)
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Slowloris Attack:** (Severity: **High**)
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** (Severity: **High**)

**Impact:** (Same as previous, focused on `warp` usage)
*   **DoS (Large Requests):** Risk reduced from **High** to **Low**.
*   **DoS (Slowloris):** Risk reduced from **High** to **Low**.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk reduced from **High** to **Low**.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure WebSocket Handling (Warp-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_websocket_handling__warp-specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Use `warp::ws()`:**  Use `warp::ws()` to define WebSocket endpoints.
2.  **Implement `warp::ws::Ws2::on_upgrade`:** Within the `on_upgrade` callback, handle the established WebSocket connection.
3.  **Message Size Limits (within `on_message`):** Inside the `on_message` callback of your `warp::ws::WebSocket` handler, check the size of incoming messages (`msg.as_bytes().len()`) and reject messages that exceed a predefined limit.
4.  **Authentication/Authorization (before `on_upgrade`):**  Perform authentication and authorization *before* calling `ws.on_upgrade`.  You can use other `warp` filters (e.g., for checking headers, cookies, or tokens) to achieve this.  Reject the connection if authentication/authorization fails.
5.  **Idle Connection Timeouts (using `tokio::time::timeout`):** Wrap your WebSocket message handling logic within `tokio::time::timeout` to close connections that have been idle for too long.  You'll need to track the last message time.
6.  **Origin Validation (using `warp::header`):** Use `warp::header::header("origin")` to get the `Origin` header and validate it against a whitelist *before* upgrading to a WebSocket connection.
7. **Input Validation (within `on_message`):** Thoroughly validate and sanitize *all* data received within the `on_message` callback.  Assume all input is potentially malicious.
8. **Test with `warp::test::ws()`:** Use `warp::test::ws()` to simulate WebSocket clients and test your WebSocket handling logic, including sending large messages, invalid data, and testing authentication/authorization.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Connection Exhaustion:** (Severity: **High**)
*   **Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH):** (Severity: **High**)
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via WebSockets:** (Severity: **Critical**)
*   **Unauthorized Access:** (Severity: **Critical**)
*   **Resource Exhaustion (via large messages):** (Severity: **High**)

**Impact:** (Same as previous, focused on `warp` usage)
*   **DoS (Connection Exhaustion):** Risk reduced from **High** to **Low**.
*   **CSWSH:** Risk reduced from **High** to **Low**.
*   **XSS:** Risk reduced from **Critical** to **Low**.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduced from **Critical** to **Low**.
*   **Resource Exhaustion (large messages):** Risk reduced from **High** to **Low**.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Safe Rejection Handling (Warp-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/safe_rejection_handling__warp-specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Define Standard `warp::reject::Rejection` Types:**  Create custom rejection types using `warp::reject::custom` for specific error conditions in your application. This allows you to handle different types of rejections differently.
2.  **Avoid Information Leakage in `warp::Reply`:** When creating a `warp::Reply` from a `warp::reject::Rejection`, ensure that the HTTP response does not reveal sensitive information. Use generic error messages for client-facing errors.
3.  **Use `recover` to Handle Rejections:** Use `warp::Filter::recover` to handle `warp::reject::Rejection`s and convert them into appropriate `warp::Reply` implementations (e.g., HTTP error responses).
4.  **Custom Rejection Handlers (with `recover`):**  Implement custom rejection handlers using `recover` to customize the way specific rejection types are handled.  Keep these handlers simple and focused on generating the correct HTTP response.
5.  **Test Rejection Handling with `warp::test`:** Use `warp::test::request()` to simulate requests that should be rejected and verify that your rejection handling logic (including custom handlers) works correctly and returns the expected HTTP responses.
6. **Consistent Error Responses:** Ensure that all parts of your application (including different filters) return consistent error responses (using the same custom rejection types and `recover` logic) for the same types of errors.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Information Leakage:** (Severity: **Medium**)
*   **Vulnerabilities in Custom Rejection Handlers:** (Severity: **Variable**, depends on the handler)
* **Inconsistent Error Handling:** (Severity: Low)

**Impact:**
*   **Information Leakage:** Risk reduced from **Medium** to **Low**.
*   **Vulnerabilities in Handlers:** Risk depends on the quality of the handler implementation.
* **Inconsistent Error Handling:** Risk reduced from Low to Negligible.
