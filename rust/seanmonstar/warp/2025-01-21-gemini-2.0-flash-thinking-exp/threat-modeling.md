# Threat Model Analysis for seanmonstar/warp

## Threat: [Path Traversal via `warp::fs::dir` Misuse](./threats/path_traversal_via__warpfsdir__misuse.md)

**Description:** An attacker could craft malicious URLs containing path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to access files outside the intended directory served by `warp::fs::dir`. They might attempt to read sensitive configuration files, source code, or other restricted data.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files on the server, potential information disclosure, and in severe cases, server compromise if exposed files contain credentials or vulnerabilities.

**Affected Warp Component:** `warp::fs::dir`

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Never** serve files from the root directory (`/`) or overly broad directories using `warp::fs::dir`.
*   Always specify the most restrictive possible directory to be served.
*   Consider using `warp::fs::file` to serve individual, pre-defined files instead of entire directories when appropriate.
*   If user input influences the served path, implement robust path sanitization and validation to prevent traversal sequences *before* using it with `warp::fs::dir`.

## Threat: [Route Parameter Injection/Manipulation](./threats/route_parameter_injectionmanipulation.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate route parameters to inject malicious input into application logic. While `warp` parses routes, it doesn't inherently sanitize parameter values. If these parameters are used unsafely (e.g., in database queries, file system operations), it can lead to injection vulnerabilities.

**Impact:**  Depending on the context of parameter usage, impacts can range from data manipulation and unauthorized access to command execution or denial of service.  Specifically, path traversal if used in file paths, SQL injection if used in database queries.

**Affected Warp Component:** `warp::path::param`, `warp::filters::path::param`

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all route parameters *immediately after extraction* from `warp::path::param` and before using them in application logic.
*   Use parameterized queries or ORMs to prevent SQL injection.
*   Use safe file system APIs and avoid constructing file paths directly from user-provided parameters without validation.
*   Apply input validation rules appropriate to the expected data type and format of each parameter.

## Threat: [Complex Filter Logic Errors](./threats/complex_filter_logic_errors.md)

**Description:** An attacker might exploit flaws in complex filter logic, especially in authentication or authorization filters, to bypass security checks. By crafting specific requests that exploit logical errors in filter composition (e.g., incorrect `and`/`or` combinations), they could gain unauthorized access.

**Impact:** Bypass of authentication or authorization, unauthorized access to protected resources or functionality, potential data breaches or system compromise.

**Affected Warp Component:** `warp::Filter` composition (`and`, `or`, `map`, etc.), custom filters

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep filter logic as simple and understandable as possible.
*   Favor clear and modular filter design over overly complex compositions.
*   Thoroughly test filter combinations, especially for security-critical filters like authentication and authorization.
*   Use unit tests to verify the intended behavior of complex filter chains and ensure they cover various scenarios and edge cases.

## Threat: [Outdated `warp` or Dependency Versions](./threats/outdated__warp__or_dependency_versions.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit known vulnerabilities in outdated versions of `warp` or its dependencies. Publicly disclosed vulnerabilities are often targeted by attackers. Running outdated software increases the attack surface.

**Impact:**  Exploitation of known vulnerabilities, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, denial of service, or other security compromises depending on the specific vulnerability.

**Affected Warp Component:** Entire `warp` framework and its dependencies (managed by `Cargo.toml`)

**Risk Severity:** High (if known vulnerabilities exist in outdated versions)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update `warp` and all its dependencies to the latest stable versions.
*   Monitor security advisories for `warp` and its ecosystem (crates.io, RustSec Advisory Database).
*   Use dependency management tools like `cargo audit` to identify and address known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
*   Implement automated dependency update processes where possible.
