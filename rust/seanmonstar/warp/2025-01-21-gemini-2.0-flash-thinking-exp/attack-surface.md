# Attack Surface Analysis for seanmonstar/warp

## Attack Surface: [Route Parameter Path Traversal](./attack_surfaces/route_parameter_path_traversal.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting route parameters to access files or directories outside the intended scope, leading to unauthorized file access or information disclosure.
*   **Warp Contribution:** Warp's routing system, specifically features like `path::param()` and wildcard path segments, can be vulnerable if developers directly use these parameters to construct file paths without proper validation and sanitization. The framework provides the mechanism for parameter extraction, and misuse leads to this vulnerability.
*   **Example:** A Warp route defined as `/files/{filename}` where `filename` is directly used to open a file. An attacker could request `/files/../../etc/passwd` to attempt to read the system's password file, exploiting Warp's parameter handling to bypass intended path restrictions.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, configuration data, source code, or potential remote code execution if combined with other vulnerabilities.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation:** Strictly validate route parameters against a whitelist of allowed characters and patterns *within your Warp route handlers*.
    *   **Path Sanitization:** Use secure path manipulation functions *in your application logic* to normalize and sanitize paths, preventing directory traversal sequences like `../`.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the application process running the Warp server has minimal file system permissions, limiting the impact of successful path traversal. This is a general security practice, but crucial in mitigating the impact of Warp-related path traversal.
    *   **Avoid Direct File Path Construction:** Instead of directly using route parameters in file paths *within your Warp handlers*, use an index or mapping to translate safe identifiers to actual file paths.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Request Body Parsing](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_request_body_parsing.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in deserialization libraries used to parse request bodies (e.g., JSON, Form data), potentially leading to remote code execution, denial of service, or data corruption.
*   **Warp Contribution:** Warp directly provides filters like `warp::body::json()` and `warp::body::form()` which facilitate request body parsing. These filters rely on underlying deserialization libraries (like `serde_json`, `serde_urlencoded`). Vulnerabilities in these libraries, or insecure deserialization practices in application code *using Warp's body filters*, can be exploited. Warp's ease of use for body parsing can inadvertently encourage insecure deserialization if developers are not cautious.
*   **Example:** An application uses `warp::body::json()` to parse JSON request bodies in a Warp route. If the application deserializes untrusted JSON data without validation and the underlying `serde_json` library (or the application's usage of it) has a vulnerability, an attacker could send a malicious JSON payload to trigger code execution *via the Warp endpoint*.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), Data Corruption, Information Disclosure.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Updates:** Keep deserialization libraries and Warp dependencies up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities. This includes ensuring your `Cargo.toml` for your Warp project specifies up-to-date versions of `warp` and related `serde` crates.
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate deserialized data against expected schemas and data types *after using Warp's body filters to parse the request*.
    *   **Safe Deserialization Practices:** Avoid deserializing untrusted data directly into complex objects without validation *in your Warp route handlers*. Consider using safer deserialization options or libraries if available.
    *   **Limit Deserialization Scope:** Only deserialize the necessary parts of the request body and avoid deserializing into overly complex structures if not required *within your Warp application logic*.

## Attack Surface: [Filter Composition Logic Errors](./attack_surfaces/filter_composition_logic_errors.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from incorrect or insecure composition of Warp filters, leading to authorization bypasses, unexpected behavior, or security misconfigurations.
*   **Warp Contribution:** Warp's core strength is its filter composition system.  This powerful feature, if misused or misunderstood, can lead to complex logic errors that create security vulnerabilities. Incorrect filter ordering, flawed filter logic within custom filters, or unintended interactions between Warp-provided and custom filters can create security gaps *directly within the Warp application's routing and request handling*.
*   **Example:** An authorization filter (`warp::filters::auth::basic()`, or a custom one) is intended to protect a route. However, due to incorrect filter composition in Warp, it's placed *after* a filter that handles requests regardless of authorization status. This allows unauthorized requests to reach the route handler, bypassing the intended security control defined using Warp's filter system.
*   **Impact:** Authorization Bypass, Access Control Issues, Security Misconfigurations, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or actions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Filter Audits and Reviews:** Carefully review and audit filter composition logic, especially for security-critical filters like authorization and authentication *in your Warp application*.
    *   **Unit Testing for Filters:** Write unit tests to verify the behavior of individual filters and filter compositions under various conditions, including error cases and edge cases *specifically testing your Warp filter chains*.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege in Filters:** Design filters to have a narrow scope and specific purpose, minimizing potential side effects and interactions *within your Warp filter design*.
    *   **Clear Filter Ordering:** Ensure filter ordering is well-defined and documented, especially for filters that depend on each other *in your Warp route definitions*. Utilize Warp's filter combinators (`and`, `or`, `map`, etc.) carefully to ensure intended logic.

## Attack Surface: [Lack of HTTPS/TLS Enforcement](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_httpstls_enforcement.md)

*   **Description:** Deploying a Warp application without enforcing HTTPS/TLS, leaving communication vulnerable to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   **Warp Contribution:** While Warp *supports* TLS configuration, it does not *enforce* it by default. The responsibility to configure and enable HTTPS rests entirely with the developer using Warp.  Failure to do so, when using Warp to build a web application, directly results in an insecure application deployment. Warp provides the tools (via `Server::tls()` and related methods), but the security outcome depends on the developer's configuration choices within Warp.
*   **Example:** A Warp application is deployed using `warp::serve(routes).run(([0, 0, 0, 0], 80))`. This starts an HTTP server on port 80 without TLS.  Any communication with this Warp application will be in plain text, vulnerable to interception.
*   **Impact:** Man-in-the-Middle Attacks, Eavesdropping, Data Theft, Session Hijacking, compromising confidentiality and integrity of data transmitted to and from the Warp application.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enable HTTPS:** Configure Warp to use HTTPS/TLS by providing certificate and key files using `warp::serve(routes).tls(cert_path, key_path).run(([0, 0, 0, 0], 443))).
    *   **HTTPS Redirection:** Enforce HTTPS redirection from HTTP to HTTPS to ensure all traffic is encrypted. While Warp itself doesn't directly handle redirection, you can implement a Warp filter to redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS, or handle this at a reverse proxy level in front of Warp.
    *   **HSTS Header:** Implement the `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS) header *using Warp's response manipulation capabilities* to instruct browsers to always use HTTPS for the application.
    *   **Secure Deployment Environment:** Ensure the deployment environment (e.g., reverse proxy, load balancer) is also configured to handle HTTPS correctly and terminate TLS if Warp is behind a proxy.
