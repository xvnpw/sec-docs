## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in `tokio` (Runtime) [HIGH RISK PATH, under Dependency Vulnerabilities]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in__tokio___runtime___high_risk_path__under_dependency_vulnerabilities_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploit known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the `tokio` asynchronous runtime that Warp relies on.
*   **Action:** Trigger specific conditions that exploit `tokio` vulnerabilities (if any exist).
*   **Impact:** High - Can lead to complete system compromise, depending on the nature of the vulnerability in the runtime.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Keep `tokio` and Warp updated to the latest versions.
    *   Monitor security advisories for `tokio`.
    *   Implement robust system security practices to limit the impact of runtime vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in `hyper` (HTTP Library) [HIGH RISK PATH, under Dependency Vulnerabilities]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in__hyper___http_library___high_risk_path__under_dependency_vulnerabilities_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploit known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the `hyper` HTTP library used by Warp.
*   **Action:** Trigger specific conditions that exploit `hyper` vulnerabilities (e.g., HTTP/2 vulnerabilities).
*   **Impact:** High - Can lead to various attacks, including DoS, request smuggling, or even remote code execution depending on the vulnerability.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Keep `hyper` and Warp updated.
    *   Monitor security advisories for `hyper`.
    *   Implement robust HTTP request handling and validation in the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in other Warp Dependencies [HIGH RISK PATH, under Dependency Vulnerabilities]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_other_warp_dependencies__high_risk_path__under_dependency_vulnerabilities_07926b2f.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploit vulnerabilities in any other crates that Warp directly or indirectly depends on (transitive dependencies).
*   **Action:** Identify and exploit vulnerabilities in transitive dependencies.
*   **Impact:** Varies (Potentially High) - Impact depends on the vulnerable dependency and how it's used. Could range from data breaches to system compromise.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Regularly audit dependencies using tools like `cargo audit`.
    *   Keep dependencies updated.
    *   Use dependency vulnerability scanning tools in CI/CD pipelines.
    *   Practice principle of least privilege for dependencies - only include necessary dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Weak Cipher Suites [HIGH RISK PATH, under Insecure TLS Configuration]](./attack_tree_paths/weak_cipher_suites__high_risk_path__under_insecure_tls_configuration_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Configure Warp with weak or outdated TLS cipher suites.
*   **Action:** Perform man-in-the-middle attacks to decrypt traffic using weak ciphers.
*   **Impact:** High - Loss of confidentiality, data interception, potential data manipulation.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Use strong and modern TLS cipher suites.
    *   Follow security best practices for TLS configuration (e.g., Mozilla SSL Configuration Generator).
    *   Regularly review and test TLS configuration.

## Attack Tree Path: [Outdated TLS Protocol Versions [HIGH RISK PATH, under Insecure TLS Configuration]](./attack_tree_paths/outdated_tls_protocol_versions__high_risk_path__under_insecure_tls_configuration_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Configure Warp to support outdated TLS versions (e.g., TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1).
*   **Action:** Downgrade attacks to force use of vulnerable TLS versions and exploit known vulnerabilities in those versions.
*   **Impact:** High - Loss of confidentiality, exploitation of known TLS vulnerabilities.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Disable outdated TLS versions and enforce TLS 1.2 or higher.
    *   Regularly review and update TLS protocol settings.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exposed Debug/Admin Endpoints [HIGH RISK PATH, under Exploit Warp Application Misconfiguration]](./attack_tree_paths/exposed_debugadmin_endpoints__high_risk_path__under_exploit_warp_application_misconfiguration_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Unintentionally expose debug or administrative endpoints in production due to misconfiguration.
*   **Action:** Access exposed debug/admin endpoints to gain unauthorized control or information.
*   **Impact:** High - Complete application compromise, data breaches, system control, depending on the functionality of the exposed endpoints.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Ensure debug/admin endpoints are only accessible in development/staging environments.
    *   Use strong authentication and authorization for admin functions, even in non-production environments.
    *   Carefully review routing configurations for production deployments.
    *   Implement network segmentation to isolate admin interfaces.

## Attack Tree Path: [Request Smuggling/Splitting [POTENTIAL HIGH RISK PATH, under Exploit Warp Framework Vulnerabilities]](./attack_tree_paths/request_smugglingsplitting__potential_high_risk_path__under_exploit_warp_framework_vulnerabilities_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploit inconsistencies in request parsing between Warp and upstream servers (if any).
*   **Action:** Craft requests that are interpreted differently by Warp and upstream proxies/servers.
*   **Impact:** High - Can bypass security controls, gain unauthorized access, or cause data corruption.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Ensure consistent HTTP parsing configurations across all components (Warp, proxies, load balancers).
    *   Thoroughly test proxy configurations and request handling logic in complex deployments.
    *   Use modern HTTP/2 where possible, which is less susceptible to smuggling than HTTP/1.1.
