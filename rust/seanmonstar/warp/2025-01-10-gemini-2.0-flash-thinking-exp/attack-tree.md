## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

* This represents the attacker's primary goal of gaining unauthorized access to the application's resources or functionality. Success here signifies a significant security breach.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Routing Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_routing_vulnerabilities__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

* Attackers target weaknesses in how the application defines and handles routes to access restricted resources or trigger unintended actions.
    * Path Traversal [HIGH-RISK PATH]:
      * Attackers manipulate URLs to access files or directories outside of the intended web root, potentially exposing sensitive data or configuration files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Path Traversal [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/path_traversal__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers manipulate URLs to access files or directories outside of the intended web root, potentially exposing sensitive data or configuration files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Header Handling Weaknesses [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_header_handling_weaknesses__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

* Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in how the application processes HTTP headers to inject malicious content or manipulate server behavior.
    * Header Injection [HIGH-RISK PATH]:
      * Attackers insert malicious code or commands into HTTP headers. If these headers are not properly sanitized and are used in backend processing or reflected in responses, it can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), session hijacking, or other vulnerabilities.
    * HTTP Request Smuggling [HIGH-RISK PATH]:
      * Attackers craft ambiguous HTTP requests with conflicting Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding headers. This can cause the server and intermediary proxies to interpret the request boundaries differently, allowing attackers to bypass security controls, route requests to unintended endpoints, or poison the HTTP cache.

## Attack Tree Path: [Header Injection [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/header_injection__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers insert malicious code or commands into HTTP headers. If these headers are not properly sanitized and are used in backend processing or reflected in responses, it can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), session hijacking, or other vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [HTTP Request Smuggling [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/http_request_smuggling__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers craft ambiguous HTTP requests with conflicting Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding headers. This can cause the server and intermediary proxies to interpret the request boundaries differently, allowing attackers to bypass security controls, route requests to unintended endpoints, or poison the HTTP cache.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit WebSocket Vulnerabilities (if used) [CONDITIONAL CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_websocket_vulnerabilities__if_used___conditional_critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

* If the application uses WebSockets, attackers can exploit weaknesses in the WebSocket implementation to compromise the application.
    * Lack of Input Validation on WebSocket Messages [HIGH-RISK PATH]:
      * Attackers send malicious payloads through the WebSocket connection. If the application doesn't properly validate and sanitize these messages, it can lead to application logic errors, data manipulation, or even command injection.
    * Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Underlying WebSocket Library (Tokio-tungstenite) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:
      * Attackers target known security flaws or zero-day vulnerabilities within the `tokio-tungstenite` library, which Warp uses for WebSocket support. Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution or other severe consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [Lack of Input Validation on WebSocket Messages [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/lack_of_input_validation_on_websocket_messages__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers send malicious payloads through the WebSocket connection. If the application doesn't properly validate and sanitize these messages, it can lead to application logic errors, data manipulation, or even command injection.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Underlying WebSocket Library (Tokio-tungstenite) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_underlying_websocket_library__tokio-tungstenite___high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers target known security flaws or zero-day vulnerabilities within the `tokio-tungstenite` library, which Warp uses for WebSocket support. Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution or other severe consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cause Disruption (Denial of Service) [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/cause_disruption__denial_of_service___critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

* Attackers aim to make the application unavailable to legitimate users by overwhelming its resources.
    * Resource Exhaustion [HIGH-RISK PATH]:
      * Attackers consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) to cause performance degradation or complete service failure.
        * Connection Exhaustion [HIGH-RISK PATH]:
          * Attackers open a large number of concurrent connections to the server, exceeding its capacity and preventing legitimate users from connecting.
        * Slowloris Attack [HIGH-RISK PATH]:
          * Attackers send partial HTTP requests slowly, keeping many connections open and consuming server resources without completing the requests.
        * Request Flooding [HIGH-RISK PATH]:
          * Attackers send a high volume of seemingly legitimate requests to overwhelm the server's processing capabilities, making it unable to respond to genuine user requests.

## Attack Tree Path: [Resource Exhaustion [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/resource_exhaustion__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) to cause performance degradation or complete service failure.
        * Connection Exhaustion [HIGH-RISK PATH]:
          * Attackers open a large number of concurrent connections to the server, exceeding its capacity and preventing legitimate users from connecting.

## Attack Tree Path: [Connection Exhaustion [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/connection_exhaustion__high-risk_path_.md)

## Attack Tree Path: [Slowloris Attack [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/slowloris_attack__high-risk_path_.md)

## Attack Tree Path: [Request Flooding [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/request_flooding__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers send a high volume of seemingly legitimate requests to overwhelm the server's processing capabilities, making it unable to respond to genuine user requests.
