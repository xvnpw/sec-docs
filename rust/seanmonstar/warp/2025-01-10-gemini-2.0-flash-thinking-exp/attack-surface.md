# Attack Surface Analysis for seanmonstar/warp

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal via Incorrect Route Definitions](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_via_incorrect_route_definitions.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can access unintended files or resources by manipulating URL paths due to poorly defined routes.
    *   **How Warp Contributes:** `warp`'s routing system relies on developers defining specific path patterns. If these patterns are too broad or contain vulnerabilities (e.g., missing anchors like `/` at the end of a directory route), it can lead to traversal.
    *   **Example:** A route defined as `/files/*` could allow an attacker to access `/files/../../etc/passwd` if the backend doesn't properly sanitize the path.
    *   **Impact:** Access to sensitive data, execution of arbitrary code (if accessible files are scripts), or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Define routes with specific and restrictive patterns.
        *   Use anchors (e.g., `/path/`) to ensure exact matching.
        *   Avoid overly broad wildcard routes if possible.

## Attack Surface: [Large Request Body Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/large_request_body_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Sending excessively large request bodies can exhaust server resources, leading to denial of service.
    *   **How Warp Contributes:** `warp` allows handling request bodies of various sizes. If the application doesn't impose limits, `warp` will attempt to process the entire body, potentially consuming excessive memory or CPU.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a multi-gigabyte file upload to an endpoint that doesn't expect large files, causing the server to crash or become unresponsive.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement request body size limits using `warp::body::content_length_limit`.
        *   Consider using streaming APIs for handling large uploads efficiently.

## Attack Surface: [WebSocket Message Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/websocket_message_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Improper handling of data received through WebSocket messages can lead to various vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Warp Contributes:** `warp` provides the infrastructure for establishing and managing WebSocket connections. However, the application logic responsible for processing incoming messages is where vulnerabilities can occur.
    *   **Example:** An application receives a JSON payload via WebSocket and deserializes it without proper validation, leading to arbitrary code execution if the payload is crafted maliciously.
    *   **Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution, data manipulation, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all data received through WebSocket messages.
        *   Implement appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms for WebSocket connections.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Internal Network via Incorrect Binding](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_internal_network_via_incorrect_binding.md)

*   **Description:** Binding the application to `0.0.0.0` without proper firewall configuration makes it accessible from any network interface.
    *   **How Warp Contributes:** `warp` allows specifying the address to bind to when starting the server. Developers might inadvertently bind to `0.0.0.0` without realizing the security implications.
    *   **Example:** An application intended for internal use is bound to `0.0.0.0` and is accessible from the public internet, exposing internal APIs or data.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to internal resources, data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Bind the application to specific network interfaces (e.g., `127.0.0.1` for local access only or a specific internal IP address).

## Attack Surface: [Lack of TLS/HTTPS Configuration (if handled by Warp directly)](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_tlshttps_configuration__if_handled_by_warp_directly_.md)

*   **Description:**  Running the application over unencrypted HTTP exposes communication to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **How Warp Contributes:** `warp` provides functionalities for handling TLS directly. If this is not configured correctly or disabled, the communication will be unencrypted.
    *   **Example:** User credentials or sensitive data transmitted over an unencrypted HTTP connection are intercepted by an attacker.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, session hijacking, man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always configure TLS/HTTPS for production environments.
        *   Use strong TLS configurations with up-to-date protocols and ciphers.
