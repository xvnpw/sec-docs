# Threat Model Analysis for seanmonstar/warp

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Large Request Headers](./threats/denial_of_service_via_large_request_headers.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service via Large Request Headers
    *   **Description:** An attacker sends HTTP requests with excessively large headers. `warp`'s header parsing logic might consume significant resources (CPU, memory) attempting to process these headers, leading to application slowdown or complete unavailability. The attacker aims to overwhelm the server by exhausting its resources.
    *   **Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive, impacting availability for legitimate users. Server resources may be fully consumed, potentially affecting other services on the same machine.
    *   **Affected Warp Component:** `warp::filters::header` (specifically the header parsing logic within the `Filter` implementation).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure `warp`'s request size limits using `warp::Filter::max_length()` to restrict the total size of the request, including headers.
        *   Implement timeouts for request processing to prevent indefinite resource consumption.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Slowloris Attacks](./threats/denial_of_service_via_slowloris_attacks.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service via Slowloris Attacks
    *   **Description:** An attacker establishes multiple connections to the `warp` application but sends only partial HTTP requests slowly over time, never completing them. This keeps many connections in a pending state, exhausting the server's connection pool and preventing legitimate users from connecting. The attacker aims to tie up server resources by maintaining numerous incomplete connections.
    *   **Impact:**  The application becomes unable to accept new connections, leading to denial of service for legitimate users.
    *   **Affected Warp Component:** `warp::server` (specifically the connection handling and management).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure timeouts for idle connections within `warp` or at the reverse proxy level to close connections that are not actively sending data.
        *   Implement connection limits to restrict the number of concurrent connections from a single IP address.

## Threat: [Route Confusion/Bypass due to Ambiguous Route Definitions](./threats/route_confusionbypass_due_to_ambiguous_route_definitions.md)

*   **Threat:** Route Confusion/Bypass due to Ambiguous Route Definitions
    *   **Description:**  An attacker crafts specific URLs that exploit ambiguities in `warp`'s route matching logic. This allows them to access routes that were intended to be protected or to bypass authentication/authorization checks by matching a different, less restrictive route than intended. The attacker manipulates the URL to trick the router.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality. Bypassing security controls can lead to privilege escalation or data breaches.
    *   **Affected Warp Component:** `warp::filters::path` (the route matching logic within the `path!` macro and related filters).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly test all defined routes, especially those with complex patterns or parameters, to ensure they behave as expected.
        *   Ensure route definitions are unambiguous and do not overlap in unintended ways. Order matters in `warp` route definitions; more specific routes should be defined before more general ones.
        *   Use `warp`'s features for explicitly defining route precedence if necessary.

## Threat: [Path Traversal via Improper Route Parameter Handling](./threats/path_traversal_via_improper_route_parameter_handling.md)

*   **Threat:** Path Traversal via Improper Route Parameter Handling
    *   **Description:** An attacker manipulates route parameters that are used to construct file paths or access resources on the server. If `warp` doesn't properly sanitize or validate these parameters, the attacker can inject path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to access files or directories outside the intended scope.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive files or directories on the server. Potential for arbitrary code execution if uploaded files can be accessed and executed.
    *   **Affected Warp Component:** `warp::filters::path` (specifically how extracted path parameters are handled within route handlers).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly validate and sanitize all route parameters before using them to access files or resources.
        *   Avoid directly using user-provided input to construct file paths.
        *   Use secure file access methods that restrict access to specific directories.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion due to Unbounded Body Size](./threats/resource_exhaustion_due_to_unbounded_body_size.md)

*   **Threat:** Resource Exhaustion due to Unbounded Body Size
    *   **Description:** An attacker sends requests with extremely large bodies without Content-Length limits or if those limits are excessively high. `warp` might attempt to buffer the entire request body in memory, leading to excessive memory consumption and potentially crashing the application.
    *   **Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive or crashes due to memory exhaustion, impacting availability.
    *   **Affected Warp Component:** `warp::filters::body` (specifically the mechanisms for handling request bodies).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure `warp`'s request body size limits using `warp::Filter::max_length()` for `bytes()` or `json()` filters.
        *   Consider using `stream()` to process large bodies in chunks instead of buffering the entire body in memory.
