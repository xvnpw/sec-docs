# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, represented by the GitHub repository `seanmonstar/warp`, provides a web server framework written in Rust. The primary business goal for adopting such a framework is to efficiently and reliably build web applications and services.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Rapid development of web applications: `warp` aims to be easy to use and composable, facilitating faster development cycles.
- High performance and efficiency: Rust is known for its performance, and `warp` leverages this to provide fast and resource-efficient web services.
- Reliability and stability: Rust's memory safety and strong type system contribute to building robust and stable applications.
- Flexibility and customization: `warp` is designed to be composable, allowing developers to tailor it to specific application needs.
- Modern web standards support:  A modern web framework should support current web protocols and standards.

Business Risks:
- Security vulnerabilities in the framework: Like any software, `warp` could contain vulnerabilities that could be exploited in applications built with it.
- Insecure application development: Developers using `warp` might introduce security flaws in their applications if they are not security-conscious or lack sufficient training.
- Dependency vulnerabilities: `warp` relies on other Rust crates (libraries), and vulnerabilities in these dependencies could impact applications using `warp`.
- Operational risks: Misconfiguration or improper deployment of `warp`-based applications can lead to security and availability issues.
- Performance bottlenecks: While `warp` is designed for performance, inefficient application code or resource constraints can still lead to performance problems.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Memory safety provided by Rust language. Rust's memory management system prevents many common memory-related vulnerabilities like buffer overflows and use-after-free errors. Implemented at the language level.
- security control: Type safety provided by Rust language. Rust's strong type system helps catch type-related errors at compile time, reducing the risk of certain types of vulnerabilities. Implemented at the language level.
- security control: HTTPS support. `warp` supports TLS/SSL for secure communication over HTTPS. Described in documentation and examples.
- security control: Input handling and routing. `warp` provides mechanisms for defining routes and handling incoming requests, allowing developers to implement input validation and sanitization. Described in documentation and examples.
- accepted risk: Security of applications built using `warp` is primarily the responsibility of the application developers. The framework provides tools, but secure application design and implementation are crucial.
- accepted risk: Dependency vulnerabilities are managed through crate updates, but timely updates and vulnerability scanning are the responsibility of the application developers.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) for applications built with `warp` as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
- security control: Conduct regular security code reviews of applications built with `warp`.
- security control: Implement dependency vulnerability scanning and management for applications using `warp`.
- security control: Provide security guidelines and best practices documentation specifically for developing secure applications with `warp`.
- security control: Encourage and facilitate community security audits of the `warp` framework itself.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication: Applications built with `warp` will likely need to implement various authentication mechanisms to verify user identities. `warp` should provide flexibility to integrate different authentication strategies (e.g., session-based, token-based, OAuth).
- Authorization: Applications need to control access to resources based on user roles and permissions. `warp` should provide mechanisms to implement authorization logic, potentially through middleware or route guards.
- Input Validation: All external inputs to `warp` applications must be validated to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting). `warp` should facilitate easy input validation and sanitization.
- Cryptography: Applications might need to use cryptography for data encryption, secure communication, and secure storage. `warp` should not hinder the use of cryptographic libraries and should ideally provide utilities for common cryptographic tasks if applicable to a web framework.
- Secure Defaults: `warp` should strive to have secure defaults in its configuration and usage patterns to minimize the risk of misconfiguration leading to vulnerabilities.
- Logging and Monitoring: Applications should log security-relevant events for auditing and monitoring purposes. `warp` should integrate well with logging frameworks and provide mechanisms to log request details and security events.
- Error Handling: Error handling should be implemented securely to avoid leaking sensitive information in error messages. `warp` should encourage secure error handling practices.
- Protection against common web attacks: `warp` and applications built on it should be protected against common web attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and others.

```

Build Process Description:

1. Developer (DEV) writes code and commits it to a version control system (e.g., GitHub).
2. Code commit triggers the CI/CD pipeline, which starts a Build Container (BC) in GitHub Actions.
3. Build Container (BC) performs the following steps:
    - Static Application Security Testing (SAST): SAST Scanner analyzes the source code for potential security vulnerabilities.
    - Linting: Linter checks the code for code quality and style issues.
    - Automated Tests: Automated tests (unit, integration, etc.) are executed to ensure code functionality and catch regressions.
    - Container Image Build (IMG_BUILD): A Docker container image for the application is built.
    - Container Image Scanning (IMG_SCAN): The container image is scanned for vulnerabilities using a container image scanner.
4. Build artifacts (e.g., binaries, container images) are pushed to a Container Registry (REG).
5. Results from SAST, Linter, and Tests are collected and reported.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- Providing web application functionality to users. This includes all features and services offered by the `warp`-based application. Disruption or compromise of this process would directly impact users and business operations.
- Data storage and retrieval. The application relies on the database system to store and retrieve critical data. Data loss, corruption, or unauthorized access would have significant business impact.
- External API integrations. If the application relies on external APIs for core functionality, the availability and security of these integrations are critical.

Data Sensitivity:
- The sensitivity of data depends on the specific application built with `warp`. However, common types of data in web applications and their potential sensitivity levels include:
    - User credentials (usernames, passwords, API keys): Confidential. Requires strong protection to prevent unauthorized access.
    - Personal Identifiable Information (PII) (names, addresses, emails, etc.): Confidential or Private. Requires protection to comply with privacy regulations and maintain user trust.
    - Application data (business-specific data): Sensitivity varies depending on the nature of the business and data. Could be Public, Internal, Confidential, or Restricted.
    - Session data: Potentially Confidential. May contain session identifiers or temporary user data that needs to be protected during the session.
    - Logs and audit trails: Internal. Important for security monitoring and incident response, needs to be protected from unauthorized access and tampering.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What type of application will be built using `warp`? (e.g., e-commerce, API service, content management system). This will help to refine the business posture and security requirements.
- What are the specific data types and sensitivity levels that the application will handle? This is crucial for data protection and risk assessment.
- What are the compliance requirements for the application (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS)? Compliance requirements will dictate specific security controls.

- The development team has some familiarity with Rust and web application development principles.
- Security is a relevant concern for the application being built, and the organization is willing to invest in security controls.
