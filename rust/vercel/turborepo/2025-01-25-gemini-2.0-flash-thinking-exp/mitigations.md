## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Granular Access Control for Monorepo Structure using `CODEOWNERS`](./mitigation_strategies/implement_granular_access_control_for_monorepo_structure_using__codeowners_.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Implement Granular Access Control for Monorepo Structure using `CODEOWNERS`

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Identify distinct applications and packages within your Turborepo monorepo and the teams responsible for each.
    *   Step 2: Create a `CODEOWNERS` file at the root of your repository, which Turborepo operates within.
    *   Step 3: Define rules in `CODEOWNERS` to assign code ownership for specific directories representing applications/packages managed by Turborepo workspaces. For example:
        ```
        /apps/frontend/  @frontend-team
        /packages/ui-components/ @ui-team
        * @default-team
        ```
    *   Step 4: Configure branch protection rules in your Git repository hosting platform for main branches, enforcing code reviews and approvals from code owners defined in `CODEOWNERS` before merging changes within the Turborepo.
    *   Step 5: Regularly review and update `CODEOWNERS` as your Turborepo project evolves, ensuring access control aligns with team responsibilities within the monorepo.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Code Changes within the Turborepo: Severity: High
    *   Accidental Introduction of Vulnerabilities in Turborepo managed code by Untrained Personnel: Severity: Medium
    *   Malicious Insider Threats targeting specific applications/packages within the Turborepo (Reduced Scope): Severity: Medium

*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Code Changes within the Turborepo: High (Significantly reduces risk by requiring approvals for changes within the monorepo)
    *   Accidental Introduction of Vulnerabilities in Turborepo managed code by Untrained Personnel: Medium (Reduces risk by adding a review layer for code within the monorepo)
    *   Malicious Insider Threats targeting specific applications/packages within the Turborepo (Reduced Scope): Medium (Limits potential damage by restricting access within the monorepo)

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partial - Branch protection is implemented on `main` branch requiring reviews. `CODEOWNERS` file exists but is not fully utilized for granular package ownership within the Turborepo structure.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Full implementation of `CODEOWNERS` for all applications and packages managed by Turborepo, enforcement of `CODEOWNERS` based reviews for all relevant branches within the Turborepo context, and regular audits of access control configurations for the monorepo.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Dependency Scoping and Boundaries using Turborepo Workspaces](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_dependency_scoping_and_boundaries_using_turborepo_workspaces.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Enforce Dependency Scoping and Boundaries using Turborepo Workspaces

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Leverage Turborepo's workspace awareness, which relies on package manager workspaces (npm, yarn, pnpm), to manage dependencies within the monorepo. Ensure workspaces are correctly configured in the root `package.json` for Turborepo to recognize.
    *   Step 2: Define clear boundaries between applications and packages within your Turborepo setup. Minimize unnecessary cross-dependencies between workspaces.
    *   Step 3: When adding dependencies, use workspace-aware commands (e.g., `npm install package-name -w workspace-name`) to explicitly install them within the specific Turborepo workspace that requires them.
    *   Step 4: Integrate linters and dependency analysis tools into your CI/CD pipeline to detect and prevent unintended or circular dependencies between Turborepo workspaces.
    *   Step 5: Regularly review and refactor code within your Turborepo to minimize cross-workspace dependencies, maintaining clear module boundaries that Turborepo can effectively manage.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Dependency Confusion Attacks (Internal to Turborepo Monorepo): Severity: Medium
    *   Accidental Exposure of Internal APIs/Functionality between Turborepo workspaces: Severity: Medium
    *   Increased Attack Surface within the Turborepo due to Unnecessary Dependencies: Severity: Low

*   **Impact:**
    *   Dependency Confusion Attacks (Internal to Turborepo Monorepo): Medium (Reduces risk by controlling dependency resolution within the monorepo managed by Turborepo)
    *   Accidental Exposure of Internal APIs/Functionality between Turborepo workspaces: Medium (Reduces risk by enforcing boundaries between workspaces managed by Turborepo)
    *   Increased Attack Surface within the Turborepo due to Unnecessary Dependencies: Low (Slightly reduces risk by minimizing dependencies within the Turborepo project)

*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes - Yarn workspaces are configured and used for dependency management within Turborepo. Basic dependency checks are in place.

*   **Missing Implementation:** More rigorous dependency analysis and enforcement in CI/CD for Turborepo workspaces, automated checks for circular dependencies between workspaces, and proactive refactoring to minimize cross-workspace dependencies within the Turborepo project.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Cache Integrity Verification for Turborepo's Cache using Hashing](./mitigation_strategies/implement_cache_integrity_verification_for_turborepo's_cache_using_hashing.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Implement Cache Integrity Verification for Turborepo's Cache using Hashing

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Extend Turborepo's build process to generate cryptographic hashes (e.g., SHA256) of build outputs (artifacts) that Turborepo intends to cache.
    *   Step 2: Store these hashes alongside the cached artifacts in both Turborepo's local and remote caches.
    *   Step 3: Before Turborepo reuses a cached artifact, retrieve the stored hash associated with it.
    *   Step 4: Recalculate the hash of the retrieved cached artifact from Turborepo's cache.
    *   Step 5: Compare the recalculated hash with the stored hash. Turborepo should only use the cached artifact if the hashes match, confirming integrity.
    *   Step 6: If hashes don't match, Turborepo should invalidate the cache entry and trigger a rebuild.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cache Poisoning of Turborepo's Local and Remote Cache: Severity: High
    *   Tampering with Cached Artifacts in Turborepo's Cache: Severity: High

*   **Impact:**
    *   Cache Poisoning of Turborepo's Local and Remote Cache: High (Significantly reduces risk of cache poisoning in Turborepo's caching mechanism)
    *   Tampering with Cached Artifacts in Turborepo's Cache: High (Significantly reduces risk of using tampered artifacts from Turborepo's cache)

*   **Currently Implemented:** No - Cache integrity verification using hashing is not currently implemented in our Turborepo setup. Turborepo relies on file timestamps and content hashes for basic invalidation but not explicit integrity checks with stored hashes.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Integration of hashing into Turborepo's build pipeline, storage of hashes with cached artifacts in Turborepo's cache, and implementation of hash verification logic before cache reuse by Turborepo in both local and remote caching mechanisms.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Access Control to Turborepo's Cache with Authentication and Authorization](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_access_control_to_turborepo's_cache_with_authentication_and_authorization.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Restrict Access Control to Turborepo's Cache with Authentication and Authorization

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: For Turborepo's local cache, ensure file system permissions are properly configured to restrict access to the cache directory to only authorized users (e.g., developers' accounts, build agents running Turborepo).
    *   Step 2: For Turborepo's remote cache, implement strong authentication mechanisms. If using cloud storage for Turborepo's remote cache, utilize IAM roles or access keys with least privilege. If using a dedicated remote cache service for Turborepo, leverage its authentication features.
    *   Step 3: Implement authorization policies to control who can read from and write to Turborepo's remote cache. Ideally, only authorized build pipelines running Turborepo should be able to write, while developers and build pipelines can read.
    *   Step 4: Regularly review and audit access control configurations for both local and remote caches used by Turborepo.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to Cached Artifacts in Turborepo's Cache (Data Leakage): Severity: Medium
    *   Cache Poisoning of Turborepo's Cache by Unauthorized Users: Severity: High

*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to Cached Artifacts in Turborepo's Cache (Data Leakage): Medium (Reduces risk by limiting access to Turborepo's cache)
    *   Cache Poisoning of Turborepo's Cache by Unauthorized Users: High (Significantly reduces risk by preventing unauthorized writes to Turborepo's cache)

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partial - Local cache access is implicitly controlled by file system permissions. Remote cache (using cloud storage) for Turborepo uses basic access keys, but fine-grained authorization policies are not fully implemented for Turborepo's cache access.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Implementation of fine-grained authorization policies for remote cache access used by Turborepo, potentially using IAM policies or dedicated cache service features. Regular audits of access control configurations for Turborepo's cache.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Scan Turborepo's Cache Content for Vulnerabilities](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_scan_turborepo's_cache_content_for_vulnerabilities.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Regularly Scan Turborepo's Cache Content for Vulnerabilities

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Integrate vulnerability scanning tools into the CI/CD pipeline that interacts with Turborepo.
    *   Step 2: Configure the vulnerability scanner to specifically scan the contents of Turborepo's cache directory (both local and remote) on a regular schedule.
    *   Step 3: Define policies for vulnerability severity thresholds relevant to your Turborepo project.
    *   Step 4: If vulnerabilities exceeding the defined thresholds are detected in Turborepo's cache, trigger alerts and invalidate the affected cache entries within Turborepo.
    *   Step 5: Investigate and remediate the root cause of the vulnerabilities that ended up in Turborepo's cache.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Distribution of Vulnerable Artifacts from Turborepo's Cache: Severity: High
    *   Supply Chain Attacks via Compromised Dependencies cached by Turborepo: Severity: High

*   **Impact:**
    *   Distribution of Vulnerable Artifacts from Turborepo's Cache: High (Significantly reduces risk by detecting vulnerabilities in Turborepo's cache)
    *   Supply Chain Attacks via Compromised Dependencies cached by Turborepo: High (Significantly reduces risk by detecting vulnerabilities originating from dependencies cached by Turborepo)

*   **Currently Implemented:** No - Vulnerability scanning of Turborepo's cache content is not currently implemented. Vulnerability scanning is performed on built artifacts before deployment, but not specifically targeting Turborepo's cache.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Integration of vulnerability scanning tools to specifically target Turborepo's cache directory in the CI/CD pipeline, configuration of scanning schedules and vulnerability thresholds for Turborepo's cache, and automated cache invalidation within Turborepo upon vulnerability detection in the cache.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Design Idempotent Build Scripts for Turborepo's Parallel Execution](./mitigation_strategies/design_idempotent_build_scripts_for_turborepo's_parallel_execution.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Design Idempotent Build Scripts for Turborepo's Parallel Execution

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Review all build scripts used by Turborepo (defined in `package.json` scripts and potentially custom scripts invoked by Turborepo tasks).
    *   Step 2: Ensure that each build script is idempotent, crucial for Turborepo's parallel task execution and caching. Running a script multiple times or in parallel should produce the same result as running it once within Turborepo's orchestration.
    *   Step 3: Avoid side effects in build scripts that depend on the order of execution or previous runs, which can be problematic with Turborepo's parallel execution.
    *   Step 4: Utilize tools and techniques that promote idempotency, ensuring reliable builds within Turborepo's environment.
    *   Step 5: Test build scripts thoroughly in parallel execution scenarios, mimicking Turborepo's behavior, to identify and fix any non-idempotent behavior that could lead to issues in Turborepo.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Inconsistent Builds due to Turborepo's Parallel Execution: Severity: Medium
    *   Race Conditions in Build Process exposed by Turborepo's concurrency: Severity: Medium
    *   Unpredictable Build Outcomes when using Turborepo: Severity: Medium

*   **Impact:**
    *   Inconsistent Builds due to Turborepo's Parallel Execution: Medium (Reduces risk of inconsistencies arising from Turborepo's parallel task execution)
    *   Race Conditions in Build Process exposed by Turborepo's concurrency: Medium (Reduces risk of race conditions becoming apparent due to Turborepo's parallel processing)
    *   Unpredictable Build Outcomes when using Turborepo: Medium (Reduces risk of unpredictable builds in a Turborepo managed project)

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partial - Build scripts are generally designed to be idempotent, but explicit testing for idempotency in parallel execution scenarios, as orchestrated by Turborepo, is not consistently performed.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Formalized testing procedures for build script idempotency, especially under parallel execution conditions as managed by Turborepo. Integration of idempotency checks into CI/CD pipeline for Turborepo projects.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Remote Cache Infrastructure for Turborepo (HTTPS, Authentication, Updates)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_remote_cache_infrastructure_for_turborepo__https__authentication__updates_.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Secure Remote Cache Infrastructure for Turborepo (HTTPS, Authentication, Updates)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Ensure the remote cache infrastructure used by Turborepo is configured to use HTTPS for all communication to encrypt data in transit between Turborepo and the remote cache.
    *   Step 2: Implement strong authentication for accessing the remote cache used by Turborepo. Avoid weak authentication methods. Use API keys, tokens, or IAM roles as appropriate for Turborepo's remote cache access.
    *   Step 3: Keep the underlying infrastructure and software components of Turborepo's remote cache up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    *   Step 4: Implement monitoring and logging for Turborepo's remote cache infrastructure to detect and respond to suspicious activity related to Turborepo's caching.
    *   Step 5: Conduct periodic security audits and penetration testing of Turborepo's remote cache infrastructure.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Data Breach of Cached Artifacts in Transit to/from Turborepo's Remote Cache: Severity: High
    *   Unauthorized Access to Turborepo's Remote Cache Infrastructure: Severity: High
    *   Vulnerabilities in Turborepo's Remote Cache Infrastructure: Severity: High

*   **Impact:**
    *   Data Breach of Cached Artifacts in Transit to/from Turborepo's Remote Cache: High (Significantly reduces risk by encrypting communication with Turborepo's remote cache)
    *   Unauthorized Access to Turborepo's Remote Cache Infrastructure: High (Significantly reduces risk by securing access to Turborepo's remote cache)
    *   Vulnerabilities in Turborepo's Remote Cache Infrastructure: High (Significantly reduces risk by maintaining secure infrastructure for Turborepo's remote cache)

*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes - Remote cache (cloud storage) used by Turborepo uses HTTPS. Basic authentication is in place. Infrastructure updates are generally performed but might not be consistently prioritized for security patches specifically for Turborepo's cache infrastructure.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Formalized process for security patching and updates for Turborepo's remote cache infrastructure, implementation of comprehensive monitoring and logging, and periodic security audits/penetration testing of Turborepo's remote cache.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Version Control and Audit Turborepo Pipeline Configuration (`turbo.json`) Changes](./mitigation_strategies/version_control_and_audit_turborepo_pipeline_configuration___turbo_json___changes.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Version Control and Audit Turborepo Pipeline Configuration (`turbo.json`) Changes

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Ensure `turbo.json`, the core configuration for Turborepo's pipeline, is under version control (Git).
    *   Step 2: Treat changes to `turbo.json` with the same level of scrutiny as code changes within your Turborepo project. Require code reviews for all modifications to `turbo.json`.
    *   Step 3: Implement auditing of changes to `turbo.json`. Track who made changes, when, and what was changed in Turborepo's pipeline configuration.
    *   Step 4: Use branching strategies and pull requests for managing changes to `turbo.json`, similar to code development workflows in your Turborepo project.
    *   Step 5: Regularly review the `turbo.json` configuration to ensure it aligns with security best practices and project requirements for your Turborepo setup.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Accidental Misconfiguration of Turborepo's Build Pipeline: Severity: Medium
    *   Malicious Modification of Turborepo's Build Pipeline: Severity: High
    *   Lack of Traceability for Turborepo Pipeline Changes: Severity: Low

*   **Impact:**
    *   Accidental Misconfiguration of Turborepo's Build Pipeline: Medium (Reduces risk by adding review process for Turborepo's configuration)
    *   Malicious Modification of Turborepo's Build Pipeline: High (Significantly reduces risk by adding review and audit for Turborepo's configuration)
    *   Lack of Traceability for Turborepo Pipeline Changes: Low (Improves traceability for investigations related to Turborepo's pipeline)

*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes - `turbo.json` is version controlled. Code reviews are generally required for changes, including `turbo.json` within the Turborepo project.

*   **Missing Implementation:** More formal audit logging of `turbo.json` changes beyond Git history in the context of Turborepo. Potentially stricter review process specifically focused on security implications of `turbo.json` modifications for the Turborepo pipeline.
