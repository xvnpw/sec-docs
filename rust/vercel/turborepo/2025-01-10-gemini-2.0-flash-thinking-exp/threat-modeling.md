# Threat Model Analysis for vercel/turborepo

## Threat: [Remote Cache Poisoning](./threats/remote_cache_poisoning.md)

**Threat:** Remote Cache Poisoning

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises the remote cache storage (configured and used by Turborepo). They upload malicious build artifacts. When other developers or CI/CD pipelines use Turborepo to pull artifacts from this compromised cache, they will incorporate the malicious code into their builds.
*   **Impact:**  This can lead to widespread compromise across the development team and potentially production deployments. Any build process relying on the poisoned remote cache will incorporate the malicious code, making it a critical supply chain vulnerability directly facilitated by Turborepo's caching mechanism.
*   **Affected Component:** Remote Cache Storage (as configured and utilized by Turborepo).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for accessing the remote cache storage used by Turborepo.
    *   Utilize features like signed URLs or access tokens with limited scope and expiration for accessing the remote cache configured within Turborepo.
    *   Implement integrity checks (e.g., checksums or cryptographic signatures) on cached artifacts before Turborepo uses them in builds.
    *   Regularly audit access logs for the remote cache to detect suspicious activity related to Turborepo's interactions.
    *   Consider using a dedicated, secure remote caching service with built-in security features specifically designed for build artifact integrity.

## Threat: [Malicious Task Execution via Compromised Configuration](./threats/malicious_task_execution_via_compromised_configuration.md)

**Threat:** Malicious Task Execution via Compromised Configuration

*   **Description:** An attacker who gains write access to the `turbo.json` file (Turborepo's configuration) can modify the task definitions or execution commands to include malicious scripts or commands. When Turborepo executes these tasks as part of the build process, the malicious code will be run by the Turborepo task runner.
*   **Impact:**  This could lead to various malicious activities, including data exfiltration, installation of backdoors, or denial-of-service attacks on the build infrastructure directly orchestrated by Turborepo. The impact depends on the permissions of the user or process executing the Turborepo tasks.
*   **Affected Component:** Task Runner (within Turborepo), `turbo.json` configuration file.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Treat `turbo.json` as configuration-as-code and apply version control and code review processes to all changes made to this Turborepo configuration file.
    *   Restrict write access to `turbo.json` to authorized personnel only within the development workflow.
    *   Implement checks and validations on the commands and scripts defined in `turbo.json` to prevent the introduction of malicious code into Turborepo's task definitions.
    *   Run Turborepo tasks with the principle of least privilege to limit the potential damage from malicious scripts executed by Turborepo.
