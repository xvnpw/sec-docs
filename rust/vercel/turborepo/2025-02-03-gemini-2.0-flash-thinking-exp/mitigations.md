# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for vercel/turborepo

## Mitigation Strategy: [Cache Integrity Verification](./mitigation_strategies/cache_integrity_verification.md)

### 1. Cache Integrity Verification

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Cache Integrity Verification
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Hashing Cached Outputs:** Implement a mechanism to generate cryptographic hashes (e.g., SHA256) of build outputs before they are stored in the Turborepo cache.
    2.  **Store Hashes with Cache Entries:** Store these hashes alongside the cached build outputs within Turborepo's cache storage.
    3.  **Verify Hashes on Cache Retrieval:** When Turborepo retrieves cached outputs, recalculate the hash of the retrieved data and compare it to the stored hash.
    4.  **Invalidate Cache on Mismatch:** If the hashes don't match, instruct Turborepo to invalidate the cache entry and rebuild the artifact, preventing the use of potentially corrupted data.
    5.  **Explore Turborepo Configuration/Plugins:** Investigate if Turborepo offers built-in configuration options or plugin capabilities to facilitate cache integrity checks. If not, consider developing a custom solution or plugin to extend Turborepo's caching mechanism.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cache Poisoning (Medium Severity):**  Malicious actors or accidental errors could lead to corrupted or malicious build outputs being stored in Turborepo's cache and reused in subsequent builds, compromising application integrity and potentially introducing vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cache Poisoning (Medium Risk Reduction):**  Significantly reduces the risk by detecting and preventing the use of tampered or corrupted cached artifacts managed by Turborepo.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No, we are currently relying on Turborepo's default caching mechanism without explicit integrity verification.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to research and implement cache integrity verification specifically for Turborepo's caching, potentially by extending Turborepo's functionality or using external caching solutions with built-in integrity checks that can integrate with Turborepo.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Access Control for Cache Storage](./mitigation_strategies/access_control_for_cache_storage.md)

### 2. Access Control for Cache Storage

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Access Control for Cache Storage
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Turborepo Cache Location:** Determine where Turborepo stores its cache (local filesystem, remote storage like S3, or a custom location).
    2.  **Implement Access Controls:** Configure access controls on the Turborepo cache storage location to restrict access to only authorized build processes and personnel.
        *   **Local Filesystem Cache:** Set appropriate file system permissions on the directory Turborepo uses for local caching.
        *   **Remote Cache (e.g., S3):** Utilize IAM roles, access policies, or similar mechanisms provided by the cloud storage provider to control access to the remote cache bucket used by Turborepo. Ensure only authorized build pipelines and administrators have access.
    3.  **Regularly Review Permissions:** Periodically review and audit access control configurations for Turborepo's cache storage to ensure they remain appropriate and secure.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Cache (Low Severity):**  Unauthorized users or processes could potentially access Turborepo's cached data. While the direct security impact might be low, it could lead to information disclosure or potential manipulation of the cache in less obvious ways.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Cache (Low Risk Reduction):**  Reduces the risk of unauthorized access to Turborepo's cache, limiting potential information disclosure or subtle cache manipulation attempts.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We have basic filesystem permissions on local caches, but remote cache access control (if using remote caching) is not fully configured and enforced specifically for Turborepo's usage.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to implement robust access control specifically for Turborepo's remote cache storage (if used) and regularly audit permissions for both local and remote caches in the context of Turborepo's operation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Remote Caching Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/secure_remote_caching_configuration.md)

### 3. Secure Remote Caching Configuration

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Remote Caching Configuration
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enforce HTTPS for Remote Cache:** Ensure that Turborepo's communication with the remote cache service is always configured to use HTTPS. This encrypts data in transit, protecting against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. Verify Turborepo's configuration options enforce HTTPS for remote cache URLs.
    2.  **Strong Authentication and Authorization:** Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for Turborepo to access the remote cache. Utilize API keys, tokens, IAM roles, or similar secure methods supported by the remote cache service and configurable within Turborepo. Avoid relying on weak or default credentials.
    3.  **Least Privilege for Cache Access:** Configure authentication and authorization to grant Turborepo's build processes only the minimum necessary permissions to interact with the remote cache (e.g., read and write access to specific buckets or namespaces, but not administrative privileges).
    4.  **Encryption at Rest (Optional but Recommended):** Consider enabling encryption at rest for sensitive data stored in the remote cache. This is a feature of the remote cache service itself, but ensure it's enabled for the storage used by Turborepo.
    5.  **Regular Security Audits of Remote Cache Setup:** Conduct regular security audits specifically focused on Turborepo's remote caching configuration and the security of the remote cache service itself.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Cache Communication (Medium Severity):**  Attackers intercepting communication between Turborepo and the remote cache could potentially steal or manipulate cached data being transferred.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Remote Cache (Medium Severity):**  Unauthorized users or processes could gain access to the remote cache if Turborepo's authentication and authorization are weak or misconfigured, potentially leading to data breaches or cache manipulation.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Cache Communication (Medium Risk Reduction):**  HTTPS encryption effectively mitigates this threat for Turborepo's remote cache communication.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Remote Cache (Medium Risk Reduction):**  Strong authentication and authorization configured for Turborepo significantly reduce this risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, we are using HTTPS for remote cache communication and basic API key authentication for Turborepo's remote cache access.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to strengthen authentication mechanisms for Turborepo's remote cache access (consider IAM roles for more robust security), explore encryption at rest for the remote cache storage used by Turborepo, and perform regular security audits specifically of Turborepo's remote caching setup.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Security Audits of Monorepo Configuration (Including Turborepo)](./mitigation_strategies/regular_security_audits_of_monorepo_configuration__including_turborepo_.md)

### 4. Regular Security Audits of Monorepo Configuration (Including Turborepo)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regular Security Audits of Monorepo Configuration (Including Turborepo)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Schedule Regular Audits:** Establish a schedule for regular security audits of your entire monorepo configuration, with a specific focus on Turborepo configurations (e.g., quarterly or bi-annually).
    2.  **Turborepo Audit Scope:**  Specifically include Turborepo related configurations in the audit scope:
        *   `turbo.json` configuration file: Review task definitions, caching settings, pipeline configurations, and any custom scripts or tooling integrations defined within `turbo.json`.
        *   `package.json` scripts: Audit scripts used by Turborepo tasks for potential security vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
        *   Remote cache configuration: Review settings for remote caching, authentication, authorization, and data encryption used by Turborepo.
        *   Turborepo plugins or custom extensions: If using any Turborepo plugins or custom extensions, audit their security implications and configurations.
    3.  **Security Expert Review:** Involve security experts who are familiar with Turborepo and monorepo security best practices in the audit process to review configurations and identify potential vulnerabilities specific to Turborepo usage.
    4.  **Remediation Plan:** Develop and implement a remediation plan to address any Turborepo-specific security issues identified during the audit.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Misconfigurations Leading to Turborepo Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):**  Detects and corrects misconfigurations specifically in Turborepo setup or tooling that could introduce security vulnerabilities related to build processes, caching mechanisms, or task orchestration within the monorepo.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Misconfigurations Leading to Turborepo Vulnerabilities (Medium Risk Reduction):**  Proactive audits focused on Turborepo help identify and fix potential security weaknesses arising from its configuration before they can be exploited, improving the overall security of the build pipeline and monorepo.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No, we do not currently have a formal schedule for security audits that specifically include a detailed review of our Turborepo configuration.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to establish a regular security audit schedule and process that explicitly includes a thorough review of Turborepo configurations, involving security experts with Turborepo knowledge.
