# Attack Surface Analysis for vercel/turborepo

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Remote Cache Server](./attack_surfaces/compromised_remote_cache_server.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious actor gains control of the remote cache server used by Turborepo.
*   **Turborepo Contribution:** Turborepo's core functionality relies on remote caching to speed up builds, creating a dependency on external infrastructure.
*   **Example:** An attacker compromises a self-hosted remote cache server and injects backdoors into cached build artifacts for commonly used internal libraries. Developers using Turborepo unknowingly pull these compromised artifacts, integrating malware into their projects.
*   **Impact:** Supply chain attack, widespread malware distribution, compromise of developer and production environments.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Remote Cache Infrastructure:** Implement strong access controls, regular security audits, and intrusion detection for remote cache servers.
    *   **Use HTTPS and Strong TLS:** Enforce HTTPS with strong TLS configurations for all communication with the remote cache.
    *   **Implement Content Integrity Checks:** Utilize cryptographic hashing to verify the integrity of cached artifacts before use.
    *   **Regular Security Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the remote cache infrastructure for suspicious activity.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Communication with Remote Cache](./attack_surfaces/insecure_communication_with_remote_cache.md)

*   **Description:** Communication between Turborepo clients and the remote cache server is not properly secured, enabling Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.
*   **Turborepo Contribution:** Turborepo's remote caching feature necessitates network communication, creating a vulnerability if not properly secured.
*   **Example:** A developer on a public Wi-Fi network uses Turborepo. An attacker performs a MITM attack, intercepts communication, and injects malicious cached artifacts during transit, compromising the developer's build process.
*   **Impact:** Supply chain attack, malicious code injection, potential compromise of developer machines.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enforce HTTPS for Remote Cache Communication:** Always use HTTPS for remote cache communication and ensure Turborepo configuration enforces it.
    *   **Use Strong TLS Configurations:** Configure both client and server for strong TLS versions and cipher suites.
    *   **Utilize VPNs for Untrusted Networks:** Developers should use VPNs on untrusted networks to encrypt traffic and secure remote cache communication.

## Attack Surface: [Insufficient Access Controls on Remote Cache](./attack_surfaces/insufficient_access_controls_on_remote_cache.md)

*   **Description:** Weak access controls on the remote cache server allow unauthorized users to read or write cached artifacts.
*   **Turborepo Contribution:** Turborepo's remote cache requires access control to restrict interaction to authorized users and systems.
*   **Example:** A self-hosted remote cache server uses default credentials. An attacker gains access, reads sensitive cached artifacts (potentially code or secrets), or injects malicious artifacts.
*   **Impact:** Data leakage, unauthorized access to sensitive information, supply chain attack via malicious artifact injection.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement Robust Authentication and Authorization:** Enforce strong authentication (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0) and role-based access control (RBAC) for the remote cache.
    *   **Regularly Review and Audit Access Controls:** Periodically review and audit access control configurations.
    *   **Secure Credential Management:** Properly manage and rotate credentials for remote cache access, avoiding hardcoding.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection Vulnerabilities in Task Definitions](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_vulnerabilities_in_task_definitions.md)

*   **Description:** Task definitions in `turbo.json` or scripts executed by Turborepo are vulnerable to command injection due to insecure handling of dynamic inputs.
*   **Turborepo Contribution:** Turborepo uses `turbo.json` to define tasks involving shell command execution. Unsafe dynamic command construction introduces injection risks.
*   **Example:** A `turbo.json` task uses an unsanitized environment variable to construct a shell command. An attacker manipulates this variable to inject arbitrary commands executed by Turborepo during the build.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the build environment, compromise of build server and application artifacts.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Sanitization and Validation:** Sanitize and validate all dynamic inputs used in task definitions and scripts before shell command execution.
    *   **Avoid Dynamic Command Construction:** Minimize dynamic command construction. Use parameterized commands or safer alternatives to shell execution.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Script Execution:** Run scripts with minimal necessary privileges.
    *   **Code Reviews for Task Definitions:** Conduct security-focused code reviews of `turbo.json` and related scripts.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Secrets in `turbo.json` or Configuration Files](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_secrets_in__turbo_json__or_configuration_files.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information (API keys, credentials) is exposed by being directly embedded in `turbo.json` or other Turborepo configuration files.
*   **Turborepo Contribution:** Turborepo uses configuration files like `turbo.json`, which can inadvertently become repositories for secrets if not managed carefully.
*   **Example:** Developers hardcode API keys in `turbo.json` or environment variable configuration files, which are then committed to version control, potentially exposing secrets publicly.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access to protected services, financial loss, reputational damage.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Utilize Environment Variables:** Store secrets as environment variables instead of hardcoding them in configuration files.
    *   **Implement Secret Management Tools:** Use dedicated secret management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) for secure secret storage and access.
    *   **Avoid Committing Secrets to Version Control:** Never commit secrets to version control. Use `.gitignore` to exclude files containing secrets.
    *   **Regularly Scan for Exposed Secrets:** Implement automated scanning for accidentally committed secrets and revoke/rotate them if found.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Turborepo Core or Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_turborepo_core_or_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities are discovered in the Turborepo core codebase or its dependencies.
*   **Turborepo Contribution:** Like any software, Turborepo is susceptible to vulnerabilities in its code or third-party libraries.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability in a dependency used by Turborepo for configuration parsing is exploited via a malicious `turbo.json` file, leading to Remote Code Execution.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), Remote Code Execution (RCE), build process compromise, potential supply chain implications.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Turborepo and Dependencies Updated:** Regularly update Turborepo and its dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Subscribe to security advisories for Turborepo and its ecosystem.
    *   **Perform Security Audits:** Conduct periodic security audits and penetration testing of Turborepo projects.
    *   **Use Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST):** Integrate SAST tools into the development pipeline for automated vulnerability scanning.
