# Threat Model Analysis for vercel/turborepo

## Threat: [Malicious Scripts in Task Definitions](./threats/malicious_scripts_in_task_definitions.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Scripts in Task Definitions
*   **Description:** An attacker, through compromised developer accounts or insider threat, injects malicious code into `turbo.json` or package scripts (`package.json` scripts referenced by `turbo.json`). When Turborepo orchestrates tasks, these malicious scripts are executed across workspaces. The attacker could aim to compromise the build process, exfiltrate secrets used in builds, or inject backdoors into built artifacts.
*   **Impact:** Code execution across the monorepo during builds, supply chain compromise by injecting malicious code into application builds, data exfiltration of build-time secrets, potential for persistent backdoors in deployed applications.
*   **Turborepo Component Affected:** Task Orchestration, `turbo.json` configuration, `package.json` scripts.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Mandatory and rigorous code review for all changes to `turbo.json` and `package.json` scripts.
    *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for any arguments passed to scripts defined in `turbo.json`.
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege to the execution environment of Turborepo tasks, limiting access to sensitive resources and network access.
    *   Utilize static analysis tools to automatically scan scripts for suspicious patterns or known vulnerabilities before they are integrated.
    *   Implement code signing or integrity checks for scripts to ensure they haven't been tampered with before execution.

## Threat: [Remote Cache Compromise](./threats/remote_cache_compromise.md)

*   **Threat:** Remote Cache Compromise
*   **Description:** If Turborepo's remote caching feature is enabled, an attacker targets the remote cache storage (e.g., cloud storage bucket). By gaining unauthorized access, the attacker can inject malicious build artifacts into the cache. Subsequently, when developers or CI/CD pipelines retrieve artifacts from the compromised remote cache, they unknowingly incorporate malicious code into their builds, leading to a widespread supply chain attack.
*   **Impact:** Wide-scale supply chain compromise affecting all users of the remote cache, injection of malicious code into application builds across multiple environments, build integrity compromise for the entire organization, potential for widespread data breaches or service disruptions.
*   **Turborepo Component Affected:** Remote Caching Mechanism, Cloud Storage Integration, Authentication and Authorization for Cache Access.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong, multi-factor authentication and robust authorization mechanisms for accessing the remote cache storage. Utilize IAM roles or similar services with the principle of least privilege.
    *   Encrypt data in transit (using HTTPS) and at rest for the remote cache storage to protect against data breaches.
    *   Regularly audit access logs and security configurations of the remote cache infrastructure to detect and respond to unauthorized access attempts.
    *   Implement integrity checks for cached artifacts before retrieval from the remote cache. Verify checksums or signatures to ensure artifacts haven't been tampered with.
    *   Consider using immutable storage for the remote cache to prevent modification of existing artifacts after they are stored.

## Threat: [Insecure Remote Cache Configuration](./threats/insecure_remote_cache_configuration.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Remote Cache Configuration
*   **Description:** Misconfiguration of the remote cache setup, particularly around credentials and access policies, can create vulnerabilities. This includes hardcoding secrets in configuration files, using overly permissive IAM roles or access keys, or failing to implement proper secret rotation. An attacker exploiting these misconfigurations can gain unauthorized access to the remote cache, leading to compromise.
*   **Impact:** Remote cache compromise, potential data breach if sensitive information is stored in the cache metadata, supply chain compromise due to the ability to inject malicious artifacts into the cache, reputational damage and loss of trust.
*   **Turborepo Component Affected:** Remote Caching Configuration, Secrets Management, Authentication and Authorization.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize secure secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, environment variables in secure CI/CD systems) to store and manage remote cache credentials. Avoid hardcoding secrets directly in configuration files or code.
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege when configuring access policies for the remote cache. Grant only necessary permissions to specific roles or services.
    *   Regularly rotate API keys and credentials used for remote cache access to limit the window of opportunity for compromised credentials.
    *   Automate the configuration and deployment of remote cache infrastructure using Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) to ensure consistent and secure configurations and reduce manual errors.
    *   Implement regular security audits of the remote cache configuration and access policies to identify and remediate potential misconfigurations.
