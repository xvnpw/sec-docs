* **Attack Vectors:**
    * Turborepo configuration, primarily managed through `turbo.json`, dictates the entire build process.
    * Vulnerabilities here allow attackers to manipulate build steps, caching behavior, and security measures.
    * Exploiting configuration vulnerabilities can have a wide-ranging impact, affecting the integrity and security of the entire application.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. Critical Node: Malicious `turbo.json` Modification](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__critical_node_malicious__turbo_json__modification.md)

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * `turbo.json` is the central configuration file for Turborepo.
    * Malicious modification can directly inject malicious scripts, alter build commands, or disable security-related tasks.
    * This node is critical because it represents direct control over the build pipeline through configuration manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1. High-Risk Path: Direct Modification (e.g., compromised developer account, insider threat)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1__high-risk_path_direct_modification__e_g___compromised_developer_account__insider_threat_.md)

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Compromised Developer Account:** An attacker gains access to a developer's account with repository write permissions.
    * **Insider Threat:** A malicious insider with legitimate access to the repository.
    * **Direct Repository Access:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in repository access controls or infrastructure.
* **Why High-Risk:**
    * **Low Effort:** Once access is gained, modifying `turbo.json` is straightforward.
    * **Low Skill Level:** Requires basic file editing skills.
    * **Critical Impact:**  Allows for complete control over the build process, leading to code injection, backdoor installation, or disabling security features.
    * **Medium Detection Difficulty:**  Changes can be subtle and might be missed without proper code review and change monitoring.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1. High-Risk Path Start: Cache Poisoning via Incorrect Hashing/Invalidation](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1__high-risk_path_start_cache_poisoning_via_incorrect_hashinginvalidation.md)

    * **Incorrect Cache Key Definition:** Cache keys in `turbo.json` are not properly defined to include all relevant inputs.
    * **Flawed Invalidation Logic:** Cache invalidation rules are insufficient or incorrectly implemented.
    * **Input Manipulation:** Attacker manipulates input files (code, configuration, dependencies) to influence the cache key while injecting malicious output.
* **Why High-Risk Start:**
    * **Medium Likelihood:** Misconfigurations in caching are common, especially in complex build setups.
    * **Moderate Impact:** Can lead to serving outdated or malicious cached artifacts, potentially bypassing security checks.
    * **Medium Effort:** Requires understanding of caching mechanisms and how to manipulate inputs.
    * **Medium Skill Level:** Requires some understanding of build processes and caching.
    * **Medium Detection Difficulty:** Can be detected through build output discrepancies or unexpected behavior, but requires careful analysis.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Critical Node: Exploit Turborepo Caching Mechanisms](./attack_tree_paths/2__critical_node_exploit_turborepo_caching_mechanisms.md)

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * Turborepo's caching is a core feature for performance. Exploiting caching mechanisms can lead to serving malicious or outdated artifacts.
    * Vulnerabilities in local or remote caching can have significant consequences, affecting build integrity and application security.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2. Critical Node: Remote Cache Exploitation (If Enabled)](./attack_tree_paths/2_2__critical_node_remote_cache_exploitation__if_enabled_.md)

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * Remote cache introduces a shared attack surface, impacting multiple projects and users.
    * Exploiting vulnerabilities in the remote cache infrastructure, authentication, or communication can have widespread consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.1.1. Critical Node: Compromise Remote Cache Server](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_1_1__critical_node_compromise_remote_cache_server.md)

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Server Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the remote cache server operating system, software, or configurations.
    * **Weak Access Controls:** Insufficient access controls allowing unauthorized access to the server.
    * **Network Exploitation:** Exploiting network vulnerabilities to gain access to the server.
* **Why Critical:**
    * **Critical Impact:**  Complete compromise of the remote cache server allows for poisoning the cache for all users and projects.
    * **Very Low Likelihood (for well-secured servers):** Compromising a server is generally difficult if properly secured.
    * **High Effort:** Requires significant effort and resources to compromise a server.
    * **High Skill Level:** Requires advanced server exploitation skills.
    * **Hard Detection Difficulty:** Depends on the security monitoring of the remote cache server itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Critical Node: Exploit Task Orchestration and Scripting Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/3__critical_node_exploit_task_orchestration_and_scripting_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * Turborepo orchestrates tasks and executes build scripts within packages.
    * Vulnerabilities in task orchestration or scripting can lead to command injection and arbitrary code execution on build systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1. High-Risk Path: Command Injection in Build Scripts (within packages)](./attack_tree_paths/3_1__high-risk_path_command_injection_in_build_scripts__within_packages_.md)

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Unsanitized Inputs in Scripts:** Build scripts within packages use unsanitized inputs from environment variables, CLI arguments, or package dependencies.
    * **Shell Execution:** Build scripts use shell execution in a way that is vulnerable to command injection.
* **Why High-Risk:**
    * **Medium Likelihood:** Command injection vulnerabilities are common in scripting, especially when handling external inputs.
    * **Significant Impact:** Can lead to arbitrary command execution on build agents or developer machines.
    * **Medium Effort:** Requires identifying vulnerable scripts and crafting malicious inputs.
    * **Medium Skill Level:** Requires understanding of command injection and scripting.
    * **Medium Detection Difficulty:** Can be detected through static analysis or runtime monitoring, but might be missed if inputs are complex.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1.1. High-Risk Path: Unsanitized Inputs from Environment Variables, CLI Arguments, or Package Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_1__high-risk_path_unsanitized_inputs_from_environment_variables__cli_arguments__or_package_depen_fe35eef7.md)

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Environment Variables:** Build scripts directly use environment variables without sanitization.
    * **CLI Arguments:** Build scripts process command-line arguments without proper validation.
    * **Package Dependencies:** Build scripts use data from package dependencies that might be maliciously crafted.
* **Why High-Risk:**
    * This is the specific mechanism that enables command injection in build scripts.
