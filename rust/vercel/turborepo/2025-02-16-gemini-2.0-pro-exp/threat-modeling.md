# Threat Model Analysis for vercel/turborepo

## Threat: [Unauthorized Cache Access and Tampering](./threats/unauthorized_cache_access_and_tampering.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the *remote caching service* used by Turborepo. This could be due to compromised credentials used by Turborepo to authenticate with the service, vulnerabilities in Turborepo's handling of those credentials, or flaws in Turborepo's interaction with the caching API that allow for bypassing authentication/authorization. The attacker could then download, modify (injecting malicious code), or delete cached build artifacts.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Code Compromise:** Malicious code injected into cached artifacts would be executed in subsequent builds, potentially compromising the entire application.
        *   **Data Theft:** Sensitive information stored within build artifacts could be stolen.
        *   **Build Disruption:** Deletion or corruption of cached artifacts leads to build failures.
    *   **Turborepo Component Affected:** Turborepo's remote caching mechanism (`turbo` CLI interaction with the configured remote cache provider). Specifically, the authentication, authorization, and data transfer logic within Turborepo's code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Credential Handling (within Turborepo):** Ensure Turborepo securely stores and handles credentials used to access the remote cache. This includes using secure storage mechanisms and avoiding hardcoding credentials.
        *   **Robust Authentication/Authorization (Turborepo's implementation):** Turborepo's code must correctly implement authentication and authorization protocols when interacting with the remote caching service, preventing bypasses.
        *   **Input Validation (within Turborepo):** Turborepo should rigorously validate all inputs related to remote caching (e.g., cache keys, URLs, API responses) to prevent injection attacks.
        *   **Regular Security Audits (of Turborepo's code):** Conduct or commission regular security audits of Turborepo's codebase, focusing on the remote caching functionality.
        * **Report Vulnerabilities:** If you discover a vulnerability in Turborepo's handling of remote caching, responsibly disclose it to the maintainers.

## Threat: [Vulnerability in Turborepo Itself](./threats/vulnerability_in_turborepo_itself.md)

*   **Description:** A security vulnerability exists within the Turborepo codebase itself (e.g., a buffer overflow, command injection, path traversal, or logic flaw in the caching logic, task execution, or CLI parsing). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain control over the build process or the system running Turborepo. This is a direct threat to Turborepo's own code.
    *   **Impact:** The impact could range from denial of service (crashing Turborepo) to arbitrary code execution on the build server or developer machines, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
    *   **Turborepo Component Affected:** Any part of the Turborepo codebase (CLI, core logic, caching mechanisms, etc.) could be affected, depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical, depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Updated:** Regularly update Turborepo to the latest stable version to receive security patches. This is the *primary* defense.
        *   **Monitor Advisories:** Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE, GitHub Security Advisories) for any reported vulnerabilities in Turborepo.
        *   **Security Audits (Optional):** For high-security projects, consider conducting independent security audits of the Turborepo codebase.
        *   **Sandboxing (Advanced):** In highly sensitive environments, consider running Turborepo within a sandboxed environment (e.g., a container or virtual machine) to limit the potential impact of a vulnerability. This adds complexity but increases isolation.
        * **Report Vulnerabilities:** If you discover a vulnerability, responsibly disclose it to the Turborepo maintainers.
