*   **Attack Surface:** Cache Poisoning via Build Script Manipulation
    *   **Description:** An attacker with the ability to modify the build scripts of a project within the monorepo crafts scripts that generate malicious outputs, which are then cached by Turborepo.
    *   **How Turborepo Contributes:** Turborepo caches the outputs of tasks based on their inputs. If the build script itself is an input and is modified to produce malicious output, Turborepo will cache this malicious output.
    *   **Example:** An attacker compromises a project's `package.json` and modifies a build script to download and execute a malicious payload as part of the build process. Turborepo caches the output of this modified script, and subsequent builds using this cache will execute the malicious payload.
    *   **Impact:** Code injection, supply chain compromise within the monorepo, potential for widespread impact if the poisoned cache is used by multiple developers or in CI/CD.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict code review processes for all changes to build scripts and dependencies.
        *   Utilize version control and protect the main branch to prevent unauthorized modifications.
        *   Employ integrity checks for dependencies and build tools.
        *   Consider using a remote cache with content addressing to ensure the integrity of cached artifacts.

*   **Attack Surface:** Remote Cache Compromise
    *   **Description:** If using a remote caching solution, an attacker compromises the remote cache service, allowing them to inject malicious artifacts.
    *   **How Turborepo Contributes:** Turborepo integrates with remote caching solutions to share build outputs across different machines and CI/CD environments. If this remote cache is compromised, Turborepo will retrieve and use the malicious artifacts.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the remote cache service's authentication mechanism or gains access through leaked credentials. They then upload a modified build artifact for a common library. When developers or the CI/CD pipeline fetch this artifact, they are using the compromised version.
    *   **Impact:** Widespread code injection across multiple development environments and deployments, significant supply chain compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for the remote cache service.
        *   Ensure the remote cache service is regularly updated and patched against known vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement encryption for data in transit and at rest for the remote cache.
        *   Consider using content addressing or cryptographic signatures for cached artifacts to verify their integrity.
        *   Regularly audit access logs for the remote cache service.

*   **Attack Surface:** Script Injection via Configuration
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains the ability to modify Turborepo's configuration files (e.g., `turbo.json`) to inject malicious commands or scripts.
    *   **How Turborepo Contributes:** Turborepo relies on these configuration files to define tasks and their execution. If these files are compromised, the attacker can control what commands are executed during the build process.
    *   **Example:** An attacker modifies the `turbo.json` file to add a malicious script to a task definition. When this task is executed by Turborepo, the malicious script will also run, potentially compromising the developer's machine or the CI/CD environment.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, potential for data exfiltration, system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict write access to Turborepo configuration files to authorized personnel only.
        *   Implement code review processes for changes to these configuration files.
        *   Store these configuration files in version control and protect the main branch.
        *   Avoid dynamically generating task definitions based on untrusted input.

*   **Attack Surface:** Command Injection in Task Definitions
    *   **Description:** Task definitions within `turbo.json` or referenced scripts dynamically construct commands based on user input or environment variables without proper sanitization, leading to command injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Turborepo Contributes:** Turborepo executes the commands defined in the task definitions. If these commands are constructed insecurely, Turborepo will execute the injected commands.
    *   **Example:** A task definition in `turbo.json` uses an environment variable to construct a command. An attacker can manipulate this environment variable to inject malicious commands that will be executed by Turborepo.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the system running the Turborepo task.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid dynamically constructing commands based on external input.
        *   If dynamic command construction is necessary, implement robust input sanitization and validation.
        *   Use parameterized commands or shell escaping mechanisms to prevent command injection.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when defining task execution environments.
