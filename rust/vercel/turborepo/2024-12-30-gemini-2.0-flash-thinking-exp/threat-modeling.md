Here are the high and critical threats directly involving Turborepo:

*   **Threat:** Remote Cache Poisoning
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the remote cache service used by Turborepo. They then inject malicious or compromised build artifacts into the cache. When other developers or CI/CD pipelines retrieve these poisoned artifacts *via Turborepo's caching mechanism*, they unknowingly integrate vulnerable code into their builds.
    *   **Impact:**  Widespread deployment of vulnerable code across the organization, potential supply chain attack, compromised development environments, introduction of backdoors or malware.
    *   **Affected Turborepo Component:** Remote Cache API (used for reading and writing to the remote cache).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for accessing the remote cache service (e.g., API keys with restricted permissions, OAuth 2.0).
        *   Use checksum verification or content addressing to ensure the integrity of cached artifacts before Turborepo uses them.
        *   Consider using a private and managed remote cache service with robust security features and access controls.
        *   Regularly audit access logs for the remote cache service for suspicious activity.
        *   Implement mechanisms to invalidate or purge potentially compromised cache entries.

*   **Threat:** Local Cache Manipulation
    *   **Description:** An attacker with local access to a developer's machine or a CI/CD runner modifies the local Turborepo cache directory. They could replace legitimate build outputs with malicious ones. When *Turborepo uses these manipulated cached artifacts*, it leads to the execution of compromised code.
    *   **Impact:** Introduction of vulnerabilities during development or deployment, inconsistent build behavior, potential for local privilege escalation if the cached artifacts are used in privileged contexts.
    *   **Affected Turborepo Component:** Local Cache Directory (where build outputs are stored).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure proper file system permissions on the local Turborepo cache directory to restrict access to authorized users and processes.
        *   Educate developers about the risks of running untrusted code or commands that could modify the cache.
        *   Consider using file integrity monitoring tools to detect unauthorized changes to the local cache.
        *   Implement regular cleanup or purging of the local cache to minimize the window of opportunity for manipulation.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Script Execution via Configuration
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains the ability to modify `turbo.json` or `package.json` files that *Turborepo directly uses for task orchestration*. They inject malicious scripts into the `pipeline` configuration or lifecycle scripts (e.g., `prebuild`, `postbuild`). When *Turborepo executes these tasks*, the attacker's malicious code is run.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on developer machines or CI/CD servers, data exfiltration, denial of service, potential for lateral movement within the network.
    *   **Affected Turborepo Component:** Task Runner (responsible for executing scripts defined in the configuration).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access controls for modifying `turbo.json` and `package.json` files.
        *   Utilize code review processes for changes to these configuration files.
        *   Employ linters and static analysis tools to identify potentially dangerous commands or patterns in scripts.
        *   Consider using a more declarative approach for defining build tasks where possible, minimizing the need for complex shell scripts.

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Secrets in Cache
    *   **Description:** Sensitive information, such as API keys, database credentials, or other secrets, might inadvertently be included in the output of build tasks and subsequently stored in the *Turborepo cache* (either local or remote). An attacker gaining access to the cache could then retrieve these secrets.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive resources, data breaches, potential for further attacks using the exposed credentials.
    *   **Affected Turborepo Component:** Local and Remote Cache Storage.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid including secrets directly in build commands or source code.
        *   Utilize environment variables or dedicated secrets management solutions to handle sensitive information.
        *   Implement mechanisms to sanitize build outputs and prevent the caching of sensitive data by Turborepo.
        *   Regularly audit the contents of the cache (if feasible) for accidental inclusion of secrets.

*   **Threat:** Compromised Remote Cache Credentials
    *   **Description:** The credentials (e.g., API keys, tokens) used by *Turborepo* to access the remote cache service are compromised. An attacker with these credentials can read, write, or delete cached artifacts, directly impacting Turborepo's functionality and the integrity of builds.
    *   **Impact:** Remote cache poisoning, unauthorized access to build artifacts, potential data breaches if sensitive information is stored in the cache, denial of service by deleting cache entries.
    *   **Affected Turborepo Component:** Remote Cache API (authentication mechanism).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store remote cache credentials securely using secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
        *   Avoid storing credentials directly in Turborepo configuration files or environment variables.
        *   Implement the principle of least privilege when granting access to the remote cache service used by Turborepo.
        *   Regularly rotate remote cache credentials.
        *   Monitor access logs for the remote cache service for unauthorized access attempts.
