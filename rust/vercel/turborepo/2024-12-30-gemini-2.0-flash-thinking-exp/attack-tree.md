Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:

**Compromise Application via Turborepo Exploitation (Critical Node):**
- This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents the successful compromise of the application through exploiting Turborepo.

**Exploit Local Caching Mechanisms (High-Risk Path):**
- Attackers target the local Turborepo cache to inject malicious artifacts.
    - **Cache Poisoning (Local) (Critical Node):**
        - **Modify Cached Build Outputs:** Attackers alter the contents of the local cache.
            - **Gain Write Access to Local Cache Directory (Critical Node):** This is a prerequisite, achieved by:
                - Exploiting Permissions Issues: Weak file system permissions on the cache directory.
    - **Inject Malicious Code into Cached Artifacts:** Injecting malicious code directly into cached build outputs.
        - **Modify Build Scripts to Include Malicious Steps:** Altering build scripts to introduce malicious actions during caching.
            - **Compromise Developer Machine (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):** Gaining control of a developer's machine allows for direct manipulation of the local cache and build scripts.

**Exploit Remote Caching Mechanisms (If Enabled) (High-Risk Path):**
- Attackers target the remote Turborepo cache to inject malicious artifacts that can be shared across the team.
    - **Compromise Remote Cache Server (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):** Gaining control of the remote cache server.
    - **Cache Poisoning (Remote) (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):** Injecting malicious artifacts into the remote cache.
        - **Upload Malicious Cached Artifacts:** Uploading compromised build outputs to the remote cache.
            - **Exploit Lack of Integrity Checks on Uploaded Artifacts (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):** If the remote cache doesn't verify the integrity of uploads, malicious artifacts can be introduced easily.

**Manipulate Turborepo Configuration (`turbo.json`) (High-Risk Path):**
- Attackers modify the `turbo.json` file to influence the build process.
    - **Modify Task Dependencies:** Altering the order or dependencies of build tasks.
        - **Introduce Malicious Tasks into Build Pipeline:** Adding new tasks that execute malicious code.
            - **Compromise Developer Machine (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):**  Required to modify and commit changes to `turbo.json`.
    - **Modify Task Execution Commands:** Changing the commands executed for specific build tasks.
        - **Inject Malicious Commands into Existing Tasks:** Adding malicious commands to existing build steps.
            - **Compromise Developer Machine (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):** Required to modify and commit changes to `turbo.json`.
    - **Disable Security Features:** Disabling security features within the Turborepo configuration.
        - **Disable Remote Caching Integrity Checks (If Applicable):** Turning off integrity checks for the remote cache.
            - **Compromise Developer Machine (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):** Required to modify and commit changes to `turbo.json`.

**Exploit Task Scheduling and Execution (High-Risk Path):**
- Attackers leverage vulnerabilities in how Turborepo schedules and executes tasks.
    - **Introduce Malicious Scripts as Dependencies:** Introducing malicious code through project dependencies.
        - **Leverage Package Management Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting weaknesses in package managers.
            - **Dependency Confusion Attack (High-Risk Path):** Uploading a malicious package with the same name as an internal dependency to a public repository.

**Exploit Developer Workflow and Assumptions (High-Risk Path):**
- Attackers exploit the trust and practices of developers.
    - **Social Engineering Developers (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):** Tricking developers into performing actions that compromise security.
        - **Trick Developers into Running Malicious Commands:** Convincing developers to execute harmful commands.
            - **Phishing Attacks Targeting Developers:** Using deceptive emails or messages to trick developers.
    - **Supply Chain Attacks Targeting Turborepo Dependencies (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):** Compromising the dependencies that Turborepo itself relies on.
        - **Compromise Upstream Dependencies of Turborepo:** Injecting malicious code into libraries or tools that Turborepo uses.
