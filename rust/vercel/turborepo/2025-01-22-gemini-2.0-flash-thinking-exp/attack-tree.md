## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Turborepo Configuration Vulnerabilities (Critical Node & High-Risk Path Start):](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_turborepo_configuration_vulnerabilities__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_start_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Targeting the core configuration of Turborepo, primarily through `turbo.json`.
*   **Why High-Risk:** Configuration dictates the entire build process. Compromise here can have cascading effects and broad impact.
*   **Mitigation Focus:**
    *   Strict access control to repository and configuration files.
    *   Mandatory code reviews for `turbo.json` changes.
    *   Integrity monitoring of configuration files.

    *   **1.1. Malicious `turbo.json` Modification (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Directly or indirectly altering the `turbo.json` file to inject malicious instructions.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** `turbo.json` controls build scripts, caching, and task dependencies. Malicious changes can inject backdoors, bypass security, or disrupt operations.
        *   **Mitigation Focus:**
            *   Strong authentication and authorization for repository access.
            *   Version control and auditing of `turbo.json`.
            *   Principle of least privilege for build processes.

            *   **1.1.1. Direct Modification (e.g., compromised developer account, insider threat) (High-Risk Path):**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Gaining direct access to the repository (via compromised account or insider) and editing `turbo.json`.
                *   **Why High-Risk:** Direct, relatively easy for an attacker with access, and has critical impact.
                *   **Mitigation Focus:**
                    *   Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for developer accounts.
                    *   Insider threat detection mechanisms.
                    *   Regular security awareness training for developers.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Turborepo Caching Mechanisms (Critical Node):](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_turborepo_caching_mechanisms__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Targeting Turborepo's caching system to poison the cache or gain unauthorized access.
*   **Why High-Risk:** Caching is central to Turborepo's performance. Exploiting it can lead to serving malicious artifacts across multiple builds and deployments.
*   **Mitigation Focus:**
    *   Secure remote cache infrastructure (if used).
    *   Strong authentication and authorization for cache access.
    *   Cache integrity checks and validation.

    *   **2.2. Remote Cache Exploitation (If Enabled) (Critical Node):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Targeting the remote cache server or communication channels.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** Remote cache is a shared resource, making compromise impactful across multiple projects and teams.
        *   **Mitigation Focus:**
            *   Harden remote cache server infrastructure.
            *   Encrypt communication with remote cache (HTTPS).
            *   Implement robust access controls and monitoring for remote cache.

            *   **2.2.1.1. Compromise Remote Cache Server (Critical Node):**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Directly compromising the remote cache server itself.
                *   **Why High-Risk:** Most critical point in remote cache exploitation. Full compromise leads to complete cache control and widespread impact.
                *   **Mitigation Focus:**
                    *   Rigorous server hardening and security patching.
                    *   Intrusion detection and prevention systems.
                    *   Regular security audits and penetration testing of the remote cache infrastructure.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Task Orchestration and Scripting Vulnerabilities (Critical Node & High-Risk Path Start):](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_task_orchestration_and_scripting_vulnerabilities__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_start_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious commands into build scripts executed by Turborepo's task orchestration.
*   **Why High-Risk:** Build scripts are where code execution happens. Command injection can lead to arbitrary code execution on build agents and developer machines.
*   **Mitigation Focus:**
    *   Input sanitization in all build scripts.
    *   Secure scripting practices (avoid shell execution, use parameterized commands).
    *   Code review for build scripts, focusing on security.

    *   **3.1. Command Injection in Build Scripts (within packages) (High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in build scripts within individual packages to inject and execute arbitrary commands.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** Command injection is a common and easily exploitable vulnerability with significant impact.
        *   **Mitigation Focus:**
            *   Thorough input validation and sanitization in all build scripts.
            *   Use linters and static analysis tools to detect potential command injection vulnerabilities.
            *   Principle of least privilege for build processes.

            *   **3.1.1. Unsanitized Inputs from Environment Variables, CLI Arguments, or Package Dependencies (High-Risk Path):**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Build scripts using unsanitized inputs from external sources, leading to command injection.
                *   **Why High-Risk:** External inputs are often untrusted and can be easily manipulated by attackers.
                *   **Mitigation Focus:**
                    *   Never directly use external inputs in shell commands without sanitization.
                    *   Use secure libraries and functions for handling external inputs.
                    *   Regularly audit build scripts for insecure input handling.

            *   **Mitigation Focus:**
                *   Implement automated dependency vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipelines.
                *   Use dependency management tools with security features.
                *   Stay informed about security advisories for dependencies.

    *   **4.2. Social Engineering Developers to Introduce Malicious Config/Scripts (Critical Node & High-Risk Path Start):**
