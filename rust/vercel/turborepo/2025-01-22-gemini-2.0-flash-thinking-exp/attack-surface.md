# Attack Surface Analysis for vercel/turborepo

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Turborepo Orchestrated Toolchain](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_turborepo_orchestrated_toolchain.md)

**Description:** Turborepo orchestrates various build tools and relies on Node.js package managers. Vulnerabilities within these tools or their dependencies, when exploited during Turborepo's build process, can lead to significant security risks. While not vulnerabilities *in* Turborepo itself, Turborepo's architecture amplifies their potential impact across the monorepo.
*   **Turborepo Contribution:** Turborepo's core function is to manage and execute tasks using these underlying tools.  It becomes the conduit through which vulnerabilities in the toolchain can be exploited across multiple projects within the monorepo.
*   **Example:** A critical vulnerability in a widely used bundler (e.g., webpack, esbuild) is present in the monorepo's dependencies. Turborepo, when executing build tasks that utilize this bundler, inadvertently triggers the vulnerability, allowing for arbitrary code execution during the build process across all affected projects.
*   **Impact:** Code execution, data breaches, supply chain compromise, potential compromise of build artifacts across the entire monorepo.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Maintain a rigorous dependency management process for the entire monorepo, including Turborepo's dependencies and the dependencies of all projects within it.
    *   Implement automated dependency scanning and vulnerability detection in CI/CD pipelines to identify and address vulnerable dependencies *before* they are used in Turborepo builds.
    *   Regularly update Node.js, package managers, and all build tools used within the Turborepo environment to their latest secure versions.
    *   Consider using isolated build environments (e.g., containers) to limit the impact of compromised build tools.

## Attack Surface: [Script Injection via Dynamically Generated Turborepo Task Definitions or Scripts](./attack_surfaces/script_injection_via_dynamically_generated_turborepo_task_definitions_or_scripts.md)

**Description:** When Turborepo task definitions in `turbo.json` or scripts executed by Turborepo are dynamically constructed based on external or untrusted input without proper sanitization, they become highly vulnerable to script injection attacks.
*   **Turborepo Contribution:** Turborepo directly executes the scripts defined in its configuration. If these scripts are dynamically generated and vulnerable, Turborepo becomes the execution engine for injected malicious code, with potentially broad impact across the monorepo.
*   **Example:** A `turbo.json` configuration dynamically constructs a build command by concatenating user-provided environment variables. An attacker manipulates these environment variables to inject malicious shell commands into the build process. Turborepo then executes this crafted command, leading to arbitrary code execution on the build server or developer machine.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, full system compromise, data exfiltration, manipulation of build artifacts, potential for supply chain attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly avoid dynamic script generation in `turbo.json` and build scripts whenever possible.
    *   If dynamic script generation is absolutely necessary, implement robust input sanitization and validation for *all* external or untrusted inputs before they are incorporated into task definitions or scripts.
    *   Utilize parameterized commands or secure templating engines with built-in sanitization features to construct commands safely, rather than string concatenation.
    *   Enforce the principle of least privilege for script execution environments to limit the potential damage from successful script injection.
    *   Conduct thorough security reviews of any code that dynamically generates Turborepo task configurations or scripts.

## Attack Surface: [Remote Cache Poisoning via Compromised Turborepo Remote Cache](./attack_surfaces/remote_cache_poisoning_via_compromised_turborepo_remote_cache.md)

**Description:** If Turborepo's remote caching feature is enabled, a compromise of the remote cache server or insecure communication with it can lead to severe cache poisoning. This allows attackers to inject malicious build artifacts into the cache, which are then distributed to developers and CI/CD systems using Turborepo.
*   **Turborepo Contribution:** Turborepo's remote caching mechanism directly relies on the integrity and security of the remote cache. By design, Turborepo retrieves and utilizes artifacts from the cache to optimize build times. A compromised cache directly undermines the security of all systems relying on it through Turborepo.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the remote cache server used by Turborepo. They inject a backdoored version of a commonly used library or application build artifact into the cache. Subsequently, developers and CI/CD pipelines using Turborepo to build projects that depend on this artifact unknowingly retrieve and use the compromised version from the cache, leading to widespread application compromise.
*   **Impact:** Supply chain compromise, distribution of malware across development teams and potentially to end-users, widespread application compromise, significant reputational damage.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust security measures for the remote cache server infrastructure, including strong access controls, network segmentation, and regular security audits.
    *   Enforce HTTPS with strong TLS configuration for *all* communication between Turborepo clients and the remote cache to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   Utilize strong authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to the remote cache, ensuring only authorized users and systems can read and write cached artifacts.
    *   Implement data integrity checks, such as content hashing and digital signatures, for cached artifacts to detect any tampering or corruption. Verify these integrity checks upon retrieval from the cache.
    *   Regularly monitor the remote cache server for suspicious activity and maintain detailed access logs for auditing purposes.
    *   Consider using a private and dedicated remote cache instance, secured within your organization's infrastructure, instead of relying on shared or public caching services if security is paramount.
