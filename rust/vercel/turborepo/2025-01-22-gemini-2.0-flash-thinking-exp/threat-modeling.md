# Threat Model Analysis for vercel/turborepo

## Threat: [Local Cache Poisoning](./threats/local_cache_poisoning.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises the local file system where Turborepo stores its build cache. They modify or replace cached artifacts with malicious code. When Turborepo utilizes this poisoned local cache for subsequent builds, it injects the malicious artifacts into the application build pipeline, potentially affecting developer environments and CI/CD processes.
*   **Impact:** Introduction of malicious code into application builds, supply chain compromise affecting development and potentially production environments, compromised developer workstations leading to further attacks.
*   **Turborepo Component Affected:** Local Cache Mechanism, Task Orchestration Engine
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Restrict file system permissions:** Implement strict file system permissions on the local cache directory to prevent unauthorized write access. Ensure only the user running Turborepo processes can modify the cache.
    *   **Regular cache clearing in CI/CD:** In automated CI/CD pipelines, regularly clear the Turborepo local cache to minimize the window of opportunity for persistent cache poisoning.
    *   **Consider integrity checks:** While Turborepo manages cache invalidation based on task configuration, explore options for more robust integrity checks of cached artifacts if feasible, or advocate for such features in Turborepo.
    *   **Secure developer workstations:** Enforce security best practices for developer workstations to prevent initial compromise that could lead to local cache poisoning.

## Threat: [Command Injection in Task Scripts](./threats/command_injection_in_task_scripts.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities within scripts defined in `package.json` that are executed by Turborepo tasks. If these scripts dynamically construct shell commands using untrusted input (e.g., environment variables, external configuration), they become susceptible to command injection. Turborepo's task orchestration then executes these injected commands during the build process.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on build servers and developer machines, potential data exfiltration from build environments, compromise of CI/CD pipelines, supply chain attacks if malicious code is injected into build outputs.
*   **Turborepo Component Affected:** Task Execution Engine, `package.json` script handling
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure script development:** Thoroughly review and sanitize all scripts in `package.json` used by Turborepo tasks. Avoid dynamic command construction based on untrusted input.
    *   **Parameterization and escaping:** Utilize parameterized commands or proper escaping mechanisms when constructing shell commands within scripts to prevent injection.
    *   **Input validation:** Implement input validation and sanitization within scripts to handle any external data or environment variables safely before using them in commands.
    *   **Principle of least privilege:**  Grant scripts only the necessary permissions and access to system resources required for their intended tasks. Avoid running scripts with elevated privileges unnecessarily.
    *   **Static analysis for scripts:** Employ static analysis tools to automatically detect potential command injection vulnerabilities in `package.json` scripts.

## Threat: [Remote Cache Poisoning (Supply Chain Attack via Remote Cache)](./threats/remote_cache_poisoning__supply_chain_attack_via_remote_cache_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized write access to the remote cache storage used by Turborepo. This could be through compromised credentials, API key leaks, or vulnerabilities in the remote cache service itself. Once access is gained, the attacker injects malicious artifacts into the remote cache. Subsequently, any Turborepo build process (developer machines, CI/CD pipelines) retrieving artifacts from this poisoned remote cache will incorporate the malicious components, leading to a widespread supply chain attack.
*   **Impact:** Large-scale supply chain compromise affecting multiple projects and environments, widespread introduction of malicious code into applications, significant reputational damage, potential for data breaches and system compromise in production environments.
*   **Turborepo Component Affected:** Remote Cache Client (Turborepo CLI), Remote Cache Integration, Remote Cache Write Operations
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong authentication and authorization for remote cache writes:** Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to strictly control write access to the remote cache. Ideally, only trusted CI/CD pipelines should be authorized to write.
    *   **Immutable cache storage:** If possible, utilize immutable remote cache storage solutions to prevent modifications after initial caching, reducing the risk of poisoning.
    *   **Integrity checks and signing:** Explore and implement integrity checks and cryptographic signing of cached artifacts to verify their authenticity and prevent tampering. Advocate for such features if not readily available in the remote cache solution or Turborepo integration.
    *   **Monitoring and alerting:** Implement monitoring and alerting for remote cache activity, specifically focusing on write operations and any suspicious or unauthorized access attempts.
    *   **Regular security audits of remote cache setup:** Conduct periodic security audits of the remote cache infrastructure, access controls, and configurations to identify and remediate any vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle Attack on Remote Cache Communication](./threats/man-in-the-middle_attack_on_remote_cache_communication.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts network communication between Turborepo clients (developer machines, CI/CD agents) and the remote cache server. This interception can occur through network sniffing, ARP poisoning, or DNS spoofing. By intercepting the communication, the attacker can inject malicious artifacts into the cache stream being sent to the client or steal cached data being transmitted to the server.
*   **Impact:** Cache poisoning leading to supply chain attacks, data leaks of potentially sensitive build artifacts, compromise of build integrity and application security.
*   **Turborepo Component Affected:** Remote Cache Communication (network requests), Remote Cache Client (Turborepo CLI)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enforce HTTPS for remote cache communication:**  **Mandatory:** Ensure that all communication between Turborepo clients and the remote cache server is strictly over HTTPS. This encrypts the traffic and prevents eavesdropping and tampering.
    *   **TLS/SSL Certificate Pinning:** Implement TLS/SSL certificate pinning to further enhance connection security and prevent Man-in-the-Middle attacks using rogue or compromised certificates.
    *   **Secure network infrastructure:** Implement network security best practices to protect the network infrastructure from MITM attacks, including network segmentation, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and secure DNS configurations.
    *   **Regular security assessments of network configurations:** Periodically assess network configurations and security controls to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities that could facilitate MITM attacks.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Turborepo Tooling Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_turborepo_tooling_itself.md)

*   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities are discovered within the Turborepo codebase itself (core logic, task scheduling, caching mechanisms, CLI, etc.). Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise applications built using Turborepo. Exploitation could range from denial of service to arbitrary code execution within the build process, potentially leading to supply chain attacks.
*   **Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, potentially including arbitrary code execution during builds, denial of service affecting development and CI/CD pipelines, information disclosure, and supply chain compromise affecting all applications using vulnerable Turborepo versions.
*   **Turborepo Component Affected:** Turborepo Core Tooling (various modules and functions across the codebase)
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Turborepo updated:** **Critical:**  Maintain Turborepo and its dependencies updated to the latest versions. Regularly monitor for security advisories and patch releases from the Turborepo maintainers and apply updates promptly.
    *   **Dependency scanning:** Integrate dependency scanning tools into development and CI/CD pipelines to automatically detect known vulnerabilities in Turborepo and its dependencies.
    *   **Security monitoring and advisories:** Subscribe to security mailing lists, vulnerability databases, and monitor Turborepo's release notes and security advisories to stay informed about potential threats.
    *   **Follow Node.js security best practices:** Adhere to general security best practices for Node.js development and deployment to minimize the overall attack surface of the build environment.
    *   **Contribute to community security:** Participate in the Turborepo community and report any potential security vulnerabilities discovered to the maintainers responsibly.
