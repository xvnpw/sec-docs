## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Discover Compiler Bug in Gleam Code Generation](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__discover_compiler_bug_in_gleam_code_generation.md)

**Attack Vector Name:** Compiler Code Generation Bug Exploitation
*   **Description of the Attack:**
    *   Attacker identifies a bug in the Gleam compiler's code generation phase. This bug could lead to the generation of incorrect or unsafe Erlang code (or JavaScript code if applicable via other tools).
    *   The attacker crafts Gleam code specifically designed to trigger this compiler bug.
    *   When the Gleam code is compiled, the bug is triggered, resulting in vulnerable compiled code.
    *   The attacker then exploits the vulnerability in the compiled application.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   Arbitrary code execution on the server or client (depending on where the compiled code runs).
    *   Memory corruption, leading to crashes or unpredictable behavior.
    *   Circumvention of security mechanisms.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly test Gleam applications, especially edge cases and complex logic.
    *   Report any suspected compiler bugs to the Gleam team.
    *   Regularly update the Gleam compiler to the latest version with bug fixes.
    *   Implement robust error handling in Gleam code to catch unexpected behavior.
    *   Employ fuzzing techniques on Gleam code and generated Erlang code to identify potential compiler vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Data Type Mismatches/Conversion Errors at Gleam-Erlang Boundary](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__data_type_mismatchesconversion_errors_at_gleam-erlang_boundary.md)

**Attack Vector Name:** Erlang Interop Data Type Mismatch Exploitation
*   **Description of the Attack:**
    *   Gleam application interacts with Erlang code using FFI (Foreign Function Interface).
    *   Attacker exploits inconsistencies or errors in data type conversion between Gleam's type system and Erlang's dynamic typing.
    *   This can lead to unexpected data being passed to Erlang functions, causing logic errors, crashes, or security vulnerabilities in the Erlang side.
    *   For example, an integer expected by Erlang code might be misinterpreted as a string due to incorrect conversion, leading to unexpected behavior.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   Logic errors in the application.
    *   Data corruption or manipulation.
    *   Unexpected program behavior, potentially leading to denial of service or security breaches.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully manage data conversion between Gleam and Erlang.
    *   Explicitly define and validate data types at the interop boundary.
    *   Use Gleam's FFI features with caution.
    *   Thoroughly test data exchange between Gleam and Erlang code.
    *   Employ robust error handling for conversion failures.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Injection Vulnerabilities via JS Interop (e.g., Cross-Site Scripting)](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__injection_vulnerabilities_via_js_interop__e_g___cross-site_scripting_.md)

**Attack Vector Name:** JavaScript Interop Injection (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS)
*   **Description of the Attack:**
    *   Gleam application generates frontend code or interacts with JavaScript in a browser environment (if Gleam is used in such a context via transpilation or bridging).
    *   Attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the application's output, which is then executed in a user's browser.
    *   This is typically achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in how Gleam code handles user input or data that is rendered in the frontend.
    *   For example, if Gleam code directly embeds user-provided strings into HTML without proper encoding, an attacker can inject `<script>` tags.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
    *   Account takeover by stealing session cookies or credentials.
    *   Data theft from the user's browser.
    *   Malware distribution.
    *   Defacement of the web page.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   If Gleam is used for frontend development, be extremely vigilant about Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
    *   Ensure proper output encoding and sanitization for all user-controlled data rendered in the frontend.
    *   Use a robust templating engine with automatic output encoding.
    *   Follow secure frontend development practices.
    *   Conduct XSS vulnerability testing (static and dynamic analysis).

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Vulnerable Dependency Introduced via `gleam.toml`](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__vulnerable_dependency_introduced_via__gleam_toml_.md)

**Attack Vector Name:** Dependency Vulnerability Exploitation
*   **Description of the Attack:**
    *   Gleam application relies on external packages managed through `gleam.toml` (using Hex package manager).
    *   Attacker exploits a known vulnerability in one of the Gleam dependencies (or their transitive dependencies).
    *   This vulnerability could be in the dependency's code itself, allowing for remote code execution, data breaches, or other malicious activities.
    *   The attacker leverages the vulnerable dependency to compromise the Gleam application.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   Full application compromise.
    *   Data breaches and data exfiltration.
    *   Denial of service.
    *   Privilege escalation.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly audit and update Gleam dependencies listed in `gleam.toml`.
    *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    *   Implement a dependency management policy.
    *   Pin dependency versions in `gleam.toml` to ensure consistent builds and reduce the risk of unexpected updates.
    *   Monitor security advisories for Gleam dependencies and the broader Erlang/OTP ecosystem.
    *   Be aware of transitive dependencies and their potential vulnerabilities.
