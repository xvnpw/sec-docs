# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Supply Chain Attack on Gleam Dependencies

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the specific attack path: **1.1.4.3 Supply Chain Attacks: Compromise a package dependency**, within the context of a Gleam application.  We aim to understand the vulnerabilities, potential impacts, and, most importantly, propose concrete mitigation strategies to reduce the risk associated with this attack vector.  This analysis will inform development practices and security policies for the application.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the following attack sub-paths, all stemming from the compromise of a package dependency:

*   **Social engineering to gain access to a package maintainer's account. [CRITICAL]**
*   **Submit malicious code to a commonly used Gleam package. [CRITICAL]**
*   **Poison the package registry (if a custom registry is used). [CRITICAL]**

The scope includes:

*   The Gleam package management ecosystem (primarily Hex.pm, but also considering custom registries).
*   Commonly used Gleam packages and their maintainer practices.
*   The build and deployment pipeline of the target Gleam application.
*   The runtime environment of the Gleam application.

The scope *excludes*:

*   Attacks on the core Gleam compiler or standard library (these are higher-level supply chain concerns).
*   Attacks unrelated to package dependencies (e.g., direct attacks on the application's infrastructure).
*   Attacks on non-Gleam dependencies (e.g., Erlang/OTP libraries, unless a Gleam wrapper is compromised).

## 3. Methodology

This deep analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  We will use the STRIDE model (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege) to categorize potential threats arising from the compromised dependency.
2.  **Vulnerability Analysis:** We will examine the Gleam package ecosystem and common practices to identify potential weaknesses that could be exploited in this attack path.
3.  **Impact Assessment:** We will assess the potential consequences of a successful attack, considering data breaches, service disruption, reputational damage, and financial loss.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Development:** We will propose specific, actionable steps to reduce the likelihood and impact of this attack.  This will include preventative, detective, and responsive measures.
5.  **Documentation:**  All findings and recommendations will be documented in this report.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path

### 4.1 Social Engineering to Gain Access to a Package Maintainer's Account [CRITICAL]

**Threat Modeling (STRIDE):**

*   **Spoofing:** The attacker impersonates a legitimate entity (e.g., Hex.pm support, another maintainer) to trick the package maintainer.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The attacker may leverage publicly available information (e.g., social media, forum posts) to craft a convincing social engineering attack.
*   **Elevation of Privilege:** The ultimate goal is to gain the maintainer's credentials, granting the attacker full control over the package.

**Vulnerability Analysis:**

*   **Weak Passwords/Lack of 2FA:**  Maintainers using weak or reused passwords, or not enabling Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) on their Hex.pm or source code repository (e.g., GitHub) accounts, are highly vulnerable.
*   **Phishing Attacks:**  Maintainers may fall victim to phishing emails or messages designed to steal their credentials.
*   **Credential Stuffing:**  If a maintainer's credentials have been compromised in a previous data breach, attackers may use those credentials to gain access to their Hex.pm or repository accounts.
*   **Lack of Awareness:**  Maintainers may not be fully aware of the risks of social engineering or the importance of strong security practices.

**Impact Assessment:**

*   **Complete Package Control:** The attacker gains full control over the package, allowing them to publish malicious versions.
*   **Widespread Impact:** If the compromised package is widely used, the impact can be significant, affecting numerous applications and users.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  Both the package maintainer and the Gleam ecosystem as a whole can suffer reputational damage.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Mandatory 2FA:**  Enforce the use of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for all package maintainers on Hex.pm and their source code repository accounts.  This is the single most effective mitigation.
*   **Security Awareness Training:**  Provide regular security awareness training to package maintainers, covering topics like phishing, password security, and social engineering.
*   **Strong Password Policies:**  Enforce strong password policies for Hex.pm accounts.
*   **Credential Monitoring:**  Encourage maintainers to use services that monitor for credential leaks and breaches.
*   **Phishing Simulations:**  Conduct regular phishing simulations to test maintainer awareness and identify areas for improvement.
*   **Communication Channels:** Establish secure communication channels for reporting suspicious activity or potential security incidents.

### 4.2 Submit Malicious Code to a Commonly Used Gleam Package [CRITICAL]

**Threat Modeling (STRIDE):**

*   **Tampering:** The attacker modifies the package's code to introduce malicious functionality.
*   **Repudiation:** The attacker may attempt to obfuscate their actions to make it difficult to trace the source of the malicious code.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The malicious code may exfiltrate sensitive data from applications using the compromised package.
*   **Denial of Service:** The malicious code may disrupt the normal operation of applications using the compromised package.
*   **Elevation of Privilege:** The malicious code may attempt to gain elevated privileges within the application or the underlying system.

**Vulnerability Analysis:**

*   **Lack of Code Review:**  If the package maintainer does not have a robust code review process, malicious code may slip through undetected.
*   **Compromised Development Environment:**  If the maintainer's development environment is compromised (e.g., through malware), malicious code could be injected without their knowledge.
*   **Insufficient Testing:**  Inadequate testing may fail to identify malicious behavior introduced by the attacker.
*   **Obfuscated Code:**  The attacker may use code obfuscation techniques to make it difficult to detect the malicious code.

**Impact Assessment:**

*   **Data Breaches:**  The malicious code could steal sensitive data, such as user credentials, API keys, or financial information.
*   **Service Disruption:**  The malicious code could cause applications to crash, become unresponsive, or behave erratically.
*   **System Compromise:**  In some cases, the malicious code could exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying system to gain complete control.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  The compromised package and the applications using it could suffer significant reputational damage.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Mandatory Code Review:**  Require all code changes to be reviewed by at least one other trusted individual before being merged.  This is crucial.
*   **Automated Security Scanning:**  Integrate automated security scanning tools into the build pipeline to detect known vulnerabilities and suspicious code patterns.  Tools like `sobelow` (for Elixir) can be adapted or used as inspiration for Gleam-specific tooling.
*   **Static Analysis:**  Use static analysis tools to identify potential security flaws in the code.
*   **Dynamic Analysis:**  Use dynamic analysis tools (e.g., fuzzing) to test the package's behavior under various conditions and identify unexpected behavior.
*   **Dependency Pinning:**  Pin the versions of all dependencies in the application's `gleam.toml` file to prevent automatic updates to potentially compromised versions.  Use specific versions, not ranges.
*   **Dependency Auditing:**  Regularly audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities and security advisories.  Tools like `mix hex.audit` (for Elixir) can be used as a model.
*   **Software Bill of Materials (SBOM):**  Generate and maintain an SBOM for the application to track all dependencies and their versions.
*   **Sandboxing:** Consider running untrusted code in a sandboxed environment to limit its potential impact. This is more relevant at the application level than the package level.

### 4.3 Poison the Package Registry (if a Custom Registry is Used) [CRITICAL]

**Threat Modeling (STRIDE):**

*   **Tampering:** The attacker modifies the package registry's data to serve malicious packages.
*   **Spoofing:** The attacker may impersonate the legitimate package registry to redirect users to a malicious server.
*   **Denial of Service:** The attacker may disrupt the availability of the package registry, preventing users from accessing legitimate packages.

**Vulnerability Analysis:**

*   **Weak Authentication/Authorization:**  If the custom registry has weak authentication or authorization mechanisms, attackers may be able to gain unauthorized access and modify its contents.
*   **Lack of Integrity Checks:**  If the registry does not perform integrity checks on packages (e.g., using checksums or digital signatures), attackers may be able to replace legitimate packages with malicious ones.
*   **Vulnerable Infrastructure:**  If the registry's infrastructure is vulnerable to attack (e.g., due to unpatched software or misconfigured security settings), attackers may be able to compromise the registry.
*   **DNS Hijacking:**  Attackers may be able to hijack the DNS records for the registry's domain name, redirecting users to a malicious server.

**Impact Assessment:**

*   **Widespread Distribution of Malicious Packages:**  All users of the custom registry could be affected, potentially leading to a large-scale compromise.
*   **Loss of Trust:**  Users may lose trust in the custom registry and the applications that rely on it.
*   **Service Disruption:**  The registry may become unavailable, preventing users from building or deploying their applications.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Strong Authentication and Authorization:**  Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for the custom registry, including 2FA and role-based access control.
*   **Package Signing and Verification:**  Require all packages to be digitally signed by their maintainers, and verify the signatures before allowing packages to be downloaded or installed.  This is a critical defense.
*   **Integrity Checks:**  Perform integrity checks on packages (e.g., using checksums) to ensure that they have not been tampered with.
*   **Secure Infrastructure:**  Ensure that the registry's infrastructure is secure, including using up-to-date software, strong passwords, and appropriate security configurations.
*   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of the registry's infrastructure and code to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
*   **DNSSEC:**  Implement DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions) to protect against DNS hijacking attacks.
*   **Monitoring and Alerting:**  Implement monitoring and alerting systems to detect suspicious activity or potential security incidents.
*   **Incident Response Plan:**  Develop and maintain an incident response plan to handle security incidents effectively.
* **Consider using Hex.pm:** Unless there is a very strong reason to use a custom registry, using the official Hex.pm registry is strongly recommended. Hex.pm has robust security measures in place.
