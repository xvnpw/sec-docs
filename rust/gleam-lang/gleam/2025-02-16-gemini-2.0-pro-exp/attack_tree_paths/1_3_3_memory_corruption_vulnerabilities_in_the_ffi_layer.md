# Deep Analysis: Memory Corruption in Gleam FFI (Attack Tree Path 1.3.3)

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to identify and assess the risk of memory corruption vulnerabilities arising from the interaction between Gleam code and foreign functions (typically written in C, Rust, or other languages) via the FFI.  We aim to determine the likelihood and potential impact of such vulnerabilities, and to propose mitigation strategies.  Specifically, we want to answer these questions:

*   How likely is it that a malicious actor could trigger a memory corruption vulnerability through the FFI?
*   What types of memory corruption vulnerabilities are most likely to occur (buffer overflows, use-after-free, double-free, etc.)?
*   What is the potential impact of a successful exploit (arbitrary code execution, denial of service, information disclosure)?
*   What specific code patterns or FFI usage scenarios are most vulnerable?
*   What are the most effective methods for preventing and mitigating these vulnerabilities?

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the FFI layer of Gleam applications.  It encompasses:

*   **Gleam's FFI mechanisms:**  How Gleam interacts with foreign code, including data type conversions, memory ownership, and function call conventions.
*   **Common FFI use cases:**  Interfacing with system libraries, performance-critical code written in other languages, and existing libraries not available in Gleam.
*   **Vulnerable code patterns:**  Identifying common mistakes or unsafe practices when using the FFI that could lead to memory corruption.
*   **Interaction with external libraries:**  Analyzing how the security of external libraries called through the FFI impacts the overall security of the Gleam application.  We will *not* perform a full security audit of every possible external library, but we will consider how their documented behavior and known vulnerabilities could be exploited through the FFI.
* **Target platform:** We will consider the BEAM VM and the underlying operating system.

This analysis *excludes*:

*   Vulnerabilities within the Gleam compiler or runtime itself (except where they directly relate to FFI interactions).
*   Vulnerabilities in application logic *not* involving the FFI.
*   General network security concerns (unless they directly facilitate exploitation of an FFI vulnerability).

## 3. Methodology

We will employ a combination of the following techniques:

1.  **Code Review:**  Manually inspect Gleam code and the corresponding foreign code (if available) for potential memory safety issues.  This includes:
    *   Examining data type mappings between Gleam and the foreign language.
    *   Analyzing memory allocation and deallocation patterns.
    *   Checking for proper bounds checking on arrays and buffers.
    *   Identifying potential use-after-free or double-free scenarios.
    *   Reviewing error handling and ensuring that errors in the foreign code are properly propagated and handled in Gleam.

2.  **Fuzzing:**  Use fuzzing tools to automatically generate a large number of diverse inputs to the FFI functions and observe the behavior of the application.  This will help identify unexpected crashes or memory errors.  We will use:
    *   **Property-based testing:**  Leverage Gleam's property-based testing capabilities (e.g., using libraries like `PropEr`) to generate valid and invalid inputs based on type specifications.
    *   **Coverage-guided fuzzing:**  Employ tools like AFL (American Fuzzy Lop) or libFuzzer (if interfacing with C/C++) to maximize code coverage and discover edge cases.  This requires adapting the Gleam FFI calls to be fuzzed by these tools, potentially through a wrapper.
    *   **Targeted fuzzing:** Focus on specific FFI functions and data types that are deemed high-risk based on the code review.

3.  **Static Analysis:**  Utilize static analysis tools (if available for the foreign language) to identify potential memory safety issues in the foreign code.  This can help pinpoint vulnerabilities that might be difficult to detect through manual code review or fuzzing.

4.  **Dynamic Analysis:**  Use dynamic analysis tools (e.g., Valgrind, AddressSanitizer) to monitor the memory behavior of the application during runtime.  These tools can detect memory leaks, use-after-free errors, and other memory corruption issues.  This is particularly useful for identifying issues that only manifest under specific conditions.

5.  **Documentation Review:**  Carefully review the documentation for both Gleam's FFI and any external libraries used through the FFI.  This will help understand the intended behavior and identify any potential security considerations.

6.  **Best Practices Research:**  Consult security best practices for FFI development in general and for the specific foreign languages used.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.3.3

**Attack Path:** 1.3.3 Memory corruption vulnerabilities in the FFI layer.

**Attack Steps:**

*   **Fuzz the FFI with various inputs. [CRITICAL]**
*   **Analyze the memory management of the FFI for potential issues. [CRITICAL]**

**4.1 Fuzzing the FFI**

**4.1.1  Strategy:**

We will employ a multi-pronged fuzzing strategy:

*   **Property-Based Fuzzing (Gleam Side):**  We'll use Gleam's property-based testing capabilities to generate a wide range of inputs for the FFI functions.  This is particularly effective for testing data type conversions and boundary conditions.  We'll focus on:
    *   Strings of varying lengths, including empty strings, very long strings, and strings containing special characters.
    *   Integers, including minimum and maximum values, zero, and negative values.
    *   Lists and tuples of varying sizes and containing different data types.
    *   Custom data types used in the FFI, generating both valid and invalid instances.
    *   Passing `null` or equivalent values where pointers are expected (if applicable to the foreign language).

*   **Coverage-Guided Fuzzing (Foreign Code Side):** If the foreign code is written in C/C++, we'll use AFL or libFuzzer.  This requires creating a harness that calls the FFI functions from the foreign code side.  This approach is highly effective at finding crashes and memory errors.  We'll focus on:
    *   Identifying and instrumenting the entry points to the foreign code that are called from Gleam.
    *   Creating a harness that takes input from the fuzzer and passes it to the FFI functions.
    *   Compiling the foreign code with appropriate instrumentation for the chosen fuzzer.
    *   Running the fuzzer for an extended period and analyzing the results.

*   **Targeted Fuzzing:** Based on the code review, we'll identify specific FFI functions and data types that are considered high-risk.  We'll then create custom fuzzers that focus on these areas, generating inputs that are specifically designed to trigger potential vulnerabilities.

**4.1.2  Expected Outcomes:**

*   **Crashes:**  Any crashes observed during fuzzing are strong indicators of memory corruption vulnerabilities.  We'll analyze the crash dumps to determine the root cause.
*   **Memory Errors:**  Dynamic analysis tools (Valgrind, AddressSanitizer) will report memory errors such as use-after-free, double-free, and invalid memory access.
*   **Unexpected Behavior:**  Even if no crashes or memory errors are detected, any unexpected behavior (e.g., incorrect results, infinite loops) could indicate a subtle vulnerability.
*   **Code Coverage:**  Coverage-guided fuzzing will provide metrics on the code coverage achieved.  Low coverage in certain areas may indicate that the fuzzer is not reaching all potential code paths.

**4.1.3  Example (Conceptual - Gleam & C):**

Let's say we have a Gleam FFI function that calls a C function to process a string:

**Gleam:**

```gleam
@external(c, "process_string")
pub fn process_string(string) -> String
```

**C (process_string.c):**

```c
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

char* process_string(const char* input) {
    // Vulnerability: No length check on input
    char buffer[10];
    strcpy(buffer, input); // Potential buffer overflow

    // ... (some processing) ...
	char* result = (char*)malloc(10);
	strcpy(result, buffer);
    return result;
}
```

**Fuzzing (libFuzzer - C side):**

```c
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "process_string.h"

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  char *input = (char *)malloc(size + 1);
  if (input == NULL) {
    return 0; // Out of memory
  }
  memcpy(input, data, size);
  input[size] = '\0';

  char *result = process_string(input);

  free(input);
  if (result != NULL) {
      free(result);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Running libFuzzer on this C code would quickly reveal the buffer overflow vulnerability in `strcpy`.

**4.2 Analyzing Memory Management**

**4.2.1  Key Areas of Concern:**

*   **Data Type Mapping:**  Ensure that Gleam data types are correctly mapped to the corresponding types in the foreign language.  Mismatches can lead to misinterpretations of data and memory corruption.  For example, Gleam's `String` needs to be handled carefully when passed to C, ensuring null termination and proper memory management.
*   **Memory Ownership:**  Clearly define which side (Gleam or the foreign code) is responsible for allocating and deallocating memory.  Ambiguity can lead to double-free or memory leak errors.  Gleam's garbage collector does *not* manage memory allocated by foreign code.
*   **Buffer Overflows:**  Check for potential buffer overflows when passing data between Gleam and the foreign code.  Ensure that sufficient space is allocated for buffers and that bounds checks are performed.
*   **Use-After-Free:**  Ensure that memory is not accessed after it has been freed.  This can occur if pointers are not properly managed or if there are race conditions.
*   **Double-Free:**  Ensure that memory is not freed multiple times.  This can happen if there are errors in the memory management logic or if pointers are not properly tracked.
*   **Error Handling:**  Ensure that errors in the foreign code are properly handled and propagated back to Gleam.  Unhandled errors can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially memory corruption.  For example, if a C function returns an error code, Gleam should check it and handle the error appropriately.
*   **Concurrency:** If the FFI functions are called from multiple Gleam processes concurrently, ensure that there are no race conditions or other concurrency-related issues.  This may require using appropriate synchronization mechanisms (e.g., mutexes) in the foreign code.
* **Resource Exhaustion:** Check if external function can exhaust memory or other resources.

**4.2.2  Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Use Safe Abstractions:**  Create wrapper functions or modules in Gleam that provide a safe interface to the FFI functions.  These wrappers can handle memory management, data type conversions, and error handling, reducing the risk of errors in the application code.
*   **Use Rust for Foreign Code:**  Rust's ownership and borrowing system can help prevent many common memory safety issues.  If possible, consider writing the foreign code in Rust.
*   **Use Memory-Safe Libraries:**  If using existing C/C++ libraries, choose libraries that are known for their security and memory safety.
*   **Perform Thorough Code Reviews:**  Carefully review both the Gleam code and the foreign code for potential memory safety issues.
*   **Use Static and Dynamic Analysis Tools:**  Employ static and dynamic analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Follow Best Practices:**  Adhere to security best practices for FFI development.
* **Isolate FFI calls:** If possible, isolate FFI calls to separate processes or sandboxed environments to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities.

## 5. Conclusion

Memory corruption vulnerabilities in the FFI layer of Gleam applications pose a significant security risk. By employing a combination of code review, fuzzing, static analysis, and dynamic analysis, we can identify and mitigate these vulnerabilities.  The use of safe abstractions, memory-safe languages like Rust, and thorough testing are crucial for ensuring the security of Gleam applications that interact with foreign code.  This deep analysis provides a framework for systematically assessing and addressing these risks. The critical nature of the identified attack steps necessitates immediate and thorough investigation and remediation.
