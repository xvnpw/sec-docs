# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.2 Exploit Erlang/OTP Vulnerabilities (Inherited by Gleam)

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the potential for exploiting vulnerabilities within the Erlang/OTP runtime environment that a Gleam application depends on.  We aim to identify specific attack vectors, assess their likelihood and impact, and propose concrete mitigation strategies to enhance the application's security posture.  This analysis focuses specifically on vulnerabilities *inherited* from Erlang/OTP, not vulnerabilities introduced by the Gleam code itself (although Gleam code could *expose* underlying Erlang vulnerabilities).

## 2. Scope

This analysis will cover the following areas within the context of a Gleam application:

*   **Classic Erlang Remote Code Execution (RCE) Vulnerabilities:**  Focusing on unsafe usage of functions like `erlang:binary_to_term/1`, `erlang:binary_to_term/2` (with unsafe options), `erlang:term_to_binary/1`, and related functions that can lead to arbitrary code execution when processing untrusted data.
*   **Erlang Distribution Protocol Vulnerabilities:**  Examining potential weaknesses in how the application utilizes the Erlang distribution protocol for inter-node communication. This includes unauthorized node connections, message interception/manipulation, and denial-of-service attacks targeting the distribution mechanism.
*   **Vulnerabilities in OTP Libraries:**  Analyzing commonly used OTP libraries (e.g., `gen_server`, `gen_statem`, `supervisor`, `epmd`, standard library modules) for known vulnerabilities and potential misuse that could lead to security issues.  This includes both officially reported CVEs and less formally documented weaknesses.
* **Gleam's Interaction with Erlang:** How Gleam code might inadvertently expose or exacerbate underlying Erlang vulnerabilities. This is crucial, as Gleam compiles to Erlang.

This analysis will *not* cover:

*   Vulnerabilities specific to the application's Gleam code logic (unless that logic directly exposes an Erlang vulnerability).  This is handled in other branches of the attack tree.
*   Generic web application vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS) that are not directly related to Erlang/OTP.
*   Infrastructure-level vulnerabilities (e.g., misconfigured servers, network vulnerabilities) outside the application's runtime environment.

## 3. Methodology

The following methodology will be employed:

1.  **Static Code Analysis (Gleam and Erlang):**
    *   Review the Gleam source code for any direct calls to potentially dangerous Erlang functions (e.g., `erlang:binary_to_term` with user-supplied input).
    *   Analyze the compiled Erlang code (if accessible) to understand how Gleam code translates to Erlang and identify potential hidden vulnerabilities.
    *   Use static analysis tools (e.g., Dialyzer, ESLint with Erlang plugins, potentially custom-built tools) to detect common Erlang security pitfalls.
2.  **Dependency Analysis:**
    *   Identify all OTP libraries and third-party Erlang dependencies used by the Gleam application.
    *   Check for known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in these dependencies using vulnerability databases (e.g., NIST NVD, Snyk, GitHub Security Advisories).
    *   Analyze the source code of critical dependencies for potential security weaknesses.
3.  **Dynamic Analysis (Fuzzing and Penetration Testing):**
    *   Develop fuzzing harnesses to test the application's handling of malformed Erlang terms and messages. This is particularly important for any code that interacts with the Erlang distribution protocol or uses `binary_to_term`.
    *   Conduct penetration testing, simulating realistic attack scenarios targeting the Erlang distribution protocol and known Erlang vulnerabilities.
4.  **Threat Modeling:**
    *   Develop threat models specific to the Erlang/OTP aspects of the application, considering different attacker profiles and their capabilities.
    *   Identify potential attack vectors and assess their likelihood and impact.
5.  **Documentation and Reporting:**
    *   Document all findings, including identified vulnerabilities, their severity, and recommended mitigation strategies.
    *   Provide clear and actionable recommendations for developers to address the identified risks.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.2

This section details the specific analysis of the attack path, breaking it down into sub-areas:

### 4.1 Classic Erlang RCE Vulnerabilities (e.g., `erlang:binary_to_term`)

**Threat:**  An attacker can inject malicious Erlang terms (serialized data) into the application, which are then deserialized using `erlang:binary_to_term` (or similar functions) without proper validation. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary Erlang code within the application's context.

**Analysis:**

*   **Code Review:**  The Gleam code *must* be meticulously reviewed for any usage of `erlang:binary_to_term` (or its variants) that might be exposed to external input.  Even indirect exposure (e.g., reading data from a database that an attacker could have modified) is a significant risk.  Look for Gleam functions that wrap or call these Erlang functions.  Examine how Gleam's type system interacts with these calls; does it provide any inherent protection? (Likely not, as Erlang's dynamic typing is still in play).
*   **Fuzzing:**  A fuzzer should be built to generate a wide range of malformed and potentially malicious Erlang terms.  This fuzzer should target any entry point in the application that receives data from external sources (network connections, message queues, databases, etc.).  The fuzzer should monitor for crashes, unexpected behavior, or signs of code execution (e.g., unexpected file access, network connections).
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Avoid `binary_to_term` with Untrusted Input:**  The *best* mitigation is to avoid using `erlang:binary_to_term` with any data that could be influenced by an attacker.  Consider using safer alternatives like:
        *   **JSON:** If the data format allows, use JSON encoding/decoding.  Gleam has libraries for this, and it's generally much safer.
        *   **MessagePack:** Another binary serialization format that is generally safer than raw Erlang terms.
        *   **Protocol Buffers/gRPC:** For structured data, these provide strong typing and schema validation.
    *   **Use `safe` option (with extreme caution):** If `binary_to_term` *must* be used, the `safe` option should be used.  **However**, even the `safe` option is not a silver bullet and has limitations.  It prevents the creation of *new* atoms, but it doesn't prevent all forms of malicious code execution.  Thorough fuzzing is still essential even with `safe`.
    *   **Input Validation:**  Implement rigorous input validation *before* deserialization.  This is difficult for Erlang terms, but if the expected structure is known, some validation can be performed.  This is a defense-in-depth measure, not a primary solution.
    *   **Least Privilege:**  Run the application with the least necessary privileges.  This limits the damage an attacker can do if they achieve code execution.

### 4.2 Erlang Distribution Protocol Vulnerabilities

**Threat:**  An attacker can exploit weaknesses in the Erlang distribution protocol to connect to the application's Erlang node, send malicious messages, or disrupt communication between nodes.

**Analysis:**

*   **Network Configuration:**  Review the network configuration to ensure that the Erlang distribution port (default: 4369 for `epmd`, and dynamically assigned ports for node communication) is not exposed to untrusted networks.  Use firewalls and network segmentation to restrict access.
*   **Authentication and Authorization:**  Erlang distribution uses a "cookie" system for authentication.  Ensure that:
    *   A strong, randomly generated cookie is used.
    *   The cookie is kept secret and not exposed in logs or configuration files.
    *   Different cookies are used for different clusters or environments.
*   **Message Interception/Manipulation:**  While the distribution protocol itself doesn't provide encryption, consider using TLS/SSL for inter-node communication if confidentiality and integrity are required.  This can be achieved using the `ssl` application in OTP.
*   **Denial-of-Service (DoS):**  The Erlang distribution protocol can be vulnerable to DoS attacks.  Consider:
    *   Rate limiting connections to the distribution port.
    *   Monitoring resource usage (CPU, memory, network) to detect potential DoS attacks.
    *   Using a load balancer or other infrastructure-level protections to mitigate DoS attacks.
*   **`epmd` Vulnerabilities:**  The Erlang Port Mapper Daemon (`epmd`) is a critical component of the distribution protocol.  Ensure that:
    *   `epmd` is running with the least necessary privileges.
    *   `epmd` is not exposed to untrusted networks.
    *   Consider using a firewall to restrict access to `epmd`.
* **Fuzzing:** Develop a fuzzer that sends malformed or unexpected messages to the Erlang distribution port. This can help identify vulnerabilities in the application's handling of distributed messages.

**Mitigation:**

*   **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate the Erlang nodes on a private network, accessible only to trusted services.
*   **Strong Cookies:**  Use long, randomly generated cookies and manage them securely.
*   **TLS/SSL:**  Encrypt inter-node communication using TLS/SSL.
*   **Firewall Rules:**  Strictly control access to the Erlang distribution port (4369 and dynamic ports) using firewall rules.
*   **Monitoring and Alerting:**  Monitor the Erlang distribution system for suspicious activity and set up alerts for potential attacks.
*   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of the Erlang distribution configuration and code.

### 4.3 Vulnerabilities in OTP Libraries

**Threat:**  Vulnerabilities in commonly used OTP libraries (e.g., `gen_server`, `ssl`, `crypto`) can be exploited to compromise the application.

**Analysis:**

*   **Dependency Tracking:**  Maintain a comprehensive list of all OTP libraries and third-party Erlang dependencies used by the application.
*   **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Regularly scan these dependencies for known vulnerabilities using vulnerability databases (e.g., NIST NVD, Snyk, GitHub Security Advisories).
*   **Code Review (OTP Libraries):**  For critical OTP libraries, review the source code for potential security weaknesses, especially in areas related to input handling, authentication, and authorization.
*   **Update Dependencies:**  Keep all OTP libraries and dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.

**Mitigation:**

*   **Patching:**  Apply security patches for OTP libraries promptly.
*   **Dependency Management:**  Use a dependency management tool (e.g., Rebar3) to manage dependencies and ensure that they are up-to-date.
*   **Least Privilege:**  Run the application with the least necessary privileges.
*   **Secure Coding Practices:**  Follow secure coding practices when using OTP libraries, avoiding common pitfalls that could lead to vulnerabilities.

## 5. Conclusion

Exploiting Erlang/OTP vulnerabilities in a Gleam application is a significant threat.  While Gleam itself aims for safety, it relies on the underlying Erlang/OTP runtime, inheriting its potential weaknesses.  A multi-faceted approach involving static analysis, dynamic analysis, dependency management, and secure configuration is crucial to mitigate these risks.  The most important mitigation is to avoid using `erlang:binary_to_term` with untrusted input.  If it *must* be used, extreme caution, rigorous validation, and the `safe` option are essential, but not foolproof.  Securing the Erlang distribution protocol is also paramount, requiring network segmentation, strong authentication, and potentially TLS/SSL encryption.  Regular security audits and vulnerability scanning are vital for maintaining a strong security posture.
