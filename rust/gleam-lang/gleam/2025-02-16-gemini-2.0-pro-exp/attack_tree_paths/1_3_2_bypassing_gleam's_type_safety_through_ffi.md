# Deep Analysis: Bypassing Gleam Type Safety via FFI

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the feasibility and potential impact of bypassing Gleam's type safety guarantees by exploiting the Foreign Function Interface (FFI) mechanism, specifically by calling malicious Erlang code.  We aim to identify concrete vulnerabilities, propose mitigation strategies, and assess the overall risk associated with this attack vector.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the following attack path:

*   **1.3.2 Bypassing Gleam's type safety through FFI:**
    *   Crafting malicious Erlang code that violates Gleam's type guarantees. [CRITICAL]
    *   Using the FFI to call this malicious code. [CRITICAL]

The scope includes:

*   Understanding the Gleam FFI mechanism and its interaction with Erlang.
*   Identifying specific type-related vulnerabilities that can be introduced through malicious Erlang code.
*   Developing proof-of-concept exploits demonstrating these vulnerabilities.
*   Analyzing the potential consequences of successful exploitation (e.g., data corruption, unexpected behavior, crashes, potential for code execution).
*   Proposing concrete mitigation strategies to prevent or minimize the risk of this attack.

The scope *excludes*:

*   Other attack vectors against the Gleam application (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, etc.).
*   Vulnerabilities within the Erlang runtime itself (unless directly related to the FFI interaction with Gleam).
*   Attacks that do not involve the FFI.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Gleam FFI Review:**  Thoroughly examine the Gleam documentation and source code related to the FFI.  This includes understanding how Gleam types are mapped to Erlang types, how function calls are handled, and any existing security mechanisms or limitations.  We'll pay close attention to the `@external` attribute and how it's used.
2.  **Erlang Type System Analysis:**  Review the Erlang type system and identify potential areas where it differs significantly from Gleam's type system.  Focus on areas where Erlang's dynamic typing can be abused to circumvent Gleam's static typing.
3.  **Vulnerability Identification:**  Based on the FFI and Erlang type system analysis, hypothesize potential vulnerabilities.  This will involve identifying scenarios where malicious Erlang code can:
    *   Return values of unexpected types to Gleam.
    *   Cause type confusion within Gleam code.
    *   Violate Gleam's immutability guarantees.
    *   Trigger unexpected side effects due to type mismatches.
4.  **Proof-of-Concept Development:**  Develop proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits for each identified vulnerability.  These PoCs will consist of:
    *   Malicious Erlang code designed to violate Gleam's type safety.
    *   Gleam code that uses the FFI to call the malicious Erlang code.
    *   Demonstration of the resulting vulnerability (e.g., a crash, unexpected behavior, data corruption).
5.  **Impact Assessment:**  For each successful PoC, assess the potential impact of the vulnerability.  Consider factors such as:
    *   Severity (e.g., crash, data corruption, potential for code execution).
    *   Likelihood of exploitation.
    *   Difficulty of detection.
6.  **Mitigation Strategy Development:**  Propose concrete mitigation strategies to prevent or minimize the risk of each identified vulnerability.  These strategies may include:
    *   Input validation and sanitization on the Erlang side.
    *   Type checking and assertions on the Gleam side after FFI calls.
    *   Use of safer FFI patterns (e.g., restricting the types allowed through the FFI).
    *   Code reviews and security audits focusing on FFI usage.
    *   Runtime monitoring to detect type-related anomalies.
7.  **Documentation and Reporting:**  Document all findings, PoCs, impact assessments, and mitigation strategies in a clear and concise report.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.3.2

### 4.1.  Gleam FFI and Erlang Interaction

Gleam's FFI allows interaction with Erlang code using the `@external` attribute.  This attribute marks a Gleam function as being implemented in Erlang.  The compiler relies on the programmer to ensure type correctness across the FFI boundary.  This is a crucial point: *Gleam trusts the Erlang code to adhere to the declared types*.

Example:

```gleam
// Gleam code (my_module.gleam)
@external(erlang, "my_erlang_module", "add_one")
pub fn add_one(x: Int) -> Int
```

```erlang
% Erlang code (my_erlang_module.erl)
-module(my_erlang_module).
-export([add_one/1]).

add_one(X) when is_integer(X) -> X + 1.
```

In this *correct* example, the Erlang code respects the Gleam type signature.  However, the compiler does *not* enforce this.

### 4.2.  Vulnerability Identification: Type Mismatches

The primary vulnerability lies in the lack of runtime type enforcement across the FFI boundary.  Malicious Erlang code can violate the declared types, leading to various issues.

**Vulnerability 1: Returning an Incorrect Type**

*   **Description:** The Erlang code returns a value of a type different from the one declared in the Gleam FFI definition.
*   **Example:**

    ```gleam
    // Gleam code (my_module.gleam)
    @external(erlang, "my_erlang_module", "get_a_number")
    pub fn get_a_number() -> Int
    ```

    ```erlang
    % Erlang code (my_erlang_module.erl)
    -module(my_erlang_module).
    -export([get_a_number/0]).

    get_a_number() -> "This is not a number!".  % Malicious!
    ```

*   **Impact:**  This can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior when the Gleam code attempts to use the returned value as an integer.  Depending on how the incorrect value is used, it could lead to further type confusion and potentially more severe consequences.  If the Gleam code attempts to perform integer-specific operations on the string, it will likely crash the Erlang VM.

**Vulnerability 2:  Violating Immutability**

*   **Description:**  Gleam relies on immutability.  Malicious Erlang code could potentially modify data structures that Gleam expects to be immutable.
*   **Example:**  This is more subtle and depends on how Gleam handles data structures passed to Erlang. If Gleam passes a reference to an internal data structure, Erlang code *could* modify it directly.  This is less likely with simple types like integers and strings, but more plausible with complex data structures like lists or custom data types.  A dedicated investigation into how Gleam handles data structure marshalling across the FFI is needed.
*   **Impact:**  Violation of immutability can lead to extremely difficult-to-debug errors, as the state of the application becomes unpredictable.

**Vulnerability 3:  Side Effects and Type Confusion**

*   **Description:**  Erlang code could perform unexpected side effects based on incorrect type assumptions.  For example, if Gleam expects a function to return a specific enum variant, but the Erlang code returns a different variant, the Gleam code might branch incorrectly.
*   **Example:**

    ```gleam
    // Gleam code
    pub type Result {
      Ok(Int)
      Error(String)
    }

    @external(erlang, "my_erlang_module", "get_result")
    pub fn get_result() -> Result
    ```

    ```erlang
    % Erlang code
    -module(my_erlang_module).
    -export([get_result/0]).

    get_result() -> {ok, "Not an integer!"}. % Malicious!  Returns {ok, String} instead of {ok, Int}
    ```

*   **Impact:**  This can lead to logic errors and unexpected program behavior.  The severity depends on the specific logic that relies on the `Result` type.

### 4.3. Proof-of-Concept (Vulnerability 1)

We'll demonstrate Vulnerability 1 (Returning an Incorrect Type).

**Gleam Code (main.gleam):**

```gleam
import gleam/io
import gleam/int

@external(erlang, "malicious_erlang", "get_number")
pub fn get_number() -> Int

pub fn main() {
  let number = get_number()
  io.println(int.to_string(number + 1)) // This will likely crash
}
```

**Erlang Code (malicious_erlang.erl):**

```erlang
-module(malicious_erlang).
-export([get_number/0]).

get_number() ->
    "This is a string, not a number!".
```

**Compilation and Execution:**

1.  Compile the Erlang code: `erlc malicious_erlang.erl`
2.  Compile the Gleam code: `gleam build`
3.  Run the Gleam code: `gleam run`

**Expected Result:** The program will crash with an error similar to:

```
error: panic
┌─ :1
│ 
1 │ "This is a string, not a number!" + 1
  │ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

unexpected argument type

I was expecting an argument of type:

    Int

But I found an argument of type:

    #("This is a string, not a number!")
```

This demonstrates that the Erlang code successfully returned a string, violating the Gleam type signature, and causing a runtime crash.

### 4.4. Impact Assessment

The impact of these FFI-related type safety violations is **CRITICAL**.

*   **Severity:**  At a minimum, these vulnerabilities can lead to application crashes.  In more complex scenarios, they could lead to data corruption, incorrect program logic, and potentially even exploitable vulnerabilities if the type confusion can be manipulated to influence memory access or control flow.  The possibility of code execution, while less direct than in languages like C, cannot be entirely ruled out if the type confusion leads to highly unexpected behavior within the Erlang VM.
*   **Likelihood of Exploitation:**  The likelihood depends on the extent to which the application uses the FFI and the complexity of the interactions.  If the FFI is used extensively and with complex data types, the likelihood of introducing vulnerabilities is higher.
*   **Difficulty of Detection:**  These vulnerabilities can be difficult to detect through standard testing, as they may only manifest under specific conditions or with specific inputs.  Static analysis tools might not be able to fully analyze the Erlang code and identify type violations.

### 4.5. Mitigation Strategies

Several mitigation strategies can be employed to reduce the risk:

1.  **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization (Erlang Side):**  The most crucial mitigation is to implement rigorous input validation and sanitization *within the Erlang code itself*.  The Erlang code should *never* trust the input it receives from Gleam and should explicitly check that the input conforms to the expected types.  It should also ensure that the output it returns to Gleam *always* matches the declared type signature.  This is the first and most important line of defense.

2.  **Defensive Programming (Gleam Side):**  On the Gleam side, adopt a defensive programming approach.  After calling an FFI function, do *not* assume the returned value is of the correct type.  Instead, use pattern matching and type assertions to verify the type and handle potential errors gracefully.

    ```gleam
    import gleam/io
    import gleam/int
    import gleam/result

    @external(erlang, "malicious_erlang", "get_number")
    pub fn get_number() -> Int

    pub fn main() {
      let result = 
        case get_number() {
          x if gleam.is_int(x) -> Ok(x)
          _ -> Error("Invalid type returned from FFI")
        }

      case result {
        Ok(number) -> io.println(int.to_string(number + 1))
        Error(message) -> io.println("Error: " <> message)
      }
    }
    ```
    This example uses a hypothetical `gleam.is_int` function. While Gleam doesn't have a direct equivalent, the principle is to check the type *after* the FFI call. You might need to use a combination of pattern matching and potentially custom Erlang helper functions to achieve robust type checking.

3.  **Minimize FFI Surface Area:**  Reduce the use of the FFI to the absolute minimum necessary.  The less FFI code you have, the smaller the attack surface.

4.  **Code Reviews and Security Audits:**  Conduct thorough code reviews and security audits, paying special attention to the FFI interactions.  Ensure that both the Gleam and Erlang code are carefully scrutinized for potential type safety violations.

5.  **Safer FFI Patterns:**  Consider using safer FFI patterns, such as:
    *   **Restricting Types:**  Limit the types that can be passed through the FFI to simple, well-defined types (e.g., integers, booleans, strings).  Avoid passing complex data structures directly.
    *   **Wrapper Functions:**  Create wrapper functions in Erlang that perform strict type checking and validation before calling the core logic.
    *   **Serialization/Deserialization:**  Instead of passing raw data structures, serialize data to a well-defined format (e.g., JSON, Protocol Buffers) on the Gleam side and deserialize it on the Erlang side (and vice versa). This forces explicit type handling.

6.  **Runtime Monitoring:**  Implement runtime monitoring to detect type-related anomalies.  This could involve logging unexpected types or using specialized tools to track type information at runtime.

7. **Consider alternative to FFI:** If possible, consider rewriting the Erlang code in Gleam to eliminate the FFI boundary altogether. This provides the strongest type safety guarantees.

## 5. Conclusion

Bypassing Gleam's type safety through the FFI is a critical vulnerability.  The lack of runtime type enforcement across the FFI boundary allows malicious Erlang code to violate Gleam's type guarantees, leading to crashes, data corruption, and potentially more severe consequences.  The primary mitigation strategy is to implement rigorous input validation and sanitization on the Erlang side, combined with defensive programming techniques on the Gleam side.  Minimizing FFI usage, conducting thorough code reviews, and employing safer FFI patterns are also essential.  By implementing these mitigations, the risk associated with this attack vector can be significantly reduced.
