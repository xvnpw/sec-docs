# Deep Analysis: Incorrect FFI Usage in Gleam (Attack Tree Path 1.3.1)

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to identify and mitigate potential security vulnerabilities arising from the incorrect usage of the Foreign Function Interface (FFI) mechanism in a Gleam application, specifically when calling Erlang functions.  We aim to prevent attackers from exploiting these vulnerabilities to compromise the application's integrity, confidentiality, or availability.  This includes preventing code injection, denial-of-service, privilege escalation, and data breaches.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the following:

*   **Gleam Code:** All Gleam code within the target application that utilizes the `@external` attribute to interface with Erlang code.  This includes both direct calls to Erlang functions and indirect calls through Gleam wrapper functions.
*   **Erlang Code:**  The specific Erlang functions (and any functions they call) that are exposed to Gleam via the FFI.  This includes standard library functions, third-party library functions, and custom Erlang code written for the application.
*   **Data Flow:** The data passed between Gleam and Erlang through the FFI, including data types, validation (or lack thereof), and potential for untrusted input to reach vulnerable Erlang code.
* **Attack surface:** We will focus on the attack surface that is exposed by the FFI.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Vulnerabilities within the Gleam compiler or runtime itself (unless directly related to FFI handling).
*   Vulnerabilities in Erlang code that are *not* accessible via the FFI from Gleam.
*   General application security best practices unrelated to FFI (e.g., input validation *before* reaching the FFI boundary, which is still crucial but outside the scope of *this specific* analysis).

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will employ a combination of the following techniques:

1.  **Static Code Analysis (Automated and Manual):**
    *   **Automated Scanning:** Use tools (if available) that can identify `@external` annotations in Gleam code and potentially flag known-unsafe Erlang functions.  This might involve custom scripts or adapting existing linters.  The primary goal is to quickly identify *all* FFI call sites.
    *   **Manual Code Review:**  Carefully examine each identified FFI call site in the Gleam code.  This includes understanding the context of the call, the data being passed, and the expected behavior of the Erlang function.
    *   **Erlang Code Review:**  Thoroughly review the corresponding Erlang code for potential vulnerabilities.  This is the most critical step, as it's where the actual unsafe operations might occur.

2.  **Data Flow Analysis:**
    *   **Tracing Input:**  Identify how user-provided or otherwise untrusted data can reach the FFI boundary.  This involves tracing data paths from input points (e.g., HTTP requests, database queries) to the Gleam functions that make FFI calls.
    *   **Type Analysis:**  Examine the Gleam and Erlang types involved in the FFI calls.  Look for mismatches or potential type confusion vulnerabilities.  Gleam's strong typing helps, but it doesn't guarantee safety on the Erlang side.
    *   **Data Validation:**  Determine if data is validated *before* being passed to Erlang.  While this is a general best practice, it's particularly important at the FFI boundary.  Lack of validation here is a major red flag.

3.  **Dynamic Analysis (Optional, but Recommended):**
    *   **Fuzzing:**  If feasible, develop fuzzing tests that specifically target the FFI interface.  This involves sending malformed or unexpected data to the Gleam functions that call Erlang, and monitoring for crashes, errors, or unexpected behavior.
    *   **Penetration Testing:**  Simulate real-world attacks that attempt to exploit potential FFI vulnerabilities.  This can help identify weaknesses that might be missed during static analysis.

4.  **Documentation Review:**
    *   Review any existing documentation for the Gleam and Erlang code, paying close attention to any notes or warnings related to FFI usage or security considerations.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.3.1

**Attack Tree Path:** 1.3.1 Incorrect usage of FFI to call unsafe Erlang functions.

**Sub-Steps & Analysis:**

**1.3.1.a Identify FFI calls in the Gleam code. [CRITICAL]**

*   **Procedure:**
    1.  Use `grep` (or a similar tool) to search the Gleam codebase for the `@external` attribute:  `grep -r "@external" .`
    2.  For each identified `@external` instance, record:
        *   The Gleam file and line number.
        *   The Gleam function name.
        *   The Erlang module and function name being called.
        *   The Gleam types of the arguments and return value.
    3.  Create a table or spreadsheet to organize this information.  This will serve as a central inventory of all FFI calls.

*   **Example (Hypothetical):**

    ```gleam
    // in src/my_module.gleam
    @external(erlang, "my_erlang_module", "dangerous_function")
    pub fn call_dangerous(input: String) -> String
    ```

    This would be recorded as:

    | Gleam File        | Gleam Function | Erlang Module      | Erlang Function    | Arguments      | Return Value |
    | ----------------- | -------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ | -------------- | ------------ |
    | src/my_module.gleam | call_dangerous | my_erlang_module   | dangerous_function | String         | String       |

*   **Potential Issues:**
    *   **Indirect FFI Calls:**  A Gleam function might not use `@external` directly but could call *another* Gleam function that does.  The initial `grep` might miss these.  Manual code review is needed to identify these indirect calls.
    *   **Dynamic Erlang Calls:**  While less common, it's theoretically possible to construct Erlang calls dynamically (e.g., using `erlang:apply/3`).  These would be extremely difficult to detect statically and represent a high risk.  Look for any use of `erlang:apply` or similar functions in the Erlang code.

**1.3.1.b Analyze the Erlang code being called for vulnerabilities. [CRITICAL]**

*   **Procedure:**
    1.  For each Erlang function identified in step 1.3.1.a, perform a thorough security-focused code review.
    2.  Focus on the following potential vulnerabilities:
        *   **Code Injection:**  Does the Erlang function use the input from Gleam to construct and execute code (e.g., using `erlang:eval/1`, `erlang:spawn/3` with dynamically generated code, or shell commands)?  This is the most severe risk.
        *   **Buffer Overflows:**  Does the Erlang function manipulate binaries or lists in a way that could lead to a buffer overflow?  Erlang's built-in data structures are generally safe, but improper use of `binary:copy/3`, `list_to_binary/1`, or NIFs (Native Implemented Functions) could introduce vulnerabilities.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Could the Erlang function be tricked into entering an infinite loop, consuming excessive resources (CPU, memory), or crashing the Erlang VM?  Look for unbounded recursion, large allocations, or operations with potentially high complexity based on input size.
        *   **Information Disclosure:**  Does the Erlang function expose sensitive information (e.g., internal state, file contents, credentials) based on the input from Gleam?
        *   **Improper Error Handling:**  Does the Erlang function handle errors (e.g., invalid input, file not found) gracefully?  Uncaught exceptions could lead to crashes or reveal internal information.
        *   **Use of Unsafe Functions:**  Be particularly wary of Erlang functions known to be potentially dangerous, such as:
            *   `erlang:system_info/1` (can reveal system information)
            *   `erlang:halt/1` (can terminate the VM)
            *   `file:write_file/2` (without proper path sanitization)
            *   Functions related to process management (if misused)
            *   Any function that interacts with the external environment (e.g., network sockets, filesystems) without proper validation.
        * **Type Confusion** Check if Erlang code is making assumptions about the data type.
    3.  Document any identified vulnerabilities, including:
        *   A description of the vulnerability.
        *   The specific Erlang code that is vulnerable.
        *   The potential impact of the vulnerability.
        *   Recommended remediation steps.

*   **Example (Hypothetical - Code Injection):**

    ```erlang
    % in my_erlang_module.erl
    dangerous_function(Input) ->
        erlang:apply(list_to_atom(Input), some_function, []).
    ```

    This is highly vulnerable to code injection.  If `Input` is controlled by an attacker, they can specify any Erlang atom, effectively calling any function in the system.

    **Vulnerability Report:**

    *   **Vulnerability:** Code Injection
    *   **Location:** `my_erlang_module:dangerous_function/1`
    *   **Impact:**  Complete system compromise.  An attacker can execute arbitrary Erlang code.
    *   **Remediation:**  *Never* use user-provided input to construct function names or atoms.  Refactor the code to use a whitelist of allowed functions or a different mechanism entirely.

*   **Example (Hypothetical - Denial of Service):**

    ```erlang
    % in my_erlang_module.erl
    recursive_function(N) when is_integer(N) ->
        recursive_function(N + 1).
    ```
     If Gleam code calls `recursive_function` and does not check if `N` is a negative number, it will lead to stack overflow.

    **Vulnerability Report:**

    *   **Vulnerability:** Denial of Service (Stack Overflow)
    *   **Location:** `my_erlang_module:recursive_function/1`
    *   **Impact:**  Crash the Erlang VM, making the application unavailable.
    *   **Remediation:**  Add a base case to the recursion to prevent infinite loops, or limit the recursion depth. Validate input `N` in Gleam code.

## 5. Remediation and Mitigation

For each identified vulnerability, implement appropriate remediation steps.  These may include:

*   **Refactoring Erlang Code:**  Modify the Erlang code to eliminate the vulnerability.  This is the preferred solution.
*   **Adding Input Validation (Gleam and/or Erlang):**  Validate data *before* it is passed to the vulnerable Erlang function.  This can be done in Gleam, Erlang, or both.  Validation should be as strict as possible, based on the expected data type and format.
*   **Using Safer Alternatives:**  If possible, replace the vulnerable Erlang function with a safer alternative.
*   **Removing the FFI Call:**  In some cases, the best solution might be to remove the FFI call entirely and implement the functionality in Gleam.
* **Adding appropriate tests:** Add tests that will cover identified vulnerability.

## 6. Conclusion

This deep analysis provides a structured approach to identifying and mitigating security risks associated with FFI calls from Gleam to Erlang. By systematically examining both the Gleam and Erlang code, and carefully analyzing data flow, we can significantly reduce the likelihood of attackers exploiting these vulnerabilities.  Regular security reviews and updates are crucial to maintain the ongoing security of the application. The combination of static analysis, data flow analysis, and (optional) dynamic analysis provides a strong defense against FFI-related vulnerabilities.
