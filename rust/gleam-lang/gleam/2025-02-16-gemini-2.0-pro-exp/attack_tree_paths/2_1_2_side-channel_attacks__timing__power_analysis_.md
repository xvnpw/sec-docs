# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 2.1.2 Side-Channel Attacks (Timing, Power Analysis)

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to identify, assess, and mitigate potential vulnerabilities within a Gleam application that could be exploited through side-channel attacks, specifically focusing on timing and power analysis attacks.  We aim to provide actionable recommendations to the development team to harden the application against these threats.  The ultimate goal is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive data processed by the application, even in the presence of an attacker with physical access or the ability to monitor system resources.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses on the following aspects of the Gleam application:

*   **Cryptographic Operations:**  Any use of cryptographic libraries (e.g., for encryption, hashing, digital signatures) within the Gleam code or its Erlang/OTP dependencies is a primary target.  This includes both standard library functions and any third-party libraries.
*   **Sensitive Data Handling:**  Code that processes, stores, or transmits sensitive data (e.g., passwords, API keys, personal information, financial data) is in scope.  This includes data serialization/deserialization, database interactions, and network communication.
*   **Conditional Logic Based on Secrets:**  Any `if`, `case`, or other conditional statements whose execution path depends on secret values are critical areas of concern.  This includes comparisons, loops, and function calls that might be influenced by secret data.
*   **External Dependencies:**  The analysis will consider the potential for side-channel vulnerabilities introduced by external dependencies, particularly those written in Erlang or C (via NIFs - Native Implemented Functions).  We will focus on commonly used libraries and those known to have potential side-channel issues.
*   **Gleam Runtime and BEAM VM:** While we won't delve into the deep internals of the BEAM VM itself, we will consider how Gleam's compilation to Erlang and the BEAM's execution model might introduce timing variations.

**Out of Scope:**

*   **Hardware-Level Attacks:**  This analysis does not cover attacks that require specialized hardware or extremely precise measurements (e.g., electromagnetic radiation analysis).  We focus on vulnerabilities exploitable through software-based timing and power analysis.
*   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks:** While timing variations *could* be used for DoS, this analysis prioritizes information leakage.
*   **Speculative Execution Attacks (Spectre/Meltdown):** These are CPU-level vulnerabilities and are outside the scope of this application-level analysis.  Mitigation for these is typically handled at the OS/hardware level.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will employ a combination of the following techniques:

1.  **Code Review:**  Manual inspection of the Gleam source code, focusing on the areas identified in the Scope section.  We will look for patterns known to be susceptible to timing attacks, such as:
    *   Secret-dependent branches.
    *   Variable-time cryptographic operations.
    *   Loops whose iteration count depends on secret data.
    *   Array indexing or data access patterns influenced by secrets.
    *   Use of non-constant-time comparison functions.

2.  **Dependency Analysis:**  Examination of the project's dependencies (listed in `gleam.toml` and any Erlang dependencies) to identify known vulnerabilities or libraries that require careful usage to avoid side-channel leaks.  We will consult vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE) and security advisories for relevant information.

3.  **Static Analysis (Limited):**  While Gleam doesn't have extensive static analysis tools specifically for side-channel analysis, we will leverage any available tools that can detect potential security issues or code smells that might indicate timing vulnerabilities.  This may include general-purpose linters and security-focused tools for Erlang/OTP.

4.  **Dynamic Analysis (Timing Measurements):**  We will develop targeted test cases to measure the execution time of critical code sections under different input conditions.  This will involve:
    *   Creating inputs that exercise different code paths based on secret values.
    *   Using high-resolution timers (e.g., `erlang:monotonic_time/0`, `os:perf_counter/0`) to measure execution time.
    *   Repeating measurements multiple times to account for noise and variations.
    *   Analyzing the timing data for statistically significant differences that could reveal information about the secret inputs.
    *   Using tools like `eprof`, `cprof`, and `fprof` to profile the application and identify potential timing bottlenecks.

5.  **Threat Modeling:**  We will consider various attacker models and scenarios to assess the feasibility and impact of potential side-channel attacks.  This will help prioritize mitigation efforts.

6.  **Documentation Review:**  We will review the documentation of any cryptographic libraries or security-sensitive functions used in the application to understand their security properties and recommended usage patterns.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 2.1.2 Side-Channel Attacks (Timing, Power Analysis)

**4.1. Analyze for side-channel leaks. [CRITICAL]**

This is the overarching goal.  We break it down into specific attack vectors:

**4.2. Exploit timing differences. [CRITICAL]**

This is the specific attack vector we're focusing on.  Here's a detailed analysis:

**4.2.1. Potential Vulnerabilities in Gleam/Erlang:**

*   **String Comparisons:**  Gleam's string comparison (and Erlang's) is *not* constant-time.  Comparing strings of different lengths will take different amounts of time.  If an attacker can control one side of a string comparison where the other side is a secret (e.g., a password hash, an HMAC), they can potentially deduce the secret by measuring the comparison time.

    *   **Example (Vulnerable):**
        ```gleam
        pub fn verify_password(attempt: String, stored_hash: String) -> Bool {
          attempt == stored_hash
        }
        ```
        An attacker could try different password lengths and prefixes, observing the time it takes for the comparison to return `False`.

    *   **Mitigation:** Use a constant-time comparison function.  Gleam itself doesn't provide one in the standard library, but you can use a library like `erlang-otp/crypto` (available to Gleam) which provides `crypto:equal/2`.

        ```gleam
        import gleam/erlang/crypto // Assuming you have the erlang-otp package

        pub fn verify_password(attempt: String, stored_hash: String) -> Bool {
          crypto.equal(attempt, stored_hash)
        }
        ```

*   **Pattern Matching on Secrets:**  While Gleam's pattern matching is generally efficient, the order of clauses in a `case` expression *could* introduce timing variations if the matching process depends on secret data.  This is less likely to be a major issue than string comparisons, but it's worth considering.

    *   **Example (Potentially Vulnerable):**
        ```gleam
        pub fn process_data(data: ByteArray, key: ByteArray) -> Result(ByteArray, Error) {
          case crypto.decrypt(data, key) {
            Ok(plaintext) -> Ok(process_plaintext(plaintext))
            Error(BadKey) -> Error(BadKey) // Might be faster if the key is completely wrong
            Error(OtherError) -> Error(OtherError)
          }
        }
        ```
        If `crypto.decrypt` returns `Error(BadKey)` much faster when the key is entirely incorrect than when it's partially correct, an attacker might be able to gain information about the key.

    *   **Mitigation:**  Ensure that all branches of a `case` expression that handle secret-dependent data take approximately the same amount of time.  This might involve adding dummy operations or padding to equalize execution time.  Ideally, the underlying cryptographic library should be constant-time.

*   **Looping Based on Secrets:**  Loops whose number of iterations depends on a secret value are a classic source of timing leaks.

    *   **Example (Vulnerable):**
        ```gleam
        pub fn count_bits(secret: Int) -> Int {
          let mut count = 0
          let mut n = secret
          while n > 0 {
            if n % 2 == 1 {
              count = count + 1
            }
            n = n / 2
          }
          count
        }
        ```
        The number of loop iterations directly depends on the value of `secret`.

    *   **Mitigation:**  Avoid loops whose iteration count is secret-dependent.  If possible, restructure the algorithm to use a fixed number of iterations.  If not, consider techniques like loop unrolling or adding dummy operations to make the execution time independent of the secret.

*   **Array/List Access Based on Secrets:**  Accessing elements in an array or list at an index derived from a secret can also leak information.

    *   **Example (Potentially Vulnerable):**
        ```gleam
        pub fn lookup(index: Int, data: List(Int)) -> Int {
          list.at(data, index) // Access time might vary slightly depending on index
        }
        ```
        If `index` is derived from a secret, the time taken to access the element might reveal information about the index.

    *   **Mitigation:**  Avoid using secret-derived values as indices directly.  If possible, use a constant-time lookup mechanism or ensure that all possible indices are accessed in a way that doesn't leak timing information.

*   **Cryptography (erlang-otp/crypto):**  The `erlang-otp/crypto` library is generally well-vetted, but it's crucial to use it correctly.  Incorrect usage can introduce timing vulnerabilities.

    *   **Example (Vulnerable):** Using a non-constant-time implementation of a cryptographic algorithm.  (This is less likely with `crypto`, but possible with custom NIFs or poorly written Erlang code.)
    *   **Mitigation:**  Use the recommended algorithms and modes of operation from `crypto`.  Consult the documentation carefully.  Avoid rolling your own cryptographic implementations.  Use constant-time comparison functions (like `crypto:equal/2`) for comparing cryptographic outputs.

*   **Native Implemented Functions (NIFs):**  If your Gleam application uses NIFs (written in C), these are a *major* area of concern.  C code is much more prone to timing vulnerabilities than Erlang/Gleam code.

    *   **Mitigation:**  Thoroughly audit any NIFs for timing vulnerabilities.  Use constant-time programming techniques in C.  Consider using libraries specifically designed for constant-time cryptography (e.g., libsodium).  If possible, avoid NIFs for security-critical operations.

* **Database Interactions:** If the database queries are constructed based on secret data, the query execution time might leak information.

    * **Example (Potentially Vulnerable):**
        ```gleam
        // Assuming a hypothetical database library
        pub fn get_user_data(db: DbConnection, username: String, secret_id: Int) -> Result(UserData, Error) {
          db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND secret_field = ?", [username, secret_id])
        }
        ```
        If `secret_field` is indexed, and the database uses a different query plan depending on the value of `secret_id`, the execution time could leak information.

    * **Mitigation:** Use parameterized queries with placeholders (as shown above) to avoid constructing queries directly from secret data.  Ensure that database indexes are used consistently and don't introduce timing variations based on secret values.  Consider using constant-time comparison functions within the database if necessary (if the database supports it).

**4.2.2. Actionable Recommendations:**

1.  **Mandatory Constant-Time Comparisons:**  Enforce the use of `crypto:equal/2` (or an equivalent constant-time comparison function) for all comparisons involving secrets or data derived from secrets.  This is the *most critical* mitigation.

2.  **Cryptographic Library Review:**  Thoroughly review the usage of the `erlang-otp/crypto` library (or any other cryptographic library) to ensure it's being used correctly and securely.  Verify that the chosen algorithms and modes of operation are appropriate for the application's security requirements.

3.  **NIF Audit:**  If NIFs are used, perform a rigorous security audit of the C code, focusing on timing vulnerabilities.  Prioritize eliminating or rewriting NIFs that handle sensitive data.

4.  **Code Review Checklist:**  Develop a code review checklist that specifically addresses timing vulnerabilities.  This checklist should include items like:
    *   No secret-dependent string comparisons without `crypto:equal/2`.
    *   No loops whose iteration count depends on secrets.
    *   No array/list access using secret-derived indices.
    *   Careful review of `case` expressions involving secrets.
    *   Verification of constant-time behavior in cryptographic operations.

5.  **Timing Tests:**  Implement automated timing tests that measure the execution time of critical code paths under different input conditions.  These tests should be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to detect regressions.

6.  **Training:**  Provide training to the development team on side-channel attacks and constant-time programming techniques.

7.  **Dependency Management:**  Regularly update dependencies to address any known security vulnerabilities, including those related to side-channel attacks.

8. **Database Query Review:** Ensure all database queries are parameterized and do not leak information through execution time variations.

By implementing these recommendations, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of timing-based side-channel attacks in the Gleam application.  Regular security reviews and testing are essential to maintain a strong security posture.
