# Deep Analysis of Gleam FFI Exploitation (Attack Tree Path 1.3)

## 1. Objective

This deep analysis aims to thoroughly investigate the potential for exploiting the Foreign Function Interface (FFI) in Gleam applications.  We will examine how an attacker might leverage vulnerabilities in FFI usage to compromise the application's security, specifically focusing on bypassing Gleam's type safety and introducing memory corruption.  The ultimate goal is to provide actionable recommendations for developers to mitigate these risks.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the following aspects of FFI exploitation within a Gleam application:

*   **Incorrect FFI Usage:**  Analyzing common mistakes developers make when interacting with Erlang (or potentially JavaScript, though Erlang is the primary target due to its closer integration with Gleam) through the FFI.
*   **Type Safety Bypass:**  Investigating how an attacker can circumvent Gleam's strong type system by manipulating FFI calls and data passed between Gleam and the foreign language.
*   **Memory Corruption:**  Examining how incorrect FFI usage can lead to memory corruption vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, use-after-free errors, and double-free vulnerabilities, within the Erlang/BEAM VM or the host system (if interacting with native code via Erlang NIFs).
* **Gleam code interacting with Erlang:** The analysis will focus on Gleam code that uses the FFI to interact with Erlang code, as this is the most common and relevant scenario.  While Gleam can also target JavaScript, the risks associated with Erlang FFI are generally higher due to the potential for memory corruption within the BEAM VM.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   General Erlang security vulnerabilities unrelated to Gleam's FFI.
*   Vulnerabilities in the Gleam compiler itself (unless directly related to FFI code generation).
*   Attacks that do not involve exploiting the FFI (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methodologies:

1.  **Code Review:**  We will examine example Gleam code that uses the FFI, both correct and intentionally incorrect examples, to identify potential vulnerabilities.  This will include reviewing the generated Erlang code to understand how Gleam's FFI translates to Erlang.
2.  **Vulnerability Research:**  We will research known Erlang vulnerabilities and how they might be triggered through Gleam's FFI.  This includes looking at CVEs related to Erlang's `erlang:open_port/2`, `erlang:binary_to_term/1`, and other potentially dangerous functions.
3.  **Threat Modeling:**  We will develop threat models to identify realistic attack scenarios where an attacker could exploit FFI vulnerabilities.
4.  **Best Practices Analysis:** We will identify and document best practices for secure FFI usage in Gleam, drawing from Gleam's documentation, Erlang security guidelines, and general secure coding principles.
5.  **Tooling Analysis:** We will explore the use of static analysis tools (if available for Gleam or Erlang) that can help detect potential FFI vulnerabilities.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.3: Exploit FFI

This section dives into the specific attack vectors outlined in the attack tree path.

### 4.1 Incorrect Usage of FFI to Call Unsafe Erlang Functions

Gleam's FFI allows calling Erlang functions directly.  While this provides flexibility, it also opens the door to using inherently unsafe Erlang functions if not handled carefully.

**Examples of Risky Erlang Functions:**

*   **`erlang:open_port/2` (with `binary` option):**  This function can be used to create ports that communicate with external processes.  If the external process is untrusted or the data exchanged is not properly validated, it can lead to arbitrary code execution.  An attacker might craft malicious input that, when processed by the external program, exploits a vulnerability in *that* program, leading to a compromise of the Erlang VM.  Even without an external program, improper handling of binary data received through the port can lead to vulnerabilities.
*   **`erlang:binary_to_term/1` (and `erlang:binary_to_term/2` with unsafe options):**  This function deserializes Erlang terms from binary data.  If the binary data is attacker-controlled, it can be crafted to create arbitrary Erlang terms, potentially leading to denial-of-service (by creating deeply nested terms) or, in some cases, code execution (if the term contains executable code or triggers unsafe behavior in the application).  The `safe` option should *always* be used.
*   **`erlang:load_module/2`:**  This function loads Erlang modules.  If an attacker can control the module name or path, they could load a malicious module, leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **NIFs (Native Implemented Functions):**  Erlang allows calling native code (C, C++, Rust, etc.) through NIFs.  If a Gleam application uses a NIF (either directly or through an Erlang library), any vulnerability in the NIF code (e.g., buffer overflow, use-after-free) can be exploited to compromise the entire Erlang VM.  Gleam's type safety does *not* extend to NIFs.
* **`erlang:process_flag(trap_exit, true)`:** While not directly unsafe, misusing exit traps in combination with FFI calls can lead to unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities. If a linked process (potentially one spawned via FFI) crashes, and `trap_exit` is enabled, the calling process receives an exit signal. Improper handling of this signal can lead to application crashes or inconsistent state.

**Example (Incorrect Usage):**

```gleam
// Gleam code
import gleam/string
import gleam/erlang/io

pub fn unsafe_deserialize(data: String) -> Result(Dynamic, String) {
  let binary = string.to_binary(data)
  let result = io.call(erlang.binary_to_term, [binary]) // UNSAFE! No 'safe' option.
  Ok(result)
}
```

This code is vulnerable because it uses `erlang:binary_to_term/1` without the `safe` option.  An attacker could provide a malicious binary string that, when deserialized, causes a denial-of-service or potentially worse.

**Mitigation:**

*   **Avoid Unnecessary FFI:**  Use Gleam's built-in functions and libraries whenever possible.  Only use the FFI when absolutely necessary.
*   **Whitelist Safe Functions:**  If you must use the FFI, create a whitelist of allowed Erlang functions and strictly enforce it.  Do not allow arbitrary Erlang function calls.
*   **Use Safe Options:**  Always use the safest options available for Erlang functions.  For example, use `erlang:binary_to_term/2` with the `safe` option.
*   **Validate Input:**  Thoroughly validate all data passed to Erlang functions through the FFI, treating it as untrusted input.  Use Gleam's type system to enforce strong typing on the data before passing it to Erlang.
*   **Validate Output:** Validate the data received *from* Erlang functions. Don't assume the Erlang code is behaving correctly.
*   **Consider Wrappers:** Create Gleam wrapper functions around Erlang FFI calls to encapsulate the unsafe operations and provide a safe interface to the rest of the Gleam code.

### 4.2 Bypassing Gleam's Type Safety through FFI

Gleam's strong type system is a key security feature.  However, the FFI acts as a boundary where this type safety can be circumvented.  An attacker can exploit this by:

*   **Passing Incorrect Types:**  Passing data of an incorrect type to an Erlang function.  For example, passing a Gleam `String` where an Erlang `integer()` is expected.  While Gleam might prevent this directly, an attacker could manipulate the data *within* the Erlang side to cause type confusion.
*   **Receiving Incorrect Types:**  Receiving data of an unexpected type from an Erlang function.  For example, an Erlang function might return a `binary()` when Gleam expects a `list(integer())`.  This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes in the Gleam code.
*   **Mutable Data:** Erlang has mutable data structures (e.g., ETS tables, process dictionaries).  If a Gleam application interacts with these mutable structures through the FFI, it can introduce race conditions and other concurrency issues that are difficult to reason about and can lead to vulnerabilities.
*   **Opaque Types:** Gleam allows defining opaque types that are represented differently in Erlang.  Incorrect handling of opaque types across the FFI boundary can lead to type confusion and vulnerabilities.

**Example (Type Bypass):**

```gleam
// Gleam code
import gleam/string
import gleam/int
import gleam/erlang/io

pub opaque MyInt

pub fn create_my_int(value: Int) -> MyInt {
  value // In Erlang, this is just an integer
}

pub fn get_my_int_value(my_int: MyInt) -> Int {
    //Assume that erlang function always return integer
  io.call(my_erlang_module, get_value, [my_int])
}

// Erlang code (my_erlang_module.erl)
-module(my_erlang_module).
-export([get_value/1]).

get_value(X) ->
  case X of
    1 -> "not an integer"; % Maliciously return a string
    _ -> X + 1
  end.
```

In this example, the Erlang function `get_value/1` can return a string even though the Gleam code expects an integer. This bypasses Gleam's type safety and could lead to a crash or unexpected behavior.

**Mitigation:**

*   **Strict Type Conversions:**  Perform explicit type conversions between Gleam and Erlang types.  Do not rely on implicit conversions.
*   **Type Assertions:**  Use type assertions (if available) to verify the types of data received from Erlang.
*   **Immutability:**  Prefer immutable data structures when interacting with Erlang through the FFI.  Avoid using mutable Erlang data structures if possible.
*   **Careful Opaque Type Handling:**  Be extremely careful when using opaque types.  Ensure that the Gleam and Erlang representations of the opaque type are consistent and that all operations on the opaque type are handled correctly on both sides of the FFI boundary.
* **Defensive Programming:** Assume that the Erlang code might return unexpected data. Include error handling and type checking to gracefully handle these cases.

### 4.3 Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities in the FFI Layer

Memory corruption vulnerabilities are particularly dangerous because they can lead to arbitrary code execution.  In the context of Gleam's FFI, these vulnerabilities can arise from:

*   **Buffer Overflows:**  If a Gleam application passes a string or binary to an Erlang function that does not properly handle the size of the input, it can lead to a buffer overflow in the Erlang VM. This is especially relevant when interacting with NIFs.
*   **Use-After-Free:**  If a Gleam application passes a reference to an Erlang term to an Erlang function, and the Erlang function frees the term while the Gleam application still holds a reference to it, a use-after-free vulnerability can occur.
*   **Double-Free:**  If a Gleam application and an Erlang function both attempt to free the same memory, a double-free vulnerability can occur.
*   **Incorrect Memory Management in NIFs:**  NIFs are written in native code (e.g., C) and are responsible for their own memory management.  Any memory management errors in a NIF can lead to memory corruption in the Erlang VM.

**Example (Buffer Overflow - Conceptual, NIF-related):**

```gleam
// Gleam code (simplified)
import gleam/string
import gleam/erlang/nif // Hypothetical NIF module

pub fn process_string(data: String) -> Result(Nil, String) {
  nif.process_string(data) // Calls a NIF function
}

// C code (NIF - vulnerable)
// WARNING: This is highly simplified and illustrative. Real NIFs are more complex.
ERL_NIF_TERM process_string(ErlNifEnv* env, int argc, const ERL_NIF_TERM argv[]) {
  char buffer[10]; // Small buffer
  ErlNifBinary bin;
  if (enif_inspect_binary(env, argv[0], &bin)) {
    // UNSAFE: No size check!
    memcpy(buffer, bin.data, bin.size);
    // ... process buffer ...
  }
  return enif_make_atom(env, "ok");
}
```

If the `data` string in the Gleam code is longer than 10 bytes, the `memcpy` in the C code will cause a buffer overflow.

**Mitigation:**

*   **Careful String and Binary Handling:**  Be extremely careful when passing strings and binaries to Erlang functions, especially NIFs.  Always check the size of the data and ensure that the Erlang code (or NIF) handles it correctly.
*   **Use Safe Libraries:**  Use well-vetted Erlang libraries that are known to be secure and handle memory management correctly.
*   **NIF Auditing:**  If you use NIFs, thoroughly audit the NIF code for memory safety vulnerabilities.  Use memory safety tools (e.g., Valgrind, AddressSanitizer) to detect potential issues.
*   **Resource Management:** Implement robust resource management to prevent use-after-free and double-free vulnerabilities.  Consider using reference counting or other techniques to ensure that memory is freed only when it is no longer in use.
* **Avoid NIFs if Possible:** NIFs introduce a significant risk of memory corruption. If possible, avoid using NIFs and find alternative solutions using pure Erlang or Gleam code.

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

Exploiting the FFI in Gleam applications is a high-risk attack vector.  While Gleam's type system provides strong protection, the FFI creates a boundary where this protection can be bypassed.  Developers must be extremely diligent when using the FFI to avoid introducing vulnerabilities.

**Key Recommendations:**

1.  **Minimize FFI Usage:**  The most effective way to mitigate FFI vulnerabilities is to minimize its use.  Rely on Gleam's built-in features and libraries whenever possible.
2.  **Strict Input/Output Validation:**  Treat all data crossing the FFI boundary as untrusted.  Thoroughly validate all input to and output from Erlang functions.
3.  **Use Safe Erlang Functions:**  Avoid using inherently unsafe Erlang functions.  If you must use them, use the safest options available and carefully validate all parameters.
4.  **NIF Security:**  If you use NIFs, prioritize their security.  Audit the NIF code thoroughly and use memory safety tools.  Consider alternatives to NIFs if possible.
5.  **Defensive Programming:**  Write defensive code that anticipates potential errors and unexpected behavior from Erlang functions.
6.  **Stay Updated:** Keep Gleam, Erlang, and any related libraries up to date to benefit from the latest security patches.
7. **Security Audits:** Regularly conduct security audits of your Gleam application, paying particular attention to FFI usage.
8. **Tooling:** Explore and utilize static analysis tools that can help identify potential FFI vulnerabilities in Gleam and Erlang code.

By following these recommendations, developers can significantly reduce the risk of FFI exploitation in their Gleam applications and build more secure and robust systems.
