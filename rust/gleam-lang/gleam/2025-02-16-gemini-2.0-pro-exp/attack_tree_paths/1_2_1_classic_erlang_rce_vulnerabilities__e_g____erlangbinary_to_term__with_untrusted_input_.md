# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Erlang RCE via `binary_to_term`

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to determine the risk and exploitability of classic Erlang Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities, specifically focusing on the misuse of `erlang:binary_to_term` and related functions, within a Gleam application.  We aim to identify if the application is susceptible to this type of attack and, if so, to understand the potential impact and mitigation strategies.

## 2. Scope

This analysis is scoped to the following:

*   **Target Application:**  A Gleam application (details of the specific application should be inserted here - e.g., "The 'AcmeCorp Customer Portal' Gleam application").  This includes all Gleam code, any integrated Erlang libraries (including standard libraries), and any external Erlang/OTP applications it interacts with.
*   **Vulnerability Focus:**  Specifically, the use of `erlang:binary_to_term/1`, `erlang:binary_to_term/2` (with unsafe options), and any other Erlang functions that deserialize external data into Erlang terms without proper validation (e.g., functions within custom NIFs or ports that might perform similar deserialization).  We will also consider Gleam wrappers around these functions.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Untrusted input provided to the application that could be passed to these vulnerable functions.  This includes, but is not limited to:
    *   User-supplied data via web forms, API requests, or message queues.
    *   Data received from external services or databases.
    *   Configuration files or environment variables that could be manipulated by an attacker.
* **Exclusion:** We are not analyzing *all* possible RCE vulnerabilities in Erlang/Gleam, only those related to unsafe term deserialization.  Other attack vectors (e.g., exploiting vulnerabilities in specific libraries) are out of scope for *this specific analysis*, although they should be considered separately.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Code Review (Static Analysis):**
    *   **Gleam Codebase Search:**  We will use tools like `grep`, `rg` (ripgrep), or Gleam's language server (if it provides suitable cross-module analysis) to search the entire Gleam codebase for:
        *   Direct calls to `erlang:binary_to_term`.
        *   Calls to any Gleam functions that might wrap `erlang:binary_to_term` (e.g., functions in `gleam/otp` or custom modules).
        *   Use of Erlang interop features (`@external` attribute) that might call Erlang functions performing unsafe deserialization.
        *   Identification of any custom Native Implemented Functions (NIFs) written in C or Rust that interact with Erlang terms and might be vulnerable.
    *   **Dependency Analysis:**  We will examine the application's dependencies (listed in `gleam.toml`) to identify any Erlang or Gleam libraries that are known to be vulnerable or that might contain unsafe deserialization logic.  This includes checking for outdated versions of libraries with known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Data Flow Analysis:**  For any identified uses of `erlang:binary_to_term` or related functions, we will trace the data flow backward to determine the source of the input.  We will identify if the input originates from an untrusted source.  This is crucial to determine if the vulnerability is exploitable.

2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Testing):**
    *   **Fuzzing:** If potential vulnerabilities are identified, we will use fuzzing techniques to test the application with a wide range of malformed and potentially malicious inputs.  This will help confirm if the vulnerability is exploitable and assess its impact.  Tools like `PropEr` (for Erlang) or custom fuzzing scripts can be used.
    *   **Penetration Testing:**  We will attempt to craft specific malicious payloads that, when deserialized, would execute arbitrary code.  This will demonstrate the practical exploitability of the vulnerability.
    *   **Runtime Monitoring:** We will monitor the application's behavior during testing, looking for signs of unexpected code execution, crashes, or other anomalies that might indicate a successful exploit.

3.  **Risk Assessment:**
    *   Based on the findings of the static and dynamic analysis, we will assess the overall risk posed by this vulnerability.  This will consider the likelihood of exploitation (based on the accessibility of the vulnerable code and the nature of the input) and the potential impact (e.g., data breach, system compromise).

4.  **Mitigation Recommendations:**
    *   We will provide specific recommendations for mitigating the identified vulnerabilities.  This will likely involve using safer alternatives to `erlang:binary_to_term`, implementing robust input validation, and/or applying other security best practices.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.2.1

**4.1. Identify if the Gleam application uses `erlang:binary_to_term` or similar functions. [CRITICAL]**

This is the core of the static analysis.  We'll perform the following searches:

*   **Direct `erlang:binary_to_term` calls:**
    ```bash
    rg "erlang:binary_to_term" -g "*.gleam"
    ```
    This command uses `ripgrep` to search for the string "erlang:binary_to_term" within all `.gleam` files in the project.  A similar search should be performed within any Erlang code (`.erl` files) if the Gleam application interacts with Erlang modules directly.

*   **Gleam wrappers:**  We need to examine the `gleam/otp` library and any other relevant libraries for functions that might wrap `erlang:binary_to_term`.  This requires careful examination of the library's source code.  For example, if we find a function like `gleam_otp.decode_term`, we need to investigate its implementation to see if it uses `erlang:binary_to_term` internally.

*   **Erlang Interop (`@external`):**
    ```bash
    rg "@external" -g "*.gleam"
    ```
    This searches for the `@external` attribute, which indicates that a Gleam function is calling an Erlang function.  We need to examine each of these external functions to determine if they perform any deserialization of Erlang terms.  This requires looking at the corresponding Erlang code.

*   **Custom NIFs:**  If the application uses custom NIFs (written in C or Rust), we need to examine their source code for any functions that interact with Erlang terms.  Specifically, we need to look for functions that convert binary data into Erlang terms (e.g., using the Erlang NIF API).

*   **Dependency Analysis:** Examine `gleam.toml` and check each dependency's documentation and source code (especially Erlang dependencies) for potential unsafe deserialization functions.

**Example Findings (Hypothetical):**

Let's assume our code review reveals the following:

*   **Finding 1:**  A direct call to `erlang:binary_to_term` is found in `src/api/handlers.gleam`:
    ```gleam
    // src/api/handlers.gleam
    pub fn handle_message(request: Request) -> Result(Response, Error) {
      let data = request.body
      let term = :erlang.binary_to_term(data) // VULNERABLE!
      // ... process the term ...
    }
    ```
*   **Finding 2:**  The `gleam/otp` library *does not* contain any wrappers around `erlang:binary_to_term`.
*   **Finding 3:**  An `@external` function is found that calls an Erlang function `my_erlang_module:decode/1`:
    ```gleam
    // src/utils.gleam
    @external(erlang = "my_erlang_module", fun = "decode")
    pub fn decode_data(data: BitString) -> Result(MyDataType, Error)
    ```
    And the corresponding Erlang code:
    ```erlang
    % src/my_erlang_module.erl
    -module(my_erlang_module).
    -export([decode/1]).

    decode(Data) ->
        erlang:binary_to_term(Data).  % VULNERABLE!
    ```
* **Finding 4:** No custom NIFs are used.
* **Finding 5:** No vulnerable dependencies are identified.

**4.2. Craft malicious input to trigger the vulnerability. [CRITICAL]**

This is the dynamic analysis and penetration testing phase.  Based on the findings above, we have two potential attack vectors:

*   **`src/api/handlers.gleam`:**  We can send a malicious payload in the body of an HTTP request to the endpoint handled by `handle_message`.
*   **`src/utils.gleam`:** We need to determine where `decode_data` is called and how its input is constructed.  If the input comes from an untrusted source, we can craft a malicious payload.

**Crafting the Payload:**

The classic `erlang:binary_to_term` exploit involves crafting a binary that, when deserialized, creates an Erlang term that will execute arbitrary code.  This often involves creating a "fun" (anonymous function) that calls `erlang:apply/3` to execute a desired function with specific arguments.

Here's a simplified example of a malicious payload (in hexadecimal representation) that would attempt to execute the `os:cmd/1` function with the argument `"whoami"`:

```
8368026400076f730004636d6464000677686f616d696a
```
Explanation:
* `83`: Magic byte indicating external term format version 131.
* `68`: Represents a small tuple (2 elements).
* `02`: Size of the tuple.
* `64`: Represents an atom.
* `00 07`: Length of the atom 'os'.
* `6f 73`: 'os' in ASCII.
* `64`: Represents an atom.
* `00 04`: Length of the atom 'cmd'.
* `63 6d 64`: 'cmd' in ASCII.
* `64`: Represents an atom.
* `00 06`: Length of the atom 'whoami'.
* `77 68 6f 61 6d 69`: 'whoami' in ASCII.
* `6a`: Represents nil (empty list), indicating the end of arguments.

**Testing the Payload:**

We would use a tool like `curl` or a dedicated penetration testing tool to send this payload to the vulnerable endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" --data-binary "$(echo '8368026400076f730004636d6464000677686f616d696a' | xxd -r -p)" http://localhost:8000/api/message
```

This command sends a POST request to `/api/message` (assuming this is the relevant endpoint) with the malicious payload in the body.  We would then monitor the server's output and logs to see if the `whoami` command was executed.  A successful exploit would likely result in the server's username being printed to the console or logged.

**Fuzzing:**

In addition to crafting specific payloads, we would use a fuzzer to send a large number of randomly generated binaries to the vulnerable endpoints.  This helps discover unexpected edge cases and potential crashes that might indicate other vulnerabilities.

## 5. Risk Assessment

Based on our hypothetical findings, the risk is **CRITICAL**.

*   **Likelihood:** High.  The vulnerable code is directly exposed in an API handler, making it easily accessible to attackers.
*   **Impact:** High.  Successful exploitation allows for arbitrary code execution on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data breaches, and other severe consequences.

## 6. Mitigation Recommendations

The following steps should be taken to mitigate this vulnerability:

1.  **Replace `erlang:binary_to_term` with a Safe Alternative:**
    *   **`erlang:binary_to_term(Binary, [safe])`:**  The simplest mitigation is to use the `safe` option with `erlang:binary_to_term`.  This prevents the creation of potentially dangerous terms like funs, ports, and references.  However, it limits the types of terms that can be deserialized.
        ```gleam
        let term = :erlang.binary_to_term(data, [:safe])
        ```
    *   **Use a Dedicated Serialization Library:**  A more robust solution is to use a dedicated serialization library like:
        *   **MessagePack:**  A widely used binary serialization format with libraries available for both Erlang and Gleam.
        *   **JSON:**  While text-based, JSON is generally safer than the Erlang term format for untrusted data, as it doesn't allow for arbitrary code execution.
        *   **Protocol Buffers:**  A highly efficient binary serialization format developed by Google.
        *   **BERT (Binary ERlang Term):** While related to the Erlang term format, BERT libraries often provide safer deserialization options.

2.  **Input Validation:**
    *   Even with safer serialization formats, it's crucial to implement strict input validation.  This means:
        *   **Whitelisting:**  Define a strict schema for the expected data and reject any input that doesn't conform to the schema.
        *   **Length Limits:**  Enforce maximum lengths for strings and other data fields to prevent buffer overflows or denial-of-service attacks.
        *   **Type Checking:**  Ensure that the data types are as expected (e.g., integers, strings, booleans).

3.  **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    *   Ensure that the application runs with the minimum necessary privileges.  This limits the damage an attacker can do if they manage to exploit a vulnerability.

4.  **Regular Security Audits and Updates:**
    *   Conduct regular security audits of the codebase and dependencies to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
    *   Keep all libraries and dependencies up to date to benefit from security patches.

5. **Consider using OTP Behaviours:**
    If the application is processing messages, consider using OTP behaviours like `gen_server` which provide a structured way to handle messages and can help prevent common errors.

By implementing these recommendations, the risk of RCE via `erlang:binary_to_term` can be significantly reduced or eliminated. The most important takeaway is to *never* deserialize untrusted data using `erlang:binary_to_term` without the `safe` option, and preferably to use a dedicated, secure serialization library instead.
