Okay, let's create a design document for the Gleam project, focusing on aspects relevant to threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Gleam is a functional programming language designed for building type-safe and scalable systems, particularly on the Erlang virtual machine (BEAM).  It emphasizes developer experience, aiming for a friendly and easy-to-use language.  Given its nature as a programming language itself, the "business" priorities are centered around adoption, community growth, and the success of projects built using Gleam.

Priorities and Goals:

*   Widespread adoption by developers, particularly those already in the Erlang/Elixir ecosystem.
*   Growth of a vibrant and supportive community.
*   Development of robust and reliable tooling (compiler, build system, package manager, etc.).
*   Enablement of successful, production-grade applications built with Gleam.
*   Maintainability and evolution of the language itself.

Business Risks:

*   Low adoption rate: If developers don't find Gleam compelling or easy to use, the project may fail to gain traction.
*   Security vulnerabilities in the compiler or runtime:  This could lead to exploits in applications built with Gleam, damaging its reputation and hindering adoption.
*   Lack of essential tooling or libraries:  This could make it difficult for developers to build complex applications, limiting Gleam's usefulness.
*   Inability to scale to large projects: If Gleam doesn't perform well or handle concurrency effectively, it won't be suitable for many real-world applications.
*   Community fragmentation or lack of contribution: A healthy open-source project relies on a strong community.
*   Supply chain attacks: Compromised dependencies or build processes could introduce vulnerabilities.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Gleam, as a language and compiler, has a unique security posture. It's not a directly deployed application, but rather a tool used to build applications. Therefore, the security posture focuses on the security of the compiler, the generated code, and the development lifecycle of Gleam itself.

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Type safety: Gleam's core feature is its strong static typing, which prevents many common programming errors at compile time. This is a significant security control, reducing the likelihood of runtime errors that could lead to vulnerabilities. Implemented in the compiler.
*   security control: Immutability: Gleam, like Erlang, emphasizes immutable data structures. This reduces the risk of concurrency-related bugs and side effects, which can often be sources of security vulnerabilities. Implemented in the language design and compiler.
*   security control: Actor model concurrency: Gleam leverages the Erlang VM's actor model, which provides a robust and well-understood approach to concurrency. This helps prevent race conditions and other concurrency-related issues. Implemented in the language design and runtime (BEAM).
*   security control: GitHub Actions for CI/CD: The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and continuous delivery, providing some level of automation and security checks. Described in the `.github/workflows` directory.
*   security control: Regular dependency updates: The project appears to actively manage and update its dependencies, reducing the risk of known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries. Described in `rebar.config` and `gleam.toml`.
*   security control: Code reviews: As an open-source project on GitHub, Gleam benefits from community code reviews, which can help identify potential security issues. Implemented through the GitHub pull request process.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Reliance on the Erlang VM (BEAM): Gleam's security is inherently tied to the security of the BEAM. While the BEAM is generally considered secure, any vulnerabilities in it would directly impact Gleam applications.
*   accepted risk: Emerging language maturity: As a relatively new language, Gleam may have undiscovered vulnerabilities or limitations in its compiler or runtime.
*   accepted risk: Limited built-in security features: Gleam, by design, is a relatively small language. It doesn't have extensive built-in security features beyond type safety and the actor model. Developers are responsible for implementing appropriate security measures in their applications.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Integrate SAST tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan the Gleam compiler's source code for potential vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Software Composition Analysis (SCA): Implement SCA tooling to identify and track known vulnerabilities in all dependencies, including transitive dependencies.
*   security control: Fuzz testing: Introduce fuzz testing to the compiler to identify potential edge cases and vulnerabilities that might not be caught by traditional testing.
*   security control: Security-focused code reviews: Explicitly include security considerations in code reviews, focusing on potential vulnerabilities and attack vectors.
*   security control: Supply chain security measures: Implement measures to verify the integrity of dependencies and build artifacts, such as signing releases and using checksums.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication: Not directly applicable to the Gleam language itself, but Gleam applications should implement robust authentication mechanisms where needed.
*   Authorization: Similarly, authorization is the responsibility of Gleam applications, not the language itself. Gleam should provide mechanisms (e.g., libraries or patterns) to facilitate secure authorization.
*   Input Validation: Gleam's type system provides a strong foundation for input validation. However, developers should still be mindful of validating data from external sources (e.g., user input, network requests) to prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities.
*   Cryptography: Gleam should provide access to robust cryptographic libraries (likely through Erlang interop) to allow developers to securely handle sensitive data. The language itself should not attempt to implement its own cryptographic primitives.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Development
        Developer[("Developer")]
        Gleam_Code[("Gleam Code")]
        Gleam_CLI[("Gleam CLI")]
    end

    subgraph Build Process
        rebar3[("rebar3")]
        Compiler[("Gleam Compiler")]
        Dependencies[("Dependencies (Hex)")]
        Artifacts[("Build Artifacts (BEAM files)")]
    end
    
    Developer -- Writes --> Gleam_Code
    Developer -- Uses --> Gleam_CLI
    Gleam_CLI -- Invokes --> rebar3
    rebar3 -- Uses --> Compiler
    rebar3 -- Fetches --> Dependencies
    Compiler -- Compiles --> Gleam_Code
    Compiler -- Outputs --> Artifacts
```

*   security control: Reproducible Builds: Ensure that the build process is deterministic and produces the same output given the same input, enhancing auditability and security.
*   security control: Build Artifact Signing: Sign the build artifacts to ensure their integrity and authenticity.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   The primary critical business process is enabling developers to build reliable and scalable applications. The success of Gleam depends on its ability to facilitate this.
*   Maintaining the integrity and security of the Gleam compiler and tooling is also critical, as vulnerabilities here could compromise all applications built with Gleam.

Data to Protect and Sensitivity:

*   Gleam itself doesn't directly handle sensitive data. However, applications built with Gleam *may* handle sensitive data, such as:
    *   User data (PII, credentials, etc.): High sensitivity.
    *   Financial data: High sensitivity.
    *   Business-critical data: Sensitivity varies depending on the specific application.
*   The Gleam source code itself is also valuable and should be protected from unauthorized modification.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   What specific security standards or compliance requirements (if any) are relevant to Gleam or applications built with Gleam?
*   What is the expected threat model for typical Gleam applications? (e.g., web applications, backend services, etc.)
*   What level of security expertise is assumed for developers using Gleam?
*   Are there any plans to develop official security guidelines or best practices for Gleam developers?
*   What is the process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities discovered in Gleam?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to promote the adoption and successful use of Gleam, prioritizing developer experience and language features that enhance reliability and scalability.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: Gleam relies heavily on the inherent security features of the Erlang VM and its type system. It is assumed that developers using Gleam will have some understanding of security principles and will implement appropriate security measures in their applications.
*   DESIGN: The design focuses on the core components of the Gleam compiler and its interaction with the Erlang ecosystem. It is assumed that deployment will typically involve packaging the compiled code into a release and deploying it to a server or cluster running the BEAM, or via containerization. The build process is assumed to be standard Gleam/Erlang build process.
