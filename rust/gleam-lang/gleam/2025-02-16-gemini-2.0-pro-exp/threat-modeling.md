# Threat Model Analysis for gleam-lang/gleam

## Threat: [Compiler Bug Exploitation (Integer Overflow or Other Code Generation Errors)](./threats/compiler_bug_exploitation__integer_overflow_or_other_code_generation_errors_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a specific input that triggers an undiscovered bug in the Gleam *compiler* during code generation. This results in incorrect Erlang code being generated, *not* due to Erlang interop issues, but due to a flaw in how Gleam translates its own code. The attacker might send a very large number, a specially crafted string, or exploit a complex type interaction that the compiler mishandles. The key here is that the vulnerability is in the *compiler's* logic, not in the interaction with Erlang.
    *   **Impact:** Could range from crashes (DoS) to incorrect calculations (leading to data corruption or incorrect authorization) or, in the worst case, arbitrary code execution (ACE) if the compiler bug affects memory management or control flow in a way that can be exploited.
    *   **Affected Component:** Gleam Compiler (specifically, the code generation phase). The vulnerability manifests in the *generated* Erlang code, but the root cause is a Gleam compiler bug.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical if ACE is possible).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Stay up-to-date with Gleam compiler releases (which include bug fixes). Perform extensive input validation and sanitization *before* any operations that could be affected by the compiler bug. Implement fuzz testing targeting various Gleam language features (not just integer operations, but also string handling, pattern matching, etc.). Report any suspected compiler bugs to the Gleam team.
        *   **User (Indirect):** None directly. Reliance is on developers and the Gleam maintainers.

## Threat: [Dependency Hijacking (Malicious *Gleam* Package)](./threats/dependency_hijacking__malicious_gleam_package_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises a *Gleam-specific* package published on Hex.pm (or another package repository) and injects malicious code. This is distinct from a general Erlang package issue; the compromised package is written *in Gleam* and targets Gleam applications. The attacker might use typosquatting or compromise a Gleam package maintainer's account.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution (ACE) within the application, potentially leading to complete system compromise. The malicious code runs as part of the Gleam application.
    *   **Affected Component:** Any Gleam code that uses the compromised *Gleam* package. The vulnerability is in the *dependency*, not the core Gleam language, but it's a Gleam-specific dependency.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Carefully vet all *Gleam* dependencies. Use tools to check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies (if such tools exist for Gleam packages). Pin dependencies to specific versions (but balance this with the need for security updates). Consider using a private package repository for sensitive projects. Review the source code of Gleam dependencies, especially before major updates. Advocate for and use package signing and verification if/when it becomes available for Gleam packages.
        *   **User (Indirect):** None directly. Reliance is on developers.

## Threat: [Gleam Standard Library Vulnerability](./threats/gleam_standard_library_vulnerability.md)

* **Description:** A vulnerability is discovered in a function or module within the *Gleam standard library itself*. This is distinct from a third-party library; it's a flaw in the core code provided by the Gleam language. An attacker could craft input that exploits this vulnerability.
    * **Impact:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, but could range from denial-of-service (DoS) to arbitrary code execution (ACE), depending on the nature of the flaw and how it's exploited.
    * **Affected Component:** The specific vulnerable function or module within the Gleam standard library.
    * **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical, depending on the vulnerability).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Stay up-to-date with Gleam releases, which will include patches for standard library vulnerabilities. Thoroughly review the documentation and source code of any standard library functions used, paying attention to any known limitations or security considerations. Implement robust input validation and error handling, even when using standard library functions.
        * **User (Indirect):** None directly. Reliance is on developers and the Gleam maintainers.
