# Deep Analysis: Unsafe `binary_to_term` Deserialization (RCE) in Gleam

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the risks associated with using Erlang's `binary_to_term` function (or its equivalents) within a Gleam application, specifically when handling data from untrusted sources.  We aim to identify potential attack vectors, clarify the severity of the vulnerability, and provide concrete, actionable recommendations for developers to prevent remote code execution (RCE).

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the `binary_to_term` deserialization vulnerability as it pertains to Gleam applications.  It covers:

*   Direct calls to Erlang's `binary_to_term` from Gleam code.
*   Indirect calls through Gleam or Erlang libraries that might internally use `binary_to_term`.
*   The interaction between Gleam and Erlang in the context of this vulnerability.
*   Mitigation strategies specifically tailored for Gleam developers.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Other deserialization vulnerabilities unrelated to `binary_to_term`.
*   General security best practices outside the scope of this specific vulnerability.
*   Vulnerabilities in the Erlang runtime itself (though we acknowledge that `binary_to_term` is inherently unsafe).

### 1.3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Vulnerability Explanation:**  Provide a detailed explanation of how `binary_to_term` works and why it's dangerous.
2.  **Gleam-Specific Considerations:**  Analyze how Gleam interacts with Erlang and how this interaction exposes the vulnerability.
3.  **Attack Vector Analysis:**  Describe realistic scenarios where an attacker could exploit this vulnerability in a Gleam application.
4.  **Code Examples (Illustrative):**  Provide (simplified) Gleam and Erlang code snippets to illustrate the vulnerability and its mitigation.  *These are not intended to be directly exploitable.*
5.  **Mitigation Strategies (Detailed):**  Expand on the initial mitigation strategies, providing specific guidance and best practices.
6.  **Tooling and Detection:** Discuss potential tools or techniques that could help identify or prevent this vulnerability.

## 2. Deep Analysis

### 2.1. Vulnerability Explanation:  `binary_to_term` and its Dangers

Erlang's `binary_to_term` function is designed to convert a binary representation of an Erlang term back into its original Erlang data structure.  This includes *any* valid Erlang term, including:

*   Atoms
*   Integers
*   Floats
*   Lists
*   Tuples
*   **Functions (including anonymous functions)**
*   **Modules**
*   **PIDs (Process Identifiers)**
*   **References**

The critical vulnerability lies in the fact that `binary_to_term` *blindly trusts* the input binary data.  It doesn't perform any validation or sanitization.  If an attacker can control the input to `binary_to_term`, they can craft a malicious binary that, when deserialized, creates arbitrary Erlang terms, including functions that execute arbitrary code.

This is a classic "arbitrary code execution" vulnerability.  The attacker can essentially inject their own code into the running Erlang/Gleam application.

### 2.2. Gleam-Specific Considerations

Gleam's interoperability with Erlang is a powerful feature, but it also means that Gleam code can directly or indirectly interact with vulnerable Erlang functions.  Here's how this vulnerability manifests in Gleam:

*   **Direct Calls:** Gleam code can directly call Erlang functions, including `:erlang.binary_to_term/1`.  This is the most obvious and dangerous scenario.
*   **Indirect Calls:**  Gleam libraries, or Erlang libraries used by Gleam code, might internally use `binary_to_term` for deserialization.  This is less obvious but equally dangerous.  Developers need to be aware of the dependencies they use and their potential security implications.
*   **FFI (Foreign Function Interface):** Gleam's FFI allows calling Erlang code.  If the FFI is used to interact with an Erlang function that uses `binary_to_term` on untrusted data, the vulnerability is present.

### 2.3. Attack Vector Analysis

Here are some realistic attack scenarios:

*   **Scenario 1:  Web Application Receiving Erlang Terms:**
    *   A Gleam web application exposes an endpoint that expects to receive data in the Erlang external term format.
    *   The application uses `binary_to_term` (or a wrapper function) to deserialize the received data.
    *   An attacker sends a crafted binary payload to this endpoint, causing the application to execute arbitrary code.

*   **Scenario 2:  Message Queue with Untrusted Messages:**
    *   A Gleam application consumes messages from a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka).
    *   The messages are assumed to be Erlang terms.
    *   The application deserializes the messages using `binary_to_term`.
    *   An attacker compromises the message queue (or a producer) and injects malicious messages, leading to RCE.

*   **Scenario 3:  Configuration Files in Erlang Term Format:**
    *   A Gleam application reads its configuration from a file that is expected to be in the Erlang external term format.
    *   The application uses `binary_to_term` to load the configuration.
    *   An attacker gains write access to the configuration file and modifies it to include a malicious payload.

*   **Scenario 4: Database with Erlang Terms**
    * A Gleam application reads data from database, that is expected to be in the Erlang external term format.
    * The application uses `binary_to_term` to load the data.
    * An attacker with SQL Injection can modify data to include malicious payload.

### 2.4. Illustrative Code Examples

**Vulnerable Gleam Code (DO NOT USE):**

```gleam
import gleam/erlang/process
import gleam/io

pub fn handle_request(data: BitString) {
  // DANGEROUS: Directly using binary_to_term on untrusted data
  let result = process.binary_to_term(data)
  io.debug(result)
}
```

**Malicious Erlang Binary (Conceptual):**

```erlang
% This is a simplified representation.  A real exploit would be more complex.
% The goal is to illustrate the concept, not provide a working exploit.

% Create a function that executes a shell command.
MaliciousFunction = fun() -> os:cmd("echo 'You have been hacked!'") end.

% Convert the function to a binary term.
MaliciousBinary = term_to_binary(MaliciousFunction).

% This MaliciousBinary would be sent by the attacker.
```

**Safe Gleam Code (Using JSON):**

```gleam
import gleam/json
import gleam/result
import gleam/string
import gleam/bit_string

pub fn handle_request(data: BitString) -> Result(Dynamic, String) {
  // Use JSON for safe deserialization
  let data_string = bit_string.to_string(data)
  case data_string {
    Error(_) -> Error("Invalid UTF-8 data")
    Ok(data_string) -> {
      case json.decode(data_string) {
        Error(_) -> Error("Invalid JSON data")
        Ok(decoded_json) -> Ok(decoded_json)
      }
    }
  }
}

```

### 2.5. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

*   **1.  Never Use `binary_to_term` with Untrusted Data:** This is the most important rule.  There is *no* safe way to use `binary_to_term` with data from an untrusted source.

*   **2.  Prefer Safe Serialization Formats:**
    *   **JSON:**  Gleam has excellent JSON support (`gleam/json`).  JSON is a widely used, well-defined, and relatively safe format for data exchange.
    *   **Protocol Buffers:**  Protocol Buffers (protobufs) are a more efficient and structured alternative to JSON.  Gleam libraries exist for protobufs.
    *   **MessagePack:** Another binary serialization format that is generally safer than Erlang's external term format.

*   **3.  Strict Input Validation (If Erlang Terms are *Absolutely* Necessary):**
    *   If you *must* use Erlang terms for external communication (which is strongly discouraged), implement a custom parser and serializer.
    *   **Whitelist Approach:**  Define a strict schema for the allowed Erlang terms.  Only accept terms that match this schema.  Reject everything else.
    *   **Avoid Functions and Modules:**  Do *not* allow functions, modules, PIDs, or references in the deserialized data.  These are the primary vectors for code execution.
    *   **Limit Term Complexity:**  Restrict the depth and size of the allowed terms to prevent denial-of-service attacks.
    *   **Consider a Custom Parser:**  Writing a custom parser for a *very* limited subset of Erlang terms can be safer than using `binary_to_term`, but this is a complex and error-prone task.  It's generally better to use a standard, safe format like JSON.

*   **4.  Dependency Auditing:**
    *   Regularly audit your Gleam and Erlang dependencies to ensure they don't use `binary_to_term` unsafely.
    *   Use tools like `rebar3_hank` (for Erlang) to identify potential vulnerabilities in your dependencies.  While there isn't a direct Gleam equivalent, understanding the Erlang dependencies is crucial.

*   **5.  Code Reviews:**
    *   Enforce strict code reviews that specifically look for uses of `binary_to_term` and related functions.
    *   Educate all developers on the team about this vulnerability.

*   **6.  Security Testing:**
    *   Include penetration testing and fuzzing in your testing process to try to identify potential deserialization vulnerabilities.

### 2.6. Tooling and Detection

*   **Static Analysis (Limited):**  While there isn't a dedicated Gleam static analysis tool that specifically flags `binary_to_term` usage, you can use `grep` or similar tools to search your codebase for direct calls to `:erlang.binary_to_term/1`.  This is a basic but important first step.
    ```bash
    grep -r ":erlang.binary_to_term" .
    ```

*   **Dynamic Analysis (Fuzzing):**  Fuzzing can be used to send malformed or unexpected data to your application's endpoints that handle external data.  This can help identify crashes or unexpected behavior that might indicate a deserialization vulnerability.

*   **Erlang-Specific Tools:**  Tools like `rebar3_hank` can help analyze Erlang dependencies for potential vulnerabilities.  Even if your Gleam code doesn't directly call `binary_to_term`, your Erlang dependencies might.

*   **Security Linters (Future):**  As the Gleam ecosystem matures, it's likely that security-focused linters will emerge that can detect this and other common vulnerabilities.

## 3. Conclusion

The unsafe `binary_to_term` deserialization vulnerability is a critical security risk for Gleam applications that interact with untrusted data.  Gleam's interoperability with Erlang makes it essential for Gleam developers to be acutely aware of this vulnerability and to actively avoid using `binary_to_term` (or any function that might use it internally) with data from untrusted sources.  By following the mitigation strategies outlined in this analysis, developers can significantly reduce the risk of remote code execution and build more secure Gleam applications. The best approach is to always use safe serialization formats like JSON or Protocol Buffers for external communication.
