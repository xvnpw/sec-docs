## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Code on the Server Hosting the Gleam Application](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_code_on_the_server_hosting_the_gleam_application.md)

**1. [CRITICAL] Exploit Erlang Interoperability Vulnerabilities:**

This high-risk path focuses on the inherent complexities and potential security weaknesses arising from the interaction between Gleam and Erlang code. Attackers target the boundary where data and control flow between these two environments.

*   **[CRITICAL] Inject Malicious Erlang Code via Interop:** Attackers aim to introduce malicious code that will be executed within the Erlang runtime environment. This is achieved by manipulating the data passed from Gleam to Erlang.
    *   **Supply Crafted Input to Gleam Function Passed to Erlang:** The attacker crafts specific input data intended to exploit vulnerabilities in the Erlang functions called by Gleam.
        *   **Type Mismatch Exploitation:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker provides data to a Gleam function that, when passed to Erlang, is interpreted as a different, potentially unsafe type. This can lead to unexpected behavior, memory corruption, or the execution of unintended code.
            *   **Example:** A Gleam function might pass an integer to an Erlang function expecting a string, or vice versa, leading to errors or exploitable conditions in the Erlang code.
        *   **Insecure Deserialization/Data Handling:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** The Erlang function deserializes data received from Gleam without proper validation. This allows an attacker to embed malicious payloads within the serialized data that, when deserialized, execute arbitrary code or perform other harmful actions.
            *   **Example:**  If the Erlang code uses a vulnerable deserialization library, an attacker could craft a malicious data structure that, upon deserialization, triggers remote code execution.

*   **[CRITICAL] Exploit Dependencies of Erlang Libraries Used via Gleam:** This path exploits vulnerabilities present in external Erlang libraries that the Gleam application relies upon.
    *   **Vulnerable Erlang Library Called by Gleam Code:** The Gleam application uses an Erlang library that contains a known security vulnerability.
        *   **Known Vulnerability in a Specific Erlang Library:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker leverages a publicly known vulnerability (e.g., a buffer overflow, SQL injection if the library interacts with a database, or a remote code execution flaw) in an Erlang library that is directly or indirectly used by the Gleam application.
            *   **Example:** A Gleam application uses an older version of an Erlang HTTP client library with a known vulnerability that allows an attacker to send specially crafted requests to trigger code execution on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Gleam Build Process or Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_gleam_build_process_or_dependencies.md)

**2. Exploit Gleam Build Process or Dependencies:**

This high-risk path targets the software supply chain, focusing on vulnerabilities introduced during the build and dependency management process of the Gleam application.

*   **[CRITICAL] Supply Chain Attacks via Gleam Dependencies:** Attackers compromise external Gleam packages that the application depends on.
    *   **Compromise a Gleam Package Dependency:** An attacker gains control of a Gleam package hosted on a package registry.
        *   **Introduce Malicious Code into a Library Used by the Application:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker, having compromised a dependency, injects malicious code into the library. This malicious code is then included in applications that depend on the compromised package during the build process.
            *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the maintainer account of a popular Gleam utility library and pushes a new version containing code that steals environment variables or opens a backdoor on servers running applications using that library.
