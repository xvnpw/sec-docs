# Threat Model Analysis for gleam-lang/gleam

## Threat: [Unsafe Foreign Function Interface (FFI) Usage](./threats/unsafe_foreign_function_interface__ffi__usage.md)

**Threat:** Unsafe Foreign Function Interface (FFI) Usage
    * **Description:**
        * **What the attacker might do and how:** When using Gleam's FFI to interact with code written in other languages (primarily C), developers might introduce vulnerabilities due to incorrect data handling, memory management issues, or calling unsafe foreign functions. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to cause crashes, memory corruption, or even execute arbitrary code within the Gleam application's process.
    * **Impact:**
        * **Describe the impact of the threat:** Can lead to severe security vulnerabilities, including remote code execution, denial of service, and information disclosure, potentially compromising the entire application and the underlying system.
    * **Which https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam component is affected:**
        * **Describe what component is affected:** The Gleam FFI and any Gleam code that uses it to interact with foreign code.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Exercise extreme caution when using the FFI.
        * Thoroughly audit and test any foreign code being called.
        * Implement robust validation and sanitization of data passed to and from foreign functions within the Gleam code.
        * Be mindful of memory safety and potential buffer overflows when interacting with C code, ensuring proper allocation and deallocation.
        * Consider using safer abstractions or libraries for interacting with external systems if possible, minimizing direct FFI usage.

## Threat: [Gleam Compiler Bugs Leading to Insecure Code Generation](./threats/gleam_compiler_bugs_leading_to_insecure_code_generation.md)

**Threat:** Gleam Compiler Bugs Leading to Insecure Code Generation
    * **Description:**
        * **What the attacker might do and how:** A bug in the Gleam compiler could result in the generation of Erlang bytecode that has unintended and exploitable security flaws. This could be due to incorrect optimizations, mishandling of edge cases in the Gleam language features, or other compiler errors. An attacker could potentially craft specific Gleam code that, when compiled, produces vulnerable bytecode that can be exploited for remote code execution or other critical impacts.
    * **Impact:**
        * **Describe the impact of the threat:**  Could lead to critical vulnerabilities such as remote code execution, allowing an attacker to gain complete control over the application and potentially the underlying server. Data breaches and complete service disruption are highly likely.
    * **Which https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam component is affected:**
        * **Describe what component is affected:** The Gleam compiler itself.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Stay updated with Gleam compiler releases, as bug fixes often include security patches for compiler-introduced vulnerabilities.
        * Thoroughly test compiled Gleam applications, especially in security-sensitive areas, looking for unexpected behavior that might indicate a compiler bug.
        * Consider using static analysis tools on the generated Erlang bytecode to identify potential issues introduced by the compiler.
        * Report any suspected compiler bugs that could have security implications to the Gleam development team immediately.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Gleam Standard Libraries Exposing Critical Functionality](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_gleam_standard_libraries_exposing_critical_functionality.md)

**Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Gleam Standard Libraries Exposing Critical Functionality
    * **Description:**
        * **What the attacker might do and how:** Security vulnerabilities could exist within the Gleam standard libraries, particularly in modules handling network communication, data parsing (like JSON or binary formats), or cryptographic operations. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by providing crafted input or triggering specific conditions that expose the flaw, potentially leading to remote code execution, arbitrary code execution, or significant data breaches.
    * **Impact:**
        * **Describe the impact of the threat:** Can lead to critical security breaches, including remote code execution, allowing an attacker to take control of the application. Data breaches, manipulation of sensitive information, and complete service disruption are highly probable.
    * **Which https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam component is affected:**
        * **Describe what component is affected:** Specific modules or functions within the Gleam standard library (e.g., `gleam/http`, `gleam/json`, `gleam/crypto`).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Stay updated with Gleam library releases and security advisories.
        * Carefully review the documentation and source code of standard library functions, especially those dealing with external input, network operations, or security-sensitive operations.
        * Implement robust input validation and sanitization even when using standard library functions.
        * Report any suspected vulnerabilities in the standard libraries to the Gleam development team immediately.
