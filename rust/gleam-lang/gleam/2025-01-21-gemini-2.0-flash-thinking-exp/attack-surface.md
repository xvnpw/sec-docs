# Attack Surface Analysis for gleam-lang/gleam

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Dependency Injection](./attack_surfaces/malicious_dependency_injection.md)

* **Attack Surface:** Malicious Dependency Injection
    * **Description:**  A malicious actor compromises a dependency used by the Gleam project, injecting malicious code that gets included in the final application.
    * **How Gleam Contributes:** Gleam projects rely on a package manager (likely Hex, the Erlang package manager) defined in `gleam.toml`. If a dependency listed in this file is compromised, Gleam's build process will fetch and include the malicious version.
    * **Example:** A popular Gleam library for HTTP requests is compromised, and its updated version contains code that exfiltrates environment variables upon application startup.
    * **Impact:**  Can range from data breaches and unauthorized access to complete system compromise, depending on the injected code's capabilities.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Dependency Pinning:**  Specify exact versions of dependencies in `gleam.toml` instead of using version ranges.
        * **Dependency Scanning:** Utilize tools that scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
        * **Source Code Review:**  Review the source code of critical dependencies, especially before major version updates.
        * **Use Private Package Registries:** If applicable, host internal dependencies on a private registry with access controls.

## Attack Surface: [Compiler Code Generation Flaws](./attack_surfaces/compiler_code_generation_flaws.md)

* **Attack Surface:** Compiler Code Generation Flaws
    * **Description:**  A vulnerability exists within the Gleam compiler itself, leading to the generation of insecure or unexpected Erlang bytecode.
    * **How Gleam Contributes:** Gleam code is compiled into Erlang bytecode. If the Gleam compiler has bugs or vulnerabilities, it could produce bytecode with exploitable flaws.
    * **Example:** A bug in the Gleam compiler's handling of certain data structures leads to the generation of Erlang code that is vulnerable to buffer overflows when processing specific inputs.
    * **Impact:**  Can lead to various vulnerabilities depending on the nature of the compiler flaw, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution or denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Keep Gleam Compiler Updated:** Regularly update to the latest stable version of the Gleam compiler, as updates often include security fixes.
        * **Monitor Gleam Security Advisories:** Stay informed about reported vulnerabilities in the Gleam compiler.
        * **Consider Using Static Analysis Tools on Generated Erlang Code:** While less direct, analyzing the generated Erlang bytecode might reveal potential issues.

## Attack Surface: [Unsafe Data Handling in Foreign Function Interface (FFI)](./attack_surfaces/unsafe_data_handling_in_foreign_function_interface__ffi_.md)

* **Attack Surface:** Unsafe Data Handling in Foreign Function Interface (FFI)
    * **Description:**  Improperly sanitized or validated data is passed between Gleam code and Erlang code via the FFI, leading to vulnerabilities in the Erlang side.
    * **How Gleam Contributes:** Gleam's FFI allows interaction with Erlang code. If Gleam code passes untrusted data to Erlang functions without proper validation, it can exploit vulnerabilities in those Erlang functions.
    * **Example:** Gleam code receives user input and passes it directly as an argument to an Erlang function that executes a system command without proper sanitization, leading to command injection.
    * **Impact:**  Can lead to vulnerabilities present in the Erlang code being exposed, such as command injection, arbitrary code execution, or data manipulation.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Thoroughly Validate and Sanitize Data:**  Validate all data before passing it to Erlang functions via FFI.
        * **Use Safe Erlang APIs:**  Prefer Erlang APIs that are designed to be secure and avoid functions known to be potentially dangerous with untrusted input.
        * **Type Safety at FFI Boundary:**  Carefully define and enforce types when interacting with Erlang via FFI to minimize type-related errors.
        * **Code Review of FFI Interactions:**  Pay close attention to code sections that involve FFI calls during code reviews.
