*   **Threat:** Type Confusion at Erlang Boundary
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides data to an Erlang function called from Gleam that does not match the expected Erlang type, even if Gleam's type system suggested it would. This could be due to incorrect FFI definitions or assumptions about Erlang's dynamic typing. The attacker might craft specific inputs to cause the Erlang function to behave unexpectedly, potentially leading to crashes, incorrect data processing, or even security vulnerabilities within the Erlang code.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, data corruption, potential for exploitation of vulnerabilities within the Erlang code.
    *   **Affected Component:** Gleam's Foreign Function Interface (FFI), specifically the interaction between Gleam types and Erlang types.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Define FFI types meticulously, ensuring they accurately reflect the expected Erlang types.
        *   Implement runtime validation of data at the Gleam-Erlang boundary, even if Gleam's type system suggests it's safe.
        *   Use Erlang libraries that perform their own input validation.
        *   Thoroughly test the integration points between Gleam and Erlang code with various input types.

*   **Threat:** Deserialization of Malicious Erlang Terms (ETF)
    *   **Description:** If the Gleam application directly handles or exposes Erlang's External Term Format (ETF), an attacker could send maliciously crafted ETF data. When deserialized by the Erlang runtime, this data could trigger vulnerabilities, potentially leading to remote code execution or denial of service. This is directly relevant to Gleam if Gleam code is responsible for handling or exposing this format.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Any Gleam code that interacts with raw Erlang term data, potentially through custom Erlang integration or libraries.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid directly handling or exposing raw ETF data if possible.
        *   If ETF handling is necessary, implement strict validation and sanitization of incoming ETF data.
        *   Consider using safer serialization formats for external communication.

*   **Threat:** Dependency Confusion via Rebar3
    *   **Description:** An attacker publishes a malicious package to a public package registry with the same name as an internal dependency used by the Gleam application. When the application's build process (using Rebar3) attempts to fetch the dependency, it might inadvertently download and use the attacker's malicious package instead of the intended internal one. This directly involves Gleam's build tool.
    *   **Impact:** Introduction of malicious code into the application, potentially leading to data breaches, backdoors, or other malicious activities.
    *   **Affected Component:** Rebar3, the Gleam build tool and dependency manager.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use unique and namespaced names for internal dependencies.
        *   Configure Rebar3 to prioritize internal package repositories.
        *   Implement dependency pinning and verification mechanisms.
        *   Regularly audit project dependencies.

*   **Threat:** Supply Chain Attacks on Gleam Libraries
    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises a popular Gleam library hosted on a package registry. This could involve injecting malicious code into the library's source code. Applications that depend on this compromised library will then unknowingly include the malicious code in their builds. This directly involves the Gleam ecosystem.
    *   **Impact:** Introduction of malicious code into the application, potentially leading to data breaches, backdoors, or other malicious activities.
    *   **Affected Component:** Third-party Gleam libraries and the Rebar3 dependency management system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully vet and review the dependencies used in the project.
        *   Utilize dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
        *   Consider using private package registries for internal dependencies.
        *   Implement Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) practices.

*   **Threat:** Build Process Compromise
    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises the environment used to build the Gleam application. This could involve injecting malicious code during the compilation process, modifying dependencies managed by Rebar3, or altering the final application artifacts produced by the Gleam compiler.
    *   **Impact:** Introduction of malicious code into the application, potentially leading to data breaches, backdoors, or other malicious activities.
    *   **Affected Component:** The Gleam compiler, Rebar3, and the build environment.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the build environment.
        *   Use isolated and ephemeral build environments.
        *   Implement integrity checks for build tools and dependencies.
        *   Sign application artifacts to ensure their integrity.
