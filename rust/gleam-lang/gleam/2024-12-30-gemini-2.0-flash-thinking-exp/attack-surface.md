*   **Compiler Bugs Leading to Insecure Bytecode**
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities within the Gleam compiler itself could result in the generation of Erlang bytecode that has security flaws, even if the original Gleam code appears secure.
    *   **How Gleam Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The Gleam compiler is the bridge between the high-level Gleam code and the low-level Erlang VM. Bugs in this translation process can introduce unexpected and potentially exploitable behavior.
    *   **Example:** A compiler bug might incorrectly handle certain data structures, leading to buffer overflows or incorrect type assumptions in the generated Erlang code.
    *   **Impact:**  Memory corruption, unexpected program behavior, potential for remote code execution if the underlying Erlang VM vulnerability is severe enough.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the Gleam compiler updated to the latest stable version, as updates often include bug fixes.
        *   Report any suspected compiler bugs to the Gleam development team.

*   **Supply Chain Attacks via Gleam Packages**
    *   **Description:** Malicious actors could publish compromised Gleam packages to the official package registry or alternative sources, which could then be included as dependencies in your application.
    *   **How Gleam Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Gleam's package management system relies on external sources for dependencies. If these sources are compromised, or if a malicious package is published, it can directly impact Gleam projects.
    *   **Example:** A malicious package could contain code that exfiltrates data, introduces backdoors, or performs other malicious actions when included in a Gleam project.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the application, data breaches, reputational damage.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully vet all Gleam package dependencies before including them in your project.
        *   Use package managers that support dependency verification and integrity checks.
        *   Monitor package registries for suspicious activity or reports of compromised packages.
        *   Consider using private package registries for internal dependencies.
        *   Regularly audit your project's dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
