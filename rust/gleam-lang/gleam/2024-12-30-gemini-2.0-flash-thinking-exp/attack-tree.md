## Gleam Application Threat Model - Focused High-Risk Sub-Tree

**Objective:** Compromise the application by exploiting vulnerabilities arising from Gleam's interaction with the Erlang ecosystem or its own language features.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

*   Compromise Gleam Application **(CRITICAL NODE)**
    *   Exploit Erlang Interoperability **(CRITICAL NODE & HIGH-RISK PATH)**
        *   Inject Malicious Erlang Code **(CRITICAL NODE & HIGH-RISK PATH)**
            *   Pass Unsanitized Data to Erlang Functions **(CRITICAL NODE & HIGH-RISK PATH)**
            *   Lack of Input Validation in Erlang **(CRITICAL NODE)**
                *   Achieve Arbitrary Code Execution on BEAM **(CRITICAL NODE)**
        *   Insecure Handling of `Any` Type **(CRITICAL NODE & HIGH-RISK PATH)**
            *   Pass Untrusted `Any` to Erlang **(CRITICAL NODE & HIGH-RISK PATH)**

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

*   **Compromise Gleam Application (CRITICAL NODE):**
    *   This is the root goal of the attacker. Success at this node means the attacker has achieved their objective of compromising the application.

*   **Exploit Erlang Interoperability (CRITICAL NODE & HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    *   This attack vector focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities that arise from the interaction between Gleam's statically typed code and Erlang's dynamically typed environment.
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: Critical
    *   Effort: Varies
    *   Skill Level: Intermediate to Advanced
    *   Detection Difficulty: Moderate to Difficult

*   **Inject Malicious Erlang Code (CRITICAL NODE & HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    *   Attackers aim to inject and execute arbitrary Erlang code by exploiting the interoperability layer.
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: Critical
    *   Effort: Low to Moderate
    *   Skill Level: Intermediate to Advanced
    *   Detection Difficulty: Moderate to Difficult

*   **Pass Unsanitized Data to Erlang Functions (CRITICAL NODE & HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    *   Gleam code passes data from untrusted sources to Erlang functions without proper sanitization or validation.
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: Critical
    *   Effort: Low
    *   Skill Level: Intermediate
    *   Detection Difficulty: Moderate

*   **Lack of Input Validation in Erlang (CRITICAL NODE):**
    *   The Erlang function receiving data from Gleam does not perform adequate input validation, making it susceptible to injection attacks.
    *   Likelihood: High
    *   Impact: Critical
    *   Effort: Low
    *   Skill Level: Beginner
    *   Detection Difficulty: Easy (if logs are reviewed)

*   **Achieve Arbitrary Code Execution on BEAM (CRITICAL NODE):**
    *   Successful exploitation leads to the attacker being able to execute arbitrary code on the BEAM virtual machine, gaining full control over the application.
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: Critical
    *   Effort: Moderate
    *   Skill Level: Advanced
    *   Detection Difficulty: Difficult

*   **Insecure Handling of `Any` Type (CRITICAL NODE & HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    *   Gleam's `Any` type, if used carelessly when interacting with Erlang, can bypass type safety and introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: Significant
    *   Effort: Low
    *   Skill Level: Beginner
    *   Detection Difficulty: Moderate

*   **Pass Untrusted `Any` to Erlang (CRITICAL NODE & HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    *   Gleam code passes a value of type `Any` originating from an untrusted source to an Erlang function without proper validation or type checking in Erlang.
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: Significant
    *   Effort: Low
    *   Skill Level: Beginner
    *   Detection Difficulty: Moderate
