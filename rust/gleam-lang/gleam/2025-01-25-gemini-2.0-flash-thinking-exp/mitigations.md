# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for gleam-lang/gleam

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Dependency Management using Gleam's Package Manager](./mitigation_strategies/strict_dependency_management_using_gleam's_package_manager.md)

**Description:**

1.  **Utilize `gleam add` for dependency declaration:**  Always use the `gleam add <package_name>` command to add dependencies to your project. This ensures proper tracking in `gleam.toml`.
2.  **Leverage `gleam.lock` for dependency pinning:** After adding or updating dependencies, always run `gleam deps download` to generate or update the `gleam.lock` file. Commit this file to version control. This locks down the specific versions of dependencies used, ensuring consistent builds and reducing supply chain risks.
3.  **Review `gleam.toml` and `gleam.lock` regularly:** Periodically review these files to understand your project's dependency tree and identify any potentially outdated or vulnerable packages.
4.  **Be mindful of dependency sources:** When adding dependencies, be aware of the source repository (e.g., Hex.pm for Erlang packages). Prioritize dependencies from trusted and reputable sources.

**Threats Mitigated:**

*   **Supply Chain Attacks via Dependency Manipulation (High Severity):**  Malicious actors could compromise dependency repositories or packages. `gleam.lock` helps mitigate this by ensuring you use specific, verified versions.
*   **Vulnerable Dependencies due to Uncontrolled Updates (High Severity):**  Without pinning, automatic dependency updates could introduce vulnerable versions. `gleam.lock` prevents unexpected updates and allows for controlled updates with testing.
*   **Dependency Confusion Attacks (Medium Severity):**  Accidental inclusion of malicious packages with similar names. Careful review of `gleam.toml` and dependency sources reduces this risk.

**Impact:**

*   Supply Chain Attacks via Dependency Manipulation: High
*   Vulnerable Dependencies due to Uncontrolled Updates: High
*   Dependency Confusion Attacks: Medium

**Currently Implemented:** Yes, `gleam add`, `gleam.toml`, and `gleam.lock` are fundamental parts of the Gleam project setup and are used in our backend service and API application. `gleam.lock` is committed to version control.

**Missing Implementation:**  Automated tooling to audit `gleam.lock` for known vulnerabilities in dependencies is not yet integrated into our workflow.  We rely on manual reviews and general Erlang/OTP security advisories.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Foreign Function Interface (FFI) Practices in Gleam](./mitigation_strategies/secure_foreign_function_interface__ffi__practices_in_gleam.md)

**Description:**

1.  **Minimize FFI usage:**  Limit the use of Gleam's FFI to only essential interactions with Erlang or JavaScript.  Prefer pure Gleam solutions where possible to reduce the attack surface.
2.  **Strict input validation at Gleam FFI boundary:** Before passing data from Gleam to Erlang or JavaScript via FFI, implement robust input validation within your Gleam code. Validate data types, formats, and ranges to ensure data integrity and prevent unexpected behavior in the foreign code.
3.  **Treat FFI calls as security boundaries:**  Consider FFI calls as points where security context changes.  Assume data received from Erlang or JavaScript via FFI is potentially untrusted and requires careful handling in Gleam.
4.  **Document FFI interactions clearly:**  Thoroughly document all FFI interactions, including data types passed, expected behavior, and security considerations. This aids in code review and future maintenance.

**Threats Mitigated:**

*   **Injection Vulnerabilities via FFI (High Severity):**  If Gleam code passes unsanitized data to Erlang or JavaScript via FFI, it could lead to injection vulnerabilities (e.g., if Erlang code executes arbitrary commands based on FFI input).
*   **Data Corruption and Type Mismatches at FFI Boundary (Medium Severity):**  Incorrect data type handling or assumptions across the FFI boundary can lead to data corruption or unexpected program behavior, potentially exploitable for security breaches.
*   **Unintended Side Effects from Foreign Code (Medium Severity):**  Interactions with Erlang or JavaScript code via FFI might have unintended side effects or security implications if not carefully designed and reviewed.

**Impact:**

*   Injection Vulnerabilities via FFI: High
*   Data Corruption and Type Mismatches at FFI Boundary: Medium
*   Unintended Side Effects from Foreign Code: Medium

**Currently Implemented:** We are mindful of FFI usage and try to minimize it. Input validation is performed on the Gleam side before some FFI calls, particularly for database interactions with Erlang libraries.

**Missing Implementation:**  FFI usage is not consistently minimized across all modules. Input validation at the Gleam FFI boundary is not fully comprehensive and formalized.  Documentation of FFI interactions with security considerations is lacking.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Leverage Gleam's Strong Static Type System for Security](./mitigation_strategies/leverage_gleam's_strong_static_type_system_for_security.md)

**Description:**

1.  **Embrace Gleam's type system fully:**  Utilize Gleam's strong static type system to its full potential. Define precise types for all data structures and function signatures.
2.  **Design types for security enforcement:**  Consider using custom types in Gleam to represent sensitive data or enforce security-related constraints at the type level. For example, create specific types for validated user IDs or sanitized strings.
3.  **Rely on compile-time type checking:**  Trust Gleam's compiler to catch type-related errors and potential vulnerabilities at compile time. Treat compiler warnings seriously and resolve them to ensure type safety.
4.  **Use types to guide security reasoning:**  Leverage the type system to reason about the security properties of your Gleam code. Types can help ensure data integrity and prevent certain classes of vulnerabilities by design.

**Threats Mitigated:**

*   **Type Confusion Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):**  Exploiting type mismatches to bypass security checks or cause unexpected behavior. Gleam's strong typing inherently reduces this risk.
*   **Data Integrity Issues due to Type Errors (Medium Severity):**  Incorrect data types can lead to data corruption or logic errors that have security implications. Gleam's type system helps prevent these issues.
*   **Logic Errors with Security Consequences Detectable at Compile Time (Medium Severity):**  Type errors can sometimes highlight underlying logic errors that could be exploited. Gleam's compiler helps catch these early.

**Impact:**

*   Type Confusion Vulnerabilities: Medium
*   Data Integrity Issues due to Type Errors: Medium
*   Logic Errors with Security Consequences Detectable at Compile Time: Medium

**Currently Implemented:**  We inherently benefit from Gleam's strong type system throughout the project. Custom types are used for domain modeling.

**Missing Implementation:**  We are not yet proactively designing types specifically for security enforcement (e.g., dedicated types for sensitive data with built-in validation).  We could further leverage Gleam's type system to enhance security by design.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Gleam's `Result` Type for Explicit Error Handling and Security](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_gleam's__result__type_for_explicit_error_handling_and_security.md)

**Description:**

1.  **Employ `Result` for fallible operations:**  Consistently use Gleam's `Result` type for functions that can potentially fail, especially those involving external interactions, user input processing, or security-sensitive operations.
2.  **Handle `Error` cases explicitly:**  Always handle both `Ok` and `Error` cases when working with `Result` types using pattern matching. Avoid ignoring or discarding error results, as this can mask potential security issues.
3.  **Provide informative but safe error messages:**  When returning `Error` results, ensure error messages are informative for debugging but avoid exposing sensitive internal details that could be exploited by attackers.
4.  **Use `Result` to propagate security-relevant errors:**  Propagate `Error` results up the call stack to ensure that security-related errors are properly handled and logged at appropriate levels.

**Threats Mitigated:**

*   **Information Disclosure via Error Messages (Medium Severity):**  Unhandled errors or overly verbose error messages can expose sensitive information (e.g., file paths, database details). Explicit `Result` handling allows for controlled error reporting.
*   **Logic Errors due to Unhandled Failures (Medium Severity):**  Ignoring errors can lead to unexpected program states and logic errors that might have security implications. `Result` forces explicit error handling.
*   **Reduced Resilience and Potential DoS (Medium Severity):**  Poor error handling can lead to application crashes or instability, making it more vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks. Robust `Result`-based error handling improves resilience.

**Impact:**

*   Information Disclosure via Error Messages: Medium
*   Logic Errors due to Unhandled Failures: Medium
*   Reduced Resilience and Potential DoS: Medium

**Currently Implemented:**  `Result` type is used for error handling in many parts of the backend service, particularly for operations that can fail.

**Missing Implementation:**  Error handling with `Result` is not consistently applied across all modules. Error messages are not always carefully reviewed for potential information disclosure.  More systematic use of `Result` for security-critical operations is needed.
