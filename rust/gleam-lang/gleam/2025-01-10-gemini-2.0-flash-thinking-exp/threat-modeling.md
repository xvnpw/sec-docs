# Threat Model Analysis for gleam-lang/gleam

## Threat: [Compiler Bugs Leading to Unintended Code Generation](./threats/compiler_bugs_leading_to_unintended_code_generation.md)

**Description:** An attacker might exploit a bug in the Gleam compiler by crafting specific Gleam code that, when compiled, produces Erlang bytecode with unintended behavior. This could allow the attacker to bypass security checks, inject malicious logic, or cause unexpected crashes in the underlying Erlang runtime.

**Impact:** Depending on the nature of the bug and the resulting bytecode, the impact could range from application crashes and denial of service to data breaches or unauthorized access.

**Affected Component:** `gleam compile` (the Gleam compiler)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* Regularly update the Gleam compiler to the latest stable version to benefit from bug fixes.
* Implement thorough testing of compiled applications, especially in security-sensitive areas.
* Monitor the Gleam issue tracker and release notes for reported compiler bugs and security advisories.

## Threat: [Insecure FFI Usage Leading to Erlang Vulnerabilities](./threats/insecure_ffi_usage_leading_to_erlang_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** When using Gleam's Foreign Function Interface (FFI) to interact with Erlang code, developers might inadvertently pass unsanitized or improperly validated data. This could expose the application to vulnerabilities present in the called Erlang functions, such as injection flaws or buffer overflows (if the Erlang code uses native functions unsafely).

**Impact:** The impact depends on the vulnerability in the called Erlang code. It could range from denial of service to remote code execution.

**Affected Component:** The FFI mechanism within Gleam (`@external` attribute).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* Carefully review all FFI calls and ensure that data passed to Erlang functions is properly sanitized and validated on the Gleam side.
* Be aware of the potential security implications of the Erlang functions being called and their input expectations.
* Apply the same security scrutiny to Erlang code used via FFI as you would to your Gleam code.

## Threat: [Malicious Packages on Hex](./threats/malicious_packages_on_hex.md)

**Description:** An attacker could intentionally publish a package on Hex that contains malicious code designed to harm applications that depend on it.

**Impact:**  The malicious package could perform a wide range of harmful actions, such as stealing credentials, compromising the server, or injecting malware.

**Affected Component:** Hex package manager.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* Be cautious when adding new dependencies and thoroughly research their maintainers and reputation.
* Avoid using packages from unknown or untrusted sources.
* Consider using a private Hex repository for internal dependencies.

## Threat: [Insecure Build Processes Exposing Secrets](./threats/insecure_build_processes_exposing_secrets.md)

**Description:** The build process for a Gleam application might involve storing or handling sensitive information (e.g., API keys, database credentials) in a way that makes them accessible to attackers. This could occur through insecure build scripts or by embedding secrets directly in the code.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information could lead to unauthorized access to resources, data breaches, or other security compromises.

**Affected Component:** Build scripts, CI/CD pipelines, and potentially the compiled application if secrets are embedded.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* Avoid storing sensitive information directly in code or build scripts.
* Utilize environment variables or secure secret management solutions to handle sensitive data during the build and deployment process.
* Implement proper access controls for build environments and CI/CD pipelines.
