## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Gleam Application [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_gleam_application__critical_node_.md)

* **Compromise Gleam Application [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents the successful compromise of the application. All other nodes and paths contribute to achieving this goal.

## Attack Tree Path: [Logic Errors Exploitation [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/logic_errors_exploitation__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

* **Logic Errors Exploitation [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * Description: Exploiting flaws in the application's Gleam code logic. These are errors made by developers during the implementation of features.
    * Likelihood: Medium-High
    * Impact: Medium-High (Can lead to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or denial of service)
    * Effort: Low-High (Depends on the complexity of the error)
    * Skill Level: Low-High (Simple errors can be found easily, complex ones require more skill)
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium-High (Requires understanding of the application's intended behavior)

## Attack Tree Path: [Unsafe Erlang Function Calls [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/unsafe_erlang_function_calls__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

* **Unsafe Erlang Function Calls [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * Description: Gleam code calls Erlang functions that are known to be vulnerable or are used in an insecure way. This bridges the security of the Gleam application to the potentially less safe world of arbitrary Erlang code.
    * Likelihood: Medium-Low
    * Impact: High (Can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server, information disclosure, or complete system compromise)
    * Effort: Medium (Requires knowledge of Erlang vulnerabilities and how to call Erlang from Gleam)
    * Skill Level: Medium-High
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium-High (Requires monitoring Erlang function calls and their parameters)

## Attack Tree Path: [BEAM VM Vulnerabilities (Indirect) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/beam_vm_vulnerabilities__indirect___critical_node_.md)

* **BEAM VM Vulnerabilities (Indirect) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * Description: Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Erlang BEAM virtual machine, on which the Gleam application runs. While not a direct flaw in Gleam code, it's a vulnerability in the runtime environment.
    * Likelihood: Low
    * Impact: High (Can lead to complete control over the server and all applications running on the BEAM VM)
    * Effort: High (Requires deep knowledge of the BEAM VM internals)
    * Skill Level: High
    * Detection Difficulty: Low (Exploitation might be detectable by system-level monitoring tools)

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

* **Exploit Dependencies [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * This category encompasses two sub-attacks related to the external libraries used by the Gleam application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Package Injection [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_package_injection__critical_node_.md)

    * **Malicious Package Injection [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * Description: Introducing a malicious Gleam or Erlang dependency into the project. This can happen through compromised developer accounts or by poisoning package repositories.
        * Likelihood: Medium
        * Impact: High (Can lead to complete control over the application, as the malicious package can execute arbitrary code)
        * Effort: Medium-High (Requires compromising a developer account or a package repository)
        * Skill Level: Medium-High
        * Detection Difficulty: High (Difficult to detect without thorough dependency auditing and integrity checks)

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerable Dependencies [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerable_dependencies__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

    * **Vulnerable Dependencies [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * Description: Using Gleam or Erlang dependencies that have known security vulnerabilities. If these vulnerabilities are not patched, attackers can exploit them.
        * Likelihood: Medium-High
        * Impact: High (Depends on the specific vulnerability, can range from information disclosure to remote code execution)
        * Effort: Low-Medium (Exploits for known vulnerabilities are often publicly available)
        * Skill Level: Low-Medium (Exploiting known vulnerabilities is often easier)
        * Detection Difficulty: Medium (Can be detected using dependency scanning tools)

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Gleam's Compilation/Build Process [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_gleam's_compilationbuild_process__critical_node_.md)

* **Exploit Gleam's Compilation/Build Process [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * This category covers attacks targeting the process of turning Gleam source code into a runnable application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compiler Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compiler_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

    * **Compiler Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * Description: Exploiting a security flaw in the Gleam compiler itself. This is less common but can have a severe impact.
        * Likelihood: Very Low
        * Impact: High (Can allow the attacker to inject malicious code directly into the compiled application)
        * Effort: High (Requires deep understanding of compiler internals)
        * Skill Level: High
        * Detection Difficulty: Very High (Extremely difficult to detect without rigorous build process auditing)

## Attack Tree Path: [Build Toolchain Manipulation [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/build_toolchain_manipulation__critical_node_.md)

    * **Build Toolchain Manipulation [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * Description: Compromising the tools used to build the Gleam application, such as Rebar3. This allows attackers to modify the build process and inject malicious code.
        * Likelihood: Low-Medium
        * Impact: High (Can lead to the injection of malicious code into the final application artifact)
        * Effort: Medium (Requires access to the build environment and understanding of the build process)
        * Skill Level: Medium
        * Detection Difficulty: Medium-High (Requires monitoring changes to build configurations and outputs)
