## Mitigation Strategy: [Precise File Inclusion with `rust-embed`](./mitigation_strategies/precise_file_inclusion_with__rust-embed_.md)

1. Mitigation Strategy: Precise File Inclusion with `rust-embed`

    *   **Description:** This strategy focuses on controlling *exactly* which files are included by `rust-embed` to minimize the risk of unintentionally embedding sensitive or unnecessary files.
        1.  **Explicit File Listing:**  Within the `#[derive(RustEmbed)]` macro, use the `include` attribute to *explicitly list* each file to be embedded.  Avoid using broad wildcard patterns (e.g., `*`, `**/*`).  If necessary, use more specific glob patterns (e.g., `images/*.png`, `configs/config.toml`).
        2.  **Avoid `exclude` (Generally):** While `rust-embed` offers an `exclude` attribute, relying primarily on `include` with precise patterns is generally safer and easier to reason about.  `exclude` can become complex to manage and may lead to unintended inclusions if not carefully maintained.
        3.  **Review `RustEmbed` Configuration:** Regularly review the `#[derive(RustEmbed)]` configuration in your code to ensure that only the intended files are being included.  This should be part of the code review process.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Information Disclosure (Unintended Files):** (Severity: **Medium**) Accidentally embedding files containing sensitive information (e.g., development notes, temporary files, backups, configuration files with secrets).
        *   **Increased Attack Surface:** (Severity: **Low**) Embedding unnecessary files increases the potential attack surface, although the risk is generally low if the embedded files themselves are not vulnerable.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced from **Medium** to **Low**.
        *   **Increased Attack Surface:** Risk reduced from **Low** to **Negligible**.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Explicit file listing is partially implemented, but some broader patterns are still used.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   The `RustEmbed` configuration needs to be reviewed and refined to use the most specific file inclusion patterns possible, ideally listing each file individually.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Lazy Loading of Embedded Files (with `rust-embed` API)](./mitigation_strategies/lazy_loading_of_embedded_files__with__rust-embed__api_.md)

2. Mitigation Strategy: Lazy Loading of Embedded Files (with `rust-embed` API)

    *   **Description:** This strategy aims to reduce memory usage and improve performance by loading embedded files only when they are actually needed, rather than all at once during application startup. This leverages `rust-embed`'s API for accessing files as byte slices.
        1.  **Identify Large Files:** Identify any large files embedded using `rust-embed`.
        2.  **Use `get` Method:** Instead of loading the entire file into memory at startup, use the `RustEmbed::get` method to obtain a `Cow<'static, [u8]>`. This represents a borrowed slice of the file's contents.
        3.  **Incremental Processing:** Process the byte slice incrementally, reading only the portions of the file that are required at any given time.  This avoids loading the entire file into memory.  For example, if you are parsing a large CSV file, read and process it line by line.
        4.  **Avoid `iter` for Large Files (Unless Necessary):** The `RustEmbed::iter` method, which provides an iterator over all embedded file names, is generally fine. However, avoid using it to *load* the contents of large files all at once.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Memory Exhaustion:** (Severity: **High**) An attacker could potentially craft an input that triggers the application to load a very large embedded file, leading to memory exhaustion and a crash. Lazy loading mitigates this by only loading necessary portions of the file.
        *   **Performance Degradation (Slow Startup/Response):** (Severity: **Medium**) Large embedded files can increase binary size and slow down application startup and response times. Lazy loading improves startup time by deferring the loading of large files.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **DoS:** Risk reduced from **High** to **Low** (if lazy loading is implemented correctly).
        *   **Performance Degradation:** Risk reduced from **Medium** to **Low**.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Lazy loading is partially implemented in some parts of the application, but not consistently.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   A consistent approach to lazy loading needs to be adopted where applicable, especially for any large embedded files. The code needs to be refactored to use `RustEmbed::get` and incremental processing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Reviewing `rust-embed` API Usage](./mitigation_strategies/reviewing__rust-embed__api_usage.md)

3. Mitigation Strategy: Reviewing `rust-embed` API Usage

    *   **Description:** This is a continuous review process focused on how `rust-embed` is used within the codebase.
        1.  **Regular Code Reviews:**  During code reviews, specifically examine any code that interacts with the `rust-embed` API (e.g., `RustEmbed::get`, `RustEmbed::iter`).
        2.  **Check for Safe Usage:** Ensure that the code is using the API safely and efficiently:
            *   Verify that large files are being loaded lazily (as described above).
            *   Confirm that file paths are being handled correctly and are not susceptible to path traversal vulnerabilities (although `rust-embed` itself is designed to prevent this, it's good practice to double-check).
            *   Ensure that the code is not making assumptions about the contents of embedded files without proper validation.
        3. **Documentation:** Document any specific considerations or limitations related to the use of `rust-embed` in the project's documentation.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Incorrect API Usage:** (Severity: **Variable**) This is a broad category that encompasses various potential issues arising from misusing the `rust-embed` API, such as inefficient loading, incorrect file path handling, or unexpected behavior.
        *   **Logic Errors:** (Severity: **Variable**) Errors in the application logic related to handling embedded files.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Incorrect API Usage:** Risk reduced from **Variable** to **Low** (through careful code reviews and adherence to best practices).
        *   **Logic Errors:** Risk reduced from **Variable** to **Low**.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Code reviews are conducted, but there isn't a specific focus on `rust-embed` API usage.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Code review guidelines need to be updated to explicitly include checks for safe and efficient `rust-embed` API usage.
        *   Documentation should be added to highlight any project-specific considerations related to `rust-embed`.
