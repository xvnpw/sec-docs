# Attack Surface Analysis for pyros2097/rust-embed

## Attack Surface: [Sensitive Data Exposure](./attack_surfaces/sensitive_data_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Extraction of confidential information embedded within the application binary.
*   **`rust-embed` Contribution:** `rust-embed` *directly* embeds files into the binary, making their contents accessible to anyone with a copy of the executable. This is the core mechanism of the attack.
*   **Example:** An attacker uses a disassembler to examine the binary and finds an embedded configuration file containing a hardcoded database password or API key.
*   **Impact:** Loss of confidentiality, unauthorized access to systems or data, potential for further attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never Embed Secrets:** Absolutely do not embed any sensitive data (API keys, passwords, cryptographic keys, etc.) directly in the binary using `rust-embed`.
    *   **Use Secure Configuration:** Load sensitive data at *runtime* from secure sources:
        *   Environment variables.
        *   Secure configuration files (not embedded, and properly protected with file system permissions).
        *   Dedicated secret management services (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, Google Cloud Secret Manager).
    *   **Obfuscation (Limited):** String obfuscation *before* embedding can slightly increase the effort for attackers, but it's not a strong defense.

## Attack Surface: [Supply Chain Attack (Pre-Compilation File Tampering)](./attack_surfaces/supply_chain_attack__pre-compilation_file_tampering_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker modifies files *before* they are embedded by `rust-embed`, injecting malicious code or data into the final binary. The critical aspect here is the *embedding* of the compromised file.
*   **`rust-embed` Contribution:** `rust-embed` is the *direct mechanism* by which the attacker's tampered files are incorporated into the application. Without `rust-embed` (or a similar embedding tool), the attacker would need to find another way to inject their payload.  The attack leverages `rust-embed`'s core functionality.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the source code repository and modifies a JavaScript file that is *specifically designated for embedding via `rust-embed`*. The modified file contains malicious code that is executed when the application runs, and this execution is directly facilitated by the file being embedded.
*   **Impact:** Code execution, data breaches, complete system compromise (depending on the nature of the tampered files).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Source Code Repository:** Implement strong access controls, multi-factor authentication, code reviews, and branch protection for your source code repository. This is crucial to prevent the initial tampering.
    *   **Secure Build System:** Protect your CI/CD pipeline from unauthorized access and modification. This prevents tampering during the build process.
    *   **Code Signing:** Digitally sign the compiled binary to detect tampering *after* the build process (and after `rust-embed` has done its work).
    *   **Reproducible Builds:** Strive for reproducible builds to make it easier to detect unauthorized changes. This helps verify that the build process hasn't been compromised.
    *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** While more focused on dependencies, SCA can sometimes help identify issues in build tools or scripts.
    *  **Input Validation of Embedded Resources (Post-Retrieval):** Even though the resource is embedded, if it's used as input (e.g., a configuration file), validate it *after* retrieving it from `rust-embed`. This adds a layer of defense even if the embedded file was tampered with. This is a defense-in-depth strategy.
