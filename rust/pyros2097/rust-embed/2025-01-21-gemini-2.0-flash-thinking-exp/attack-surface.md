# Attack Surface Analysis for pyros2097/rust-embed

## Attack Surface: [Build-Time File Injection/Substitution](./attack_surfaces/build-time_file_injectionsubstitution.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious files are injected or substituted into the application binary during the build process due to a compromised build environment or untrusted file sources used by `rust-embed`.
*   **How rust-embed contributes to the attack surface:** `rust-embed`'s core functionality is to embed files specified by paths into the application binary *at build time*. This process inherently trusts the build environment and the source of these files. If these are compromised, `rust-embed` will embed malicious content.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the build pipeline and modifies a critical JavaScript file intended to be embedded by `rust-embed`. This altered, malicious JavaScript is then embedded into the application binary. When users run the application, this malicious JavaScript executes, potentially leading to account takeover or data theft.
*   **Impact:** **Critical**.  Unrestricted code execution within the application context, complete compromise of application functionality, data exfiltration, supply chain compromise affecting all users of the application.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure the Build Environment:** Implement robust access controls, monitoring, and regular security audits of the build infrastructure.
    *   **Supply Chain Security:** Verify the integrity and source of all files intended for embedding. Use checksums, digital signatures, and trusted repositories for assets.
    *   **Code Review for Embedding Configuration:** Rigorously review all changes to `rust-embed` configuration and file lists to detect any unauthorized or suspicious inclusions.
    *   **Isolated Build Environments:** Utilize containerized or virtualized build environments to limit the impact of a potential compromise.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only necessary permissions to build processes and users involved in the build pipeline.

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure through Embedded Files (Sensitive Data Exposure)](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_through_embedded_files__sensitive_data_exposure_.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information, such as API keys, credentials, or internal application secrets, is unintentionally or intentionally embedded within the application binary through `rust-embed`, making it accessible to attackers via reverse engineering or memory analysis.
*   **How rust-embed contributes to the attack surface:** `rust-embed` embeds files directly into the application binary. This means any file included, regardless of its content, becomes part of the compiled executable and can be extracted by analyzing the binary.
*   **Example:** A developer mistakenly includes a configuration file containing database credentials or API keys in the directories scanned by `rust-embed`. These sensitive credentials are then embedded into the application binary. An attacker can reverse engineer the application, extract the embedded configuration file, and gain unauthorized access to the database or external services.
*   **Impact:** **High** to **Critical**. Exposure of sensitive credentials leading to unauthorized access to backend systems, data breaches, privilege escalation, and potential complete compromise of associated systems and data. Severity depends on the sensitivity of the exposed information.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strictly Avoid Embedding Secrets:** Never embed sensitive information like API keys, passwords, or cryptographic keys directly into files that are embedded by `rust-embed`.
    *   **Secret Management Solutions:** Utilize dedicated secret management solutions (e.g., environment variables, dedicated secret stores, HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to handle sensitive credentials securely outside of the application binary.
    *   **Regularly Audit Embedded Files:** Conduct thorough audits of all files being embedded by `rust-embed` to ensure no sensitive information is inadvertently included.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Embedded Data:** Only embed the absolute minimum data required for the application to function. Avoid embedding configuration files or other files that might contain sensitive settings.
    *   **Consider Encryption (with Caution):** If embedding sensitive *data* (not credentials) is absolutely necessary, consider encrypting it within the embedded files. However, key management for decryption within the application becomes a critical security challenge and should be carefully evaluated.  This is generally not recommended for secrets.
