# Threat Model Analysis for pyros2097/rust-embed

## Threat: [Accidental Embedding of Sensitive Data](./threats/accidental_embedding_of_sensitive_data.md)

*   **Threat:** Accidental Embedding of Sensitive Data
*   **Description:** Developers may inadvertently include sensitive information like API keys, passwords, private keys, or internal documentation within the assets directory that `rust-embed` embeds. An attacker gaining access to the application binary (e.g., through reverse engineering) could extract these embedded secrets.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, unauthorized access to systems or data protected by the exposed secrets, potential privilege escalation, and reputational damage.
*   **Affected Component:** `rust-embed` macro, asset inclusion process.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Code Review:** Implement mandatory code reviews focusing on the contents of the assets directory before each release.
    *   **Secure Development Practices:** Establish clear guidelines and training for developers to prevent inclusion of sensitive data in assets.
    *   **Automated Scanning:** Utilize automated tools to scan the assets directory for potential secrets during the build process.
    *   **Environment Variables/External Configuration:** Favor using environment variables, configuration files loaded from outside the binary, or secure secret management solutions for sensitive data instead of embedding them as assets.
    *   **`.gitignore` and Exclusion Rules:** Strictly use `.gitignore` or similar mechanisms to explicitly exclude sensitive files and directories from being included in the assets directory.

## Threat: [Embedding Compromised or Malicious Assets](./threats/embedding_compromised_or_malicious_assets.md)

*   **Threat:** Embedding Compromised or Malicious Assets
*   **Description:** If the assets directory contains files sourced from untrusted or compromised origins, these malicious files will be embedded into the application binary by `rust-embed`. An attacker could intentionally replace legitimate assets with malicious ones before embedding.
*   **Impact:** Integrity compromise of the application, potential introduction of malware or backdoors into the application, supply chain attack, and potential compromise of user systems if malicious assets are served to users.
*   **Affected Component:** `rust-embed` macro, asset inclusion process, build pipeline.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Trusted Asset Sources:** Only use assets from trusted and verified sources, preferably from reputable and secure repositories or vendors.
    *   **Integrity Verification:** Implement a process to verify the integrity and authenticity of assets before embedding them. This could involve checksum verification (e.g., using SHA256 hashes) or digital signatures.
    *   **Security Scanning:** Regularly scan the assets directory for known vulnerabilities and malware using security tools before each build.
    *   **Dependency Management:** Utilize dependency management tools to track and manage the sources of assets and ensure their integrity throughout the development lifecycle.
    *   **Secure Build Pipeline:** Secure the build pipeline to prevent unauthorized modification of assets during the build process.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities within Embedded Assets](./threats/vulnerabilities_within_embedded_assets.md)

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities within Embedded Assets
*   **Description:** Embedded assets, especially web assets like JavaScript libraries or CSS frameworks, might contain known security vulnerabilities. `rust-embed` directly includes these potentially vulnerable assets into the application binary. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities if the application uses or serves these assets.
*   **Impact:** Application becomes vulnerable to exploits targeting vulnerabilities in embedded assets, potentially leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), code execution, or other attacks depending on the vulnerability and asset usage.
*   **Affected Component:** Embedded assets themselves, `rust-embed` macro (for embedding), application code that uses or serves embedded assets.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Asset Version Management:** Keep embedded assets up-to-date with the latest security patches and versions. Implement a system to track and update asset versions regularly.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan embedded assets for known vulnerabilities using vulnerability scanners.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) for web applications serving embedded web assets to mitigate the impact of potential XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Subresource Integrity (SRI):** Use Subresource Integrity (SRI) for embedded web assets to ensure that browsers only load assets from trusted sources and that assets have not been tampered with.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the application and its embedded assets to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Code Injection via Embedded Assets](./threats/code_injection_via_embedded_assets.md)

*   **Threat:** Code Injection via Embedded Assets
*   **Description:** If the application processes or serves embedded assets (e.g., serving HTML or JavaScript files directly to users), and does not properly sanitize or validate them, it may be vulnerable to code injection attacks, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Because `rust-embed` makes it easy to serve these assets, developers might overlook proper security measures. An attacker could inject malicious code into the assets before embedding or during asset processing if the application is vulnerable.
*   **Impact:** Successful code injection attacks can lead to session hijacking, defacement, malicious actions performed on behalf of users, or further compromise of the application and user data.
*   **Affected Component:** Application code that processes or serves embedded assets, `rust-embed` macro (for embedding and facilitating asset serving).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Output Encoding and Sanitization:** Implement proper output encoding and sanitization when serving or processing embedded assets, especially if they are dynamically generated or user-influenced. Use context-aware encoding to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Utilize a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the capabilities of embedded scripts and mitigate the impact of potential XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Input Validation:** If embedded assets are generated or modified based on user input or external data, implement robust input validation to prevent injection attacks.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Avoid directly serving or processing untrusted or user-provided content as embedded assets. If necessary, isolate the processing and serving of such assets to minimize the impact of potential vulnerabilities.
