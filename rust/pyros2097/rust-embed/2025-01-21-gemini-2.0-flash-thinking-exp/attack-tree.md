Objective: To compromise application via rust-embed

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
*   **2. Exploit Misuse or Misconfiguration of rust-embed by Application Developer [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
    *   **2.1. Path Traversal Vulnerabilities via Asset Names [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **2.1.1. Application uses user-controlled input to select embedded assets without proper sanitization. [CRITICAL NODE]**
            *   [Actionable Insight 2.1.1]: **Never** directly use user-provided input to construct paths for accessing embedded assets. If asset selection based on user input is needed, use a safe mapping or whitelist approach. Sanitize and validate any user input before using it to access assets.
                *   Likelihood: Medium to High
                *   Impact: High
                *   Effort: Low
                *   Skill Level: Low
                *   Detection Difficulty: Low to Medium
    *   **2.2. Information Disclosure via Embedded Assets [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **2.2.1. Accidental Embedding of Sensitive Data (API keys, secrets, internal configurations) [CRITICAL NODE]**
            *   [Actionable Insight 2.2.1]:  **Strictly control** which directories and files are included in `rust-embed` embedding. Regularly audit the embedded assets to ensure no sensitive information is inadvertently included. Use `.gitignore`-like mechanisms for `rust-embed` configuration to exclude sensitive files.
                *   Likelihood: Medium
                *   Impact: Medium to High
                *   Effort: Low
                *   Skill Level: Low
                *   Detection Difficulty: Low to Medium
    *   **2.4. Client-Side Vulnerabilities via Embedded Content (If serving web content) [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        *   **2.4.1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Embedded HTML/JS [CRITICAL NODE]**
            *   **2.4.1.1. Embedding Untrusted or User-Generated HTML/JS [CRITICAL NODE]**
                *   [Actionable Insight 2.4.1.1]: **Never embed untrusted or user-generated HTML or JavaScript directly.** If embedding dynamic content, sanitize and escape it properly before embedding and serving. Use Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS risks.
                    *   Likelihood: Medium to High
                    *   Impact: High
                    *   Effort: Low to Medium
                    *   Skill Level: Low to Medium
                    *   Detection Difficulty: Low to Medium
    *   **2.5. Build-Time/Supply Chain Attacks related to Asset Embedding [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        *   **2.5.1. Compromised Development Environment leading to Malicious Asset Injection [CRITICAL NODE]**
            *   [Actionable Insight 2.5.1]: Secure development environments. Implement strong access controls, use secure coding practices, and regularly scan development machines for malware.
                *   Likelihood: Low to Medium
                *   Impact: High
                *   Effort: Medium to High
                *   Skill Level: Medium to High
                *   Detection Difficulty: High
        *   **2.5.2. Compromised CI/CD Pipeline leading to Malicious Asset Injection [CRITICAL NODE]**
            *   [Actionable Insight 2.5.2]: Secure CI/CD pipelines. Implement access controls, use secure build agents, and verify the integrity of build artifacts. Implement checks to ensure only authorized and reviewed assets are embedded during the build process.
                *   Likelihood: Low
                *   Impact: Critical
                *   Effort: High
                *   Skill Level: Expert
                *   Detection Difficulty: High
    *   **1.1.1. Memory Safety Issues (Unlikely in Rust, but theoretically possible in unsafe blocks) [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   [Actionable Insight 1.1.1]: Regularly audit rust-embed's code, especially unsafe blocks, for memory safety issues. Utilize Rust's built-in memory safety tools during development and CI.
            *   Likelihood: Low
            *   Impact: High
            *   Effort: High
            *   Skill Level: Expert
