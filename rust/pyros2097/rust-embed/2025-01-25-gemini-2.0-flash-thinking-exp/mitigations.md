*   **Missing Implementation:** N/A - Currently implemented as part of standard maintenance.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dependency Auditing](./mitigation_strategies/dependency_auditing.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Dependency Auditing

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Integrate a dependency auditing tool like `cargo audit` into your development workflow and CI/CD pipeline. This tool will specifically check for known vulnerabilities in your dependencies, including `rust-embed` and its transitive dependencies.
    *   Step 2: Run `cargo audit` regularly (e.g., before each release, weekly, or nightly in CI) to proactively identify security issues in the `rust-embed` dependency chain.
    *   Step 3: Review the `cargo audit` report for identified vulnerabilities specifically related to `rust-embed` or its dependencies.
    *   Step 4: Prioritize and address reported vulnerabilities that affect `rust-embed` or its dependencies, based on severity and exploitability. This may involve updating `rust-embed` (if a newer version fixes the issue), updating other dependencies, or finding alternative solutions if vulnerabilities are found in `rust-embed`'s dependencies.
    *   Step 5: Document the audit findings and remediation actions taken, especially those related to `rust-embed`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Known vulnerabilities in `rust-embed` and transitive dependencies - Severity: High (for critical vulnerabilities) to Medium (for less critical vulnerabilities). This directly targets vulnerabilities within the `rust-embed` ecosystem.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Known vulnerabilities in `rust-embed` and transitive dependencies: High - Proactively identifies and allows for remediation of known security flaws in `rust-embed` and its dependencies, reducing the attack surface originating from the crate itself.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partial - `cargo audit` is run manually before major releases.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Automated `cargo audit` integration into the CI/CD pipeline for every commit or nightly builds to continuously monitor `rust-embed` and its dependencies.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Content Security Policy (CSP) for Web Assets](./mitigation_strategies/content_security_policy__csp__for_web_assets.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Content Security Policy (CSP) for Web Assets

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Define a strict Content Security Policy specifically if you are embedding *web assets* (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) using `rust-embed` and serving them to web browsers. This policy controls how browsers handle resources loaded from these embedded assets.
    *   Step 2: Implement the CSP by setting the `Content-Security-Policy` HTTP header when serving web assets embedded via `rust-embed`. This ensures that the browser respects the security policy for your embedded content.
    *   Step 3: Carefully review and refine your CSP to be restrictive enough to mitigate XSS risks within your *embedded web assets*, but still allow these assets to function correctly.
    *   Step 4: Regularly monitor CSP reports (if configured) to identify and address any policy violations or potential issues arising from your *embedded web content*.
    *   Step 5: Consider using CSP directives like `nonce` or `hash` for inline scripts and styles within your *embedded web assets* for enhanced XSS protection.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in embedded web assets - Severity: High. This directly mitigates XSS risks originating from web content embedded using `rust-embed`.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in embedded web assets: High - Significantly reduces the risk of XSS attacks originating from web assets embedded using `rust-embed`, protecting users from malicious scripts within your application's embedded content.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization (If Applicable)](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization__if_applicable_.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Input Validation and Sanitization (If Applicable)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Identify if your application processes or manipulates *embedded content* (assets loaded via `rust-embed`) based on external input. While `rust-embed` is primarily for static embedding, dynamic manipulation *after* loading is possible.
    *   Step 2: For any input points that influence the processing of *embedded assets*, implement robust input validation to ensure that the input conforms to expected formats and constraints before it affects the embedded content.
    *   Step 3: Sanitize any user-provided data before using it to interact with or process *embedded content*. This prevents injection vulnerabilities if user input is used to construct paths or manipulate data related to embedded assets.
    *   Step 4: If possible, avoid dynamic manipulation of *embedded content* based on user input altogether. Prefer static embedded content or server-side rendering to minimize risks associated with user-controlled data interacting with embedded assets.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Injection vulnerabilities (e.g., HTML injection, script injection) when processing embedded content based on user input - Severity: Medium to High (depending on the context and impact). This addresses injection risks specifically related to how your application handles content loaded via `rust-embed` and user input.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Injection vulnerabilities when processing embedded content: Medium to High - Reduces the risk of injection attacks by preventing malicious code from being introduced through user input and affecting the processing of content originally embedded using `rust-embed`.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes - Input validation and sanitization are standard practices throughout the application, including areas that might indirectly interact with embedded assets.

*   **Missing Implementation:** N/A - Input validation and sanitization are generally well-implemented. Continuous review is recommended, especially in areas that process or interact with embedded assets.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Review Embedded Assets](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_review_embedded_assets.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Regularly Review Embedded Assets

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Establish a process for regularly reviewing the files that are embedded using `rust-embed`. This review should be conducted periodically to ensure the continued security and integrity of your *embedded assets*.
    *   Step 2: Verify the source and integrity of all *embedded assets*. Ensure they originate from trusted sources and have not been tampered with since they were added to your `rust-embed` configuration.
    *   Step 3: Scan *embedded assets* for potential vulnerabilities or malicious content using security scanning tools. This is crucial as `rust-embed` directly includes these assets in your application binary.
    *   Step 4: Document the review process and findings, specifically noting any issues found within the *embedded assets*.
    *   Step 5: If external tools or scripts are used to process assets *before* embedding them with `rust-embed`, review and secure these tools and scripts as well to prevent malicious asset injection at the embedding stage.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Malicious code in embedded assets - Severity: High (if malicious code is successfully embedded and executed from assets loaded via `rust-embed`).
    *   Vulnerabilities in embedded assets (e.g., outdated JavaScript libraries within embedded web assets) - Severity: Medium to High (depending on the vulnerability). This directly addresses threats introduced through the assets you choose to embed using `rust-embed`.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Malicious code in embedded assets: High - Reduces the risk of embedding and deploying compromised assets *via `rust-embed`*, which could harm users or the application.
    *   Vulnerabilities in embedded assets: Medium to High - Helps identify and remediate vulnerabilities present in assets *before they are embedded using `rust-embed`*, reducing the attack surface of your application.

*   **Currently Implemented:** No - Embedded assets are not currently reviewed regularly beyond initial inclusion.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Implement a scheduled review process for embedded assets, including security scanning and source verification, to ensure the ongoing security of assets embedded via `rust-embed`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege for Embedded Assets](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_for_embedded_assets.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Principle of Least Privilege for Embedded Assets

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Analyze the required permissions and access rights for each *embedded asset* within your application's context. Consider how your application interacts with assets loaded via `rust-embed`.
    *   Step 2: Ensure that *embedded assets* are granted only the minimum necessary permissions to function correctly within your application. Avoid granting excessive privileges to the embedded content.
    *   Step 3: If embedding configuration files via `rust-embed`, ensure they are read-only at runtime and do not contain secrets. This limits potential misuse of embedded configuration.
    *   Step 4: Avoid embedding sensitive data directly via `rust-embed` if possible. If sensitive data must be embedded, explore alternative secure storage and retrieval mechanisms *outside of direct embedding* or encrypt the embedded data appropriately.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Information disclosure due to overly permissive access to embedded assets - Severity: Medium. This addresses risks related to how embedded assets are accessed and handled *after being loaded by `rust-embed`*.
    *   Privilege escalation if embedded assets can be manipulated or misused due to excessive permissions - Severity: Medium. This mitigates risks if vulnerabilities in your application allow attackers to leverage overly permissive embedded assets.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Information disclosure: Medium - Reduces the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information potentially contained within assets *embedded using `rust-embed`*.
    *   Privilege escalation: Medium - Limits the potential for attackers to exploit *embedded assets* to gain elevated privileges or compromise the application's security, by ensuring assets have minimal necessary permissions.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partial - Configuration files are generally read-only, but a formal review of permissions for all embedded assets loaded via `rust-embed` has not been conducted.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Conduct a comprehensive review of permissions for all assets embedded using `rust-embed` and enforce the principle of least privilege to minimize potential misuse of these assets.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Build Pipeline for Asset Embedding](./mitigation_strategies/secure_build_pipeline_for_asset_embedding.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Secure Build Pipeline for Asset Embedding

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Secure your build pipeline to prevent unauthorized modifications or injections of malicious files during the *asset embedding process* using `rust-embed`. This is crucial to ensure the integrity of assets included in your binary via `rust-embed`.
    *   Step 2: Implement integrity checks for assets *before embedding them with `rust-embed`*. This could involve checksum verification or digital signatures to ensure assets haven't been tampered with during the build process.
    *   Step 3: If assets are sourced from external locations for embedding via `rust-embed`, use secure channels (HTTPS) and verify the authenticity of the source to prevent supply chain attacks.
    *   Step 4: Limit access to the build pipeline and related infrastructure to authorized personnel only to prevent unauthorized manipulation of the *asset embedding process*.
    *   Step 5: Regularly audit the build pipeline configuration and processes for security vulnerabilities that could be exploited to inject malicious assets into your application through `rust-embed`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Supply chain attacks targeting embedded assets - Severity: High. This directly addresses the risk of malicious assets being introduced into your application *through the `rust-embed` embedding process*.
    *   Compromised build environment leading to malicious asset injection - Severity: High. This mitigates the risk of attackers compromising your build system to inject malicious assets that are then embedded via `rust-embed`.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Supply chain attacks: High - Reduces the risk of attackers injecting malicious assets into your application *through compromised dependencies or external sources used in conjunction with `rust-embed`*.
    *   Compromised build environment: High - Protects against malicious actors exploiting vulnerabilities in the build pipeline to inject malicious code into assets that are subsequently embedded using `rust-embed`.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partial - Build pipeline uses HTTPS for external asset sources, but integrity checks and comprehensive pipeline security audits specifically focused on the `rust-embed` asset embedding process are not regularly performed.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Implement integrity checks for assets in the build pipeline *before they are embedded using `rust-embed`* and conduct regular security audits of the build pipeline infrastructure and processes, focusing on the security of the asset embedding stage.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secret Management - Avoid Embedding Secrets](./mitigation_strategies/secret_management_-_avoid_embedding_secrets.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Secret Management - Avoid Embedding Secrets

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Identify and **never embed sensitive information like API keys, passwords, or cryptographic secrets directly into your application binary using `rust-embed`**.  Embedded secrets are easily accessible by reverse-engineering the binary created by `rust-embed`.
    *   Step 2: Implement a secure secret management solution *instead of embedding secrets*. Options include:
        *   Environment variables: Load secrets from environment variables at runtime, keeping them separate from the embedded binary.
        *   Configuration files outside the binary: Store secrets in encrypted configuration files located outside the application binary, preventing them from being directly embedded by `rust-embed`.
        *   Dedicated secret management services: Use a dedicated service to securely store and retrieve secrets, ensuring secrets are never embedded in the application binary by `rust-embed`.
    *   Step 3: Ensure that secrets are accessed only when needed and by authorized components of the application, regardless of the secret management method chosen *instead of embedding*.
    *   Step 4: Regularly rotate secrets according to security best practices, independent of how assets are embedded using `rust-embed`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Hardcoded secrets in binary (due to embedding via `rust-embed`) - Severity: Critical. This directly addresses the severe risk of embedding secrets using `rust-embed`.
    *   Information disclosure of secrets through reverse engineering of the binary created by `rust-embed` - Severity: Critical. This prevents easy extraction of secrets from binaries where assets are embedded using `rust-embed`.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Hardcoded secrets in binary: Critical - Eliminates the most direct and easily exploitable vulnerability of embedding secrets directly in the application *using `rust-embed`*.
    *   Information disclosure of secrets: Critical - Prevents attackers from easily extracting secrets from the application binary *that might have been embedded using `rust-embed`*, through reverse engineering.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes - Secrets are managed using environment variables and configuration files outside the binary, avoiding embedding.

*   **Missing Implementation:** N/A - Secret management is implemented using environment variables and external configuration, specifically to avoid embedding secrets, especially via mechanisms like `rust-embed`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Code Reviews for Sensitive Data](./mitigation_strategies/code_reviews_for_sensitive_data.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Code Reviews for Sensitive Data

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Conduct thorough code reviews for all changes related to *embedded assets* and configuration, especially when using `rust-embed` to include these assets.
    *   Step 2: Specifically focus on identifying any accidental inclusion of sensitive data (secrets, credentials, personal information) in *embedded files*. Developers might inadvertently embed sensitive data when using `rust-embed`.
    *   Step 3: Train developers on secure coding practices and the importance of avoiding hardcoded secrets, especially in the context of *embedding assets using `rust-embed`*.
    *   Step 4: Use code review checklists that include specific checks for sensitive data in *embedded assets*, to ensure no secrets are accidentally included when using `rust-embed`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Accidental embedding of sensitive data in assets included via `rust-embed` - Severity: High (if sensitive data is exposed).
    *   Information disclosure due to accidentally embedded sensitive data - Severity: High (if sensitive data is exposed). This directly addresses the risk of sensitive data being exposed through assets embedded using `rust-embed`.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Accidental embedding of sensitive data: High - Reduces the risk of developers unintentionally including sensitive information in assets *that are then embedded using `rust-embed`*.
    *   Information disclosure: High - Prevents potential information leaks by catching sensitive data before it is deployed in assets embedded via `rust-embed`.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes - Code reviews are mandatory for all code changes, including those related to embedded assets.

*   **Missing Implementation:** N/A - Code reviews are standard practice, and their importance is emphasized for changes involving `rust-embed` and embedded assets.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Automated Secret Scanning](./mitigation_strategies/automated_secret_scanning.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Automated Secret Scanning

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Integrate an automated secret scanning tool into your CI/CD pipeline and development workflow. Configure it to specifically scan *embedded assets* and configuration files for potential secrets before they are embedded using `rust-embed`.
    *   Step 2: Configure the secret scanning tool to scan codebase, configuration files, and *embedded assets* for potential secrets (API keys, passwords, etc.) that might be accidentally included in files intended for embedding via `rust-embed`.
    *   Step 3: Run the secret scanner regularly (e.g., before each commit, in CI pipeline) to proactively detect secrets in assets *before they are embedded using `rust-embed`*.
    *   Step 4: Review and address any secrets identified by the scanner in *assets intended for embedding*. Remove hardcoded secrets from these assets and implement proper secret management instead of embedding.
    *   Step 5: Configure the scanner to prevent commits containing detected secrets in *assets that are intended to be embedded using `rust-embed`*.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Accidental embedding of secrets in assets included via `rust-embed` - Severity: High (if secrets are embedded).
    *   Information disclosure due to accidentally embedded secrets - Severity: High (if secrets are embedded and exposed). This directly addresses the risk of secrets being embedded in assets loaded via `rust-embed`.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Accidental embedding of secrets: High - Proactively detects and prevents accidental inclusion of secrets in the codebase and *embedded assets* before they are included in the binary via `rust-embed`.
    *   Information disclosure: High - Reduces the risk of information leaks by automatically identifying and flagging potential secrets in assets *intended for embedding via `rust-embed`* before deployment.

*   **Currently Implemented:** No - Automated secret scanning is not currently implemented, especially for embedded assets.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Integrate a secret scanning tool into the CI/CD pipeline and development workflow, specifically configured to scan *assets intended for embedding via `rust-embed`* for secrets.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Embedded Asset Size and Quantity](./mitigation_strategies/limit_embedded_asset_size_and_quantity.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Limit Embedded Asset Size and Quantity

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Analyze the necessity of each *embedded asset* that you are including using `rust-embed`. Remove any unnecessary or redundant assets to minimize the binary size.
    *   Step 2: Optimize the size of *embedded assets* (e.g., compress images, minify JavaScript and CSS) before embedding them with `rust-embed`. This reduces the overall size of the application binary.
    *   Step 3: Consider lazy loading or on-demand loading of assets *outside of `rust-embed`* if not all assets are required at application startup. This can reduce the initial memory footprint even if you are using `rust-embed` for some core assets.
    *   Step 4: Monitor application binary size and resource usage to identify potential issues related to large *embedded assets*. Large binaries created by `rust-embed` can impact performance and resource consumption.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) due to resource exhaustion caused by large embedded assets - Severity: Medium (if resource exhaustion is easily triggered by large binaries created by `rust-embed`).
    *   Increased attack surface due to larger binary size (though less directly related to `rust-embed`'s security itself, larger binaries can be more complex to analyze) - Severity: Low.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): Medium - Reduces the risk of DoS attacks caused by excessive resource consumption due to large *embedded assets included via `rust-embed`*.
    *   Increased attack surface: Low - Minimally reduces the overall attack surface by keeping the binary size smaller and more manageable, which can be influenced by the size of assets embedded using `rust-embed`.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partial - Basic asset optimization (minification) is performed, but a comprehensive review of asset necessity and lazy loading strategies in the context of `rust-embed` usage is not implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Conduct a review of assets *intended for embedding via `rust-embed`* to remove unnecessary ones and implement lazy loading for assets that are not immediately required, to minimize the impact of embedded asset size.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Monitoring](./mitigation_strategies/resource_monitoring.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Resource Monitoring

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Implement resource monitoring for your application in production. Monitor metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, and network traffic, especially paying attention to resource consumption that might be related to *embedded assets*.
    *   Step 2: Set up alerts for unusual resource consumption patterns that might indicate a DoS attack or other issues potentially exacerbated by large *embedded assets*.
    *   Step 3: Regularly review resource usage trends to identify potential performance bottlenecks or resource leaks that could be related to the way *embedded assets* are being used by your application.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) - Severity: Medium (helps detect and respond to DoS attempts, including those potentially related to resource-intensive embedded assets).
    *   Performance degradation due to resource exhaustion, potentially linked to large embedded assets - Severity: Medium.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): Medium - Improves detection and response to DoS attacks, potentially mitigating their impact, including DoS scenarios related to resource usage of *embedded assets*.
    *   Performance degradation: Medium - Helps identify and address performance issues related to resource usage, including those potentially caused by the way *embedded assets* are handled after being loaded by `rust-embed`.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes - Resource monitoring is implemented using a standard monitoring solution.

*   **Missing Implementation:** N/A - Resource monitoring is generally implemented, and its relevance to managing the impact of *embedded assets* is understood.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid Dynamic File Serving Based on User Input with `rust-embed`](./mitigation_strategies/avoid_dynamic_file_serving_based_on_user_input_with__rust-embed_.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Avoid Dynamic File Serving Based on User Input with `rust-embed`

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Review your application code to ensure that `rust-embed` is **not used to serve files where the path is directly or indirectly controlled by user input**. `rust-embed` is designed for static embedding, not dynamic file serving.
    *   Step 2: If dynamic file serving is required, use dedicated web server functionalities and proper file access controls instead of attempting to misuse `rust-embed` for this purpose.
    *   Step 3: If you identify any instances of dynamic file serving with `rust-embed`, refactor the code to use a secure alternative that is designed for dynamic file access and control, and remove the misuse of `rust-embed` for this scenario.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Path Traversal - Severity: High. Misusing `rust-embed` for dynamic file serving based on user input can directly lead to path traversal vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Path Traversal: High - Eliminates the risk of path traversal vulnerabilities that could arise from misusing `rust-embed` for dynamic file serving, ensuring `rust-embed` is used only for its intended purpose of static asset embedding.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes - The application architecture does not intend to use `rust-embed` for dynamic file serving based on user input.

*   **Missing Implementation:** N/A - Current architecture avoids this misuse. Continuous code review should ensure this pattern is not introduced in the future, specifically preventing misuse of `rust-embed` for dynamic paths.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation (If Absolutely Necessary - Highly Discouraged for Path Traversal with `rust-embed`)](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation__if_absolutely_necessary_-_highly_discouraged_for_path_traversal_with__rust-embed__.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Input Validation (If Absolutely Necessary - Highly Discouraged for Path Traversal with `rust-embed`)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: **Strongly discourage** using `rust-embed` in scenarios where user input influences file paths for accessing *embedded assets*. This is a misuse of `rust-embed` and inherently risky.
    *   Step 2: If, against best practices, you must use user input to access *embedded files via `rust-embed`* (which is highly discouraged), implement extremely strict input validation.
    *   Step 3: Use allow-lists of permitted file names or paths *within the context of `rust-embed`'s embedded assets* instead of block-lists.
    *   Step 4: Sanitize user input to remove any path traversal characters (e.g., `..`, `/`, `\`) if you are attempting to use user input to select from *embedded assets* (again, highly discouraged).
    *   Step 5: Thoroughly test input validation to ensure it effectively prevents path traversal attacks *if you are misusing `rust-embed` for dynamic asset access*.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Path Traversal - Severity: High (if dynamic file serving with user input is attempted using `rust-embed`). This addresses path traversal risks arising from the misuse of `rust-embed`.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Path Traversal: Medium (even with input validation, the risk is not fully eliminated and complexity is increased when misusing `rust-embed` for dynamic paths. Best to avoid dynamic paths with `rust-embed`).

*   **Currently Implemented:** N/A - Dynamic file serving based on user input with `rust-embed` is not intended and therefore input validation for this specific misuse scenario is not implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:** N/A -  The best mitigation is to avoid this pattern entirely and not misuse `rust-embed` for dynamic file access. Input validation is a fallback and should be avoided if possible when considering `rust-embed`'s intended use.
