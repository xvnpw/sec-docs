# Attack Surface Analysis for pyros2097/rust-embed

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Embedded Files](./attack_surfaces/malicious_embedded_files.md)

*   **Description:** The application binary contains files that are intentionally harmful.
    *   **How `rust-embed` Contributes:** `rust-embed` is the mechanism that integrates these files directly into the application binary during the build process. It takes files from the filesystem and makes them part of the executable.
    *   **Example:** A developer unknowingly includes a script within the embedded files that, when executed by the application, exfiltrates data or compromises the system.
    *   **Impact:** Critical - Could lead to remote code execution, data breaches, or complete system compromise depending on the nature of the malicious file and how the application uses it.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly control the source of files being embedded.
        *   Implement a review process for all files intended for embedding.
        *   Use checksums or digital signatures to verify the integrity of embedded files.
        *   Employ static analysis tools on the embedded files if they are code or scripts.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal during Embedding](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_during_embedding.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker can manipulate the file paths used with `rust-embed` to include files from unintended locations.
    *   **How `rust-embed` Contributes:**  If the paths provided to the `#[embed_dir]` or `#[embed_file]` macros are not properly validated, an attacker who can influence the build process could potentially embed files from outside the intended directory.
    *   **Example:** An attacker modifies the build script or configuration to embed a sensitive system file (e.g., `/etc/shadow`) into the application binary.
    *   **Impact:** High - Could lead to the inclusion of sensitive information within the application binary, potentially exposing credentials or other confidential data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure that all file paths used with `rust-embed` are canonicalized and validated to prevent traversal outside the intended embedding directory.
        *   Avoid constructing file paths dynamically based on external input during the build process.
        *   Implement strict access controls on the build environment to prevent unauthorized modifications.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization/Interpretation Vulnerabilities in Embedded Data](./attack_surfaces/deserializationinterpretation_vulnerabilities_in_embedded_data.md)

*   **Description:** If the embedded files contain data that is deserialized or interpreted by the application, vulnerabilities in the deserialization/interpretation process can be exploited.
    *   **How `rust-embed` Contributes:** `rust-embed` makes this data readily available within the application's runtime environment.
    *   **Example:** Embedding a YAML configuration file that, when parsed by the application, allows for arbitrary code execution due to insecure deserialization practices.
    *   **Impact:** High - Could lead to remote code execution or other significant security breaches if the deserialization or interpretation process is flawed.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize and validate the content of embedded data before deserialization or interpretation.
        *   Use secure deserialization libraries and avoid known insecure practices.
        *   Limit the application's ability to execute code directly from embedded data.
