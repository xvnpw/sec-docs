## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Embedded Assets [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_embedded_assets__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** This path represents a broad category of attacks where the attacker aims to leverage the embedded assets to compromise the application. This can involve introducing malicious content during the build process or exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application retrieves and handles these assets at runtime.
*   **Why High-Risk:** This path encompasses several specific attack vectors with a combination of medium to high likelihood and significant impact, making it a highly probable and damaging avenue for attack.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Introduce Malicious Assets During Build [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2__introduce_malicious_assets_during_build__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This critical node represents the point where an attacker attempts to inject or replace legitimate assets with malicious ones during the application's build process.
*   **Why Critical:** Success at this node allows the attacker to embed virtually any type of malicious content directly into the application. This can lead to various high-impact consequences, including arbitrary code execution (client-side or server-side), data breaches, and denial of service. Compromising this stage can have cascading effects, making it a primary target for attackers.

    *   **Inject Malicious File Content [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker modifies source files or build scripts to include files containing malicious content. This could be JavaScript for XSS, server-side code snippets, or files designed to cause resource exhaustion.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Requires access to the codebase or build environment.
        *   **Impact:** Significant - Potential for XSS, arbitrary code execution, or DoS.
        *   **Mitigation Focus:** Implement strict access controls for the codebase and build environment, conduct thorough code reviews, and use static analysis tools to detect potentially malicious content in assets.

    *   **Replace Legitimate Assets with Malicious Ones [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker manipulates the file system or version control system to replace legitimate asset files with malicious ones before the build process.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Requires write access to the asset storage or version control.
        *   **Impact:** Significant - Similar to injecting malicious content, can lead to various compromise scenarios.
        *   **Mitigation Focus:** Implement strong file system permissions, utilize version control with robust access controls and auditing, and consider implementing integrity checks for assets before the build.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Data Retrieval Logic [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_data_retrieval_logic__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** This path focuses on vulnerabilities in how the application retrieves and handles the embedded assets at runtime. Attackers aim to exploit weaknesses in the logic used to access these assets.
*   **Why High-Risk:**  Exploiting data retrieval logic can directly lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information or other security breaches.

    *   **Path Traversal During Retrieval [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** If the application uses user-provided input to construct the path for retrieving embedded assets (e.g., `embed.get(user_input)`), an attacker can use path traversal techniques (e.g., `../sensitive_data.txt`) to access unintended files.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Depends on application's input handling and developer awareness.
        *   **Impact:** Significant - Potential access to sensitive data.
        *   **Mitigation Focus:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization for any user-provided input used in asset retrieval. Avoid directly using user input in `embed.get()`; use an index or identifier instead.

    *   **Information Disclosure via Incorrect Access Control [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Sensitive data is embedded within the application, and the application fails to implement proper authorization checks before exposing these embedded assets.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Depends on developer awareness and security practices.
        *   **Impact:** Significant - Leakage of confidential information.
        *   **Mitigation Focus:** Avoid embedding sensitive data directly if possible. If necessary, implement robust authorization checks before allowing access to embedded assets. Consider encrypting sensitive data before embedding.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Build Process Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_build_process_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Exploit Build Script Weaknesses [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** The build script used to prepare assets for embedding contains vulnerabilities (e.g., command injection). An attacker exploits these vulnerabilities to inject malicious content during the asset preparation phase.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium - Depends on the complexity and security of the build scripts.
    *   **Impact:** Significant - Embedding of malicious content.
    *   **Mitigation Focus:** Secure build scripts by avoiding the use of external commands with unsanitized input. Implement secure coding practices in build scripts and regularly review them for vulnerabilities. Use parameterized commands where possible.
