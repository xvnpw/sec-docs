# Threat Model Analysis for pyros2097/rust-embed

## Threat: [Accidental Embedding of Sensitive Secrets](./threats/accidental_embedding_of_sensitive_secrets.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, or private keys if developers inadvertently embed these secrets within the files managed by `rust-embed` during development. This happens because `rust-embed` directly includes the contents of specified files into the application binary.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of credentials could lead to unauthorized access to other systems, data breaches, or compromise of the application's infrastructure.
    *   **Affected Component:** `#[embedded_resource]` macro, the generated static data structure holding the embedded files.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rigorous code review processes to identify accidentally embedded secrets *before* they are included by `rust-embed`.
        *   Utilize environment variables or dedicated secret management solutions and ensure these files are *excluded* from the directories processed by `rust-embed`.
        *   Employ secret scanning tools during development and CI/CD pipelines to detect potential secrets in the asset directories *before* embedding.

## Threat: [Embedding of Malicious Assets](./threats/embedding_of_malicious_assets.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker, potentially through a compromised development environment or supply chain attack affecting the source assets, could inject malicious files (e.g., scripts, executables, or manipulated data files) into the directories managed by `rust-embed`. The `rust-embed` crate will then directly embed these malicious assets into the application binary.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of malicious code within the application's context, potentially leading to data corruption, system compromise, or other security incidents. The embedded malicious content becomes an integral part of the application.
    *   **Affected Component:** `#[embedded_resource]` macro, the generated static data structure holding the embedded files.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access control and integrity checks on the source assets *before* they are embedded by `rust-embed`.
        *   Secure the development environment to prevent unauthorized modification of assets that will be processed by `rust-embed`.
        *   Utilize dependency scanning tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in asset sources *before* they are embedded.
        *   Perform regular security audits of the assets intended for embedding.
