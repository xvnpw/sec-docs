# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Enable Rust developers to easily embed static assets (like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) directly into their compiled Rust binaries.
  - Simplify the distribution and deployment of Rust applications by bundling assets within the executable, eliminating the need for separate asset files or directories.
  - Improve the user experience by ensuring that applications are self-contained and assets are readily available without complex configuration.
  - Enhance application portability by reducing dependencies on external file systems for static assets.
- Business Risks:
  - Increased binary size due to embedded assets, potentially impacting download times and storage requirements.
  - Potential security vulnerabilities if embedded assets are not properly managed or sanitized, especially if they are dynamically served or processed by the application.
  - Risk of including sensitive data within embedded assets if not handled carefully.
  - Dependency on the 'rust-embed' library itself, introducing a supply chain risk if the library is compromised or contains vulnerabilities.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Rust's memory safety features inherently reduce the risk of memory-related vulnerabilities in the library itself. (Implemented by: Rust Language)
  - security control: Use of `cargo` for dependency management, which includes checksum verification for downloaded crates. (Implemented by: Cargo build system)
  - security control: Code hosted on GitHub, allowing for community review and scrutiny. (Implemented by: GitHub platform)
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in dependencies of 'rust-embed' that are not yet identified or patched.
  - accepted risk: Risk of developer misuse of 'rust-embed' leading to security issues in the applications that use it (e.g., embedding and serving untrusted content without proper sanitization).
  - accepted risk: Reliance on the security of the crates.io registry for distributing the library.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated security scanning (e.g., `cargo audit`, `cargo deny`) in the CI/CD pipeline to detect known vulnerabilities in dependencies and enforce security policies.
  - security control: Conduct regular security audits of the 'rust-embed' codebase, especially before major releases, to identify and address potential security flaws.
  - security control: Provide clear documentation and examples for developers on secure usage of 'rust-embed', highlighting potential security pitfalls and best practices for handling embedded assets.
  - security control: Consider signing releases of the 'rust-embed' crate to enhance supply chain security and verify the authenticity of the library.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to a library like 'rust-embed'. Authentication is the responsibility of the applications that use this library.
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to 'rust-embed'. Authorization is the responsibility of the applications that use this library to control access to the embedded assets if needed.
  - Input Validation: Input validation is relevant to 'rust-embed' in the context of how it processes configuration or user-provided paths for embedding assets. Ensure proper validation to prevent path traversal or other input-related vulnerabilities.
  - Cryptography: Cryptography might be relevant if there's a need to embed encrypted assets. 'rust-embed' itself doesn't inherently require cryptography, but applications using it might need to decrypt embedded assets at runtime. If so, ensure secure cryptographic practices are followed in the application.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - For 'rust-embed' as a library, the critical business process is enabling developers to efficiently and securely embed static assets in their Rust applications. The library's reliability, security, and ease of use directly impact the development and deployment workflows of its users.
- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Data being protected in the context of 'rust-embed' are the static assets that developers choose to embed. The sensitivity of this data depends entirely on the application using 'rust-embed'. Assets could range from public images and stylesheets to potentially sensitive configuration files or application data.
  - Sensitivity levels vary greatly:
    - Public Assets (low sensitivity): Images, CSS, JavaScript files intended for public access. Compromise might lead to defacement or minor disruptions.
    - Application Configuration (medium sensitivity): Configuration files embedded for convenience. Exposure could reveal application settings or internal structure.
    - Sensitive Application Data (high sensitivity): Embedding sensitive data directly into the binary is generally discouraged but technically possible. Exposure would have severe consequences depending on the nature of the data (e.g., API keys, secrets).

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What are the intended use cases for applications using 'rust-embed'? (e.g., web applications, desktop applications, embedded systems). This would help to refine the threat model.
  - Are there any specific compliance requirements for applications using 'rust-embed' (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)? This could influence security requirements.
  - What is the risk appetite of organizations using 'rust-embed'? (Startups might accept more risks than Fortune 500 companies).
- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to provide a convenient and efficient way for Rust developers to embed static assets, simplifying application deployment and distribution.
  - SECURITY POSTURE:  The current security posture relies heavily on Rust's inherent memory safety and standard Rust development practices. There is an awareness of supply chain risks and a need for more proactive security measures in the build and release process.
  - DESIGN: The design is centered around providing a macro and API for embedding and accessing assets. The deployment model is flexible, supporting various deployment scenarios for Rust applications. The build process is assumed to be using standard Rust tooling (cargo) and can be enhanced with CI/CD and security checks.
