# Attack Surface Analysis for pyros2097/rust-embed

## Attack Surface: [Supply Chain Vulnerabilities via Embedded Assets](./attack_surfaces/supply_chain_vulnerabilities_via_embedded_assets.md)

*   **Description:**  The risk of embedding malicious or compromised files into the application binary due to vulnerabilities in the asset supply chain. This is a **Critical** risk when considering the potential for widespread impact.
*   **How `rust-embed` directly contributes to the attack surface:** `rust-embed`'s core functionality is to embed files from a designated source directory into the application binary *during the build process*. This direct embedding action means any compromise in the source of these files *directly* translates to a compromised application binary. `rust-embed` is the mechanism that integrates these external assets into the final product.
*   **Example:** A developer's workstation, used to build the application, is infected with malware. This malware modifies legitimate JavaScript files within the asset directory that `rust-embed` is configured to embed.  During the build, `rust-embed` unknowingly includes these malware-infected JavaScript files into the application binary. When deployed, users accessing the application receive and execute this malicious JavaScript, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, session hijacking, or redirection to phishing sites.
*   **Impact:** **Critical**.  Compromise can lead to widespread Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), data breaches, account compromise, and potentially remote code execution depending on the nature of the malicious embedded files and how the application utilizes them. The impact is amplified because the malicious code is embedded directly into the application, making detection and remediation more challenging after deployment.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Build Environment:** Harden build environments (developer workstations, CI/CD pipelines) to prevent malware infections and unauthorized modifications. Implement regular security scans and updates.
    *   **Strict Source Control and Access Control:** Implement robust access controls and monitoring for the source directory of embedded assets. Use version control and code review processes for any changes to these assets.
    *   **Dependency Scanning and Management:**  Thoroughly scan dependencies used to generate or manage embedded assets for known vulnerabilities. Implement a process for vetting and updating dependencies.
    *   **Integrity Verification:** Implement cryptographic checksums or digital signatures for embedded assets *before* embedding them using `rust-embed`. Verify these signatures during the build process and potentially at runtime to detect tampering.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Asset Sources):** Limit access to the source directories of embedded assets to only authorized personnel and processes.

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure via Embedded Sensitive Data](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_via_embedded_sensitive_data.md)

*   **Description:** Unintentional embedding of sensitive information (API keys, secrets, internal documentation, private keys) within files intended for embedding. This can be a **High** risk if critical secrets are exposed.
*   **How `rust-embed` directly contributes to the attack surface:** `rust-embed` embeds *all* files from a specified directory (or matching patterns) without inherent filtering or awareness of sensitive content.  If developers mistakenly place sensitive files within the designated embedding directory, `rust-embed` will faithfully include them in the application binary.  `rust-embed` is the direct mechanism that makes these files accessible within the deployed application.
*   **Example:** A developer, during development, places a configuration file containing database credentials or API keys in the asset directory for easy access. They forget to remove or exclude this file before building the release version. `rust-embed` embeds this configuration file into the final application binary. An attacker who obtains the application binary (through reverse engineering, accessing public deployments, or insider access) can extract the embedded assets and retrieve the sensitive credentials, leading to unauthorized access to backend systems or data.
*   **Impact:** **High**. Leakage of sensitive credentials (API keys, database passwords, private keys), exposure of internal documentation revealing system architecture or vulnerabilities, unauthorized access to internal systems, and potential data breaches. The impact is high because exposed secrets can directly lead to significant security compromises.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Automated Sensitive Data Scanning:** Implement automated tools to scan files within the asset directory for patterns indicative of sensitive data (e.g., API key formats, common secret names, keywords like "password", "secret"). Fail the build process if sensitive data is detected.
    *   **Code and Configuration Reviews:** Conduct mandatory code and configuration reviews specifically focused on identifying and preventing the accidental embedding of sensitive data.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Data Storage):**  Strictly avoid storing sensitive information in files that are candidates for embedding. Utilize secure configuration management practices.
    *   **Environment Variables and Secret Management:**  Force the use of environment variables or dedicated secret management solutions (like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) for handling sensitive configuration.  Ensure embedded assets *never* contain secrets directly.
    *   **`.embedignore` and `.gitignore` Usage:**  Mandate the use of `.embedignore` (for `rust-embed`) and `.gitignore` (for version control) to explicitly exclude sensitive files and directories from being embedded and committed to version control. Regularly review these exclusion lists.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in `rust-embed` Crate Itself (Dependency Risk - Critical if exploited)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in__rust-embed__crate_itself__dependency_risk_-_critical_if_exploited_.md)

*   **Description:** The risk of vulnerabilities existing within the `rust-embed` crate itself. While this is a general dependency risk, it becomes a **Critical** concern if a vulnerability in `rust-embed` directly impacts the security of applications using it, especially if it allows for control over embedded assets or application execution flow.
*   **How `rust-embed` directly contributes to the attack surface:** By directly depending on `rust-embed`, applications inherit any vulnerabilities present in the crate's code. If a vulnerability in `rust-embed` allows an attacker to manipulate the embedding process or access embedded assets in an unintended way, it directly impacts the security of applications relying on `rust-embed` for asset management.
*   **Example:** A hypothetical critical vulnerability is discovered in `rust-embed` that allows an attacker to inject arbitrary files into the embedded assets during the build process by crafting a specific input to the `rust-embed` macro or build script. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to inject malicious code into applications using vulnerable versions of `rust-embed`, effectively achieving remote code execution when the application is deployed and run.
*   **Impact:** **Critical**.  Depending on the nature of the vulnerability in `rust-embed`, the impact could range from Denial of Service to arbitrary file read, remote code execution, or complete application compromise. A vulnerability in a widely used crate like `rust-embed` can have a broad and severe impact.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (if a severe vulnerability exists and is exploited)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Continuous Monitoring and Updates:**  Implement automated dependency scanning and monitoring to track known vulnerabilities in `rust-embed` and its dependencies.  Establish a process for promptly updating `rust-embed` to the latest versions to patch any discovered vulnerabilities.
    *   **Security Advisories and Notifications:** Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases related to Rust crates and `rust-embed` specifically (e.g., RustSec Advisory Database).
    *   **Crate Security Audits (for critical applications):** For applications with stringent security requirements, consider performing or commissioning independent security audits of the `rust-embed` crate itself to proactively identify potential vulnerabilities beyond those publicly known.
    *   **Consider Alternative Solutions (for extreme risk aversion):** In extremely high-security contexts, evaluate if alternative asset embedding or management solutions exist that might have a lower perceived risk profile, although this should be a last resort after thorough risk assessment and mitigation efforts.
