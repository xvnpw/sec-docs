# Threat Model Analysis for pyros2097/rust-embed

## Threat: [Embedded File Tampering Before Compilation](./threats/embedded_file_tampering_before_compilation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the source code repository or the build environment *before* compilation. They maliciously modify or replace files that are intended to be embedded by `rust-embed`. This could involve injecting malicious code, substituting legitimate assets with harmful ones, or altering configuration files to compromise the application's behavior.
*   **Impact:** The compiled application embeds and subsequently uses compromised data. This can have severe consequences, including:
    *   Serving malicious content to application users, leading to malware distribution or phishing attacks.
    *   Application malfunction or instability, causing denial of service or data corruption.
    *   Introduction of vulnerabilities that can be exploited for further attacks, such as remote code execution or privilege escalation.
*   **Affected Component:** `rust-embed` build process, specifically the file system interaction during compilation where files are read for embedding.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Access Control:** Implement and enforce strict access control and authentication mechanisms for all source code repositories and build environments. Limit access to authorized personnel only.
    *   **Code Review and Version Control:** Mandate thorough code reviews for all changes, especially those affecting embedded files. Utilize version control systems to track changes and facilitate rollback if necessary.
    *   **Build Environment Security:** Harden the build environment by applying security best practices, including regular patching, intrusion detection systems, and secure configuration management.
    *   **Integrity Monitoring:** Implement file integrity monitoring on the build environment to detect unauthorized modifications to files intended for embedding.
    *   **Pre-Compilation Checksums/Signatures:** Consider generating checksums or digital signatures for embedded files *before* compilation. These can be verified during the build process or at application runtime to ensure file integrity.

## Threat: [Accidental Embedding of Sensitive Data](./threats/accidental_embedding_of_sensitive_data.md)

*   **Description:** Developers unintentionally include sensitive information within files that are designated for embedding by `rust-embed`. This sensitive data could include API keys, cryptographic secrets, private keys, database credentials, internal documentation containing confidential information, or other forms of sensitive data. This often occurs due to oversight, misconfiguration of embedding paths, or a lack of awareness regarding what constitutes sensitive data in the context of embedded resources.
*   **Impact:** Sensitive data becomes directly embedded within the application binary. This significantly increases the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access because:
    *   Anyone with access to the compiled application binary can potentially extract and access the embedded sensitive data through reverse engineering or binary analysis.
    *   Distribution of the application binary (even to intended users) inadvertently distributes the embedded secrets, expanding the attack surface.
    *   Compromised secrets can lead to unauthorized access to backend systems, data theft, financial loss, and reputational damage.
*   **Affected Component:** `rust-embed` configuration (specifying file paths for embedding) and developer workflow when selecting files to embed.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Sensitive Data Inventory and Classification:**  Establish a clear inventory of sensitive data within the application and classify data appropriately. Understand what data should *never* be embedded.
    *   **Secure Configuration Management:** Implement robust configuration management practices that separate sensitive configuration from embedded files. Utilize environment variables, secure configuration files loaded from protected locations at runtime, or dedicated secret management vaults.
    *   **Automated Secret Scanning:** Integrate automated secret scanning tools into the development pipeline and CI/CD process. These tools can detect accidentally committed secrets in source code and embedded files before they are deployed.
    *   **Code and Configuration Reviews:** Conduct thorough code and configuration reviews, specifically focusing on `rust-embed` configurations and the files selected for embedding. Ensure no sensitive data is inadvertently included.
    *   **Developer Training and Awareness:** Educate developers about secure coding practices, the risks of embedding sensitive data, and proper techniques for managing secrets in applications.
