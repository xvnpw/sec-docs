* **Threat:** Embedding Malicious or Compromised Assets
    * **Description:** An attacker could compromise the source of the static assets and inject malicious files that are then directly embedded into the application binary *by `rust-embed`*. This occurs during the build process when `rust-embed` includes the specified files.
    * **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, redirection to malicious sites, delivery of malware to users, or other client-side exploits if these assets are later served by the application.
    * **Affected Component:** `rust-embed`'s embedding process.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Verify the integrity and authenticity of all static assets *before they are processed by `rust-embed`*. Use checksums or digital signatures.
        * Scan asset directories for known malware or vulnerabilities before embedding.

* **Threat:** Supply Chain Attack via Malicious `rust-embed` Crate
    * **Description:** An attacker could compromise the `rust-embed` crate itself (or a dependency of it) and introduce malicious code that executes *during the `rust-embed`'s processing* in the build process. This malicious code could manipulate the embedding process, inject vulnerabilities into the binary through the embedded assets, or exfiltrate data during the build.
    * **Impact:** Compromise of the application build process, potentially leading to the injection of arbitrary code into the final binary via the embedded assets, data breaches, or other severe security flaws.
    * **Affected Component:** The `rust-embed` crate itself.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Rely on reputable crate registries (crates.io).
        * Regularly audit dependencies using tools like `cargo audit`.
        * Consider using a dependency management system with security scanning capabilities.
        * Pin specific versions of dependencies to avoid unexpected updates with malicious code.

* **Threat:** Accidental Embedding of Sensitive Information
    * **Description:** Developers might unintentionally include sensitive data within the directories specified for embedding, and *`rust-embed` will directly include these files into the application binary*. An attacker could then gain access to the compiled binary and extract this unintentionally embedded sensitive data.
    * **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials or confidential information, potentially leading to unauthorized access to systems, data breaches, or intellectual property theft.
    * **Affected Component:** `rust-embed`'s embedding process.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strict controls and reviews of directories and files intended for embedding *before `rust-embed` processes them*.
        * Utilize mechanisms similar to `.gitignore` to explicitly exclude sensitive files or patterns from the embedding process configuration of `rust-embed`.
        * Employ automated tools to scan the embedding directories for potential secrets before building.
        * Avoid storing sensitive information directly in files intended for embedding.

* **Threat:** Path Traversal During Embedding
    * **Description:** If the configuration of `rust-embed` allows for dynamic or user-controlled paths for embedding, an attacker might be able to manipulate these paths to trick *`rust-embed` into including files from outside the intended directories*, potentially embedding sensitive files from the developer's system.
    * **Impact:** Accidental or malicious inclusion of sensitive files into the application binary, leading to potential information disclosure.
    * **Affected Component:** `rust-embed`'s configuration handling and embedding process.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Ensure that the paths used for embedding in `rust-embed`'s configuration are static and controlled by the development team.
        * Avoid dynamic or user-provided paths in `rust-embed`'s configuration.
        * Implement strict validation and sanitization of any paths used in the `rust-embed` configuration.
