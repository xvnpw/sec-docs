**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**1. Manipulate Embedded Content Before Embedding [CRITICAL NODE]:**

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the development environment, source code repository, or build artifacts *before* the `rust-embed` process incorporates the static assets into the application binary.
*   **Mechanism:** The attacker directly modifies the files that are intended to be embedded.
*   **Impact:** This is a critical node because successful manipulation at this stage allows for the injection of a wide range of malicious content, leading to various severe consequences.
*   **Examples:**
    *   Replacing a legitimate JavaScript file with a malicious one to steal user credentials.
    *   Injecting malicious JavaScript into an HTML file to perform Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
    *   Modifying data files to alter application logic or introduce vulnerabilities.

**2. Replace Legitimate Asset with Malicious Asset [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**

*   **Attack Vector:**  Following the compromise of the pre-embedding stage, the attacker specifically targets a legitimate static asset and replaces it entirely with a malicious counterpart.
*   **Mechanism:** The attacker identifies a suitable target asset (e.g., a commonly used JavaScript file, a core HTML page) and overwrites it with a file containing malicious code or data.
*   **Impact:** This path has a high risk due to the direct and often significant impact of replacing a key application asset.
*   **Examples:**
    *   Replacing the main JavaScript file with one that redirects all user traffic to a phishing site.
    *   Replacing an HTML login page with a fake one to steal credentials.
    *   Replacing a configuration file with one that points to malicious external resources.

**3. Substitute with Maliciously Crafted Asset [CRITICAL NODE]:**

*   **Attack Vector:** This node represents the successful culmination of the "Replace Legitimate Asset with Malicious Asset" path. The attacker has successfully substituted a legitimate asset with a malicious one.
*   **Mechanism:** The malicious asset is now part of the application's binary, and when the application uses this asset, the malicious payload is executed or the malicious data is processed.
*   **Impact:** This is a critical node because it signifies the point where the malicious payload is actively integrated into the application, leading to immediate potential for exploitation.
*   **Examples:**
    *   Execution of injected JavaScript leading to XSS.
    *   Attempted execution of an embedded malicious executable (if the application tries to run it).
    *   Processing of maliciously crafted data leading to application logic errors or vulnerabilities.

**4. Exploit Embedding Process Vulnerabilities -> Inject Malicious Files During Build Process [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**

*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker targets the build process itself, aiming to inject malicious files into the directories that `rust-embed` is configured to scan and embed.
*   **Mechanism:** This often involves compromising the build environment (e.g., CI/CD server, developer's machine used for building). Once compromised, the attacker can add malicious files to the appropriate locations.
*   **Impact:** This path is high-risk because it allows attackers to inject malicious code directly into the application's binary without needing to modify existing legitimate assets.
*   **Examples:**
    *   Adding a malicious JavaScript file to a directory containing other scripts that are embedded.
    *   Introducing a backdoored library or data file that will be included in the final application.

**5. Compromise Build Environment [CRITICAL NODE]:**

*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker successfully gains control over the infrastructure and systems used to build the application.
*   **Mechanism:** This can involve various techniques, such as exploiting vulnerabilities in the CI/CD server, compromising developer accounts, or injecting malicious code into build scripts.
*   **Impact:** This is a critical node because compromising the build environment grants the attacker significant control over the final application artifact. They can inject any type of malicious code or data.
*   **Examples:**
    *   Modifying build scripts to download and include malicious dependencies.
    *   Injecting malicious code directly into the application's source code during the build process.
    *   Replacing legitimate build tools with malicious ones.

**6. Exploit Application's Handling of Embedded Content [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**

*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker leverages vulnerabilities in how the application processes and uses the static assets embedded by `rust-embed`. This assumes the embedded content itself might be initially benign, but the application's handling is flawed.
*   **Mechanism:** This involves exploiting common web application vulnerabilities related to how data is processed and rendered.
*   **Impact:** This path is high-risk because it targets common and often exploitable vulnerabilities in web applications.
*   **Examples:**
    *   The application renders embedded HTML without proper sanitization, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
    *   The application processes embedded data files (e.g., JSON, XML) without proper validation, allowing for data injection attacks.
    *   The application uses embedded file paths without proper sanitization, leading to path traversal vulnerabilities.
