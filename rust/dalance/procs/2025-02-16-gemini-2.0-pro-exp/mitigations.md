# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for dalance/procs

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Access to `/proc` (Containerization)](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_access_to__proc___containerization_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Dockerize the Application:** Package the application and its dependencies into a Docker container.
2.  **Configure Bind Mount (Read-Only):** When running the container, use a bind mount to mount the host's `/proc` filesystem into the container, but make it *read-only*.  This prevents the application (and any potential attacker exploiting it) from modifying anything within `/proc`.  Example (Docker command):  `docker run -v /proc:/proc:ro ...`
3.  **Restrict `/proc` View (Optional, Advanced):** If possible, further restrict the container's view of `/proc`. Instead of mounting the entire `/proc`, mount only specific subdirectories that the application *needs*.  This requires a deep understanding of the application's requirements.  You might use techniques like `unshare` or `nsenter` (if available and appropriate) to create a more isolated process namespace, limiting the container's view to only its own processes.
4.  **Test Thoroughly:** After implementing the containerization and `/proc` restrictions, thoroughly test the application to ensure it still functions correctly.  This is crucial, as overly restrictive mounts can break functionality.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Information Disclosure (High Severity):** Dramatically reduces the risk. The application can only see a limited, read-only view of process information.  If the view is further restricted (step 3), this risk is almost eliminated.
*   **Denial of Service (Medium Severity):** Limits the ability of an attacker to use `procs` information to target host processes for DoS attacks.
*   **Privilege Escalation (High Severity):** Makes privilege escalation extremely difficult, as the attacker's view of the system is highly restricted.
*   **Data Tampering (Medium Severity):** Prevents any direct modification of the host's `/proc` filesystem, which could be used for data tampering.

**Impact:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Very High impact - approaches elimination of the risk if the `/proc` view is tightly controlled.
*   **Denial of Service:** Medium impact - significantly reduces the attacker's options.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Very High impact - makes privilege escalation extremely challenging.
*   **Data Tampering:** High impact - prevents direct tampering via `/proc`.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   The application is containerized.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   The `/proc` filesystem is currently mounted read-write within the container. This is a major security gap.  It *must* be changed to a read-only mount in the Dockerfile or docker-compose configuration.  Further restriction of the `/proc` view (step 3) should be investigated and implemented if feasible.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization (Process ID/Name)](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization__process_idname_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Input Points:** Identify all points in the application where user input (directly or indirectly) can influence which processes are queried using the `procs` library. This could be through API endpoints, configuration files, command-line arguments, or any other mechanism.
2.  **Implement Strict Validation:** For any input that represents a process ID or name, implement *strict* validation:
    *   **Process IDs:** Validate that the input is a positive integer within a reasonable range (avoiding excessively large numbers that might cause resource issues).
    *   **Process Names:**
        *   **Whitelist (Preferred):** If the application only needs to query a known, limited set of processes, create a *whitelist* of allowed process names.  Reject any input that doesn't match the whitelist.
        *   **Regular Expression (If Whitelist Not Feasible):** If a whitelist is not possible, use a carefully crafted regular expression to restrict the allowed characters to a safe set (e.g., alphanumeric characters, underscores, and perhaps hyphens).  *Crucially, prevent path traversal characters* (like `..`, `/`, and potentially others depending on the OS).  The regex should be as restrictive as possible while still allowing legitimate use cases.
3.  **Sanitize (If Necessary, with Caution):** If you *cannot* fully validate the input (e.g., you need to allow some special characters that are difficult to validate), *sanitize* the input.  This involves removing or escaping any potentially dangerous characters.  However, sanitization is generally less secure than strict validation, so it should be used as a last resort.
4.  **Test Thoroughly:** Test the input validation and sanitization with a wide range of inputs, including known malicious patterns (e.g., path traversal attempts), boundary conditions (very large/small numbers), and unexpected characters.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious process IDs or names to access information about arbitrary processes (those they shouldn't have access to).
*   **Denial of Service (Low Severity):** Reduces the risk of an attacker using crafted input to trigger unexpected behavior or resource exhaustion within the `procs` library or the application itself.
* **Data Tampering (Low Severity):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious process IDs or names to access information about arbitrary processes and use it for data tampering.

**Impact:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Medium impact - prevents access to arbitrary processes via input manipulation.
*   **Denial of Service:** Low impact - mitigates some potential DoS vectors, but not the primary ones related to `procs`.
* **Data Tampering:** Low impact - mitigates some potential data tampering vectors.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   No input validation or sanitization is currently implemented for process IDs or names obtained from user input.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   This is a critical missing security control. Input validation and sanitization *must* be implemented for *all* relevant input points where user-supplied data can influence which processes are queried. This needs to be added to the API endpoint handlers, configuration file parsing, and any other code that processes user-supplied process identifiers.  Prioritize using a whitelist if at all possible.
