# Threat Model Analysis for dalance/procs

## Threat: [procs Library Vulnerability (Privilege Escalation)](./threats/procs_library_vulnerability__privilege_escalation_.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability exists within the `procs` library itself (e.g., a buffer overflow, format string vulnerability, integer overflow, or other code execution vulnerability) or one of its *direct* dependencies (libraries that `procs` links against and uses internally). An attacker crafts a malicious input, triggers a race condition, or otherwise exploits the vulnerability to gain arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the application using `procs`. This is a vulnerability *within* `procs` or its low-level dependencies, not a misuse of the library.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for complete system compromise if the application runs with elevated privileges.  If the application runs as a regular user, the attacker gains the privileges of that user, which could still be used for further attacks.
    *   **Affected `procs` Component:** Any part of the `procs` library or its *direct* dependencies could be affected, depending on the specific vulnerability. This includes all modules and functions, as a vulnerability could exist in any of them.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   Keep `procs` and all its *direct* dependencies up-to-date. This is the *most crucial* mitigation.
            *   Regularly review security advisories for `procs` and its dependencies.
            *   Perform static analysis (e.g., using tools like Clippy for Rust) and fuzz testing on `procs` itself to identify potential vulnerabilities.
            *   Contribute to the security of `procs` by reporting any discovered vulnerabilities responsibly to the maintainers.
            *   Consider using memory-safe languages or techniques within `procs` itself (Rust's ownership system helps, but vulnerabilities are still possible).
        *   **User/Administrator:**
            *   Ensure the application and its dependencies (including `procs`) are regularly updated from trusted sources.
            *   Run the application with the least necessary privileges (principle of least privilege).  *Never* run the application as root unless absolutely necessary.
            *   Consider using sandboxing or containerization (e.g., Docker, systemd-nspawn) to isolate the application and limit the impact of a potential compromise.

## Threat: [Integer Overflow in Process ID Handling](./threats/integer_overflow_in_process_id_handling.md)

* **Description:** If `procs` uses integer types that are too small to represent all possible process IDs on a system, an integer overflow could occur. An attacker might be able to exploit this by crafting a scenario where a very large process ID is encountered, leading to unexpected behavior, potentially including a crash or, in a worst-case scenario, exploitable memory corruption. This is a direct vulnerability *within* how `procs` handles PIDs internally.
    * **Impact:** Denial of service (crash) or potential for code execution (depending on how the overflow is handled).
    * **Affected `procs` Component:** Any function that handles process IDs, particularly:
        * `procs::Process::new()`
        * `procs::Process::pid()`
        * Internal functions that compare or manipulate PIDs.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developer:**
            * Ensure that `procs` uses integer types that are large enough to represent all possible process IDs on the target platforms (e.g., `pid_t`, or a 64-bit integer on 64-bit systems).
            * Implement robust checks to prevent integer overflows when handling PIDs. Use saturating or wrapping arithmetic where appropriate, and explicitly handle potential overflow conditions.
            * Perform thorough testing, including edge cases and boundary conditions, to ensure that PID handling is robust.
        * **User/Administrator:** Keep the system and `procs` updated.

## Threat: [Race Condition in Process Information Retrieval](./threats/race_condition_in_process_information_retrieval.md)

* **Description:** A race condition could exist within `procs` if it accesses process information (e.g., from `/proc` on Linux) without proper synchronization. If a process's state changes (e.g., its command line is modified, or it terminates) *during* the information retrieval, `procs` might return inconsistent or incorrect data. An attacker might be able to exploit this by timing their actions to coincide with `procs`'s information retrieval, potentially leading to a denial of service or, in a less likely but more severe scenario, a use-after-free vulnerability or other memory corruption. This is a direct vulnerability *within* `procs`'s internal logic.
    * **Impact:** Denial of service (incorrect data or crash), or potentially exploitable memory corruption (less likely, but higher impact).
    * **Affected `procs` Component:** Any function that retrieves process information, particularly those that access multiple pieces of information about a process (e.g., `cmdline`, `environ`, `stat`, `status`).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developer:**
            * Use appropriate synchronization mechanisms (e.g., mutexes, read-write locks) to protect access to shared process information.
            * Minimize the time window during which process information is accessed.
            * If possible, use atomic operations to read process information.
            * Thoroughly test `procs` under concurrent conditions to identify and fix race conditions.
        * **User/Administrator:** Keep the system and `procs` updated.
