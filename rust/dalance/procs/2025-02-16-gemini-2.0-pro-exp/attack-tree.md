## Attack Tree Path: [1. Information Disclosure [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1__information_disclosure__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the primary attack vector, focusing on unauthorized access to system and process information. The `procs` library's core function is to provide this information, making it a natural target.
    *   **Sub-Vectors:**

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Exploit `procs` functions to read sensitive process information [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_exploit__procs__functions_to_read_sensitive_process_information__cn_.md)

    *   **Description:**  The attacker attempts to directly misuse the functions provided by `procs` to obtain information they shouldn't have access to. This is the gateway to most information disclosure attacks.
            *   **Sub-Vectors:**

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Bypass intended filtering/restrictions (if any) in `procs`](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_bypass_intended_filteringrestrictions__if_any__in__procs_.md)

                    *   **Description:** The attacker tries to circumvent any security measures built into `procs` to limit access to information.
                    *   **Sub-Vectors:**

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.1 Craft malicious input to `procs` functions (e.g., `pid`, `keyword`) to access processes outside the intended scope. [HR] [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_1_craft_malicious_input_to__procs__functions__e_g____pid____keyword___to_access_processes_outs_cc71d8a9.md)

                            *   **Description:** This is the most direct and likely attack. The attacker provides carefully crafted input to `procs` functions, aiming to trick the library into revealing information about processes or files it shouldn't. This could involve:
                                *   **Path Traversal:**  If `procs` uses user-provided input to construct paths to `/proc` entries, the attacker might try to inject ".." sequences or absolute paths to access files outside the intended directory.  Example:  If a function takes a PID as input, the attacker might provide "../../etc/passwd" to try to read the password file.
                                *   **PID Manipulation:**  If `procs` allows specifying PIDs, the attacker might try to provide PIDs of system processes or other users' processes to access their information.
                                *   **Keyword Injection:** If `procs` uses keywords to search for processes, the attacker might try to inject special characters or patterns to broaden the search or access unintended processes.
                            *   **Likelihood:** High (if input validation is weak)
                            *   **Impact:** High
                            *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
                            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
                            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2 Read sensitive environment variables of other processes (if `procs` exposes this). [HR] [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_read_sensitive_environment_variables_of_other_processes__if__procs__exposes_this____hr___cn_.md)

                    *   **Description:** The attacker leverages `procs` to read the environment variables of other processes. Environment variables often contain sensitive data like API keys, database credentials, and other secrets.
                    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (depends on `procs` functionality and access controls)
                    *   **Impact:** High
                    *   **Effort:** Low
                    *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
                    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.3 Read command-line arguments of other processes, potentially revealing credentials or configuration secrets. [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_3_read_command-line_arguments_of_other_processes__potentially_revealing_credentials_or_configura_55859dc6.md)

                    *   **Description:** Similar to environment variables, command-line arguments can sometimes contain sensitive information, although this is generally considered bad practice.
                    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
                    *   **Impact:** Medium to High
                    *   **Effort:** Low
                    *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
                    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Process Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/2__process_manipulation.md)

    *   **Sub-Vectors:**

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1 Inject malicious code into a target process](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_inject_malicious_code_into_a_target_process.md)

            *   **Sub-Vectors:**

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1 Exploit a buffer overflow or other memory corruption vulnerability in `procs` itself (if present) to gain control of the application using `procs`. [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1_exploit_a_buffer_overflow_or_other_memory_corruption_vulnerability_in__procs__itself__if_prese_05244c11.md)

                    *   **Description:** The attacker exploits a memory safety vulnerability (like a buffer overflow, use-after-free, or double-free) in the `procs` library itself.  This allows them to overwrite memory and potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of the application using `procs`. This is a *critical* vulnerability because it gives the attacker control over the application, which can then be used for further attacks.
                    *   **Likelihood:** Low (but depends on code quality and language used)
                    *   **Impact:** Very High
                    *   **Effort:** High
                    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced to Expert
                    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Privilege Escalation (Indirect, via `procs` exploitation)](./attack_tree_paths/3__privilege_escalation__indirect__via__procs__exploitation_.md)

    *   **Sub-Vectors:**

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1 Exploit a vulnerability in `procs` to gain control of the application using it. [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_exploit_a_vulnerability_in__procs__to_gain_control_of_the_application_using_it___cn_.md)

            *   **Description:** This is the same as 2.1.1. The attacker gains control of the application. The difference here is the *context*: if the application using `procs` is running with elevated privileges (e.g., as root or a system service), then the attacker gains those privileges.
            *   **Sub-Vectors:**

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1.1 As in 2.1.1, find a memory corruption vulnerability in `procs` itself. [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_1_as_in_2_1_1__find_a_memory_corruption_vulnerability_in__procs__itself___cn_.md)

 (Same as 2.1.1)
