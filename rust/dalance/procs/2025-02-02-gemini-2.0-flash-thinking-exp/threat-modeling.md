# Threat Model Analysis for dalance/procs

## Threat: [Sensitive Process Information Exposure](./threats/sensitive_process_information_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit insufficient access controls in the application to view process information retrieved by `procs`, such as command-line arguments, environment variables, user IDs, and file paths. This could be achieved by directly accessing an API endpoint exposing process data or by exploiting a vulnerability in the application's authorization logic. The attacker's goal is to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data exposed by `procs`.
*   **Impact:** Confidential information leakage, including credentials (API keys, passwords), internal system details, intellectual property, or PII if present in process information. This can lead to unauthorized access to other systems, data breaches, and reputational damage.
*   **Affected procs component:**  Usage of `procs` library in application logic, specifically functions retrieving process details (e.g., `Process::cmdline()`, `Process::environ()`, `Process::uid()`, `Process::cwd()`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to process information.
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege, granting access only to authorized users or roles.
    *   Filter and sanitize process information before displaying or using it, removing or redacting sensitive data.
    *   Avoid exposing raw output from `procs` directly to users.
    *   Regularly audit access controls and authorization logic related to process information.
