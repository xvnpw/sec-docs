# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for dalance/procs

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege for Process Information Access](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_for_process_information_access.md)

**Description:**
1.  Identify the absolute minimum process information fields required for each application feature.
2.  Modify code to retrieve *only* these necessary fields from `procs`, avoiding indiscriminate data fetching.
3.  Conduct code reviews to ensure adherence to least privilege and prevent unnecessary process data access.
4.  Periodically audit data access patterns to confirm ongoing compliance.
**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   Information Disclosure (High Severity)
**Impact:** Significantly Reduces Information Disclosure risk.
**Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented (frontend filtering).
**Missing Implementation:** Backend service needs modification to fetch only required fields directly from `procs`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Sanitization and Filtering of Process Information](./mitigation_strategies/data_sanitization_and_filtering_of_process_information.md)

**Description:**
1.  Identify sensitive process information fields (e.g., command-line arguments, environment variables).
2.  Implement sanitization functions (redaction, truncation, whitelisting/blacklisting) for these fields.
3.  Apply sanitization *before* displaying, logging, or transmitting process information.
4.  Thoroughly test sanitization functions for effectiveness and functionality.
**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   Information Disclosure (High Severity)
**Impact:** Moderately Reduces Information Disclosure risk.
**Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented (basic frontend sanitization of command-line arguments).
**Missing Implementation:** Comprehensive sanitization in backend, applied to environment variables, file paths, and logs.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting Process Information Queries](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_process_information_queries.md)

**Description:**
1.  Identify application endpoints/features using `procs` for process information retrieval.
2.  Define appropriate rate limits based on usage and system capacity.
3.  Implement rate limiting mechanisms (token bucket, leaky bucket) for these endpoints.
4.  Implement error handling for rate-limited requests with informative error messages.
5.  Monitor rate limiting effectiveness and adjust limits as needed.
**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity)
**Impact:** Moderately Reduces Denial of Service risk.
**Currently Implemented:** Not implemented.
**Missing Implementation:** Rate limiting middleware for API endpoints retrieving process information.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limits for Process Information Retrieval](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limits_for_process_information_retrieval.md)

**Description:**
1.  Set timeouts for all `procs` library calls to prevent indefinite blocking.
2.  Limit query depth/scope for recursive process scanning to prevent resource exhaustion.
3.  Monitor system resource usage during process information retrieval.
4.  Optimize code for efficient process information retrieval, avoiding redundancy.
**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity)
**Impact:** Moderately Reduces Denial of Service risk.
**Currently Implemented:** Basic network request timeouts, but not specific `procs` timeouts.
**Missing Implementation:** Specific timeouts for `procs` calls, optimization of retrieval code, and scope limits for process tree traversal if used.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Asynchronous Operations for Process Information Retrieval](./mitigation_strategies/asynchronous_operations_for_process_information_retrieval.md)

**Description:**
1.  Identify synchronous `procs` library calls blocking the main application thread.
2.  Refactor code to use asynchronous patterns (`async/await`) for `procs` calls.
3.  Ensure non-blocking execution of process information retrieval.
4.  Thoroughly test asynchronous implementation for functionality and responsiveness.
**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   Denial of Service (DoS) (Low Severity)
*   Performance Degradation (Medium Severity)
**Impact:** Minimally Reduces DoS risk, Significantly Improves Performance and Responsiveness.
**Currently Implemented:** Synchronous process information retrieval.
**Missing Implementation:** Asynchronous refactoring of backend code for `procs` calls.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update `procs` Dependency](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update__procs__dependency.md)

**Description:**
1.  Use dependency management tools (`cargo`) to manage `procs` dependency.
2.  Regularly monitor for updates to `procs` on its repository or security advisories.
3.  Consider automated dependency update tools.
4.  Test application thoroughly after updating `procs` for compatibility and regressions.
**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   Vulnerabilities in `procs` (Variable Severity)
*   Supply Chain Attacks (Variable Severity)
**Impact:** Significantly Reduces risks from `procs` vulnerabilities and supply chain attacks.
**Currently Implemented:** Dependencies managed by `cargo`, but updates not regular.
**Missing Implementation:** Regular dependency update process, CI/CD integration for update checks.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dependency Vulnerability Scanning](./mitigation_strategies/dependency_vulnerability_scanning.md)

**Description:**
1.  Choose a dependency vulnerability scanning tool (`cargo audit`).
2.  Integrate scanning tool into CI/CD pipeline.
3.  Automate dependency vulnerability scans on each build/commit.
4.  Set up vulnerability reporting with severity levels and remediation advice.
5.  Establish a process for promptly addressing reported vulnerabilities.
**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   Vulnerabilities in `procs` and Dependencies (Variable Severity)
*   Zero-Day Exploits (Low Severity - early detection)
**Impact:** Significantly Reduces risks from vulnerabilities in `procs` and dependencies.
**Currently Implemented:** Not implemented.
**Missing Implementation:** Integration of `cargo audit` into CI/CD, vulnerability alert system, and remediation workflow.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Code Review and Security Audits of `procs` Usage](./mitigation_strategies/code_review_and_security_audits_of__procs__usage.md)

**Description:**
1.  Incorporate security-focused code reviews, emphasizing secure `procs` usage.
2.  Train developers and reviewers on `procs`-specific security risks.
3.  Conduct regular security audits, reviewing `procs` usage and mitigation effectiveness.
4.  Consider external security experts for penetration testing and audits.
**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   All Threats (Variable Severity)
*   Implementation Flaws (Variable Severity)
**Impact:** Moderately to Significantly Reduces all identified threats.
**Currently Implemented:** Code reviews, but no explicit focus on `procs` security.
