## High-Risk Sub-Tree: Compromise Application Using 'procs'

**Attacker's Goal:** Gain unauthorized code execution on the server hosting the application by exploiting vulnerabilities in the `procs` library or the application's usage of it.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

* **[CRITICAL] Exploit Vulnerabilities within 'procs' Library (HIGH RISK PATH)**
    * **[CRITICAL] Buffer Overflow in Process Data Parsing (HIGH RISK PATH)**
    * **[CRITICAL] Format String Vulnerability in Process Data Handling (HIGH RISK PATH)**
    * Dependency Vulnerabilities in 'procs'
* **[CRITICAL] Exploit Application's Use of 'procs' Output (HIGH RISK PATH)**
    * Information Disclosure via Unsanitized Output
    * **[CRITICAL] Command Injection via Unsanitized Process Data (HIGH RISK PATH)**

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**1. [CRITICAL] Exploit Vulnerabilities within 'procs' Library (HIGH RISK PATH)**

* **Attack Vector:** Exploiting inherent weaknesses within the `procs` library itself.
* **Impact:** Potentially allows for direct and significant compromise of any application using the vulnerable version of the library.
* **Likelihood:** Depends on the presence of exploitable vulnerabilities in the specific version of `procs` being used.
* **Effort:** Can range from low (for exploiting known vulnerabilities) to high (for discovering new vulnerabilities).
* **Skill Level:** Can range from low (for exploiting known vulnerabilities with existing tools) to high (for vulnerability research and exploit development).
* **Detection Difficulty:** Can vary depending on the nature of the vulnerability and the sophistication of the exploit.

    * **[CRITICAL] Buffer Overflow in Process Data Parsing (HIGH RISK PATH)**
        * **Attack Vector:** Supplying specially crafted process data (e.g., very long process names or arguments) that exceeds the allocated buffer size within the `procs` library during parsing.
        * **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server running the application.
        * **Likelihood:** Medium (Buffer overflows are a known vulnerability type, but modern languages and libraries often have built-in protections. Depends on the implementation of `procs`.)
        * **Effort:** Medium to High (Requires reverse engineering or analysis of `procs` code to identify vulnerable parsing logic and craft an exploit).
        * **Skill Level:** High (Requires knowledge of memory management, assembly language, and exploit development).
        * **Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium (Can be detected by memory corruption detection tools or unusual process behavior if the exploit is not sophisticated).

    * **[CRITICAL] Format String Vulnerability in Process Data Handling (HIGH RISK PATH)**
        * **Attack Vector:** If `procs` uses process data (e.g., command line arguments) in format strings without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject format specifiers to read from or write to arbitrary memory locations.
        * **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential for arbitrary code execution.
        * **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (Less common in modern codebases, but still possible if process data is used directly in formatting functions without sanitization).
        * **Effort:** Medium (Requires identifying the vulnerable formatting function and crafting a format string payload).
        * **Skill Level:** Medium to High (Requires understanding of format string vulnerabilities and memory layout).
        * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Can be detected by monitoring for unusual characters in logs or by analyzing memory access patterns).

    * Dependency Vulnerabilities in 'procs'
        * **Attack Vector:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in libraries that `procs` depends on.
        * **Impact:** Depends on the nature of the dependency vulnerability, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.
        * **Likelihood:** Medium (Common for libraries to have vulnerable dependencies. Depends on the specific dependencies of `procs` and their security status).
        * **Effort:** Low to Medium (Identifying vulnerable dependencies is relatively easy with vulnerability scanners. Exploiting them depends on the specific vulnerability).
        * **Skill Level:** Low to High (Exploiting known vulnerabilities can be easier with available tools, but discovering new ones requires higher skill).
        * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Can be detected by vulnerability scanners and monitoring for exploitation attempts against known vulnerabilities).

**2. [CRITICAL] Exploit Application's Use of 'procs' Output (HIGH RISK PATH)**

* **Attack Vector:** Exploiting how the application processes and utilizes the information retrieved by the `procs` library.
* **Impact:** Can lead to information disclosure, logic errors, or, critically, arbitrary code execution.
* **Likelihood:** Depends on the application's implementation and how carefully it handles the output from `procs`.
* **Effort:** Can range from low (for simple information disclosure) to medium/high (for command injection).
* **Skill Level:** Can range from low to high depending on the complexity of the exploit.
* **Detection Difficulty:** Can vary depending on the type of exploitation and the logging/monitoring in place.

    * Information Disclosure via Unsanitized Output
        * **Attack Vector:** The application displays or logs raw output from `procs` (e.g., command line arguments, environment variables) without proper sanitization, revealing sensitive information.
        * **Impact:** Leakage of credentials, API keys, internal paths, or other confidential data.
        * **Likelihood:** Medium to High (A common mistake in application development).
        * **Effort:** Low (Observing the application's output or logs).
        * **Skill Level:** Low.
        * **Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium (Can be detected by monitoring logs and application output for sensitive information).

    * **[CRITICAL] Command Injection via Unsanitized Process Data (HIGH RISK PATH)**
        * **Attack Vector:** The application uses data from `procs` output (e.g., process name, command line) to construct and execute system commands without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious commands.
        * **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server.
        * **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (A serious vulnerability, but developers are generally more aware of the risks of direct command execution with untrusted input).
        * **Effort:** Medium (Requires identifying where process data is used in command execution and crafting malicious process names or arguments).
        * **Skill Level:** Medium to High (Requires understanding of command injection techniques and how to manipulate process information).
        * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Can be detected by monitoring system calls for unusual command executions originating from the application).
