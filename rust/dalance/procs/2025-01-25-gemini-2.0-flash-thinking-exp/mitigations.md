# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for dalance/procs

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege for Process Information Access](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_for_process_information_access.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify `procs` Usage:** Pinpoint all code sections where your application calls functions from the `procs` library to retrieve process information.
    2.  **Restrict Access Points:** Implement access control mechanisms around these code sections. Ensure only authorized parts of your application or specific user roles can trigger calls to `procs`.
    3.  **Limit Data Exposure:**  Within the code that uses `procs`, retrieve only the necessary process information fields. Avoid retrieving all available data if only a subset is required. This minimizes the potential for accidental exposure of sensitive details.
    4.  **Internal API Control:** If you create internal APIs or functions that wrap `procs` calls, apply access control at this API level.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (High Severity):** Unauthorized access to sensitive process details retrieved by `procs`, such as command-line arguments, usernames, and system paths.
    *   **Unauthorized Monitoring (Medium Severity):**  Components or users without proper authorization using `procs` indirectly to monitor system processes, gaining unintended insights.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Significantly reduces the risk by limiting which parts of the application and which users can access process information via `procs`.
    *   **Unauthorized Monitoring:** Significantly reduces the risk by controlling access to the `procs` library's functionality within the application.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Role-based access control exists in the application, but it's not yet granularly applied to control access to the specific functionalities that utilize `procs`.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Access control needs to be implemented specifically around the code sections that directly call `procs` functions. This might involve creating internal wrappers with access checks or modifying existing authorization logic to cover `procs` usage.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Sanitization and Filtering of Process Information from `procs`](./mitigation_strategies/data_sanitization_and_filtering_of_process_information_from__procs_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Sanitize `procs` Output:**  Immediately after retrieving process information using `procs`, implement sanitization and filtering logic.
    2.  **Redact Sensitive Fields:**  Specifically target sensitive fields returned by `procs` (e.g., `cmdline`, `username`) and redact or mask potentially sensitive data within them *before* further processing or storage.
        *   Example:  For `cmdline`, redact password-like arguments.
    3.  **Filter Unnecessary Data:**  Filter out process information fields that are not essential for your application's functionality.  Only retain and process the minimum required data from `procs`.
    4.  **Context-Aware Sanitization:**  If process data is used in different contexts (e.g., logging vs. UI display), apply context-specific sanitization levels. More aggressive sanitization might be needed for less trusted contexts.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (High Severity):** Accidental exposure of sensitive data embedded within process information retrieved by `procs` (e.g., secrets in command lines) to logs, UI, or other application components.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Significantly reduces the risk of accidental information disclosure by actively removing or masking sensitive data directly from the output of `procs` before it's used.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic sanitization exists for general application logging, but specific sanitization tailored to the process information retrieved by `procs` is not yet in place.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Sanitization logic needs to be implemented directly after calls to `procs` functions, within the code that processes the library's output. This should be applied before the data is used by other parts of the application.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting and Throttling of `procs` Calls](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_and_throttling_of__procs__calls.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify `procs` Call Frequency:** Analyze how frequently your application calls functions from the `procs` library.
    2.  **Implement Rate Limiting:**  Introduce rate limiting mechanisms to control the number of calls to `procs` within a given time window.
        *   This can be implemented at the application level, wrapping the `procs` calls, or using system-level rate limiting if applicable.
    3.  **Throttling on Limit Exceedance:**  If rate limits are exceeded, implement throttling to slow down or temporarily block further calls to `procs`.
    4.  **Optimize `procs` Usage:** Review your code to ensure `procs` is called efficiently and only when necessary. Avoid unnecessary or redundant calls to the library.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):**  Excessive or uncontrolled calls to `procs` overloading the system or the application itself, leading to performance degradation or failure.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):**  Uncontrolled retrieval of process data using `procs` consuming excessive system resources (CPU, memory, I/O).

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Significantly reduces the risk of DoS by preventing excessive calls to `procs` from overwhelming the system.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Significantly reduces the risk of resource exhaustion by controlling the frequency and potentially the scope of process information retrieval via `procs`.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. Rate limiting and throttling are not currently applied to calls to the `procs` library.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Rate limiting and throttling mechanisms need to be implemented specifically for the code sections that call `procs` functions. This could be done by wrapping `procs` calls in a rate-limited function or using a dedicated rate limiting library.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update `procs` Dependency](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update__procs__dependency.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Track `procs` Dependency:**  Use dependency management tools to track the `procs` library as a dependency of your project.
    2.  **Monitor for `procs` Updates:** Regularly check for new versions and security advisories specifically for the `procs` library on its GitHub repository or relevant security databases.
    3.  **Update `procs` Promptly:** When new versions of `procs` are released, especially those containing bug fixes or security patches, update your project's dependency to the latest version.
    4.  **Test After Update:** After updating `procs`, thoroughly test your application to ensure compatibility and that the update hasn't introduced any regressions.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Dependency Vulnerabilities (High Severity):**  Exploiting known vulnerabilities that might be discovered in the `procs` library itself.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Dependency Vulnerabilities:** Significantly reduces the risk of exploitation of vulnerabilities within the `procs` library by ensuring you are using the most up-to-date and patched version.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Dependency management tools are used, but proactive monitoring specifically for `procs` updates and automated update processes are not fully in place.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to establish a system for proactively monitoring for updates to the `procs` library and integrate a process for promptly updating the dependency when new versions are released. This could involve automated checks and alerts for new `procs` versions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Code Reviews and Security Testing Focused on `procs` Usage](./mitigation_strategies/code_reviews_and_security_testing_focused_on__procs__usage.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Targeted Code Reviews:**  During code reviews, specifically focus on the code sections that interact with the `procs` library.
        *   Reviewers should be aware of the security implications of using `procs` and accessing system process information.
        *   Pay close attention to how the output of `procs` is handled, sanitized, and used within the application logic.
    2.  **Security Test Cases for `procs`:**  Develop specific security test cases that target potential vulnerabilities related to `procs` usage.
        *   Test for information disclosure by attempting to access process data without proper authorization.
        *   Test for DoS vulnerabilities by simulating excessive calls to the functionalities that use `procs`.
        *   Test input validation and output encoding in areas where user input interacts with process data retrieved by `procs`.
    3.  **Penetration Testing Focus:**  During penetration testing, specifically instruct testers to examine areas of the application that use `procs` for potential security weaknesses.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **All Threats Directly Related to `procs`:** Code reviews and security testing can help identify and mitigate all types of threats stemming from the application's use of the `procs` library, including information disclosure, DoS, and vulnerabilities in handling process data.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **All Threats Directly Related to `procs`:** Significantly reduces the risk of all threats associated with `procs` usage by proactively identifying and addressing vulnerabilities through focused code analysis and testing.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Code reviews are conducted, but security-focused reviews specifically targeting `procs` usage are not consistently performed. General security testing is done, but dedicated test cases for `procs`-related vulnerabilities are lacking.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to implement security-focused code review guidelines that specifically address `procs` usage. Also, need to develop and incorporate security test cases specifically designed to test the security of application components that utilize the `procs` library.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Developer Training on Secure Usage of `procs` Library](./mitigation_strategies/developer_training_on_secure_usage_of__procs__library.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **`procs`-Specific Training Module:**  Develop a training module specifically focused on the secure usage of the `procs` library.
    2.  **Highlight Security Risks:**  In the training, clearly explain the security risks associated with using `procs`, particularly information disclosure and potential DoS.
    3.  **Best Practices for `procs`:**  Teach developers best practices for using `procs` securely, including:
        *   Principle of least privilege for accessing process data.
        *   Data sanitization and filtering of `procs` output.
        *   Rate limiting calls to `procs`.
        *   Regularly updating the `procs` dependency.
    4.  **Code Examples and Exercises:**  Include code examples and hands-on exercises in the training to demonstrate secure and insecure ways of using `procs` and reinforce secure coding principles.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **All Threats Directly Related to `procs`:** Developer training indirectly mitigates all threats by equipping developers with the knowledge and skills to use `procs` securely and avoid introducing vulnerabilities in the first place.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **All Threats Directly Related to `procs`:** Partially reduces the risk of all threats by improving developer awareness and promoting secure coding practices specifically related to the `procs` library.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. General security awareness training is provided, but specific training on the secure usage of system information libraries, and particularly `procs`, is missing.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to develop and deliver targeted training for developers specifically on the secure usage of the `procs` library, covering the mitigation strategies and best practices outlined above. This training should be integrated into developer onboarding and ongoing professional development.
