## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Buffer Overflow in Process Data Parsing](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_buffer_overflow_in_process_data_parsing.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts malicious process data (e.g., overly long process names, arguments, or environment variables) that, when parsed by the `procs` library, exceeds the allocated buffer size.

**Mechanism:** This overflow overwrites adjacent memory regions, potentially corrupting program data or control flow.

**Outcome:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution within the application's process, granting the attacker full control over the application and potentially the underlying system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Input via Application Interface](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_input_via_application_interface.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker provides malicious input through the application's user interface or API. This input is then used by the application to filter or process process data using the `procs` library without proper sanitization.

**Mechanism:** The malicious input can contain special characters, escape sequences, or commands that are interpreted by the underlying system when the application uses the unsanitized input in system calls or shell commands.

**Outcome:** This can lead to command injection, where the attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server with the application's privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [Command Injection via Process Arguments](./attack_tree_paths/command_injection_via_process_arguments.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application retrieves process arguments using the `procs` library and then uses these arguments in the construction of shell commands without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Mechanism:** An attacker can manipulate the arguments of a process running on the system (or create a new process with malicious arguments) that will be subsequently retrieved by the application. When the application constructs and executes the shell command, the malicious arguments are interpreted as commands.

**Outcome:** This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the application process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities within `procs` Library](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_within__procs__library.md)

**Attack Vectors:** This node represents a range of potential vulnerabilities within the `procs` library itself. Exploiting any of these vulnerabilities directly compromises the library's functionality.
    *   **Parsing Vulnerabilities (including Buffer Overflow):** As detailed above, flaws in how `procs` parses process data can lead to memory corruption and code execution.
    *   **Race Conditions:** Attackers might manipulate the system state while `procs` is retrieving process information, causing it to return inconsistent or incorrect data that the application then uses insecurely.
    *   **Dependency Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in the libraries that `procs` depends on can indirectly compromise the application.
    *   **Logic Errors:** Flaws in the internal logic of `procs` could lead to it returning incorrect or misleading information, which the application might then use to make vulnerable decisions.

**Impact:** Successful exploitation of vulnerabilities within `procs` can have a widespread impact on all applications using the library and often leads to high-severity outcomes like arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vectors:** This node focuses specifically on vulnerabilities arising from the parsing of process data within `procs`.
    *   **Buffer Overflows:** As detailed in the High-Risk Paths, these are a primary concern.
    *   **Format String Vulnerabilities:** While less likely in Rust, if `procs` interacts with C code via FFI, format string vulnerabilities could be present. Attackers could inject format string specifiers to read from or write to arbitrary memory locations.
    *   **Integer Overflows:**  If `procs` performs calculations on sizes or lengths related to process data without proper bounds checking, attackers could provide input that causes integer overflows, potentially leading to memory corruption.
    *   **Inconsistent Data Handling:**  Different operating systems and environments might provide process data in slightly different formats. If `procs` doesn't handle these variations robustly, attackers could craft inputs that exploit these inconsistencies to cause errors or unexpected behavior.

**Impact:** Successful exploitation of parsing vulnerabilities can directly lead to arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Application's Use of `procs`](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_application's_use_of__procs_.md)

**Attack Vectors:** This node encompasses vulnerabilities that arise from how the application *uses* the `procs` library, rather than flaws within the library itself.
    *   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** As detailed in the High-Risk Paths, failing to sanitize user input used with `procs` can lead to injection attacks.
    *   **Insecure Handling of Process Data:** This includes using process arguments in shell commands without sanitization (leading to command injection), using file paths from process data without validation (leading to path traversal), and exposing sensitive process information to unauthorized users.
    *   **Privilege Escalation via Process Information:** Attackers might use `procs` to identify privileged processes and then attempt to interact with them maliciously.
    *   **Unintended Side Effects of Process Management:** If the application allows process management based on `procs` data, attackers could abuse this to disrupt the system (e.g., killing critical processes).

**Impact:** The impact varies depending on the specific vulnerability, but can range from information disclosure and denial of service to arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insufficient Input Sanitization](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insufficient_input_sanitization.md)

**Attack Vectors:** This node focuses on the critical vulnerability of failing to properly sanitize user input before using it in conjunction with `procs`.
    *   **Command Injection:** As detailed in the High-Risk Paths, this is a primary risk.
    *   **Other Injection Attacks:** Depending on how the input is used, other injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection if process data is stored in a database) might be possible.
    *   **Denial of Service:**  Malicious input could be crafted to cause the application to crash or consume excessive resources.

**Impact:**  Insufficient input sanitization is a common and easily exploitable vulnerability that can lead to a wide range of security breaches, including arbitrary code execution, data breaches, and denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Handling of Process Data](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_handling_of_process_data.md)

**Attack Vectors:** This node highlights the dangers of trusting and directly using the data returned by `procs` without proper validation and sanitization.
    *   **Command Injection via Process Arguments:** As detailed in the High-Risk Paths.
    *   **Path Traversal:** If the application uses file paths obtained from process information (e.g., the executable path) without validating them, attackers could potentially access or manipulate arbitrary files on the system.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** The arguments and environment variables of processes often contain sensitive information. If the application exposes this information without proper authorization, it can lead to data breaches.

**Impact:**  Insecure handling of process data can lead to severe consequences, including arbitrary code execution, unauthorized file access, and the disclosure of sensitive information.
