# Threat Model Analysis for dalance/procs

## Threat: [Information Disclosure of Sensitive Process Data](./threats/information_disclosure_of_sensitive_process_data.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit the application's direct use of `procs` to retrieve a list of running processes and their details. This occurs when the application directly calls `procs` functions and exposes the raw or minimally processed output without sufficient access control or sanitization. The attacker gains access to sensitive information embedded in command-line arguments, environment variables, or process ownership.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data such as API keys, database credentials, internal application configurations, or the presence of other applications on the server. This information can be used for further attacks, such as privilege escalation or lateral movement.

**Affected Component:** The core functionality of `procs` responsible for retrieving process information (likely the main module and functions for listing processes).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict access controls on any application code paths that directly invoke `procs`.
* Avoid directly exposing the raw output of `procs` calls.
* Sanitize and filter process data *within the application* before any potential display or use, removing sensitive details *before* the data leaves the secure context.
* Ensure the application runs with the minimal necessary privileges to access process information.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion through Excessive Process Listing (Directly Triggered by Application Logic)](./threats/resource_exhaustion_through_excessive_process_listing__directly_triggered_by_application_logic_.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate the application in a way that causes it to repeatedly and unnecessarily call `procs` to list all running processes. This might occur if the application logic uses process listing in an inefficient or unbounded loop, and this logic can be triggered by attacker-controlled input or actions. The repeated calls to `procs` consume significant server resources (CPU, memory), potentially leading to a denial of service.

**Impact:** Degradation of application performance, potential service outages, and increased server load directly caused by the application's excessive use of `procs`. This impacts legitimate users and the overall availability of the application.

**Affected Component:** The core functionality of `procs` responsible for listing processes (likely the main module and functions for listing processes) when directly invoked by vulnerable application logic.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully review and optimize application logic that uses `procs` to list processes.
* Implement safeguards to prevent unbounded or excessive calls to `procs` based on user input or internal application state.
* Implement timeouts or limits on the duration or number of process listing operations.
* Monitor resource usage and set up alerts for unusual activity related to process listing initiated by the application.
