# Attack Surface Analysis for dalance/procs

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure via Process Details](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_via_process_details.md)

* **Description:** The application exposes sensitive information about running processes.
    * **How `procs` Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `procs` provides the functionality to retrieve detailed process information, making it readily available to the application. If the application doesn't properly control access or sanitize this data, it becomes an attack vector.
    * **Example:** An attacker could access an API endpoint that uses `procs` to list processes and their command-line arguments, revealing database credentials passed as arguments to a database process.
    * **Impact:** Leakage of sensitive data like credentials, API keys, file paths, internal application details, or user information. This can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or further attacks.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strict access control mechanisms to limit who can access process information retrieved by `procs`.
        * Avoid displaying raw process details directly to users.
        * Sanitize or filter sensitive information from process details before displaying or logging them.
        * Design the application to avoid passing sensitive information as command-line arguments or environment variables where possible.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Consumption and Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_surfaces/resource_consumption_and_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

* **Description:** An attacker can cause the application or the underlying system to become unavailable by exhausting resources through excessive process information requests.
    * **How `procs` Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `procs` allows querying for all processes and their details. Malicious actors can exploit this by sending a large number of requests to retrieve this information, consuming CPU, memory, and I/O resources.
    * **Example:** An attacker repeatedly calls an endpoint that uses `procs` to list all running processes on the server, overwhelming the server and making it unresponsive to legitimate requests.
    * **Impact:** Application downtime, service disruption, and potential impact on other applications running on the same system.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement rate limiting on API endpoints or functionalities that utilize `procs` to retrieve process information.
        * Implement timeouts for process information retrieval operations.
        * Monitor resource usage and set up alerts for unusual activity.
        * Consider caching process information to reduce the frequency of calls to `procs`.
