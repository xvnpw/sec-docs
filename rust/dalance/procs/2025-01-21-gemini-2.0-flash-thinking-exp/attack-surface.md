# Attack Surface Analysis for dalance/procs

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Command-Line Arguments](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_command-line_arguments.md)

* **Description:** The `procs` library retrieves command-line arguments of running processes. These arguments can inadvertently contain sensitive information like passwords, API keys, database credentials, or file paths.
    * **How `procs` Contributes:** `procs` directly provides access to this information through its API, making it readily available to the application.
    * **Example:** An application uses `procs` to monitor resource usage of other processes. A legitimate process might be started with a command like `my_process --api-key=super_secret_key`. The application using `procs` could inadvertently log or display this command line, exposing the API key.
    * **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, unauthorized access to resources, potential for lateral movement if credentials for other systems are exposed.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Avoid passing sensitive information directly as command-line arguments. Use environment variables, configuration files with restricted permissions, or secure secret management solutions instead. Sanitize or redact command-line arguments *retrieved by `procs`* before logging or displaying them.
        * **Users:** Be mindful of the information passed as command-line arguments when starting processes.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Environment Variables](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_environment_variables.md)

* **Description:** Similar to command-line arguments, `procs` can retrieve environment variables associated with processes. These variables can also contain sensitive data.
    * **How `procs` Contributes:** `procs`'s API allows access to the environment variables of running processes.
    * **Example:** A process might have an environment variable `DATABASE_PASSWORD=another_secret`. An application using `procs` to gather process information could inadvertently expose this password if it logs or displays the environment variables.
    * **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, unauthorized access to databases or other systems, potential for privilege escalation.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Be cautious about logging or displaying environment variables *retrieved by `procs`*. Implement strict access control within the application to limit who can access this information.
        * **Users:**  Follow secure practices for managing environment variables, ensuring they are not unnecessarily exposed or logged.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion through Excessive Process Enumeration](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_through_excessive_process_enumeration.md)

* **Description:** Repeatedly calling `procs` to enumerate all running processes can consume CPU and memory resources, potentially leading to a denial-of-service condition for the application itself.
    * **How `procs` Contributes:** `procs` provides the functionality to iterate through all processes, and inefficient or excessive use of this functionality can lead to resource exhaustion.
    * **Example:** An application might poll `procs` very frequently to monitor process activity. If the number of processes is large, this constant enumeration can strain the application's resources.
    * **Impact:** Denial of service, application slowdown, instability.
    * **Risk Severity:** Medium
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Implement efficient process monitoring strategies. Avoid unnecessary or overly frequent calls to `procs`. Consider using more targeted queries or event-based mechanisms if available. Implement rate limiting or throttling for process enumeration.
        * **Users:**  Configure the application to monitor processes less frequently or only monitor specific processes of interest.
