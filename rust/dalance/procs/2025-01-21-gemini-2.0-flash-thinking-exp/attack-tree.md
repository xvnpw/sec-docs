## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Logic via Manipulated Process Information [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_logic_via_manipulated_process_information__critical_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. It represents the successful manipulation of process information to cause the application to behave in an unintended or malicious way. This could involve actions like making incorrect decisions, interacting with the wrong processes, or exposing sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in `procs` Library [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in__procs__library__critical_.md)

This critical node represents the attacker directly targeting weaknesses within the `procs` library itself. Success here can have a broad impact on any application using the vulnerable version of `procs`.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Buffer Overflow in `procs` Parsing](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_buffer_overflow_in__procs__parsing.md)

*   **Inject Malformed Process Data (e.g., excessively long strings in process names/arguments):** An attacker crafts process data that exceeds the expected buffer size when parsed by `procs`. This could involve creating processes with extremely long names or command-line arguments.
*   **Trigger `procs` to Parse This Data:** The application using `procs` calls a function that retrieves and parses this malformed process data. If `procs` doesn't have sufficient bounds checking, this can lead to a buffer overflow.

## Attack Tree Path: [Logic Errors in `procs`](./attack_tree_paths/logic_errors_in__procs_.md)

This critical node highlights vulnerabilities arising from flaws in the logic of the `procs` library, rather than memory safety issues.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Incorrect Process Filtering/Matching](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_incorrect_process_filteringmatching.md)

*   **Create Malicious Process with Carefully Crafted Name/Arguments:** The attacker creates a process with a name or command-line arguments designed to mimic a legitimate process that the application intends to interact with.
*   **Cause Application to Misidentify This Process via `procs` [CRITICAL]:** The application uses `procs` to find a specific process based on its name or arguments. Due to the crafted name/arguments of the malicious process, the application incorrectly identifies and interacts with the malicious process instead of the intended one. This is a critical point where the application's logic is directly compromised.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Process Information Sources [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_process_information_sources__critical_.md)

This critical node represents the attacker gaining control over the sources of information that `procs` relies on. This allows for widespread manipulation of process data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Tamper with OS Process Information (Requires Elevated Privileges) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/tamper_with_os_process_information__requires_elevated_privileges___critical_.md)

This critical node signifies that the attacker has gained elevated privileges on the system, allowing them to directly manipulate OS-level process information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify `/proc` Filesystem (Linux)](./attack_tree_paths/modify__proc__filesystem__linux_.md)

*   **Gain Root Access on the System [CRITICAL]:** The attacker successfully gains root privileges on the Linux system where the application is running. This is a highly critical point of compromise.
*   **Directly Alter Process Information Files:** With root access, the attacker can directly modify files within the `/proc` filesystem to alter the information about running processes. This can involve changing process names, arguments, owners, or other attributes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Utilize Debugging Tools to Alter Process Memory](./attack_tree_paths/utilize_debugging_tools_to_alter_process_memory.md)

*   **Gain Sufficient Privileges [CRITICAL]:** The attacker obtains privileges sufficient to attach a debugger to the target process. This might involve root access or specific debugging permissions.
*   **Modify Process Attributes in Memory Before `procs` Reads Them:** Using debugging tools, the attacker can directly modify the memory of a running process, altering its attributes (e.g., command-line arguments, environment variables) before `procs` retrieves this information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce Malicious Processes to Influence Application Logic](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_malicious_processes_to_influence_application_logic.md)

This path involves the attacker creating new processes to influence the application's behavior through the information `procs` provides.

## Attack Tree Path: [Create Processes with Specific Names/Arguments](./attack_tree_paths/create_processes_with_specific_namesarguments.md)

*   **Craft Process Names/Arguments to Match Application's Filtering Logic:** The attacker carefully crafts the names and command-line arguments of new processes to match the criteria used by the application when filtering or identifying processes using `procs`.
*   **Launch These Processes Before Application Uses `procs`:** The attacker launches these malicious processes before the application queries process information using `procs`, ensuring that the malicious processes are included in the results.
