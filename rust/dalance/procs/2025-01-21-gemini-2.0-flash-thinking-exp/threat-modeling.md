# Threat Model Analysis for dalance/procs

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Process Arguments](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_process_arguments.md)

**Description:** An attacker could gain access to the command-line arguments of running processes *retrieved by `procs`*. This might happen if the application logs this information, exposes it through an API, or displays it in an insecure manner. The attacker could then extract sensitive data like passwords, API keys, database credentials, or internal paths embedded within these arguments.

**Impact:** Compromise of other systems or services using the exposed credentials, unauthorized access to resources, data breaches, and potential lateral movement within the infrastructure.

**Affected `procs` Component:**
*   Module: `Process` struct
*   Function/Field: `cmdline` field

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid logging or storing the full `cmdline` output.
*   Implement strict access controls to any part of the application that retrieves and displays process arguments.
*   Sanitize or redact sensitive information from process arguments before logging or displaying them.
*   Educate developers on best practices for avoiding embedding secrets in command-line arguments. Consider using environment variables or secure configuration management instead.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Environment Variables](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_environment_variables.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit the application's use of `procs` to retrieve the environment variables of running processes. If the application then exposes this information (e.g., in error messages, logs, or API responses), the attacker could gain access to sensitive data such as API keys, database connection strings, and internal configuration details stored in environment variables.

**Impact:** Similar to the exposure of process arguments, leading to compromise of other systems, unauthorized access, and data breaches.

**Affected `procs` Component:**
*   Module: `Process` struct
*   Function/Field: `environ` field

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Minimize the retrieval of environment variables using `procs`. Only retrieve them if absolutely necessary.
*   Implement robust access controls for accessing process environment data within the application.
*   Never directly expose environment variables in application outputs or logs.
*   Consider using dedicated secret management solutions instead of relying solely on environment variables for sensitive information.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in the `procs` Library Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_the__procs__library_itself.md)

**Description:** Like any third-party library, `dalance/procs` might contain security vulnerabilities. If these vulnerabilities are discovered and exploited, they could directly compromise the application. This could range from information disclosure to remote code execution, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.

**Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data breaches, or denial of service.

**Affected `procs` Component:** Any part of the library could be affected depending on the specific vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update the `procs` library to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
*   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for known issues in `procs`.
*   Consider using dependency scanning tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in the library.
*   Implement security best practices in the application to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities in dependencies.
