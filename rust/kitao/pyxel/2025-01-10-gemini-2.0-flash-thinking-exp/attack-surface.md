# Attack Surface Analysis for kitao/pyxel

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Resource Loading](./attack_surfaces/insecure_resource_loading.md)

- **Description:** The application loads external resources like images, sounds, and music files. If the application allows user-controlled paths or doesn't properly validate resource content, it can be exploited.
- **How Pyxel Contributes:** Pyxel provides functions to load resources (e.g., `pyxel.load`, `pyxel.image`, `pyxel.sound`). If the paths passed to these functions are derived from user input without sanitization, it becomes an attack vector.
- **Example:** A game allows users to load custom sprite sheets by entering a file path. An attacker provides a path like `../../../../etc/passwd`, potentially exposing sensitive system files. Or, an attacker provides a maliciously crafted PNG file that exploits a vulnerability in the underlying image decoding library used by Pyxel.
- **Impact:**
    - Path Traversal: Access to or modification of arbitrary files on the system.
    - Remote Code Execution: Through vulnerabilities in resource decoding libraries.
- **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the potential for code execution).
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Input Validation:**  Strictly validate and sanitize any user-provided file paths. Use whitelisting of allowed characters and directories.
    - **Restrict Resource Paths:**  Limit resource loading to specific, controlled directories within the application's data folder.
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP) for Resources (if applicable):** If the application has a web component, implement CSP to restrict the sources from which resources can be loaded.
    - **Regularly Update Dependencies:** Keep Pyxel and its underlying dependencies (like SDL2's image loading libraries) updated to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Input Handling](./attack_surfaces/malicious_input_handling.md)

- **Description:** The application processes user input from keyboard, mouse, and gamepad. Insufficient validation or sanitization of this input can lead to unexpected behavior or security issues.
- **How Pyxel Contributes:** Pyxel provides functions to access input states (e.g., `pyxel.btn`, `pyxel.mouse_x`, `pyxel.mouse_y`). If application logic directly uses this input to construct commands or file paths without validation, it's vulnerable.
- **Example:** A game uses keyboard input to name saved game files. An attacker enters a filename like `"; rm -rf / #"` which, if not properly handled, could lead to command injection on the underlying system (though this is less likely in a sandboxed environment, it illustrates the principle).
- **Impact:**
    - (Potentially) Code Execution: If input is used to execute system commands without sanitization.
- **Risk Severity:** High (due to the potential for code execution, though less likely in typical Pyxel usage without explicit system calls).
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Validate and sanitize all user input before using it in application logic, especially for critical actions like file saving.
    - **Use Pyxel's Input Abstractions Carefully:** While Pyxel provides abstractions, ensure the logic built upon them is secure.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Underlying Library Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_underlying_library_vulnerabilities.md)

- **Description:** Pyxel relies on underlying libraries (like SDL2 for graphics, input, and audio). Vulnerabilities in these libraries can indirectly affect Pyxel applications.
- **How Pyxel Contributes:** Pyxel utilizes the functionality provided by these libraries. If a vulnerability exists in SDL2's image loading or audio decoding, a Pyxel application using those features could be vulnerable.
- **Example:** A vulnerability exists in the libpng library (used by SDL2 for PNG decoding). An attacker provides a specially crafted PNG file that, when loaded by a Pyxel application, triggers the vulnerability, potentially leading to a crash or code execution.
- **Impact:**
    - Remote Code Execution.
- **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the nature of the underlying vulnerability).
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Regularly Update Pyxel and Dependencies:** Keep Pyxel and all its underlying dependencies updated to the latest versions to patch known security vulnerabilities.
    - **Be Aware of Dependency Security Advisories:** Monitor security advisories for the libraries Pyxel depends on (e.g., SDL2, its image format libraries, etc.).

## Attack Surface: [Network Functionality (If Implemented)](./attack_surfaces/network_functionality__if_implemented_.md)

- **Description:** If the Pyxel application is extended with network capabilities (e.g., for multiplayer), it introduces a significant new attack surface.
- **How Pyxel Contributes:** While Pyxel itself doesn't provide networking, if developers add networking features using external libraries or custom code within a Pyxel application, these features become part of the application's attack surface.
- **Example:** A multiplayer game built with Pyxel uses a simple socket server and is vulnerable to common network attacks.
- **Impact:**
    - Data breaches and information disclosure.
    - Account compromise.
    - Remote code execution on server or client machines.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical (due to the potential for widespread impact).
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Secure Network Programming Practices:** Implement secure coding practices for all network-related code.
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all data received from the network.
    - **Use Secure Protocols:** Employ secure communication protocols like HTTPS or TLS for network communication.
    - **Implement Strong Authentication and Authorization:** Verify the identity of users and control access to resources.
    - **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct security assessments to identify and address vulnerabilities.
