## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities (HIGH RISK)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_handling_vulnerabilities__high_risk_.md)

*   **Buffer Overflow in Input Processing (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Description:** Pyxel applications often take user input. If input buffers are not handled correctly, providing excessively long input strings can overwrite adjacent memory regions, potentially leading to code execution. This is more likely if the application uses Pyxel's text input features or allows users to input file names.
    *   **Attack Steps:**
        *   Send excessively long input strings (e.g., for text input, file names).
        *   Trigger Pyxel's input handling routines to process this oversized input.
    *   **Impact:** High (Code execution, application crash).
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization, ensuring that input lengths are checked and do not exceed buffer capacities. Use safe string handling functions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Resource Loading Vulnerabilities (HIGH RISK)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_resource_loading_vulnerabilities__high_risk_.md)

*   **Malicious Image/Sound Files (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Description:** Pyxel applications load image and sound files. If the libraries used by Pyxel to decode these files have vulnerabilities, a specially crafted malicious file can trigger a buffer overflow, memory corruption, or other exploitable conditions during the loading process.
    *   **Attack Steps:**
        *   Provide specially crafted image or sound files (e.g., with malicious headers, excessive data).
        *   Trigger Pyxel's functions to load these resources (e.g., `pyxel.load`, `pyxel.image`, `pyxel.sound`).
    *   **Impact:** High (Code execution, application crash).
    *   **Mitigation:** Ensure Pyxel and its dependencies are up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities in image and sound decoding libraries. Consider validating file headers and performing basic sanity checks before attempting to load resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Pyxel-Specific Features Vulnerabilities (HIGH RISK)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_pyxel-specific_features_vulnerabilities__high_risk_.md)

*   **Vulnerabilities in `pyxelres` File Handling (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Description:** Pyxel uses `.pyxelres` files to store resources like images, tilemaps, and sounds. If the format of this file is not robustly parsed, a maliciously crafted `.pyxelres` file with corrupted data or excessive sizes could trigger vulnerabilities during loading, potentially leading to crashes or even code execution.
    *   **Attack Steps:**
        *   Provide a maliciously crafted `.pyxelres` file (e.g., with corrupted data, excessive sizes).
        *   Trigger Pyxel's loading of the `.pyxelres` file at startup or during runtime.
    *   **Impact:** High (Application crash, potential for code execution if parsing is flawed).
    *   **Mitigation:** Ensure robust parsing of `.pyxelres` files with proper error handling and validation. Limit the maximum size of resources within the file.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node.md)

*   **Compromise Pyxel Application:** This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and is therefore a critical node. All the high-risk paths aim to achieve this compromise, highlighting the importance of securing against the vulnerabilities described above.
