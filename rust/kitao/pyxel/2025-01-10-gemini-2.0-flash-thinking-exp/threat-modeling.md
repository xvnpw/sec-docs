# Threat Model Analysis for kitao/pyxel

## Threat: [Buffer Overflow in Resource Loading](./threats/buffer_overflow_in_resource_loading.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a malformed resource file (e.g., image, sound) that, when loaded by the Pyxel application, causes a buffer overflow in Pyxel's internal memory management. This could allow the attacker to overwrite adjacent memory regions. The attacker might achieve this by providing the malicious file through game assets or potentially through user-uploaded content if the application allows it.
*   **Impact:**  Memory corruption can lead to application crashes, unexpected behavior, or, in more severe cases, the ability to execute arbitrary code on the user's machine. This could allow the attacker to gain control of the user's system, steal data, or install malware.
*   **Affected Pyxel Component:**  Specifically the modules responsible for loading and processing external resources, such as the image loading module (`pyxel.image`), sound loading module (`pyxel.sound`), or tilemap loading functionalities. Potentially the underlying C++ backend handling these operations.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Update Pyxel:** Regularly update to the latest version of Pyxel, as newer versions may contain fixes for known buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
    *   **Memory Safety Practices (Pyxel Developers):**  The Pyxel development team should employ memory-safe coding practices in the C++ backend to prevent buffer overflows. This includes using bounds checking and safe memory management techniques.

## Threat: [Integer Overflow in Resource Handling](./threats/integer_overflow_in_resource_handling.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a resource file (e.g., image, sound) with maliciously crafted metadata that causes an integer overflow when Pyxel calculates memory allocation sizes or other related values. This overflow can lead to unexpected behavior, such as allocating a smaller buffer than required, potentially leading to a subsequent buffer overflow.
*   **Impact:** Similar to buffer overflows, integer overflows can lead to application crashes, unexpected behavior, and potentially arbitrary code execution.
*   **Affected Pyxel Component:**  Modules involved in resource loading and processing, particularly the parts that handle metadata parsing and size calculations within `pyxel.image`, `pyxel.sound`, and related functionalities. Again, the underlying C++ backend is likely affected.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Update Pyxel:** Keep Pyxel updated to benefit from potential fixes for integer overflow vulnerabilities.
    *   **Safe Integer Arithmetic (Pyxel Developers):** The Pyxel development team should use safe integer arithmetic techniques in the C++ backend to prevent overflows, such as checking for potential overflows before performing calculations.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Pyxel, while primarily written in Python and C++, might rely on underlying system libraries or external dependencies for certain functionalities (e.g., image loading, sound processing). Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited by providing crafted input that triggers the vulnerability within the dependency.
*   **Impact:** The impact depends on the nature of the vulnerability in the dependency. It could range from application crashes and information disclosure to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Affected Pyxel Component:**  The interfaces and wrappers within Pyxel that interact with the vulnerable dependency.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regularly Update Pyxel:** Updating Pyxel might include updates to its dependencies, patching known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Dependency Audits (Pyxel Developers):** The Pyxel development team should regularly audit the dependencies used by Pyxel and update them to the latest secure versions.
