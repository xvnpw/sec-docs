# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for kitao/pyxel

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation for Pyxel Button and Mouse Events](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_for_pyxel_button_and_mouse_events.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Identify all points in the game where Pyxel's input functions are used for decision making or actions. This includes functions like `pyxel.btnp()`, `pyxel.btn()`, `pyxel.mouse_x`, `pyxel.mouse_y`, and gamepad input functions.
    *   Step 2: For each input event, validate the *context* in which the input is being processed. For example, if `pyxel.btnp(pyxel.KEY_SPACE)` is used to trigger an action in a specific game state (e.g., in-game gameplay, not in a menu), ensure the game is indeed in that expected state before processing the input.
    *   Step 3: When using mouse coordinates (`pyxel.mouse_x`, `pyxel.mouse_y`), validate if these coordinates are within expected bounds or interactive areas on the Pyxel screen before triggering actions. For example, if clicking on a button sprite, check if the mouse coordinates are within the sprite's bounding box.
    *   Step 4: Avoid directly using raw input values to directly index into game data structures without context validation. Ensure that input events are processed within the intended game logic flow.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Logic errors due to unexpected input context (Severity: Medium):**  If input events are processed without proper context validation, unexpected game states or actions might be triggered. For example, a button press intended for a menu might inadvertently trigger an in-game action if context is not checked.
    *   **Unintended actions due to mouse input outside interactive areas (Severity: Low):**  Mouse clicks outside intended interactive elements might trigger unintended actions if area boundaries are not properly validated.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Logic errors due to unexpected input context: Partially reduces
    *   Unintended actions due to mouse input outside interactive areas: Partially reduces
*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic context checks are implemented in the main game state machine to differentiate between menu input and gameplay input.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Missing more granular context validation within specific game scenes and for mouse input interactions with in-game objects and UI elements.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limits for Pyxel Sprite and Sound Usage](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limits_for_pyxel_sprite_and_sound_usage.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Understand Pyxel's resource limitations, particularly regarding sprite sheet size, number of available sprites, sound channels, and overall memory usage within the Pyxel environment.
    *   Step 2:  When designing game mechanics involving dynamic creation of sprites or sounds, implement systems to track the usage of these Pyxel resources.
    *   Step 3: Set reasonable limits on the number of sprites and sounds that can be actively used concurrently within the game, considering Pyxel's capabilities and target performance.
    *   Step 4:  Implement strategies to manage resource usage when limits are approached. This could include:
        *   Sprite Pooling: Reusing existing sprites instead of constantly creating new ones, especially for frequently used elements like projectiles or particles.
        *   Sound Channel Management: Prioritizing sound playback and potentially stopping less important sounds when sound channels are limited.
        *   Asset Optimization: Minimizing the size of sprite sheets and sound files to reduce memory footprint within Pyxel.
    *   Step 5: Monitor Pyxel's performance during development to identify potential resource bottlenecks and adjust resource limits or optimization strategies as needed.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Client-side Denial of Service (DoS) through Pyxel resource exhaustion (Severity: Medium):**  Excessive creation of sprites or sounds can exhaust Pyxel's internal resources, leading to game slowdowns, crashes, or unexpected behavior within the Pyxel environment.
    *   **Performance degradation due to excessive Pyxel resource usage (Severity: Low):**  Even without crashing, exceeding Pyxel's resource limits can lead to noticeable performance degradation, impacting frame rate and responsiveness.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Client-side Denial of Service (DoS) through Pyxel resource exhaustion: Significantly reduces
    *   Performance degradation due to excessive Pyxel resource usage: Significantly reduces
*   **Currently Implemented:** Particle effects are using a basic sprite pooling mechanism to limit sprite creation. Sound effects are generally managed, but no explicit channel limits are enforced.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Missing comprehensive resource tracking and management for all dynamically created sprites and sounds across all game systems.  More robust sprite pooling could be implemented for enemies and projectiles. Sound channel prioritization and limiting is not yet implemented.
