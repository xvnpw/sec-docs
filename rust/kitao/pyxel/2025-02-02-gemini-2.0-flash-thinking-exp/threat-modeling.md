# Threat Model Analysis for kitao/pyxel

## Threat: [Untrusted External Resource Loading](./threats/untrusted_external_resource_loading.md)

*   **Description:** If a Pyxel application is designed to load resources (images, sounds, music) from external, untrusted sources (e.g., user-provided URLs, third-party servers), an attacker can serve malicious resources. This is a threat directly related to how a developer might choose to utilize Pyxel's resource loading capabilities in a risky manner.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) due to oversized or malformed files crashing the application, impacting Pyxel's runtime.
    *   Potential (but less likely) code execution if vulnerabilities exist in Pyxel's resource parsing or underlying libraries when handling externally loaded data.
    *   Supply chain attack if relying on compromised external resource repositories, leading to malicious resources being loaded by Pyxel.
*   **Pyxel Component Affected:** Pyxel resource loading functions (e.g., `pyxel.load`, image/sound/music loading functions) when used to load external resources, network communication if implemented within the Pyxel application for resource fetching.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid loading resources from untrusted external sources.** Design the application to rely on bundled or verified resources if possible.
    *   **Implement strong verification mechanisms** if external resources are absolutely necessary. This includes using checksums, digital signatures, and HTTPS to ensure resource integrity and authenticity before Pyxel loads them.
    *   **Whitelist trusted resource sources.** Restrict resource loading to a predefined list of reputable and controlled origins, preventing Pyxel from loading from arbitrary URLs.
    *   **Sanitize and validate resource URLs and paths** before passing them to Pyxel's loading functions to prevent injection attacks or access to unintended locations.

## Threat: [Pyxel Library Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/pyxel_library_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:**  A critical or high severity vulnerability exists within the Pyxel library itself (core code or dependencies). An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting specific inputs or conditions that interact with Pyxel in a malicious way, leading to unintended and harmful outcomes. This is a direct threat stemming from the security of the Pyxel engine itself.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Code Execution** on the user's machine. Exploiting a Pyxel vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Pyxel application, directly compromising the user's system.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS)**. A vulnerability could be triggered to crash the Pyxel application, making it unavailable.
    *   **Information Disclosure**.  A vulnerability might allow an attacker to leak sensitive information from the application's memory or environment through Pyxel's functionalities.
*   **Pyxel Component Affected:** Core Pyxel library code, potentially dependencies like SDL2 or Python libraries used internally by Pyxel.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Pyxel updated to the latest version.** Regularly update Pyxel to benefit from security patches and bug fixes released by the Pyxel development team.
    *   **Monitor Pyxel project security advisories.** Stay informed about reported vulnerabilities and recommended updates by following the Pyxel project's communication channels (e.g., GitHub repository, mailing lists).
    *   **Consider static analysis tools.** Use static analysis tools to scan the Pyxel application code and potentially identify patterns that might indicate vulnerability exploitation or insecure Pyxel usage.
    *   **Report suspected Pyxel vulnerabilities.** If you discover a potential security vulnerability in Pyxel, responsibly report it to the Pyxel development team to allow for timely patching and mitigation for all users.
