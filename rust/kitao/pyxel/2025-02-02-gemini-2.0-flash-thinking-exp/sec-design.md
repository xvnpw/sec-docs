# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide an accessible and easy-to-use retro game engine for Python developers.
  - Enable the creation of pixel art style games with a focus on simplicity and fun.
  - Foster a community of game developers and retro game enthusiasts.
  - Offer a cross-platform solution for game development and deployment.

- Business Risks:
  - Reputation damage due to security vulnerabilities in the engine, potentially affecting games built with it.
  - Limited adoption if the engine is perceived as unreliable or difficult to use.
  - Lack of community support if the project is not actively maintained or lacks documentation.
  - Potential for compatibility issues across different operating systems and Python versions.
  - Risk of supply chain attacks if dependencies are compromised.
  - For companies using pyxel in commercial projects, risks associated with vulnerabilities in games impacting their users and brand.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Open Source Code - The source code is publicly available on GitHub, allowing for community review and potential identification of vulnerabilities. (Implemented: GitHub Repository)
  - security control: Standard Python Security Practices - Pyxel is built using Python, benefiting from general Python security best practices and ecosystem security tools. (Implemented: Python Language Ecosystem)
  - accepted risk: Limited Formal Security Audits - As an open-source project, dedicated security audits might not be regularly performed.
  - accepted risk: Community-Driven Security - Security relies on community contributions and the maintainer's responsiveness to reported issues.
  - accepted risk: Dependency Vulnerabilities - Pyxel depends on external Python libraries, which might have their own vulnerabilities.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement Automated Security Scanning - Integrate SAST (Static Application Security Testing) and dependency scanning tools into the development and build process to automatically detect potential vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Establish Vulnerability Reporting Process - Create a clear process for users and developers to report security vulnerabilities, including a dedicated security contact and a defined response plan.
  - security control: Provide Security Guidelines for Game Developers - Offer documentation and best practices for developers using Pyxel to build games securely, especially regarding input validation and data handling.
  - security control: Regularly Update Dependencies - Keep dependencies up to date to patch known vulnerabilities in underlying libraries.
  - security control: Code Review Process - Implement a code review process for contributions, with a focus on identifying potential security issues.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to the Pyxel engine itself. Authentication requirements would be relevant for games built using Pyxel if they require user accounts or online features.
  - Authorization: Similar to authentication, authorization is primarily relevant for games built with Pyxel that need to control access to features or data based on user roles or permissions.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Pyxel engine should handle various input types (keyboard, mouse, gamepad, audio, file inputs) robustly and prevent crashes or unexpected behavior due to malformed input.
    - Requirement: Games built with Pyxel must implement input validation to protect against injection attacks and ensure data integrity, especially when handling user-provided data.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: If games built with Pyxel require secure communication (e.g., online multiplayer) or data storage (e.g., save games with sensitive information), they should utilize appropriate cryptographic libraries and practices. Pyxel engine itself might not directly require cryptography, but should not hinder its use in games.

```

- Build Process Description:
  - Developer writes code and creates game assets on their local machine.
  - Code and assets are committed to a local Git repository.
  - Changes are pushed to a remote Git repository (e.g., GitHub).
  - Pushing to the remote repository triggers a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions).
  - The CI/CD system fetches the code and necessary dependencies into a build environment.
  - Security checks are performed in the build environment, including SAST (Static Application Security Testing) and linters to identify potential vulnerabilities and code quality issues.
  - The code is compiled and packaged into build artifacts (e.g., executables for different platforms, Python packages).
  - Build artifacts are signed using code signing certificates to ensure integrity and authenticity.
  - Signed build artifacts are published to distribution channels, such as GitHub Releases for binaries and PyPI for Python packages.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Maintaining the integrity and availability of the Pyxel engine and related tools.
  - Protecting the reputation of the Pyxel project and its maintainers.
  - Ensuring the security and reliability of games built using Pyxel (indirectly, but important for community trust).
  - Secure distribution of Pyxel library and editor to prevent supply chain attacks.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Pyxel Source Code: High sensitivity - Confidentiality and integrity are crucial to prevent unauthorized modifications or exposure of vulnerabilities.
  - Build Artifacts (Pyxel Library, Editor, Examples): Medium sensitivity - Integrity is important to ensure users download legitimate and untampered software. Availability is also important for users to access the engine.
  - Game Assets Created with Pyxel (by users): Sensitivity depends on the game and user. For Pyxel project itself, less sensitive, but for game developers, their assets are valuable IP.
  - User Data (Potentially in games built with Pyxel): Sensitivity depends entirely on the game. Could range from low (no user data) to high (personal or sensitive user information). Pyxel engine itself does not handle user data, but games built with it might.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- BUSINESS POSTURE:
  - Question: Is Pyxel primarily intended for hobbyist game developers or is there a target audience of professional/commercial game developers?
  - Assumption: Primarily for hobbyist and indie game developers, but could be used for educational purposes or rapid prototyping in commercial settings.
  - Question: Are there any specific business goals related to community growth or monetization for the Pyxel project itself?
  - Assumption: Focus is on community growth and providing a valuable free tool, rather than direct monetization of the Pyxel engine itself.

- SECURITY POSTURE:
  - Question: Are there any existing security guidelines or documentation for Pyxel developers?
  - Assumption: Limited formal security documentation exists currently.
  - Question: Is there a designated security contact or process for reporting vulnerabilities in Pyxel?
  - Assumption: Security vulnerability reporting is likely handled through general issue reporting channels on GitHub.
  - Question: What is the tolerance for security risks in the Pyxel project? (Startup vs. Fortune 500 context)
  - Assumption: As an open-source hobby project, risk tolerance might be higher than a Fortune 500 company, but maintaining a secure and reliable engine is still important for community trust and adoption.

- DESIGN:
  - Question: What is the intended scope of this design document - is it focused solely on the Pyxel engine itself, or also encompassing games built with Pyxel?
  - Assumption: Primarily focused on the Pyxel engine (library and editor) and its build/deployment processes. Security considerations for games built with Pyxel are addressed at a high level.
  - Question: What are the key dependencies of Pyxel, and are there plans to minimize or manage these dependencies for security and stability?
  - Assumption: Pyxel relies on standard Python libraries. Dependency management and updates are important for maintaining security.
  - Question: What are the typical deployment scenarios for games built with Pyxel?
  - Assumption: Primarily desktop applications for Windows, macOS, and Linux, with potential for web-based deployment. Mobile deployment is less common.
