# Attack Surface Analysis for kitao/pyxel

## Attack Surface: [Malicious `.pyxres` Resource Files](./attack_surfaces/malicious___pyxres__resource_files.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in Pyxel's parsing of `.pyxres` resource files to achieve code execution, denial of service, or memory corruption.
*   **Pyxel Contribution:** Pyxel's core functionality includes loading and parsing `.pyxres` files for game assets. Vulnerabilities in this parsing logic are directly attributable to Pyxel.
*   **Example:** A specially crafted `.pyxres` file contains a malformed image header that triggers a buffer overflow in Pyxel's image loading routine. This overflow allows an attacker to overwrite memory and potentially execute arbitrary code when the application loads this resource file.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Code Execution
    *   Denial of Service (DoS)
    *   Memory Corruption
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement rigorous validation of the `.pyxres` file format and its contents before parsing. This includes checking file structure, data types, and sizes against expected values.
        *   **Secure Parsing Libraries (Backend):**  Within Pyxel's C/C++ backend, utilize well-vetted and security-focused libraries for parsing resource file formats. Avoid custom parsing logic where possible, or subject custom logic to extensive security review.
        *   **Robust Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling during `.pyxres` file loading to gracefully manage malformed files and prevent crashes. Ensure error handling does not expose sensitive information.
        *   **Resource Limits and Sandboxing:** Enforce limits on resource sizes within `.pyxres` files to prevent resource exhaustion DoS attacks. Consider sandboxing the resource loading and parsing process to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Users:**
        *   **Trusted Sources Only:**  Load `.pyxres` files exclusively from trusted and verified sources. Avoid using resource files from unknown or untrusted origins.
        *   **System Security:** Maintain up-to-date antivirus and operating system security patches, which may offer some protection against exploitation of underlying vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Image and Sound Decoding Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/image_and_sound_decoding_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities within Pyxel's image and sound decoding processes to achieve code execution, denial of service, or memory corruption.
*   **Pyxel Contribution:** Pyxel relies on image and sound decoding to render graphics and play audio. Vulnerabilities in these decoding mechanisms are inherent to Pyxel's functionality.
*   **Example:** A PNG image loaded by Pyxel contains a crafted chunk that triggers a heap buffer overflow in the PNG decoding library or custom routine used by Pyxel. This overflow can be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Pyxel application.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Code Execution
    *   Denial of Service (DoS)
    *   Memory Corruption
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Utilize Secure and Updated Libraries:** Employ well-established, actively maintained, and security-audited image and sound decoding libraries. Keep these libraries updated to patch known vulnerabilities promptly.
        *   **Input Sanitization and Validation:** Implement input sanitization and validation for image and sound data *before* passing it to decoding libraries. Verify file headers and basic structure to reject obviously malformed files early.
        *   **Fuzzing and Security Testing:** Conduct regular fuzzing and security testing of Pyxel's image and sound decoding routines to proactively identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
        *   **Sandboxing/Isolation (Backend):** Consider sandboxing or isolating the decoding processes within Pyxel's backend to limit the potential impact of vulnerabilities.
    *   **Users:**
        *   **Trusted Media Sources:** Use image and sound files only from trusted and reputable sources. Be cautious about using media from unknown or untrusted websites or individuals.
        *   **System Updates:** Ensure your operating system and security software are up-to-date, as these updates often include patches for underlying image and sound decoding libraries used by applications.

## Attack Surface: [Python/C++ Binding Issues (Memory Management and Type Safety)](./attack_surfaces/pythonc++_binding_issues__memory_management_and_type_safety_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from memory management errors or type safety issues in the interface between Pyxel's Python bindings and its C/C++ backend, potentially leading to memory corruption or unexpected behavior.
*   **Pyxel Contribution:** Pyxel's architecture, which combines a performance-critical C/C++ backend with a user-friendly Python API, inherently introduces complexity in managing data and memory across these language boundaries. Errors in this interface are directly related to Pyxel's design.
*   **Example:** A memory leak exists in the C/C++ backend that is triggered when a specific Pyxel API function is called repeatedly from Python. This repeated invocation leads to memory exhaustion and eventually crashes the application. In a more severe scenario, incorrect type handling across the binding could lead to memory corruption exploitable for code execution.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Memory Leaks
    *   Memory Corruption
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) due to memory exhaustion
    *   Potentially Code Execution (in severe memory corruption cases)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Rigorous Testing of Bindings:** Conduct thorough testing specifically focused on the Python/C++ binding interface, paying close attention to memory management, data type conversions, and error handling across the language boundary.
        *   **Memory Safety Tools (Development):** Utilize memory safety analysis tools (e.g., Valgrind, AddressSanitizer) during Pyxel development and continuous integration to automatically detect memory errors in the C/C++ backend and bindings.
        *   **Code Reviews with Binding Focus:** Perform code reviews specifically targeting the C/C++ backend and Python binding code, looking for potential memory management issues, type mismatches, and insecure API design.
        *   **Clear and Secure API Design:** Design the Python API to be robust and minimize the potential for developers to misuse it in ways that could expose backend vulnerabilities. Provide comprehensive and accurate API documentation.
    *   **Users:**
        *   **Keep Pyxel Updated:** Ensure you are using the latest version of Pyxel to benefit from bug fixes and security patches in the backend and bindings.
        *   **Report Issues:** If you encounter unexpected behavior, crashes, or memory-related problems while using Pyxel, report these issues to the Pyxel developers. User reports are crucial for identifying and fixing underlying vulnerabilities.
