## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Pyxel Library Vulnerabilities (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_pyxel_library_vulnerabilities__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Targeting vulnerabilities directly within the Pyxel library code itself.
    *   Exploiting weaknesses in how Pyxel handles data or interacts with the underlying system.
    *   Focusing on areas of Pyxel code that are complex, less tested, or handle external inputs.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. Input Manipulation Vulnerabilities (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__input_manipulation_vulnerabilities__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Providing unexpected, malformed, or excessively large inputs to Pyxel API functions.
    *   Specifically targeting text input, coordinate inputs, and any API that processes external data.
    *   Aiming to trigger buffer overflows, crashes, or unexpected behavior through crafted inputs.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1. Malformed Input to Pyxel API (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1__malformed_input_to_pyxel_api__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **1.1.1.1. Send excessively long strings to text input functions (High-Risk Path):**
        *   Attackers send strings exceeding expected buffer sizes to Pyxel functions that handle text input (e.g., drawing text, text input fields if implemented).
        *   This can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities if Pyxel doesn't properly validate string lengths.
    *   **1.1.1.2. Provide out-of-bounds coordinates to drawing or input functions (High-Risk Path):**
        *   Attackers supply negative, extremely large, or otherwise invalid coordinate values to Pyxel drawing functions (e.g., `pyxel.blt`, `pyxel.rect`) or input handling functions.
        *   This can cause crashes, unexpected drawing behavior, or potentially memory access issues if coordinate validation is insufficient.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.1. Send excessively long strings to text input functions (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_1__send_excessively_long_strings_to_text_input_functions__high-risk_path_.md)

    *   This can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities if Pyxel doesn't properly validate string lengths.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.2. Provide out-of-bounds coordinates to drawing or input functions (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_2__provide_out-of-bounds_coordinates_to_drawing_or_input_functions__high-risk_path_.md)

*   Attackers supply negative, extremely large, or otherwise invalid coordinate values to Pyxel drawing functions (e.g., `pyxel.blt`, `pyxel.rect`) or input handling functions.
    *   This can cause crashes, unexpected drawing behavior, or potentially memory access issues if coordinate validation is insufficient.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2. Asset Loading Vulnerabilities (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1_2__asset_loading_vulnerabilities__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **1.2.1.1. Replace legitimate game assets (images, sounds) with malicious files (High-Risk Path):**
        *   Attackers attempt to substitute original game assets with modified or malicious files.
        *   If the application loads assets from untrusted sources or lacks integrity checks, attackers can inject malicious assets.
        *   Malicious assets could be crafted to exploit vulnerabilities in image/sound decoding libraries or to alter game behavior in unintended ways.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1.1. Replace legitimate game assets (images, sounds) with malicious files (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_1__replace_legitimate_game_assets__images__sounds__with_malicious_files__high-risk_path_.md)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3. API Abuse/Unexpected Behavior (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1_3__api_abuseunexpected_behavior__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Calling Pyxel API functions in sequences or with parameters that are not intended or tested by developers.
    *   Exploiting state dependencies or error handling weaknesses in the Pyxel API.
    *   Aiming to trigger crashes, exceptions, or resource exhaustion through unusual API usage patterns.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.1. Call Pyxel APIs in unexpected sequences or with invalid parameters (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_1__call_pyxel_apis_in_unexpected_sequences_or_with_invalid_parameters__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **1.3.1.1. Trigger crashes or exceptions by calling APIs out of order (High-Risk Path):**
        *   Attackers call Pyxel API functions in an illogical or out-of-sequence order, violating expected API usage patterns.
        *   This can expose state management issues or error handling flaws within Pyxel, leading to crashes or exceptions.
    *   **1.3.1.2. Cause resource exhaustion by rapidly calling resource-intensive APIs (High-Risk Path):**
        *   Attackers rapidly and repeatedly call Pyxel APIs that consume significant resources (e.g., creating sprites, sounds, large images).
        *   This can lead to memory exhaustion, performance degradation, and potentially denial of service if Pyxel lacks resource limits or throttling.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Application Logic Vulnerabilities (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_application_logic_vulnerabilities__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in the application code *built using Pyxel*, rather than Pyxel itself.
    *   Focusing on common web application security issues that developers might introduce when using Pyxel.
    *   This is less about Pyxel's inherent flaws and more about how developers use it insecurely.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1. Insecure Data Handling in Application Code (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/2_1__insecure_data_handling_in_application_code__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)
