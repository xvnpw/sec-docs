### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.2.1.1. Replace legitimate game assets (images, sounds) with malicious files

#### 4.1. Attack Description

This attack path describes a scenario where an attacker aims to compromise a Pyxel game by replacing its original image and sound assets with malicious versions. The goal is to inject harmful content or manipulate the game's behavior in unintended ways by substituting these core game components.

#### 4.2. Technical Details

**4.2.1. Attack Vector: Asset Replacement**

The core of this attack lies in the attacker's ability to substitute the legitimate asset files used by the Pyxel game with their own crafted malicious files. This can be achieved through various means, depending on how the game is distributed and how assets are loaded:

*   **Local File System Manipulation (Post-Installation):**
    *   If the game is distributed as standalone executables or packages that extract assets to a local directory, an attacker who gains access to the user's file system (e.g., through malware, social engineering, or physical access) could directly replace the asset files in the game's installation directory.
    *   This is particularly relevant if the game assets are stored in easily accessible locations without proper permissions or integrity checks.

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (During Download/Update):**
    *   If the game downloads assets from a remote server during installation or updates, an attacker performing a MitM attack could intercept the download process and replace the legitimate assets with malicious ones before they reach the user's machine.
    *   This is more likely if the asset download process is not secured with HTTPS and lacks integrity verification mechanisms.

*   **Compromised Distribution Channels:**
    *   If the attacker can compromise the distribution channel (e.g., a website hosting the game download, a game store platform), they could replace the legitimate game package with a modified version containing malicious assets.
    *   This is a high-impact attack but requires significant attacker resources and access.

**4.2.2. Exploitable Vulnerabilities and Lack of Security Measures:**

The success of this attack relies on the absence of security measures and potential vulnerabilities in the game's asset loading process:

*   **Loading Assets from Untrusted Sources:**
    *   If the game is designed to load assets from external or user-defined locations without proper validation, attackers could trick the game into loading malicious assets from attacker-controlled sources. This is less common in typical game distribution but could be relevant in modding scenarios or poorly designed update mechanisms.

*   **Lack of Integrity Checks:**
    *   **No Digital Signatures or Checksums:** If the game does not verify the integrity of asset files using digital signatures or checksums, it will be unable to detect if assets have been tampered with or replaced.
    *   **Insufficient File Type Validation:**  If the game relies solely on file extensions or basic header checks to identify asset types, attackers could potentially disguise malicious files as legitimate image or sound files.

*   **Vulnerabilities in Image/Sound Decoding Libraries:**
    *   Pyxel, while providing its own API, might rely on underlying libraries or OS-level codecs for image and sound decoding. These libraries can have vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, format string bugs, integer overflows) that could be exploited by crafted malicious assets.
    *   An attacker could create specially crafted image or sound files that, when processed by the decoding library, trigger a vulnerability leading to code execution or other malicious outcomes.

*   **Unintended Game Behavior through Asset Manipulation:**
    *   Even without exploiting library vulnerabilities, attackers can manipulate game behavior by altering asset content.
    *   **Visual Exploits:** Replacing sprites or tile sets with misleading or offensive images, or images that obscure gameplay elements.
    *   **Audio Cues Manipulation:** Replacing sound effects or music to disrupt gameplay, provide misleading information, or inject unwanted audio content.
    *   **Data Embedding in Assets:**  While less direct, attackers could potentially embed malicious data within image or sound files that could be parsed or interpreted by the game logic in unintended ways, although this is less likely in typical Pyxel usage.

#### 4.3. Impact

The impact of successfully replacing legitimate game assets can range from minor annoyances to significant security risks:

*   **Game Disruption and User Experience Degradation:**
    *   **Visual Glitches and Errors:** Replaced images might be corrupted, incorrectly formatted, or visually jarring, disrupting the game's aesthetics and user experience.
    *   **Audio Issues:** Replaced sounds might be distorted, missing, or inappropriate, negatively impacting the game's atmosphere and feedback.
    *   **Gameplay Confusion:**  Maliciously altered sprites or backgrounds could make the game confusing or unplayable.

*   **Malicious Content Injection:**
    *   **Offensive or Inappropriate Content:** Attackers could inject offensive images, sounds, or messages into the game, damaging the game's reputation and potentially exposing users to harmful content.
    *   **Phishing or Social Engineering:**  Malicious assets could be designed to trick users into revealing personal information or performing actions that benefit the attacker.

*   **Exploitation of Vulnerabilities and System Compromise (High Risk):**
    *   **Code Execution:** If malicious assets exploit vulnerabilities in image/sound decoding libraries, attackers could potentially achieve arbitrary code execution on the user's system. This is the most severe impact, allowing attackers to install malware, steal data, or take complete control of the user's machine.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Malicious assets could be crafted to cause the game to crash or become unresponsive, leading to a denial of service for the user.

#### 4.4. Likelihood

The likelihood of this attack path depends on several factors:

*   **Game Distribution Method:** Games distributed through secure platforms with integrity checks are less vulnerable than games distributed through less secure channels.
*   **Developer Security Practices:**  Developers who implement proper asset integrity checks and secure asset loading mechanisms significantly reduce the likelihood of this attack.
*   **User Security Awareness:** Users who are cautious about downloading games from untrusted sources and maintain up-to-date security software are less likely to be affected by attacks relying on local file system manipulation.
*   **Complexity of Exploiting Decoding Libraries:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in image/sound decoding libraries can be complex and requires specialized skills, making this specific high-impact scenario less frequent than simpler asset replacement for disruption.

**Overall Likelihood:** While direct code execution through malicious assets might be less frequent, the risk of game disruption, malicious content injection, and user experience degradation through asset replacement is **moderate to high**, especially if developers do not implement adequate security measures.

#### 4.5. Mitigation Strategies

To mitigate the risk of asset replacement attacks, the following strategies should be implemented:

*   **Asset Integrity Checks:**
    *   **Digital Signatures:**  Sign all game assets using a digital signature. Verify these signatures during game loading to ensure assets have not been tampered with. This is the most robust approach but can be more complex to implement.
    *   **Checksums (Hashes):** Generate checksums (e.g., SHA-256) for all game assets and store them securely (e.g., within the game executable or a separate integrity file). Verify these checksums during game loading to detect any modifications. This is a simpler and effective approach.

*   **Secure Asset Loading Practices:**
    *   **Restrict Asset Loading Locations:**  Load assets only from trusted locations within the game's installation directory or secure data folders. Avoid loading assets from user-defined or external paths unless absolutely necessary and with strict validation.
    *   **File Type Validation:**  Implement robust file type validation beyond just file extensions. Verify file headers and magic numbers to ensure assets are of the expected type and format.

*   **Secure Distribution Channels:**
    *   **HTTPS for Downloads:**  If assets are downloaded from a remote server, use HTTPS to encrypt the communication and prevent MitM attacks.
    *   **Reputable Distribution Platforms:**  Distribute the game through reputable platforms (e.g., established game stores) that have their own security measures and integrity checks.

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization (Indirect Mitigation):**
    *   While not directly related to asset replacement, robust input validation and sanitization throughout the game can help prevent exploitation of vulnerabilities that might be triggered by malicious asset content.

*   **Keep Libraries Updated:**
    *   Ensure that any underlying image and sound decoding libraries used by Pyxel or the game development environment are kept up-to-date with the latest security patches to minimize the risk of known vulnerabilities.

*   **Code Reviews and Security Testing:**
    *   Conduct regular code reviews and security testing, specifically focusing on asset loading and handling routines, to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

*   **User Education (Limited Mitigation):**
    *   While less effective as a primary defense, educating users about the risks of downloading games from untrusted sources can contribute to overall security.

**Recommended Mitigation for Pyxel Games (Practical and Effective):**

For Pyxel games, implementing **checksum-based asset integrity checks** is a practical and effective mitigation strategy. This can be achieved by:

1.  **Generating checksums** for all image and sound assets during the game build process.
2.  **Storing these checksums** in a secure location within the game files (e.g., a dedicated data file or embedded in the executable).
3.  **Implementing a verification routine** at game startup that calculates the checksums of the loaded assets and compares them to the stored checksums.
4.  **If checksums do not match**, the game should display an error message and potentially refuse to load, preventing the use of tampered assets.

This approach provides a good balance between security and implementation complexity for Pyxel game development.

### 5. Conclusion

The attack path "Replace legitimate game assets (images, sounds) with malicious files" poses a real risk to Pyxel games. While the severity can vary, the potential for game disruption, malicious content injection, and even system compromise exists. By implementing robust mitigation strategies, particularly asset integrity checks using checksums, and following secure development practices, developers can significantly reduce the likelihood and impact of this attack, ensuring a safer and more trustworthy gaming experience for their users. This analysis provides a foundation for the development team to prioritize security measures and build more resilient Pyxel applications.
