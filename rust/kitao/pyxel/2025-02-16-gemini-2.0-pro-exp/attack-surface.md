# Attack Surface Analysis for kitao/pyxel

## Attack Surface: [Resource Loading (Path Traversal)](./attack_surfaces/resource_loading__path_traversal_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers attempt to load arbitrary files from the system using Pyxel's resource loading functions.
*   **How Pyxel Contributes:** Pyxel's `pyxel.image()`, `pyxel.sound()`, and `pyxel.tilemap()` functions are the *direct* mechanism for loading resources.  If these functions are used with unsanitized user-provided input for file paths, a path traversal attack is possible.  This is a *direct* consequence of how Pyxel is used.
*   **Example:** A game allows users to specify a custom image for their character profile.  An attacker provides a path like `"../../../../etc/passwd"` to the `pyxel.image()` function (indirectly, through the game's UI), attempting to read system files.
*   **Impact:** Disclosure of sensitive system files, potentially leading to further compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the accessible files and the operating system).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Strict Whitelisting:** *Never* load resources directly from user-provided paths.  Use a hardcoded whitelist of allowed resource names and load them from a fixed, trusted directory within the application's package. This is the *most important* mitigation.
        *   **Input Sanitization (if absolutely necessary, but strongly discouraged):** If user input *must* influence resource loading, implement *extremely* strict input sanitization and validation.  Reject any input containing path traversal characters (`..`, `/`, `\`) or suspicious file extensions.  This is *much less secure* than whitelisting.  A whitelist is *always* preferred.
        *   **Resource Integrity Checks:** While primarily useful for malformed files, verifying checksums *before* loading can add an extra layer of defense, even against path traversal (by detecting unexpected files).
    *   **Users:**
        *   **Download from Trusted Sources:** Only download Pyxel games from official sources (e.g., the developer's website, a reputable game distribution platform).

## Attack Surface: [Resource Loading (Malformed Files - Triggering Vulnerabilities in Underlying Libraries via Pyxel)](./attack_surfaces/resource_loading__malformed_files_-_triggering_vulnerabilities_in_underlying_libraries_via_pyxel_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers provide malformed resource files (images, sounds, tilemaps) to trigger vulnerabilities in the underlying libraries *used by Pyxel* (SDL2_image, SDL2_mixer).
*   **How Pyxel Contributes:** Pyxel's resource loading functions (`pyxel.image()`, `pyxel.sound()`, `pyxel.tilemap()`) are the *direct interface* through which these malformed files are passed to the vulnerable libraries.  Pyxel acts as the conduit for the attack.
*   **Example:** An attacker provides a specially crafted, corrupted `.png` file that exploits a known (or zero-day) vulnerability in SDL2_image.  The game, using `pyxel.image()` to load the file, triggers the vulnerability.
*   **Impact:**  Potential arbitrary code execution (though increasingly difficult with modern libraries and OS protections), denial of service (crash).
*   **Risk Severity:** High (potential for code execution, even if difficult).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Pyxel and *all* its dependencies (especially SDL2, SDL2_image, SDL2_mixer) up-to-date to incorporate security patches. This is *crucial*.
        *   **Fuzz Testing:** Fuzz test Pyxel's resource loading functions with a wide variety of malformed and corrupted files. This helps identify vulnerabilities *before* they are publicly disclosed.
        *   **Resource Integrity Checks:** Before loading a resource, verify its integrity using checksums. This helps detect *tampered* files, even if they aren't specifically crafted to exploit a known vulnerability.
    *   **Users:**
        *   **Download from Trusted Sources:** Only download Pyxel games from official sources.
        *   **Keep Software Updated:** Keep your operating system and any relevant software (like graphics drivers) up-to-date.
