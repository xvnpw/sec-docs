# Threat Model Analysis for kitao/pyxel

## Threat: [Resource Spoofing/Replacement (Direct Pyxel Loading)](./threats/resource_spoofingreplacement__direct_pyxel_loading_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker replaces legitimate Pyxel resource files (`.pyxel` files, image files, sound files) that are loaded *directly* by Pyxel's `pyxel.load()` function. This bypasses any external loading mechanisms or wrappers. The attacker achieves this by modifying the application's distribution, compromising a network share (if resources are loaded from there), or exploiting a file system vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Display of malicious or inappropriate content (images, sounds).
        *   Execution of altered game logic (due to modified tilemaps, sound events, or other data within the `.pyxel` file).
        *   Potential crashes or instability if the replacement files are malformed.
        *   *Highly Unlikely, but Theoretically Possible:* If a severe vulnerability existed in Pyxel's resource parsing code (e.g., a buffer overflow in the image decoder), a carefully crafted malicious resource file *could* potentially lead to arbitrary code execution. This is extremely improbable in a well-maintained library like Pyxel, but it's the theoretical worst-case scenario for any software that processes external data.
    *   **Pyxel Component Affected:**
        *   `pyxel.load()`: The core function for loading `.pyxel` resource files. This is the *direct* point of attack.
        *   `pyxel.image()`: Used internally by `pyxel.load()` to handle image data.
        *   `pyxel.tilemap()`: Used internally by `pyxel.load()` to handle tilemap data.
        *   `pyxel.sound()`: Used internally by `pyxel.load()` to handle sound data.
        *   `pyxel.play()`, `pyxel.playm()`: Used to play sounds and music loaded via `pyxel.load()`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (especially if resources are loaded from untrusted locations or if the distribution mechanism is weak).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Checksum Validation (Crucial):** Before calling `pyxel.load()`, calculate a cryptographic hash (e.g., SHA-256) of the resource file. Compare this hash to a known-good hash that is securely stored within the application code (or in a separate, digitally signed file). *Reject* the file if the hashes do not match. This is the *primary* defense against resource spoofing.
        *   **Secure Packaging (Essential):** Use a packaging tool (PyInstaller, Nuitka, etc.) to bundle the resource files *directly* into the executable or a secure, self-contained archive. This makes it significantly harder for an attacker to tamper with the resources without modifying the entire application, which is more likely to be detected.
        *   **Digital Signatures (Strongly Recommended):** Digitally sign the application executable (and/or the resource archive, if separate). This allows users (and the operating system) to verify the integrity of the application and ensure it hasn't been tampered with.
        *   **Avoid External Resource Loading (If Possible):** The most secure approach is to *avoid* loading resources from external directories or network locations. If this is absolutely unavoidable, implement *strict* access controls and consider sandboxing (see below).
        *   **Sandboxing (If External Loading is Necessary):** If external resource loading is *unavoidable*, run the Pyxel application within a sandboxed environment (e.g., a container, a virtual machine, or using operating system-level sandboxing features). This limits the application's access to the file system and other system resources, reducing the impact of a potential compromise.

## Threat: [Code Injection via Malicious Resource (Theoretical, but Important to Acknowledge)](./threats/code_injection_via_malicious_resource__theoretical__but_important_to_acknowledge_.md)

* **Description:** This is a *highly unlikely* but theoretically possible scenario. If a vulnerability existed in Pyxel's internal resource parsing code (e.g., a buffer overflow in the image decoding logic within `pyxel.image()`, a format string vulnerability in how tilemap data is processed within `pyxel.tilemap()`, or a similar flaw in `pyxel.sound()`), an attacker *could* craft a specially designed resource file that exploits this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code when `pyxel.load()` is called.
    * **Impact:**
        *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker gains complete control over the application and potentially the underlying system, depending on the application's privileges. This is the worst-case scenario.
    * **Pyxel Component Affected:**
        *   `pyxel.load()`: The entry point for loading the malicious resource.
        *   Potentially any of the internal resource handling functions: `pyxel.image()`, `pyxel.tilemap()`, `pyxel.sound()`, depending on the specific vulnerability.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical (although the likelihood is very low).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Pyxel Updated (Paramount):** The *most important* mitigation is to always use the *latest stable version* of Pyxel. Security vulnerabilities are often discovered and patched in software updates. By keeping Pyxel up-to-date, you benefit from these fixes.
        *   **Input Validation (Indirectly Relevant):** While this threat focuses on vulnerabilities *within* Pyxel, robust input validation in your *own* code can help prevent scenarios where user-provided data might influence which resources are loaded, reducing the attack surface.
        *   **Sandboxing (Highly Recommended):** Running the Pyxel application in a sandboxed environment (as described above) is a *crucial* mitigation for this type of threat. Even if arbitrary code execution is achieved, the sandbox limits the attacker's ability to interact with the rest of the system.
        *   **Avoid Custom Pyxel Forks (Unless Expert):** Do *not* use custom or modified versions of Pyxel unless you are a security expert and have thoroughly audited the changes. Unofficial modifications could introduce new vulnerabilities.
        * **Fuzzing (For Pyxel Developers):** This mitigation is primarily for the *developers of Pyxel* itself. Fuzz testing (providing random or malformed data to the resource loading functions) can help identify potential vulnerabilities before they are exploited.
