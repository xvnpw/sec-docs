# Deep Analysis of Pyxel Application Attack Tree Path: Command Injection

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the potential for command injection vulnerabilities within a Pyxel application, specifically focusing on the attack path:  **3. Exploit Pyxel Input Handling -> 4. Unvalidated Input -> 4a. Command Injection [CN]**.  We aim to identify:

*   Specific code patterns within Pyxel applications that could lead to command injection.
*   Realistic scenarios where user input, even indirectly, might be used in system calls.
*   Mitigation strategies to prevent command injection vulnerabilities.
*   Testing methods to verify the absence (or presence) of this vulnerability.

## 2. Scope

This analysis is limited to Pyxel applications and the specific attack vector of command injection through unvalidated input used in system calls.  It does *not* cover:

*   Other types of input validation vulnerabilities (e.g., cross-site scripting, SQL injection â€“ irrelevant to Pyxel).
*   Vulnerabilities within the Pyxel library itself (we assume Pyxel is secure in its core functionality).
*   Attacks that do not involve command injection (e.g., denial-of-service, memory corruption).
*   Attacks on the underlying operating system or other software running on the same system (unless triggered by the command injection).

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Code Review (Static Analysis):**  We will examine hypothetical and, if available, real-world Pyxel application code to identify potential uses of `os.system()`, `subprocess.Popen()`, or similar functions that might involve user input.  We will focus on how Pyxel's input handling mechanisms (`pyxel.btn()`, `pyxel.btnp()`, `pyxel.mouse_x`, `pyxel.mouse_y`, etc.) could be connected to these system calls.
2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Testing):** We will construct test cases and, if possible, use a debugger to trace the flow of user input through the application.  This will help us understand how input might be manipulated to reach vulnerable code sections.
3.  **Threat Modeling:** We will consider realistic scenarios where an attacker might be able to influence the input that reaches a system call.
4.  **Mitigation Analysis:** We will identify and recommend specific coding practices and security measures to prevent command injection.
5.  **Documentation:**  The findings, recommendations, and testing procedures will be documented in this report.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 3 -> 4 -> 4a

**4a. Command Injection [CN]**

*   **Description:** (As stated in the original attack tree) This attack occurs if the Pyxel application uses user input (even indirectly) in system calls (e.g., `os.system()`, `subprocess.Popen()`) without proper sanitization. The attacker injects shell commands into the input, which are then executed by the operating system.

*   **Likelihood:** Very Low (Unlikely in a typical Pyxel game, but *critical* if present) - This is accurate.  Most Pyxel games are self-contained and don't need to interact with the operating system in a way that would expose them to command injection.  However, the "critical if present" caveat is crucial.

*   **Impact:** Very High (Arbitrary code execution with system privileges) - Correct.  Successful command injection grants the attacker the ability to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the Pyxel application. This could lead to data theft, system compromise, or even the installation of malware.

*   **Effort:** Low - Accurate.  Once a vulnerable input field is identified, crafting a command injection payload is often trivial.

*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate - This is a reasonable assessment.  The attacker needs to understand basic shell commands and how to craft them to exploit the specific vulnerability.

*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium - Correct.  If the vulnerability is obvious (e.g., a text input field directly used in `os.system()`), it's easy to detect.  However, if the input is processed or transformed before being used, detection can be more challenging.

**4.1.  Code Review (Static Analysis) - Identifying Potential Vulnerabilities**

Let's examine some hypothetical (but plausible) scenarios where a Pyxel application *might* be vulnerable:

**Scenario 1:  "High Score Saver" (Unlikely, but Illustrative)**

```python
import pyxel
import os

class App:
    def __init__(self):
        pyxel.init(160, 120, title="High Score Saver")
        self.username = ""
        self.score = 1000
        pyxel.run(self.update, self.draw)

    def update(self):
        if pyxel.btnp(pyxel.KEY_RETURN):
            # DANGEROUS:  Using user input directly in a system call!
            os.system(f"echo '{self.username} - {self.score}' >> highscores.txt")

    def draw(self):
        pyxel.cls(0)
        pyxel.text(10, 10, "Enter your username:", 7)
        pyxel.text(10, 20, self.username, 7)
        if pyxel.btn(pyxel.KEY_A):
            self.username += "A"
        # ... (other input handling for username) ...

App()
```

**Vulnerability:** The `os.system()` call in the `update()` function directly uses the `self.username` variable, which is populated by user input.  An attacker could enter a username like:  `"; rm -rf /; echo "Pwned`  This would result in the following command being executed:

```bash
echo ''; rm -rf /; echo "Pwned' - 1000 >> highscores.txt
```

This would (on a Unix-like system) attempt to delete the entire file system!  (The `echo ''` is to handle the intended output, and the rest is the malicious payload).

**Scenario 2:  "Level Editor" (More Plausible, Still Risky)**

```python
import pyxel
import subprocess

class App:
    def __init__(self):
        pyxel.init(256, 256, title="Level Editor")
        self.level_name = "level1"
        pyxel.run(self.update, self.draw)

    def update(self):
        if pyxel.btnp(pyxel.KEY_S):
            # DANGEROUS:  Using user-provided level name in a subprocess call.
            try:
                subprocess.run(["./level_validator", self.level_name], check=True, capture_output=True)
                pyxel.text(10, 50, "Level validated!", 7)
            except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
                pyxel.text(10, 50, f"Validation error: {e.stderr.decode()}", 8)

    def draw(self):
        pyxel.cls(0)
        pyxel.text(10, 10, "Enter level name:", 7)
        pyxel.text(10, 20, self.level_name, 7)
        if pyxel.btn(pyxel.KEY_L):
            self.level_name = pyxel.input_text(self.level_name, 10) # Hypothetical input_text function

App()
```

**Vulnerability:**  The `subprocess.run()` call uses `self.level_name`, which is controlled by the user.  An attacker could enter a level name like:  `level1; cat /etc/passwd`.  This would execute:

```bash
./level_validator level1; cat /etc/passwd
```

This would attempt to run the level validator (which might or might not exist) and then display the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file (containing user account information).

**Scenario 3: Indirect Input via Configuration File (Less Likely, but Possible)**
Imagine a game that loads settings from a configuration file, and the user can modify this file.
```python
#config.txt
command_to_run = "harmless_command"

#game.py
import pyxel
import os
import configparser

class App:
    def __init__(self):
        pyxel.init(160, 120)
        self.config = configparser.ConfigParser()
        self.config.read('config.txt')
        pyxel.run(self.update, self.draw)

    def update(self):
        if pyxel.btnp(pyxel.KEY_R):
            command = self.config['DEFAULT']['command_to_run']
            os.system(command) #VULNERABLE

    def draw(self):
        pyxel.cls(7)
        pyxel.text(55, 41, "Press R to run command", pyxel.COLOR_BLACK)

App()
```
If attacker can modify `config.txt` and change `command_to_run` to `rm -rf /*`, then pressing `R` will execute malicious command.

**4.2. Dynamic Analysis (Testing)**

To test for these vulnerabilities, we would:

1.  **Craft Payloads:** Create a series of input strings designed to trigger command injection.  Examples:
    *   `"; echo 'test' > test.txt; "`
    *   `& whoami &`
    *   `| ls -l |`
    *   (For Windows) `& dir &`
    *   (For Windows) `| dir |`

2.  **Input Injection:**  Use the application's interface to enter these payloads into any fields that might be used in system calls.

3.  **Observe Results:**  Carefully monitor the application's behavior and the system's state.  Look for:
    *   Unexpected files being created or modified.
    *   Unexpected output in the console or application window.
    *   System crashes or unexpected behavior.
    *   Evidence of commands being executed (e.g., the `test.txt` file being created in the first payload example).

4.  **Debugging (Optional):**  Use a debugger (like `pdb` in Python) to step through the code and observe the values of variables as the input is processed.  This can help pinpoint the exact location of the vulnerability.

**4.3. Threat Modeling**

Realistic threat scenarios are limited due to the nature of Pyxel games.  However, we can consider:

*   **Malicious Level Files:** If the game allows users to share or download level files, and the level loading process involves system calls using the level name or other data from the file, an attacker could create a malicious level file that triggers command injection.
*   **Modified Configuration Files:** As shown in Scenario 3, if the game reads settings from a user-modifiable configuration file, an attacker could modify the file to inject commands.
*   **Networked Games (Rare):**  If the game has a networking component (highly unlikely for a typical Pyxel game), and user input from the network is used in system calls, this could be a vector for attack.

**4.4. Mitigation Strategies**

The most important mitigation strategy is to **never directly use user input in system calls.**  Here are specific recommendations:

1.  **Avoid System Calls:**  The best approach is to avoid using `os.system()`, `subprocess.Popen()`, and similar functions altogether if possible.  Most Pyxel games should not need to interact with the operating system in this way.

2.  **Use Safe Alternatives:** If you *must* interact with the operating system, use safer alternatives whenever possible.  For example:
    *   Instead of `os.system("rm " + filename)`, use `os.remove(filename)`.
    *   Instead of `os.system("mkdir " + dirname)`, use `os.makedirs(dirname, exist_ok=True)`.
    *   Use the `shutil` module for file operations (e.g., `shutil.copy()`, `shutil.move()`).

3.  **Whitelist Input:** If you must use user input in a system call, strictly validate it against a whitelist of allowed values.  For example, if the user is selecting a file from a list, ensure that the selected value is actually in the list.

    ```python
    allowed_files = ["level1.txt", "level2.txt", "level3.txt"]
    if user_selected_file in allowed_files:
        # It's (relatively) safe to use user_selected_file in a system call.
        pass
    else:
        # Handle the error - the user selected an invalid file.
        pass
    ```

4.  **Escape Input (Least Preferred):**  If you *absolutely must* use user input directly in a system call, and you cannot use a whitelist, you *must* properly escape the input to prevent command injection.  However, this is error-prone and should be avoided if possible.  The `shlex.quote()` function can be used for this purpose (on Unix-like systems).  For Windows, escaping is more complex and requires careful consideration of the specific command being executed.

    ```python
    import shlex
    import os

    # ... (get user_input) ...

    # Escape the input using shlex.quote()
    escaped_input = shlex.quote(user_input)

    # Use the escaped input in the system call
    os.system("some_command " + escaped_input)
    ```
    **Important Note on Escaping:** Escaping is a last resort. It's easy to make mistakes, and new vulnerabilities can be introduced if the escaping is not done correctly. Whitelisting or using safe alternatives is always preferred.

5. **Use subprocess with arguments list:**
    ```python
        subprocess.run(["command", arg1, arg2]) # Safe
        subprocess.run(f"command {arg1} {arg2}", shell=True) # DANGEROUS
    ```
    Pass arguments as list of strings.

## 5. Conclusion

Command injection is a serious vulnerability that can have devastating consequences.  While unlikely in a typical Pyxel game, it's crucial to be aware of the risk and to take steps to prevent it.  By avoiding unnecessary system calls, using safe alternatives, whitelisting input, and (as a last resort) properly escaping input, developers can significantly reduce the risk of command injection vulnerabilities in their Pyxel applications.  Thorough code review and testing are essential to ensure that these mitigations are effective.
