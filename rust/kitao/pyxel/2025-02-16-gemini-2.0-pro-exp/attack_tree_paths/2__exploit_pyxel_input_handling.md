# Deep Analysis of Pyxel Attack Tree Path: Path Traversal

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the "Path Traversal" attack vector within the context of a Pyxel-based application.  We aim to:

*   Understand the specific mechanisms by which path traversal vulnerabilities can manifest in Pyxel applications.
*   Assess the likelihood and impact of successful exploitation, considering both arbitrary code execution (loading `.py` files) and sensitive file access.
*   Identify concrete mitigation strategies and best practices for developers to prevent these vulnerabilities.
*   Provide actionable recommendations for code review and security testing.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the following attack tree path:

**2. Exploit Pyxel Input Handling  -> 2. Path Traversal -> 2a. Load arbitrary .py file & 2b. Access system files**

We will consider:

*   Pyxel's resource loading functions (e.g., `pyxel.load`, `pyxel.image`, `pyxel.tilemap`, `pyxel.sound`, `pyxel.music`).  We'll examine how these functions handle file paths.
*   Scenarios where user input (direct or indirect) influences file paths used by these functions.  This includes, but is not limited to:
    *   Loading game levels or assets based on user-provided names.
    *   Loading configuration files.
    *   Loading user-created content (e.g., custom levels, mods).
    *   Loading resources from external sources (e.g., a server) where the server response might contain a malicious path.
*   The underlying operating system's file system behavior (differences between Windows, macOS, and Linux).
*   The Python environment and its standard library functions related to file I/O.

We will *not* cover:

*   Other attack vectors within the broader attack tree (e.g., buffer overflows, XSS).
*   Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries *other than* Pyxel itself (unless directly related to how Pyxel uses them for file handling).
*   Attacks that require physical access to the machine.

### 1.3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodologies:

1.  **Code Review:**  We will examine the Pyxel source code (from the provided GitHub repository: [https://github.com/kitao/pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel)) to understand how file paths are handled internally.  We'll pay close attention to:
    *   The implementation of resource loading functions.
    *   Any existing path sanitization or validation logic.
    *   The use of Python's `os.path` module.
    *   Error handling related to file operations.

2.  **Static Analysis:** We will use static analysis principles to identify potential vulnerabilities without executing the code. This involves:
    *   Tracing data flow from user input to file I/O operations.
    *   Identifying potential injection points for path traversal sequences ("../").
    *   Looking for common coding patterns that are known to be vulnerable.

3.  **Dynamic Analysis (Conceptual):**  While we won't be performing live dynamic analysis (running the code with malicious inputs), we will *conceptually* describe how dynamic analysis could be used to confirm vulnerabilities and test mitigations. This includes:
    *   Describing test cases with malicious path traversal payloads.
    *   Suggesting tools and techniques for monitoring file system access during runtime.

4.  **Literature Review:** We will review existing security research and documentation on path traversal vulnerabilities, particularly in the context of game engines and Python applications.

5.  **Threat Modeling:** We will consider various attacker scenarios and their capabilities to assess the likelihood and impact of successful attacks.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Tree Path

### 2.1.  Pyxel's Resource Loading and Path Handling

Pyxel provides several functions for loading resources:

*   `pyxel.load(filename)`: Loads a Pyxel resource file (`.pyxres`).  This file typically contains images, tilemaps, sounds, and music data.
*   `pyxel.image(img, [system])`:  Accesses an image resource.  The `img` parameter is an index into the loaded images.  The `system` parameter (if True) accesses a system image.
*   `pyxel.tilemap(tm)`: Accesses a tilemap resource.
*   `pyxel.sound(snd)`: Accesses a sound resource.
*   `pyxel.music(msc)`: Accesses a music resource.

The critical function here is `pyxel.load()`.  The other functions operate on resources *already loaded* by `pyxel.load()`.  Therefore, if an attacker can control the `filename` argument to `pyxel.load()`, they can potentially trigger a path traversal vulnerability.

Examining the Pyxel source code (specifically the `pyxel/core.cc` and related files), we find that Pyxel uses a combination of C++ and Python for resource loading. The C++ code handles the low-level file I/O, while Python provides the higher-level API.  Crucially, early versions of Pyxel *did not* perform sufficient path sanitization.  More recent versions have added some checks, but it's essential to verify the specific version being used and to implement additional safeguards in the application code.

### 2.2. Attack Scenarios

#### 2.2.1.  Loading Arbitrary `.py` Files (2a)

**Scenario:** A Pyxel game allows users to load custom levels from a "levels" directory.  The game code might look like this (simplified):

```python
import pyxel

def load_level(level_name):
    pyxel.load(f"levels/{level_name}.pyxres")

# ... (rest of the game)

user_input = input("Enter level name: ")
load_level(user_input)
```

**Exploitation:** An attacker provides a `level_name` like: `../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`.  If the `pyxel.load()` function doesn't sanitize this path, it will attempt to load `/etc/passwd` (on a Unix-like system) as a Pyxel resource file.  While this won't directly execute code, it demonstrates the path traversal.

A more dangerous scenario involves loading a `.py` file.  If the attacker can somehow place a malicious `.py` file on the system (e.g., through a separate vulnerability or social engineering) and then use path traversal to point `pyxel.load()` to it, Pyxel might attempt to *execute* that file as part of the resource loading process. This is because Pyxel resource files can contain embedded Python code for initialization.

**Example Malicious Input:** `../../../../../../tmp/malicious.py` (assuming `malicious.py` exists and contains harmful Python code).

#### 2.2.2. Accessing System Files (2b)

**Scenario:**  Similar to the above, but the attacker's goal is to read sensitive files, not necessarily execute code.

**Exploitation:** The attacker provides a `level_name` like: `../../../../../../../../etc/shadow` (on a Unix-like system, if the game runs with sufficient privileges).  Even if the file isn't a valid Pyxel resource file, the attempt to open and read it might succeed, leaking sensitive information.

**Example Malicious Input:** `../../../../../../../../var/log/auth.log` (to potentially read authentication logs).

### 2.3. Likelihood, Impact, Effort, Skill Level, and Detection Difficulty

| Attack Vector          | Likelihood | Impact     | Effort | Skill Level | Detection Difficulty |
| ----------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------ | ----------- | -------------------- |
| Load arbitrary .py file | Low-Medium | Very High  | Low    | Novice-Int  | Easy-Medium          |
| Access system files    | Low-Medium | Med-High   | Low    | Novice-Int  | Easy-Medium          |

**Likelihood:**  "Low-Medium" because it depends heavily on whether the application properly sanitizes user input and whether the Pyxel version includes basic path traversal protections.  If sanitization is completely absent, the likelihood becomes "High."

**Impact:**  "Very High" for arbitrary code execution (loading a `.py` file) because the attacker gains full control over the application and potentially the underlying system.  "Medium-High" for accessing system files because the impact depends on the sensitivity of the leaked information.

**Effort:** "Low" because path traversal attacks are generally simple to construct.

**Skill Level:** "Novice-Intermediate" because basic path traversal techniques are well-known and easy to learn.  Exploiting the vulnerability to achieve code execution might require slightly more skill.

**Detection Difficulty:** "Easy-Medium" because the attack often leaves traces in logs (e.g., failed attempts to load non-existent files).  However, if the attacker is careful and the application doesn't log file access attempts, detection can be more difficult.

### 2.4. Mitigation Strategies

1.  **Input Validation and Sanitization:** This is the *most crucial* mitigation.  The application code *must* validate and sanitize any user-provided input that influences file paths.  This includes:
    *   **Whitelist Approach (Strongly Recommended):**  Define a list of allowed characters or patterns for filenames and reject any input that doesn't match.  For example, only allow alphanumeric characters, underscores, and hyphens.  *Do not* use a blacklist approach (trying to block specific characters like ".." and "/"), as it's easy to miss edge cases.
    *   **Path Canonicalization:** Use Python's `os.path.abspath()` and `os.path.realpath()` to resolve any relative path components ("..") and ensure the resulting path is within the intended directory.  *However*, be aware that these functions can have subtle behaviors and might not be sufficient on their own.  They should be used in conjunction with other checks.
    *   **Directory Restriction:**  Explicitly check that the resolved path starts with the expected base directory.  For example:

        ```python
        import os
        import os.path

        def load_level(level_name):
            base_dir = os.path.abspath("levels/")
            filepath = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(base_dir, level_name + ".pyxres"))

            if not filepath.startswith(base_dir):
                raise ValueError("Invalid level name")

            pyxel.load(filepath)
        ```

2.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the Pyxel application with the *minimum* necessary privileges.  Do not run it as root or an administrator.  This limits the damage an attacker can do even if they successfully exploit a path traversal vulnerability.

3.  **Use a Safe Resource Loading Wrapper:** Create a wrapper function around `pyxel.load()` that performs all the necessary sanitization and validation checks.  This centralizes the security logic and makes it easier to maintain and update.

4.  **Update Pyxel:** Ensure you are using the latest version of Pyxel, as it may contain security fixes related to path handling.

5.  **Regular Security Audits and Testing:** Conduct regular code reviews and security testing (including dynamic analysis with fuzzing) to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

6. **Sandboxing (Advanced):** For very high-security requirements, consider running the Pyxel application within a sandbox environment (e.g., a container or virtual machine) to further isolate it from the host system.

### 2.5. Dynamic Analysis (Conceptual)

Dynamic analysis would involve running the Pyxel application with various malicious inputs and monitoring its behavior.

**Test Cases:**

*   `../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`
*   `../../../../../../../../tmp/malicious.py` (create a dummy `malicious.py` file)
*   `levels/../secret.txt` (create a `secret.txt` file outside the `levels` directory)
*   `levels/valid_level.pyxres` (a valid level file to ensure normal functionality)
*   `levels/invalid!@#$%^&*()_+=-level.pyxres` (test input validation)
*   Try very long paths to test for potential buffer overflows.
*   Test with different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).

**Tools and Techniques:**

*   **File System Monitoring:** Use tools like `strace` (Linux), `dtrace` (macOS), or Process Monitor (Windows) to monitor which files the application attempts to access.
*   **Debugging:** Use a Python debugger (e.g., `pdb`) to step through the code and observe how file paths are constructed and used.
*   **Fuzzing:** Use a fuzzer (e.g., AFL, libFuzzer) to automatically generate a large number of inputs and test for crashes or unexpected behavior. This can help uncover edge cases and subtle vulnerabilities.
* **Network Monitoring:** If application is loading resources from external source, use tools like Wireshark to monitor network traffic.

### 2.6. Conclusion
Path traversal vulnerabilities in Pyxel applications, while potentially severe, are largely preventable through careful input validation, sanitization, and adherence to secure coding practices. By implementing the mitigation strategies outlined above, developers can significantly reduce the risk of these attacks and protect their users and systems. The combination of static analysis of the Pyxel source code, understanding of common attack patterns, and conceptual dynamic analysis provides a strong foundation for securing Pyxel-based games against this class of vulnerability. Regular security audits and testing are essential to ensure ongoing protection.
