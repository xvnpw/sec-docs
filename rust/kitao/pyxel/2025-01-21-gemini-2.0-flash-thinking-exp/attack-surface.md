# Attack Surface Analysis for kitao/pyxel

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Asset Loading](./attack_surfaces/malicious_asset_loading.md)

*   **Description:** The application loads external image, sound, or music files using Pyxel's loading functions without proper validation of the file content.
    *   **How Pyxel Contributes:** Pyxel provides functions like `pyxel.load`, `pyxel.image`, `pyxel.sound`, and `pyxel.music` that can load external files. If these files are malicious, they can exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying decoding libraries.
    *   **Example:** A user can load custom sprite sheets for their game. A malicious user provides a specially crafted PNG file that exploits a vulnerability in the image decoding library used by Pyxel (or its dependencies), leading to code execution on the user's machine.
    *   **Impact:** Code execution, denial of service (crashes), information disclosure (depending on the vulnerability).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Restrict the sources from which assets can be loaded. Ideally, bundle all necessary assets within the application.
            *   Implement checks on file types and potentially file sizes before attempting to load them.
            *   Consider using checksums or digital signatures to verify the integrity of asset files.
            *   Keep Pyxel and its dependencies updated to patch known vulnerabilities in decoding libraries.
        *   **Users:** Only load assets from trusted sources. Be wary of downloading and using custom assets from unknown origins.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal during Asset Loading (If Implemented by Developer)](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_during_asset_loading__if_implemented_by_developer_.md)

*   **Description:** If the developer allows users to specify file paths for loading assets without proper sanitization, an attacker could potentially access files outside the intended asset directory.
    *   **How Pyxel Contributes:** While Pyxel's basic loading functions might not directly expose this, if the developer builds custom file loading mechanisms using Pyxel's file system access in conjunction with user input, this vulnerability can arise.
    *   **Example:** The game allows users to load custom backgrounds by entering a file path. A malicious user enters a path like `../../../../etc/passwd` attempting to access sensitive system files.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential for arbitrary file access or modification depending on application permissions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Never directly use user-provided input to construct file paths without strict validation.
            *   Use safe file path manipulation techniques and ensure paths remain within the intended asset directory.
            *   Consider using file dialogs or predefined asset lists instead of allowing manual path input.
        *   **Users:** Be cautious about entering file paths and understand the potential risks.
