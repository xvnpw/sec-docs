## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using Pyxel [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_pyxel__critical_node_.md)

**Critical Nodes:**

*   **Compromise Application Using Pyxel:** This is the ultimate goal. Any successful exploitation of the underlying vulnerabilities or insecure integration leads to this compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Pyxel Library [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_pyxel_library__critical_node_.md)

**Critical Nodes:**

*   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Pyxel Library:** This node represents a broad range of potential attacks directly targeting weaknesses within the Pyxel library itself. Successful exploitation here bypasses the application's integration layer and directly compromises the application through Pyxel's flaws.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH START]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_handling_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_start_.md)

**High-Risk Paths:**

*   **Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities -> Overflow Input Buffer:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers send excessively long input strings to Pyxel functions (e.g., for rendering text, loading images, handling user input).
    *   **Mechanism:** If Pyxel or its underlying libraries do not properly validate the length of input, this can lead to a buffer overflow, where the input data overwrites adjacent memory regions.
    *   **Impact:** This can cause the application to crash (Denial of Service) or, more critically, allow the attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code on the system running the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Overflow Input Buffer [HIGH-RISK PATH END]](./attack_tree_paths/overflow_input_buffer__high-risk_path_end_.md)

**High-Risk Paths:**

*   **Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities -> Overflow Input Buffer:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers send excessively long input strings to Pyxel functions (e.g., for rendering text, loading images, handling user input).
    *   **Mechanism:** If Pyxel or its underlying libraries do not properly validate the length of input, this can lead to a buffer overflow, where the input data overwrites adjacent memory regions.
    *   **Impact:** This can cause the application to crash (Denial of Service) or, more critically, allow the attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code on the system running the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Resource Loading Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH START]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_resource_loading_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_start_.md)

**High-Risk Paths:**

*   **Exploit Resource Loading Vulnerabilities -> Load Malicious Image Files:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers provide specially crafted image files (e.g., PNG, GIF) to the application, which are then loaded by Pyxel.
    *   **Mechanism:** These malicious image files contain embedded exploits that target vulnerabilities in the image parsing libraries used by Pyxel (e.g., Pillow). When Pyxel attempts to load and process the image, the exploit is triggered.
    *   **Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution, allowing the attacker to gain control of the system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Load Malicious Image Files [HIGH-RISK PATH END]](./attack_tree_paths/load_malicious_image_files__high-risk_path_end_.md)

**High-Risk Paths:**

*   **Exploit Rendering Vulnerabilities -> Trigger Graphics Library Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers leverage Pyxel's drawing functionalities to trigger known vulnerabilities in the underlying graphics library (likely SDL2). This might involve specific sequences of drawing calls or providing crafted graphical data.
    *   **Mechanism:** Vulnerabilities in the graphics library can range from memory corruption issues to flaws in how specific rendering operations are handled.
    *   **Impact:** This can lead to a Denial of Service (application crash) or, in some cases, arbitrary code execution if memory corruption can be controlled.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Graphics Library Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH END]](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_graphics_library_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_end_.md)

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies of Pyxel [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH START]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies_of_pyxel__critical_node__high-risk_path_start_.md)

**Critical Nodes:**

*   **Exploit Dependencies of Pyxel:** Pyxel relies on external libraries like the Python interpreter and potentially others for image processing, audio, etc. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited to compromise the application. This is a critical node because it represents a significant attack surface outside of Pyxel's direct codebase.

**High-Risk Paths:**

*   **Exploit Dependencies of Pyxel -> Exploit Vulnerabilities in Python Interpreter:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target known security vulnerabilities in the specific version of the Python interpreter that Pyxel is running on.
    *   **Mechanism:** This involves crafting exploits that leverage these Python vulnerabilities within the context of the running Pyxel application.
    *   **Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution at the operating system level.
*   **Exploit Dependencies of Pyxel -> Exploit Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Libraries -> Achieve arbitrary code execution or other forms of compromise:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers identify and exploit known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by Pyxel (e.g., for audio processing, advanced image manipulation).
    *   **Mechanism:** This involves triggering these vulnerabilities through Pyxel's interaction with the vulnerable library.
    *   **Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, this can lead to arbitrary code execution, data breaches, or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Application Integration with Pyxel [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_application_integration_with_pyxel__critical_node_.md)

**Critical Nodes:**

*   **Exploit Insecure Application Integration with Pyxel:** This node highlights vulnerabilities arising from how the application *uses* Pyxel. Even if Pyxel itself is secure, improper integration can introduce significant risks. This includes passing unsanitized data or exposing Pyxel functionality in a dangerous way.

## Attack Tree Path: [Pass Unsanitized Data to Pyxel [HIGH-RISK PATH START]](./attack_tree_paths/pass_unsanitized_data_to_pyxel__high-risk_path_start_.md)
