# Threat Model Analysis for kitao/pyxel

## Threat: [Malicious Asset Injection (Images, Sounds, Music)](./threats/malicious_asset_injection__images__sounds__music_.md)

*   **Description:** If the application allows users to load custom assets (images, sounds, music) using Pyxel's API, an attacker could provide malicious files. These files could be crafted to exploit vulnerabilities in Pyxel's asset loading or rendering/playback mechanisms. This could involve malformed file headers, excessively large files, or files containing embedded malicious data that could potentially trigger vulnerabilities in underlying libraries used by Pyxel.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Application crashes or freezes when attempting to load or process the malicious asset.
        *   Memory exhaustion due to excessively large or poorly compressed assets.
        *   Potentially, if vulnerabilities exist in the underlying libraries Pyxel uses for asset handling, this could lead to arbitrary code execution within the Pyxel process.
    *   **Affected Component:** `pyxel.load()`, `pyxel.image()`, `pyxel.sound()`, `pyxel.music()` (and the underlying asset loading and processing logic within Pyxel).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict validation checks on all loaded assets, including file type, size, and basic structure, *before* passing them to Pyxel's loading functions.
        *   Use robust error handling during asset loading within the application to prevent crashes caused by Pyxel.
        *   Consider using a sandboxed environment or separate process for asset loading and processing *before* integrating them with Pyxel.
        *   Avoid directly using user-provided file paths without proper sanitization before passing them to Pyxel.
        *   If possible, re-encode or process user-provided assets through trusted libraries *before* using them in Pyxel.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Potential Pyxel Engine Bugs](./threats/exploitation_of_potential_pyxel_engine_bugs.md)

*   **Description:** Like any software, Pyxel might contain undiscovered bugs or vulnerabilities in its core engine. An attacker could discover and exploit these bugs to cause unexpected behavior, crashes, or potentially even gain control over the application's execution *within the Pyxel environment*. This could involve triggering specific sequences of Pyxel API calls or providing crafted data that exposes underlying flaws.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unpredictable application behavior directly caused by Pyxel.
        *   Application crashes or freezes originating from within Pyxel's code.
        *   In severe cases, potential for arbitrary code execution within the Pyxel process, potentially allowing the attacker to compromise the entire application.
    *   **Affected Component:** Various core modules and functions within the Pyxel engine (rendering, input, audio, resource management, etc.).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical if code execution is possible, otherwise High depending on the impact on application stability and functionality).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Stay updated with the latest stable version of Pyxel to benefit from bug fixes and security patches released by the Pyxel developers.
        *   Monitor Pyxel's issue tracker and release notes for reported vulnerabilities and apply updates promptly.
        *   Implement robust error handling within the application to gracefully handle unexpected exceptions or behavior originating from Pyxel.
        *   Consider using a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of potential Pyxel vulnerabilities on the rest of the system.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Pyxel Updates (If Applicable)](./threats/man-in-the-middle_attacks_on_pyxel_updates__if_applicable_.md)

*   **Description:** If the application automatically checks for and updates the Pyxel library (or related dependencies) over a network, an attacker could perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack to intercept the update process and inject a malicious version of the Pyxel library.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Installation of a compromised Pyxel library, potentially containing backdoors or malware that will be directly integrated into the application.
        *   Complete compromise of the application and potentially the user's system due to the malicious Pyxel library.
    *   **Affected Component:** Any update mechanisms implemented by the application that involve downloading the Pyxel library or its dependencies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure that Pyxel updates are downloaded over secure channels (HTTPS).
        *   Implement integrity checks (e.g., using checksums or digital signatures) to verify the authenticity of downloaded Pyxel updates.
        *   Prefer using trusted package managers or official sources for managing the Pyxel dependency.
        *   If implementing custom update mechanisms, carefully review and secure the entire process.
