* **Malicious Image File Loading**
    * **Description:** The application loads image files (PNG, GIF, JPEG) using Pyxel's functions. Maliciously crafted image files can exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying image decoding libraries.
    * **How Pyxel Contributes:** Pyxel provides functions like `pyxel.load` and `pyxel.image` which rely on underlying libraries (likely Pillow or similar) for image decoding. Vulnerabilities in these libraries can be exposed through Pyxel's image loading functionality.
    * **Example:** A user loads a specially crafted PNG file that exploits a buffer overflow in the image decoding library, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
    * **Impact:** Application crash, denial of service, potentially arbitrary code execution.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**  Ensure Pyxel and its dependencies (especially image processing libraries) are up-to-date with the latest security patches. Avoid loading images from untrusted sources or implement strict validation on image file headers and sizes before attempting to load. Consider sandboxing the image loading process.
        * **Users:** Only load resources from trusted sources. Be wary of downloading and using custom assets from unknown origins.

* **Path Traversal during Resource Loading**
    * **Description:** If the application allows users (even indirectly through configuration files) to specify paths for loading resources, a malicious actor could use path traversal techniques to access files outside the intended resource directory.
    * **How Pyxel Contributes:** While Pyxel's basic `pyxel.load` function typically works with relative paths within the application's directory, if the application logic constructs file paths based on user input and then uses Pyxel's loading functions, path traversal vulnerabilities can be introduced.
    * **Example:** A configuration file allows specifying a custom sound directory. A malicious user provides a path like `../../../../etc/passwd` which the application then attempts to load using Pyxel's sound loading, potentially exposing sensitive files (though Pyxel itself might not be able to interpret it).
    * **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential access to sensitive files on the user's system.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Never directly use user-provided input to construct file paths. Use whitelisting of allowed resource paths or IDs. Ensure all file access is confined to the intended resource directories.
        * **Users:** Be cautious about modifying configuration files or providing custom resource paths to applications from untrusted sources.

* **Reliance on Vulnerable External Libraries**
    * **Description:** Pyxel relies on other Python libraries (like Pygame's SDL2 wrapper). Vulnerabilities in these underlying libraries can indirectly affect Pyxel applications.
    * **How Pyxel Contributes:** Pyxel's functionality is built upon these external libraries. If a vulnerability exists in SDL2 or another dependency, it can be exploited through Pyxel's usage of those libraries.
    * **Example:** A vulnerability in the version of SDL2 used by Pyxel could be exploited by sending specific input events that trigger the vulnerability, even if the Pyxel application itself doesn't directly handle that input in a problematic way.
    * **Impact:** Application crashes, denial of service, potentially arbitrary code execution depending on the nature of the underlying vulnerability.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Regularly update Pyxel and all its dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities. Monitor security advisories for the libraries Pyxel depends on.
        * **Users:** Ensure the Pyxel application you are using is built with up-to-date libraries.
