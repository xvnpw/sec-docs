# BUSINESS POSTURE

SurrealDB is positioned as a next-generation database solution designed to simplify development and enhance application performance. It targets a wide range of applications, including web, mobile, and serverless, emphasizing real-time data capabilities and a flexible data model.

- Business priorities:
  - Ease of use and developer productivity: SurrealDB aims to reduce the complexity of database management and integration, allowing developers to focus on application logic.
  - Performance and scalability: The database is designed for high performance and scalability to handle demanding application workloads.
  - Real-time data capabilities: SurrealDB provides real-time query and subscription features, enabling applications to react instantly to data changes.
  - Versatility and flexibility: Supporting both document and graph data models, SurrealDB offers flexibility for various application data needs.

- Business goals:
  - Market adoption: To become a widely adopted database solution, challenging established databases in the market.
  - Community growth: To build a strong and active community around the database, fostering contributions and support.
  - Revenue generation (for SurrealDB Ltd, the company behind it): To establish a sustainable business model, likely through cloud offerings, enterprise support, or premium features.

- Most important business risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities: Data breaches or system compromises could severely damage reputation and hinder adoption, especially for a database system that handles sensitive data.
  - Performance bottlenecks: Failure to deliver on promised performance and scalability could lead to user dissatisfaction and migration to alternative solutions.
  - Data integrity issues: Bugs or design flaws that compromise data consistency or durability could erode trust and limit adoption in critical applications.
  - Lock-in and migration challenges: If users perceive it as difficult to migrate data to or from SurrealDB, adoption might be limited.
  - Competition: The database market is crowded. SurrealDB needs to differentiate itself effectively and compete against established and emerging databases.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing security controls:
  - security control: Access control mechanisms are likely in place to manage user permissions and database access, although details need to be confirmed in documentation. (Location: Documentation and source code)
  - security control: Encryption of data in transit using TLS/HTTPS for client-server communication is expected. (Location: Documentation and network configuration guides)
  - security control: Authentication mechanisms to verify user identities before granting access. (Location: Documentation and authentication module in source code)
  - security control: Authorization mechanisms to control what authenticated users can do within the database. (Location: Documentation and authorization module in source code)
  - security control: Regular security audits and vulnerability scanning are likely conducted by the SurrealDB team. (Location: Internal processes of SurrealDB Ltd)
  - security control: Secure coding practices are expected to be followed during development. (Location: Development guidelines and code review processes within SurrealDB Ltd)
  - accepted risk: As a relatively new database, SurrealDB might have a smaller track record of security testing and real-world deployment compared to mature databases. This implies a potentially higher risk of undiscovered vulnerabilities.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions might introduce security risks if contributions are not thoroughly vetted.

- Recommended security controls:
  - security control: Implement robust input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks.
  - security control: Implement comprehensive logging and auditing of security-related events for monitoring and incident response.
  - security control: Provide options for data encryption at rest to protect data stored on disk.
  - security control: Conduct regular penetration testing by external security experts to identify and address vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure and response process to handle security issues reported by the community or found internally.
  - security control: Implement automated security scanning tools (SAST/DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline.
  - security control: Dependency scanning to identify and manage vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.

- Security requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: Support strong authentication mechanisms, such as password policies, multi-factor authentication (MFA), or integration with external identity providers (e.g., OAuth, LDAP).
    - Requirement: Securely store and manage user credentials, avoiding plaintext storage and using strong hashing algorithms.
    - Requirement: Implement protection against brute-force attacks and account lockout mechanisms.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Implement fine-grained access control to manage permissions at the database, namespace, table, and record level.
    - Requirement: Support role-based access control (RBAC) to simplify permission management.
    - Requirement: Enforce the principle of least privilege, granting users only the necessary permissions.
  - Input validation:
    - Requirement: Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (SQL injection, NoSQL injection, command injection, etc.).
    - Requirement: Sanitize user inputs before processing and storing them in the database.
    - Requirement: Implement input validation at multiple layers (client-side and server-side).
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Use strong encryption algorithms and protocols for data in transit (TLS/HTTPS).
    - Requirement: Provide options for data encryption at rest using industry-standard encryption algorithms.
    - Requirement: Securely manage cryptographic keys, protecting them from unauthorized access.
    - Requirement: Consider using cryptography for data integrity checks to detect tampering.

## DEPLOYMENT

Deployment options for SurrealDB can vary. It can be deployed as:

1.  **Self-hosted on-premises:** Deploying SurrealDB on company-managed servers within their own data centers.
2.  **Self-hosted in the cloud (IaaS):** Deploying SurrealDB on virtual machines or containers in cloud environments like AWS EC2, Azure VMs, or Google Compute Engine.
3.  **Managed cloud service (PaaS/DBaaS):** Utilizing a managed SurrealDB service offered by SurrealDB Ltd or a third-party cloud provider (if available in the future).
4.  **Embedded within applications:** Embedding SurrealDB directly into applications as a library or process.

Let's consider a **Self-hosted in the cloud (IaaS)** deployment scenario on AWS using containers (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes).

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical business processes:
  - Data storage and retrieval: The core function of SurrealDB is to reliably store and retrieve data for applications. Disruption or compromise of this process would impact all applications relying on SurrealDB.
  - Real-time data processing: SurrealDB's real-time capabilities are a key feature. Failure to deliver real-time updates or data corruption in real-time streams would affect applications that depend on this functionality.
  - Authentication and authorization: Securely controlling access to data and database operations is crucial. Weaknesses in authentication or authorization could lead to unauthorized data access or manipulation.
  - Database administration and maintenance: Processes for managing, monitoring, and maintaining the database are essential for its continuous operation and security. Failures in these processes could lead to instability or vulnerabilities.

- Data being protected and sensitivity:
  - Application data: SurrealDB is designed to store various types of application data, which can range from public information to highly sensitive personal data, financial records, or intellectual property, depending on the application using it.
  - Database credentials: Credentials used to access and manage the database itself (e.g., administrator passwords, API keys) are highly sensitive and must be protected.
  - Audit logs: Logs containing security-related events and user activity are sensitive as they can reveal security incidents or vulnerabilities.
  - Backups: Database backups contain all the data and are highly sensitive. Unauthorized access to backups could lead to data breaches.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What specific authentication mechanisms are currently supported by SurrealDB (e.g., password-based, API keys, OAuth)?
