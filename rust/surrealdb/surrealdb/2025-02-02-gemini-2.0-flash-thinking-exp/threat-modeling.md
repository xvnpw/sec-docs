# Threat Model Analysis for surrealdb/surrealdb

## Threat: [SurrealQL Injection](./threats/surrealql_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious SurrealQL queries by injecting code into application inputs. This injected code is executed by SurrealDB, allowing direct database interaction bypassing application logic. For example, manipulating `SELECT` queries for unauthorized data retrieval or using `DELETE`/`UPDATE` for data modification/removal.
*   **Impact:** Data Breach (confidentiality loss), Data Manipulation (integrity loss), Data Deletion (availability loss), Potential privilege escalation.
*   **Affected SurrealDB Component:** SurrealQL Query Parser and Execution Engine.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Input Sanitization and Validation.
    *   Parameterized Queries.
    *   Principle of Least Privilege for database users.
    *   Regular Code Review.

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass](./threats/authentication_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker circumvents SurrealDB's authentication to gain unauthorized access. Methods include exploiting default credentials, brute-forcing weak passwords, or exploiting vulnerabilities in authentication protocols (e.g., JWT flaws).
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized Access, Data Breach (confidentiality loss), Data Manipulation (integrity loss), Data Deletion (availability loss), Account Takeover.
*   **Affected SurrealDB Component:** Authentication Module (Username/Password, JWT, OAuth).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strong Password Policies.
    *   Change Default Credentials.
    *   Secure Authentication Configuration (JWT, OAuth).
    *   Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for sensitive accounts.
    *   Regular Security Audits of authentication.

## Threat: [Authorization Bypass](./threats/authorization_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker bypasses SurrealDB's authorization controls to access restricted resources or actions. This can involve exploiting flaws in RBAC, record-level permissions, or application-level authorization interacting with SurrealDB. For example, accessing other users' data or performing admin actions without authorization.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized Access, Data Breach (confidentiality loss), Data Manipulation (integrity loss), Privilege Escalation.
*   **Affected SurrealDB Component:** Authorization Module (RBAC, Record Permissions).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Principle of Least Privilege for users and roles.
    *   Properly Define and Test Permissions.
    *   Application-Level Authorization Checks.
    *   Regular Permission Reviews.

## Threat: [Unsecured Database Access (Direct Exposure)](./threats/unsecured_database_access__direct_exposure_.md)

*   **Description:** SurrealDB instance is directly exposed to the internet or untrusted network without network security. Attackers can directly connect and attempt to exploit vulnerabilities, brute-force credentials, or leverage default configurations.
*   **Impact:** Full Database Compromise, Data Breach (confidentiality loss), Data Manipulation (integrity loss), Data Deletion (availability loss), Denial of Service, Lateral movement potential.
*   **Affected SurrealDB Component:** Network Listener, Server Configuration.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Firewall Configuration to restrict access.
    *   Network Segmentation to isolate SurrealDB.
    *   Disable Public Binding (if applicable).
    *   Use Secure Protocols (TLS/HTTPS).

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends complex or resource-intensive SurrealQL queries to overwhelm the SurrealDB server (CPU, memory, disk I/O). This leads to performance degradation, service unavailability, or crashes, impacting legitimate users.
*   **Impact:** Service Unavailability (availability loss), Performance Degradation, Financial Loss.
*   **Affected SurrealDB Component:** Query Execution Engine, Resource Management.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Query Complexity Limits (application or SurrealDB config).
    *   Rate Limiting on API endpoints.
    *   Resource Monitoring and Alerting.
    *   Connection Limits in SurrealDB.
    *   Input Validation to prevent resource-intensive queries.

## Threat: [Insecure Backups](./threats/insecure_backups.md)

*   **Description:** SurrealDB backups are stored insecurely (unencrypted, weak access controls). Attackers accessing backups can extract sensitive data, compromising the database.
*   **Impact:** Data Breach (confidentiality loss), Full Database Compromise, Compliance Violations.
*   **Affected SurrealDB Component:** Backup and Restore Utilities, Backup Storage.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure Backup Storage with restricted access.
    *   Backup Encryption at rest and in transit.
    *   Regular Backup Testing and validation.
    *   Backup Integrity Checks.
