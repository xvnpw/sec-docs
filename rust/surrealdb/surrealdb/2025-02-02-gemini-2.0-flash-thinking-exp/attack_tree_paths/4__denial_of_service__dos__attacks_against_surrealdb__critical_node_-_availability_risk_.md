#### 4. Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks against SurrealDB (CRITICAL NODE - Availability Risk)

This section details the deep analysis of the selected attack vectors under the overarching category of DoS attacks against SurrealDB.

##### 4.1.4. Network Bandwidth Exhaustion by flooding SurrealDB server with requests (CRITICAL NODE - Common DoS)

*   **Description:**

    This attack vector leverages the principle of overwhelming the network bandwidth available to the SurrealDB server. Attackers achieve this by generating and sending a massive volume of network traffic towards the server. This traffic can consist of various types of requests, including:

    *   **Legitimate Requests:**  Attackers might mimic legitimate application requests to SurrealDB, but at an exponentially higher volume than normal.
    *   **Amplified Requests:**  In some cases, attackers might exploit protocols or services to amplify their traffic. While less directly applicable to a database server like SurrealDB, reflection attacks could theoretically be directed towards the server's network.
    *   **Garbage Data:**  Attackers might simply flood the server with meaningless data packets to consume bandwidth.

    The sheer volume of traffic saturates the network links leading to the SurrealDB server, effectively choking off legitimate traffic. This results in packet loss, increased latency, and ultimately, the inability for legitimate users to connect to and interact with SurrealDB.

*   **Vulnerability:**

    The vulnerability exploited in this attack vector primarily stems from:

    *   **Lack of Network-Level Rate Limiting:**  If there are no mechanisms in place to limit the rate of incoming network traffic to the SurrealDB server, it becomes susceptible to being overwhelmed by a flood of requests. This lack of rate limiting can exist at various points in the network infrastructure, including:
        *   **Firewall/Edge Router:**  Insufficiently configured firewalls or edge routers that do not implement traffic shaping or rate limiting rules.
        *   **Load Balancer (if used):**  Load balancers that are not configured to handle DoS attacks or lack rate limiting capabilities.
        *   **Network Infrastructure:**  The network infrastructure itself might lack inherent DoS protection mechanisms.
    *   **Insufficient Bandwidth Capacity:**  If the network bandwidth provisioned for the SurrealDB server is inadequate to handle peak legitimate traffic plus a reasonable buffer for potential surges, it becomes easier for attackers to exhaust the available bandwidth. This can be due to:
        *   **Under-provisioned Network Links:**  The network connection to the server (e.g., internet uplink, internal network link) might be too small.
        *   **Shared Infrastructure:**  If the server shares network resources with other services, a DoS attack targeting SurrealDB can impact other services as well.

*   **Impact:**

    A successful Network Bandwidth Exhaustion attack can have severe impacts:

    *   **Service Outage:**  Legitimate users will be unable to connect to SurrealDB, leading to a complete service outage for applications relying on the database.
    *   **Denial of Service for Legitimate Users:**  The primary impact is the denial of service, preventing legitimate users from accessing data, performing queries, or interacting with applications that depend on SurrealDB.
    *   **Application Downtime:**  Applications relying on SurrealDB will become unavailable or severely degraded, leading to business disruption and potential financial losses.
    *   **Reputational Damage:**  Service outages can damage the reputation of the organization hosting SurrealDB and the applications it supports.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Secondary):** While primarily a bandwidth issue, prolonged high traffic can also indirectly strain server resources like CPU and memory due to the overhead of processing and discarding the flood of requests.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**

    To mitigate Network Bandwidth Exhaustion attacks, a multi-layered approach is necessary:

    *   **Network-Level Rate Limiting and Traffic Shaping:**
        *   **Firewall/Edge Router Configuration:** Implement strict ingress traffic filtering and rate limiting rules on firewalls and edge routers to limit the number of packets and bandwidth consumed from specific sources or networks.
        *   **Load Balancer Rate Limiting:**  If using a load balancer, configure it to enforce rate limits on incoming requests and connections.
    *   **Bandwidth Provisioning and Capacity Planning:**
        *   **Adequate Bandwidth:** Ensure sufficient network bandwidth is provisioned for the SurrealDB server to handle peak legitimate traffic and provide a buffer for potential surges.
        *   **Scalable Infrastructure:** Design the network infrastructure to be scalable to accommodate future growth and potential increases in traffic volume.
    *   **DDoS Mitigation Services:**
        *   **Cloud-Based DDoS Protection:**  Utilize cloud-based DDoS mitigation services offered by providers like Cloudflare, Akamai, or AWS Shield. These services can detect and mitigate large-scale DDoS attacks before they reach the SurrealDB infrastructure.
    *   **Traffic Filtering and Anomaly Detection:**
        *   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Deploy IDS/IPS systems to monitor network traffic for suspicious patterns and anomalies indicative of DoS attacks.
        *   **Traffic Analysis Tools:**  Utilize network traffic analysis tools to identify and block malicious traffic sources.
    *   **Implement Connection Limits (Indirect Benefit):** While primarily for connection exhaustion attacks, limiting connections can indirectly reduce the overall bandwidth consumption if attackers are attempting to establish many connections as part of their flood.

##### 4.2.1. Open a large number of connections to exhaust SurrealDB's connection limits (CRITICAL NODE - Simple DoS)

*   **Description:**

    This attack vector focuses on exhausting the resources of the SurrealDB server by opening and maintaining a large number of connections. Attackers aim to consume all available connection slots on the server, preventing legitimate users from establishing new connections. This is often a simpler form of DoS compared to bandwidth exhaustion, as it targets server resources directly rather than network bandwidth.

    The attack typically involves:

    *   **Connection Flooding:** Attackers rapidly initiate a large number of TCP connections to the SurrealDB server.
    *   **Half-Open Connections (SYN Flood):**  Attackers might send SYN packets to initiate connections but not complete the TCP handshake (by not sending the ACK). This leaves the server in a state of waiting for the handshake to complete, consuming resources for each half-open connection.
    *   **Slowloris Attacks (Application Layer):**  While less directly related to connection limits in the TCP sense, attackers might send slow, incomplete HTTP requests to keep connections open for extended periods, eventually exhausting server resources. (Less likely for direct SurrealDB protocol, but relevant if accessed via HTTP proxy).

    Once the server's connection limit is reached, any new connection attempts, including those from legitimate users, will be refused.

*   **Vulnerability:**

    The vulnerability exploited here is primarily:

    *   **Insufficient Connection Limits Configured in SurrealDB:**  SurrealDB, like most database systems, will have a configurable limit on the maximum number of concurrent connections it can handle. If this limit is set too high or left at a very large default value without proper resource consideration, it becomes easier for attackers to exhaust these connections.
        *   **Configuration Settings:**  The specific configuration method for connection limits in SurrealDB needs to be reviewed in its documentation. It might be in configuration files, command-line arguments, or environment variables.
    *   **Lack of Connection Rate Limiting:**  Even if connection limits are set, the server might not have mechanisms to limit the *rate* at which new connections are accepted from a single source or overall. This allows attackers to rapidly establish a large number of connections before any limits are enforced.
        *   **Application-Level Rate Limiting (Less Common for Connections):** While request rate limiting is common at the application level, connection rate limiting is typically handled at lower network layers.
        *   **Operating System Limits:**  Operating system level limits on open files and sockets can also play a role, but application-level limits within SurrealDB are more directly relevant.

*   **Impact:**

    A successful Connection Limit Exhaustion attack leads to:

    *   **Service Outage:**  Legitimate users are unable to establish new connections to SurrealDB. Existing connections might remain active, but the inability to create new connections effectively renders the service unavailable for new requests or users.
    *   **Inability for Legitimate Users to Connect:**  The primary impact is the prevention of legitimate users from accessing SurrealDB. Applications will fail to connect to the database, leading to errors and application downtime.
    *   **Application Downtime:**  Applications that require new database connections will fail, causing application downtime and business disruption.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Server-Side):**  Maintaining a large number of connections, even if idle, consumes server resources like memory, CPU (for connection management), and file descriptors. This can degrade overall server performance and potentially impact other services running on the same server.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**

    Mitigating Connection Limit Exhaustion attacks requires a combination of configuration and network security measures:

    *   **Configure Appropriate Connection Limits in SurrealDB:**
        *   **Review Documentation:** Consult SurrealDB documentation to identify the configuration parameters for setting maximum connection limits.
        *   **Resource-Based Limits:**  Set connection limits based on the server's resources (CPU, memory) and the expected legitimate workload. Avoid setting excessively high limits that could be easily exploited.
    *   **Connection Rate Limiting at Firewall/Load Balancer:**
        *   **Firewall Rules:** Configure firewalls to limit the rate of new connection attempts from specific source IPs or networks.
        *   **Load Balancer Connection Limits:**  If using a load balancer, configure it to enforce connection rate limits and potentially connection limits per backend server.
    *   **SYN Cookies (Operating System Level):**
        *   **Enable SYN Cookies:**  Enable SYN cookies at the operating system level. This mechanism helps to mitigate SYN flood attacks by deferring the allocation of resources for new connections until the TCP handshake is almost complete.
    *   **Connection Timeouts and Idle Connection Management:**
        *   **Short Connection Timeouts:**  Configure relatively short connection timeouts in SurrealDB and the application connecting to it. This ensures that idle or abandoned connections are closed promptly, freeing up resources.
        *   **Idle Connection Killing:**  Implement mechanisms to periodically check for and close idle connections that have been inactive for a certain period.
    *   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):**
        *   **Connection Flood Detection:**  Deploy IDS/IPS systems capable of detecting connection flood attacks and automatically blocking malicious sources.
    *   **Implement Network Segmentation (Defense in Depth):**
        *   **Restrict Access:**  Limit network access to SurrealDB to only authorized networks and clients. This reduces the attack surface and makes it harder for attackers to initiate connections from untrusted sources.

By implementing these mitigation strategies, organizations can significantly reduce the risk and impact of both Network Bandwidth Exhaustion and Connection Limit Exhaustion DoS attacks against their SurrealDB deployments, ensuring the availability and reliability of their services.
