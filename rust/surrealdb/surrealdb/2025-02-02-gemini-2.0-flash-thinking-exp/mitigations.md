## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Strong Password Policies within SurrealDB](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_strong_password_policies_within_surrealdb.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce Strong Password Policies within SurrealDB
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Define Password Complexity Requirements:** Establish rules for password strength, including minimum length, character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols), and complexity. Document these requirements clearly for SurrealDB administrators and users.
        2.  **Implement Password Length Enforcement:** Configure SurrealDB (if possible through its configuration or administration interface) to enforce a minimum password length for user accounts.
        3.  **Implement Password Complexity Checks:**  Utilize SurrealDB's user management features or external tools (if available and necessary) to enforce password complexity requirements when creating or updating SurrealDB user passwords.
        4.  **Enforce Password Rotation:**  Establish a policy for regular password changes for SurrealDB users (e.g., every 90 days).  Implement reminders and mechanisms within your user management processes to prompt SurrealDB users to change their passwords periodically. For service accounts accessing SurrealDB, schedule regular manual password rotations.
        5.  **Prevent Password Reuse:**  If SurrealDB offers password history tracking or similar features, enable them to prevent users from reusing recently used passwords.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Brute-force attacks on SurrealDB user accounts - Severity: High
        *   Credential stuffing attacks against SurrealDB - Severity: High

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize SurrealDB's Built-in Authentication and Authorization Mechanisms](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_surrealdb's_built-in_authentication_and_authorization_mechanisms.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Utilize SurrealDB's Built-in Authentication and Authorization Mechanisms
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Design a Granular Permission Model within SurrealDB:**  Analyze your application's data and functionalities within SurrealDB. Identify different user roles and the specific SurrealDB permissions required for each role to access and manipulate data.
        2.  **Implement Namespaces and Databases in SurrealDB:**  Organize your data into namespaces and databases within SurrealDB to logically separate different parts of your application or different tenants. Use namespaces and databases to create natural boundaries for SurrealDB access control.
        3.  **Define Scopes and Users in SurrealDB:**  Create SurrealDB scopes to define specific areas of access within databases. Create SurrealDB users directly within SurrealDB and assign them to appropriate scopes with the minimum necessary permissions (e.g., `SELECT`, `CREATE`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) as defined by SurrealDB's permission system.
        4.  **Apply Principle of Least Privilege within SurrealDB:**  Grant each SurrealDB user or application service account only the permissions required to perform its intended tasks within SurrealDB. Avoid granting overly broad SurrealDB permissions like `ALL` unless absolutely necessary and well-justified.
        5.  **Regularly Review and Audit SurrealDB Permissions:** Periodically review the assigned SurrealDB permissions for all SurrealDB users and scopes directly within SurrealDB's management interface or using SurrealDB's query language. Ensure that SurrealDB permissions are still appropriate and remove any unnecessary or excessive permissions. Implement audit logging for SurrealDB permission changes if available in SurrealDB.
