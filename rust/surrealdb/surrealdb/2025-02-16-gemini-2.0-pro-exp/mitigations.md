## Mitigation Strategy: [Granular Permissions with `DEFINE PERMISSION`](./mitigation_strategies/granular_permissions_with__define_permission_.md)

**1. Mitigation Strategy: Granular Permissions with `DEFINE PERMISSION`**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Roles:** Define distinct user roles within the application (e.g., admin, editor, viewer, guest).
    2.  **Analyze Access Needs:** For each role, determine the specific tables, records, and fields they need to access within SurrealDB.  Consider *read*, *write*, *create*, and *delete* operations separately.
    3.  **Craft `DEFINE PERMISSION` Statements:** Write SurrealQL `DEFINE PERMISSION` statements for each role.  Use the `FOR` clause to specify the allowed operations (`select`, `create`, `update`, `delete`). Use the `WHERE` clause to restrict access based on record attributes (e.g., `WHERE user = $auth.id`).  Use SurrealDB's `$auth` variable to access authenticated user information.
    4.  **Test Permissions:** Thoroughly test each permission using SurrealQL queries, simulating users assigned to the corresponding roles.  Attempt actions that *should* be allowed and actions that *should* be denied.  Use SurrealDB's client libraries to authenticate as different users for testing.
    5.  **Regular Review:** Schedule periodic reviews (e.g., quarterly) of all `DEFINE PERMISSION` statements, querying SurrealDB's system tables to inspect the defined permissions and ensure they remain aligned with the application's evolving security requirements.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access (High Severity):** Prevents users from accessing data they shouldn't see or modify within SurrealDB.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (High Severity):** Prevents users from gaining higher privileges than intended within SurrealDB.
    *   **Data Tampering (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized modification or deletion of data within SurrealDB.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Limits the exposure of sensitive data stored in SurrealDB.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Risk significantly reduced (e.g., from High to Low).
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk significantly reduced (e.g., from High to Low).
    *   **Data Tampering:** Risk significantly reduced (e.g., from High to Low).
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk moderately reduced (e.g., from Medium to Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic permissions defined for `admin` and `user` roles on the `posts` and `comments` tables using `DEFINE PERMISSION` statements.  Permissions allow `admin` full access and `user` read-only access to `posts` they created and all `comments`. Implemented in `/db/permissions.surql`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Permissions are not yet defined for the `users` table itself (limiting what user information can be seen by other users) using `DEFINE PERMISSION`.
    *   No permissions are defined for the `analytics` namespace using `DEFINE PERMISSION`.
    *   No regular review process that queries SurrealDB to check permissions is in place.


## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Schema Enforcement with `DEFINE FIELD ... TYPE` and `ASSERT`](./mitigation_strategies/strict_schema_enforcement_with__define_field_____type__and__assert_.md)

**2. Mitigation Strategy: Strict Schema Enforcement with `DEFINE FIELD ... TYPE` and `ASSERT`**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Analyze Data Model:** For each table in SurrealDB, identify all fields and their intended data types (e.g., `string`, `int`, `datetime`, `record(another_table)`).
    2.  **Define Fields with Types:** Use SurrealQL `DEFINE FIELD` statements with explicit `TYPE` declarations for each field.
    3.  **Add Assertions:** Use the `ASSERT` keyword within `DEFINE FIELD` statements to enforce constraints on data values using SurrealQL expressions.  Examples:
        *   `ASSERT $value > 0` (for positive numbers)
        *   `ASSERT string::is::email($value)` (for email addresses)
        *   `ASSERT array::len($value) > 0` (for non-empty arrays)
        *   `ASSERT $value INSIDE [ ... ]` (for allowed values)
    4.  **Test Schema:** Attempt to insert data into SurrealDB that violates the defined types and assertions.  Verify that SurrealDB rejects the invalid data. Use SurrealQL queries to test.
    5.  **Regular Review:** Review schema definitions (using SurrealQL queries to inspect the system tables) alongside permission reviews to ensure consistency and completeness.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Corruption (Medium Severity):** Prevents invalid data from entering SurrealDB.
    *   **Injection Attacks (High Severity):**  Indirectly mitigates some injection attacks by limiting the types of data that can be inserted into SurrealDB.
    *   **Logic Errors (Medium Severity):** Helps prevent application logic errors caused by unexpected data types or values in SurrealDB.
    *  **Bypassing Permissions (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from inserting crafted data into SurrealDB that might bypass permission checks.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Corruption:** Risk reduced (e.g., from Medium to Low).
    *   **Injection Attacks:** Risk slightly reduced (defense in depth).
    *   **Logic Errors:** Risk reduced (e.g., from Medium to Low).
    *   **Bypassing Permissions:** Risk moderately reduced (e.g., from High to Medium).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic type definitions (`string`, `int`, `datetime`) are in place for most fields in the `posts` and `comments` tables using `DEFINE FIELD` statements.  Implemented in `/db/schema.surql`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `ASSERT` statements are not consistently used within the `DEFINE FIELD` statements.  Many fields lack validation beyond basic type checking.
    *   No schema definitions exist for the `analytics` namespace using `DEFINE FIELD`.
    *   No regular review process that queries SurrealDB to check schema definitions is in place.


## Mitigation Strategy: [Parameterized Queries (Bindings) in SurrealQL](./mitigation_strategies/parameterized_queries__bindings__in_surrealql.md)

**3. Mitigation Strategy: Parameterized Queries (Bindings) in SurrealQL**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify User Input:** Identify all points in the application code where user-supplied data is used in SurrealQL queries *sent to SurrealDB*.
    2.  **Use Bindings:**  *Never* directly concatenate user input into SurrealQL strings.  Instead, use the parameterized query (binding) mechanism provided by the SurrealDB client library, which translates to using placeholders in the SurrealQL query string (e.g., `$1`, `$2`, or named parameters) and passing the user input as separate parameters to the client library's query execution function.  The client library then handles the proper escaping and formatting for SurrealDB.
    3.  **Code Review:**  Conduct thorough code reviews to ensure that *all* SurrealQL queries involving user input use parameterized queries, paying close attention to how the queries are constructed and sent to SurrealDB.
    4.  **Testing:** Include tests that specifically attempt SQL injection attacks against the application's interaction with SurrealDB, to verify that parameterized queries are working correctly and preventing injection.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **SurrealQL Injection (Critical Severity):**  The primary defense against SurrealQL injection attacks, preventing attackers from executing arbitrary SurrealQL code within SurrealDB.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **SurrealQL Injection:** Risk drastically reduced (e.g., from Critical to Very Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   The application uses the official SurrealDB Python client library, and most queries involving user input *appear* to use parameterized queries when interacting with SurrealDB.  Implemented throughout the application code, primarily in data access layer modules.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A comprehensive code review specifically focused on identifying *all* instances of SurrealQL query construction *sent to SurrealDB* has not been performed.
    *   Dedicated penetration testing for SurrealQL injection, specifically targeting the application's interaction with SurrealDB, has not been conducted.


## Mitigation Strategy: [Query Complexity Limits and Timeouts (within SurrealDB Client)](./mitigation_strategies/query_complexity_limits_and_timeouts__within_surrealdb_client_.md)

**4. Mitigation Strategy: Query Complexity Limits and Timeouts (within SurrealDB Client)**

* **Description:**
    1. **Identify Potentially Complex Queries:** Analyze application code and identify SurrealQL queries sent to SurrealDB that could potentially be resource-intensive.
    2. **Set Timeouts:** Configure query timeouts on the SurrealDB *client*. This is a direct interaction with the SurrealDB client library, ensuring that even if a complex query is sent to SurrealDB, it won't run indefinitely on the server. The timeout is enforced by the client, but it protects the SurrealDB server.
    3. **Load Testing:** Perform load testing with a variety of query patterns, including complex ones, to determine appropriate timeout values for interactions with SurrealDB.
    4. **Monitor and Adjust:** Continuously monitor query performance and resource usage *of SurrealDB*. Adjust timeout values as needed.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from overwhelming the SurrealDB server with complex queries.

* **Impact:**
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):** Risk significantly reduced (e.g., from High to Medium or Low).

* **Currently Implemented:**
    * A global query timeout of 5 seconds is configured on the SurrealDB client.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    * Load testing specifically focused on identifying DoS vulnerabilities against SurrealDB has not been performed.
    * No monitoring of SurrealDB query performance is in place beyond basic server metrics.


## Mitigation Strategy: [Controlled Usage of Built-in Functions (e.g., `crypto`) within SurrealQL](./mitigation_strategies/controlled_usage_of_built-in_functions__e_g____crypto___within_surrealql.md)

**5. Mitigation Strategy: Controlled Usage of Built-in Functions (e.g., `crypto`) within SurrealQL**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Usage:** Identify all instances where SurrealDB's built-in functions, particularly those related to cryptography (`crypto::*`) or system interaction, are used *within SurrealQL queries*.
    2.  **Security Review:** For each usage within a SurrealQL query, carefully review the code to ensure:
        *   The correct function is being used.
        *   Appropriate parameters are being passed.
        *   The function's limitations and security implications are understood.
        *   If cryptographic functions are used, strong algorithms and key management practices are in place.  This may involve checking how keys are used *within* SurrealQL.
    3.  **Restrict Access:** If functions provide access to sensitive operations or the underlying system, restrict their use to highly privileged users or roles *using SurrealDB permissions*.
    4.  **Testing:** Include specific tests that verify the secure and correct usage of these functions *within SurrealQL queries*.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cryptographic Weaknesses (High Severity):** Prevents the use of weak or inappropriate cryptographic algorithms within SurrealQL.
    *   **Unauthorized System Access (Critical Severity):** Limits the potential for attackers to exploit functions that interact with the underlying system via SurrealQL.
    *   **Data Corruption (Medium Severity):** Prevents incorrect usage of functions within SurrealQL that could lead to data corruption.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cryptographic Weaknesses:** Risk reduced (depending on the specific functions used).
    *   **Unauthorized System Access:** Risk significantly reduced (if applicable).
    *   **Data Corruption:** Risk reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   The application uses `crypto::bcrypt::generate` and `crypto::bcrypt::compare` for password hashing within SurrealQL `DEFINE USER` statements.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A comprehensive review of all built-in function usage within SurrealQL queries has not been conducted.
    *   No specific restrictions are in place on the use of built-in functions within SurrealQL, beyond the existing user permissions.
