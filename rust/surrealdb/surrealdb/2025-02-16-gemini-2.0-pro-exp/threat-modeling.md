# Threat Model Analysis for surrealdb/surrealdb

## Threat: [SurrealQL Injection](./threats/surrealql_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** SurrealQL Injection

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input that, when incorporated into a SurrealQL query without proper sanitization, alters the query's intended logic.  The attacker might insert extra commands, modify `WHERE` clauses, or use `DEFINE` statements to alter the database schema. This is a direct attack on SurrealDB's query processing.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches (reading unauthorized data), data modification (altering or deleting data), data destruction, denial of service (by causing resource exhaustion), and potentially even code execution if SurrealDB has any exploitable vulnerabilities related to query parsing.
    *   **Affected Component:** SurrealDB's query parser and execution engine (specifically, how it handles dynamically constructed queries). The `query` function and any related functions used for executing SurrealQL statements are the primary targets.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements:** *Always* use parameterized queries or prepared statements. This is the *primary* defense. SurrealDB's client libraries should provide mechanisms for this. Do *not* construct queries by string concatenation with user input.
        *   **Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation on the application side to ensure that user-provided data conforms to expected types and formats *before* it's even considered for use in a query.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Ensure database users have only the minimum necessary permissions. An attacker who successfully injects SurrealQL should be limited in what they can do.

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass](./threats/authentication_bypass.md)

*   **Threat:** Authentication Bypass

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to SurrealDB without valid credentials. This could be due to flaws in SurrealDB's authentication logic, or improper handling of authentication tokens (e.g., JWTs) *within SurrealDB itself*.  This focuses on vulnerabilities *within* SurrealDB's authentication mechanisms, not just weak passwords.
    *   **Impact:** Complete database compromise. The attacker could read, modify, or delete all data, and potentially even alter the database schema.
    *   **Affected Component:** SurrealDB's authentication module, including user management functions (e.g., `DEFINE USER`, `SIGNIN`, `SIGNUP`), and any related functions for handling authentication tokens.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Token Handling:** If using JWTs or other tokens, ensure they are properly validated (signature, expiration, issuer, audience) *within SurrealDB's code*.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Regularly review authentication configurations and logs, focusing on SurrealDB's internal handling of authentication.
        *   **Report Vulnerabilities:** If you discover a vulnerability in SurrealDB's authentication, report it responsibly to the developers.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Data Access (Insufficient Authorization)](./threats/unauthorized_data_access__insufficient_authorization_.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Data Access (Insufficient Authorization)

    *   **Description:** An authenticated user (or an attacker who has bypassed authentication) accesses data they are not authorized to see. This is due to insufficient access controls *within SurrealDB's authorization logic*.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches. Sensitive information is exposed to unauthorized parties.
    *   **Affected Component:** SurrealDB's authorization module and permission system. This includes how `DEFINE TABLE`, `DEFINE FIELD`, and `PERMISSIONS` statements are used and enforced *by SurrealDB*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant users only the *minimum* necessary permissions to perform their tasks. Use granular permissions at the table and field level, relying on SurrealDB's permission system.
        *   **Regular Permission Reviews:** Periodically review user permissions *within SurrealDB* to ensure they are still appropriate.
        *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement RBAC *using SurrealDB's features* to simplify permission management.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (Resource Exhaustion)](./threats/denial_of_service__resource_exhaustion_.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (Resource Exhaustion)

    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a large number of complex queries, large data insertions, or connection requests *specifically designed to exploit weaknesses in SurrealDB's internal handling of these requests*. This focuses on vulnerabilities *within SurrealDB's query processing or resource management*, not just general network flooding.
    *   **Impact:** Service disruption. Legitimate users cannot access the database.
    *   **Affected Component:** SurrealDB's query processing engine, connection handling, and resource management. This could affect various internal components depending on the specific attack vector *within SurrealDB*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Query Timeouts:** Set timeouts for queries *within SurrealDB's configuration* to prevent long-running queries from blocking other requests.
        *   **Resource Limits:** Configure resource limits (memory, CPU, connections) *for SurrealDB itself*.
        *   **Input Validation (Size Limits):** Limit the size of data that can be inserted or retrieved in a single request *as enforced by SurrealDB*.
        *   **Monitor SurrealDB Internals:** Monitor SurrealDB's *internal* performance and resource usage to detect and respond to potential DoS attacks targeting its specific vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Unpatched Vulnerabilities (Directly in SurrealDB)](./threats/unpatched_vulnerabilities__directly_in_surrealdb_.md)

*   **Threat:** Unpatched Vulnerabilities (Directly in SurrealDB)

    *   **Description:** SurrealDB *itself* contains known or unknown vulnerabilities that have not been patched. This focuses specifically on vulnerabilities *within the SurrealDB codebase*.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but could range from denial of service to complete database compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Any part of SurrealDB could be affected, depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep SurrealDB up to date with the latest security patches. This is the *most critical* mitigation.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan for known vulnerabilities *specifically in SurrealDB*.
        *   **Security Advisories:** Monitor security advisories and mailing lists related to SurrealDB.
