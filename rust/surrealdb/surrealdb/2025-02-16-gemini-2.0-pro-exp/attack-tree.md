## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit SurrealDB Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_surrealdb_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **1.1 Code Injection:**
    *   **1.1.1 SurrealQL Injection [HR][CN]:**
        *   **Description:**  An attacker crafts malicious SurrealQL queries to inject code into the database, exploiting insufficient input validation.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (If input validation is weak or absent; Low if proper sanitization is in place)
        *   **Impact:** High to Very High (Data exfiltration, modification, potential code execution)
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Depends on the complexity of the vulnerability and the application's structure)
        *   **Skill Level:** Medium (Requires understanding of SurrealQL and injection techniques)
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High (Can be detected with WAFs, input validation logs, and database query monitoring; but sophisticated attacks might try to evade detection)
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Use parameterized queries or SurrealDB's query builder.
            *   Implement strong input validation and sanitization on the application side.
            *   Regularly update SurrealDB.
            *   Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF).

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Leverage Misconfigurations/Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/2__leverage_misconfigurationsweaknesses.md)

*   **2.1 Weak Authentication:**
    *   **2.1.1 Default Credentials [HR][CN]:**
        *   **Description:**  The attacker uses the default username and password (e.g., `root:root`) to gain administrative access.
        *   **Likelihood:** Very Low (Should be changed immediately; but surprisingly common)
        *   **Impact:** Very High (Full administrative access to the database)
        *   **Effort:** Very Low (Trivial to exploit)
        *   **Skill Level:** Very Low (No specialized skills required)
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low (Easily detected by checking for default credentials)
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   *Immediately* change default credentials upon installation.
            *   Enforce a strong password policy.

    *   **2.1.2 Weak Passwords [HR]:**
        *   **Description:**  The attacker uses brute-force or dictionary attacks to guess user passwords.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on password policy enforcement)
        *   **Impact:** High (Access to the database as the compromised user)
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Brute-force or dictionary attacks)
        *   **Skill Level:** Low (Basic attack tools can be used)
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Can be detected through failed login attempts and password auditing)
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Enforce a strong password policy (length, complexity, character sets).
            *   Consider implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA).
            * Implement account lockout after failed login attempts.

*   **2.3 Insecure Network Configuration:**
     *   **2.3.1 Unencrypted Traffic [HR][CN]:**
        *   **Description:**  The attacker intercepts network traffic between the application and SurrealDB, capturing credentials and data.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (If TLS/SSL is properly configured; High if not)
        *   **Impact:** High (Data interception, including credentials)
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Requires network access and sniffing tools)
        *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium (Requires understanding of network protocols)
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Can be detected with network monitoring tools)
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   *Always* use TLS/SSL encryption for all SurrealDB communication.
            *   Ensure certificates are valid and from a trusted authority.
            *   Use a VPN if connecting over untrusted networks.
