# Attack Surface Analysis for surrealdb/surrealdb

## Attack Surface: [SurrealQL Injection](./attack_surfaces/surrealql_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in SurrealDB query processing by injecting malicious SurrealQL code through user-controlled input.
*   **SurrealDB Contribution:** SurrealDB's core functionality relies on SurrealQL. Insufficient input sanitization when constructing SurrealQL queries directly leads to this vulnerability.
*   **Example:** An application uses user input to filter data. A malicious user inputs `' OR password != '' --'` into a username field. If this is directly used in a SurrealQL query like `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'userInput'`, it becomes `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR password != '' --'`. This bypasses the username check and potentially exposes all user data due to the `--` commenting out the rest of the intended query logic.
*   **Impact:** Data breach (unauthorized access to sensitive data), data manipulation (unauthorized modification or deletion of data), potential for privilege escalation and further system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Parameterize Queries:**  Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements provided by SurrealDB drivers. This ensures user input is treated as data, not executable code.
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation to restrict user input to expected formats and data types before using it in SurrealQL queries. Sanitize or reject invalid input.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant database users and application roles only the necessary permissions to perform their intended tasks. Limit access to sensitive tables and operations.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication Bypass](./attack_surfaces/authentication_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Circumventing SurrealDB's authentication mechanisms to gain unauthorized access to the database.
*   **SurrealDB Contribution:**  SurrealDB's authentication system is the gatekeeper to database access. Weaknesses or misconfigurations in this system directly lead to authentication bypass vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** An application uses default credentials for a SurrealDB administrative user. An attacker discovers these default credentials (e.g., through documentation or common default lists) and uses them to authenticate directly to SurrealDB, gaining full administrative privileges.
*   **Impact:** Complete database compromise, including unauthorized access to all data, ability to modify or delete data, and potential to disrupt database operations and availability.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Passwords and Secure Credential Management:** Enforce strong password policies for all SurrealDB users. Never use default credentials. Store and manage credentials securely, avoiding hardcoding in applications.
    *   **Regular Password Rotation:** Implement a policy for regular password rotation, especially for administrative accounts.
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Consider implementing MFA for administrative access to SurrealDB for an added layer of security.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for User Accounts:**  Avoid granting excessive privileges to user accounts. Create specific roles with limited permissions as needed.

## Attack Surface: [Authorization Flaws](./attack_surfaces/authorization_flaws.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting weaknesses in SurrealDB's authorization system to access or manipulate data beyond granted permissions.
*   **SurrealDB Contribution:** SurrealDB's permission system, based on namespaces, databases, tables, and potentially record-level permissions, controls data access. Misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in this system directly lead to authorization bypass.
*   **Example:** A user is granted read-only access to a specific table in SurrealDB. However, due to a misconfiguration in SurrealDB's permission rules or a flaw in its authorization logic, the user is able to execute `DELETE` or `UPDATE` queries on that table, modifying data they should only be able to read.
*   **Impact:** Data breach (unauthorized access to data), data manipulation (unauthorized modification or deletion of data), privilege escalation, potential for data integrity compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Permissions:**  Grant users and application roles only the minimum necessary permissions required to perform their functions.
    *   **Regular Permission Audits and Reviews:** Regularly review and audit SurrealDB permission configurations to ensure they are correctly implemented and aligned with security policies.
    *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement RBAC to manage permissions effectively and consistently, simplifying administration and reducing errors.
    *   **Thorough Testing of Authorization Rules:**  Thoroughly test authorization rules under various scenarios to ensure they function as intended and prevent unintended access or actions.

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Network Exposure](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_network_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Exposing the SurrealDB server to unauthorized network access, making it vulnerable to direct attacks.
*   **SurrealDB Contribution:** SurrealDB is a network service that listens on specific ports.  Direct exposure of these ports to untrusted networks without proper security measures is a direct SurrealDB related vulnerability.
*   **Example:** A SurrealDB server is deployed with default network settings and is directly accessible from the public internet on its default port (e.g., 8000 or 8001). Attackers can scan public IP ranges, discover the open SurrealDB port, and attempt to connect and exploit potential vulnerabilities directly.
*   **Impact:** Database compromise, data breach, denial of service, potential for lateral movement within the network if the server is compromised.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Network Segmentation and Firewalls:** Isolate the SurrealDB server within a private network segment, behind firewalls. Configure firewalls to restrict access to the SurrealDB server only from authorized sources (e.g., application servers).
    *   **Change Default Ports:** Change default SurrealDB ports to less common ports to reduce automated scanning and discovery attempts.
    *   **HTTPS/WSS Encryption:** Always use HTTPS for HTTP connections and WSS for WebSocket connections to encrypt communication between the application and the SurrealDB server, protecting data in transit.
    *   **VPN/SSH Tunneling (for sensitive environments):** For highly sensitive environments, consider using VPNs or SSH tunnels to further secure communication channels and restrict access to authorized networks.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Vulnerabilities in SurrealDB Software](./attack_surfaces/server-side_vulnerabilities_in_surrealdb_software.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities present in the SurrealDB server software itself, potentially leading to severe consequences.
*   **SurrealDB Contribution:** Like any software, SurrealDB may contain undiscovered or unpatched vulnerabilities in its codebase. These vulnerabilities are inherent to the SurrealDB software itself and can be exploited if not addressed.
*   **Example:** A critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability is discovered in a specific version of SurrealDB. An attacker exploits this vulnerability on a publicly accessible or poorly secured SurrealDB server to execute arbitrary code on the server, gaining complete control.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, complete server compromise, potential for data breaches and widespread system disruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep SurrealDB Updated:**  Regularly update SurrealDB to the latest stable version to patch known security vulnerabilities. Implement a robust patch management process.
    *   **Security Monitoring and Vulnerability Scanning:**  Actively monitor security advisories and release notes from the SurrealDB project. Periodically perform vulnerability scanning on the SurrealDB server to identify potential weaknesses.
    *   **Security Hardening:**  Follow SurrealDB's security hardening guidelines and best practices for server configuration to minimize the attack surface.
    *   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Implement IDS/IPS to detect and potentially block malicious activity targeting the SurrealDB server, providing an additional layer of defense.

## Attack Surface: [GraphQL API Specific Vulnerabilities (If Used)](./attack_surfaces/graphql_api_specific_vulnerabilities__if_used_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities specific to SurrealDB's GraphQL API implementation, if enabled.
*   **SurrealDB Contribution:** If the GraphQL API feature of SurrealDB is enabled, it introduces GraphQL-specific attack vectors that are directly related to how SurrealDB implements and exposes this API.
*   **Example:** GraphQL introspection is enabled in a production environment using SurrealDB's GraphQL API. An attacker uses introspection queries to discover the entire GraphQL schema, revealing sensitive data structures, types, and API endpoints that were intended to be kept private or less discoverable. This information is then used to craft more targeted and effective attacks.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure (schema details, potentially sensitive data structures), potential for denial of service through complex queries, authorization bypass if field-level authorization is not properly implemented.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable Introspection in Production:** Disable GraphQL introspection in production environments to prevent schema discovery by unauthorized parties.
    *   **Query Complexity Analysis and Limits:** Implement query complexity analysis and limits within the GraphQL API to prevent overly complex or nested queries that can lead to denial of service.
    *   **Rate Limiting for GraphQL Endpoints:** Apply rate limiting specifically to GraphQL endpoints to mitigate potential DoS attacks and abuse.
    *   **Field-Level Authorization:** Implement fine-grained authorization at the field level in GraphQL resolvers to control access to specific data fields and operations exposed through the GraphQL API.

## Attack Surface: [Data Storage Security (Lack of Encryption at Rest)](./attack_surfaces/data_storage_security__lack_of_encryption_at_rest_.md)

*   **Description:**  Compromising the confidentiality of data at rest stored by SurrealDB due to lack of encryption.
*   **SurrealDB Contribution:** SurrealDB manages persistent data storage. If encryption at rest is not enabled or properly configured within SurrealDB or the underlying storage system, it directly contributes to the risk of data breaches if storage media is compromised.
*   **Example:** A server hosting SurrealDB is physically stolen or storage media is improperly disposed of. If data at rest is not encrypted, an attacker who gains physical access to the storage can directly read and extract sensitive data without needing to bypass SurrealDB's authentication or authorization mechanisms.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, exposure of highly sensitive information, compliance violations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA), reputational damage, financial losses.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enable Encryption at Rest:** Enable encryption at rest for SurrealDB data storage. Investigate and utilize SurrealDB's built-in encryption features or leverage encryption capabilities provided by the underlying storage system (e.g., disk encryption, volume encryption).
    *   **Secure Backup Procedures with Encryption:** Implement secure backup procedures, including encryption of backups both in transit and at rest. Ensure backup storage is also secured with appropriate access controls.
    *   **Access Control for Storage Infrastructure:** Restrict physical and logical access to the server and storage media where SurrealDB data is stored. Implement strong access control policies and regularly audit access logs.
