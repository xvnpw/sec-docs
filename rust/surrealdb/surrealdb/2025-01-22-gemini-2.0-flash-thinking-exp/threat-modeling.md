# Threat Model Analysis for surrealdb/surrealdb

## Threat: [SurrealQL Injection](./threats/surrealql_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious SurrealQL code into application queries by manipulating user inputs that are not properly sanitized or parameterized. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary SurrealQL commands within the SurrealDB database.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized data access: Attacker can read sensitive data they are not authorized to access within SurrealDB.
    *   Data modification/deletion: Attacker can modify or delete data stored in SurrealDB, leading to data integrity issues or data loss.
    *   Privilege escalation: In some cases, attacker might be able to escalate privileges within the SurrealDB database itself.
*   **Affected SurrealDB Component:** SurrealQL Query Parser, SurrealQL Execution Engine
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Parameterized Queries:**  Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements when incorporating user input into SurrealQL queries to prevent injection.
    *   **Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization to reject or neutralize malicious input before it is used in SurrealDB queries.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only necessary database permissions to application users and roles within SurrealDB's permission system.
    *   **Code Review:** Regularly review application code that constructs SurrealQL queries to identify and remediate potential injection vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [DoS via Malicious Queries](./threats/dos_via_malicious_queries.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts and sends complex or resource-intensive SurrealQL queries specifically designed to overload the SurrealDB server. These queries consume excessive CPU, memory, or I/O resources on the SurrealDB server, making the database unresponsive to legitimate requests.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Service unavailability: The application relying on SurrealDB becomes slow or completely unavailable to users due to database overload.
    *   Performance degradation: Legitimate users experience slow response times and application instability due to database performance issues.
*   **Affected SurrealDB Component:** SurrealQL Execution Engine, Query Optimizer, Storage Engine
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Query Complexity Limits:** Implement limits on query complexity (e.g., maximum joins, aggregations) within SurrealDB configuration or application logic to prevent overly resource-intensive queries.
    *   **Query Timeouts:** Set timeouts for SurrealQL query execution within SurrealDB to prevent long-running queries from monopolizing resources.
    *   **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor SurrealDB server resource usage (CPU, memory, I/O) to detect and respond to DoS attacks based on query patterns.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting at the application level to restrict the number of requests to SurrealDB from a single source, mitigating query-based DoS.
    *   **Query Analysis and Optimization:** Analyze and optimize frequently executed SurrealQL queries to minimize their resource consumption on the SurrealDB server.

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass](./threats/authentication_bypass.md)

This could involve exploiting default credentials, flaws in the authentication protocol implemented by SurrealDB, or implementation errors within SurrealDB's authentication module.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Full database access: Attacker gains complete unauthorized control over the SurrealDB database and its data.
    *   Data breach: Attacker can access, modify, or delete all data within the SurrealDB database.
    *   System compromise: Compromise of the SurrealDB database can lead to wider system compromise if the database server is connected to other systems.
*   **Affected SurrealDB Component:** Authentication Module, User Management
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Credentials:** Change default administrative credentials for SurrealDB immediately upon deployment to prevent exploitation of known defaults.
    *   **Secure Authentication Methods:** Utilize strong and well-vetted authentication methods provided by SurrealDB, avoiding weaker or deprecated options.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Regularly audit SurrealDB configurations and authentication mechanisms for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Authentication):** Limit the number of users with administrative or high-privilege access to SurrealDB.
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Consider implementing MFA for administrative access to SurrealDB for enhanced security.

## Threat: [Authorization Bypass / Privilege Escalation](./threats/authorization_bypass__privilege_escalation.md)

*   **Description:** An authenticated attacker exploits vulnerabilities in SurrealDB's permission system or its implementation to bypass authorization checks or gain higher privileges than they are intended to have within SurrealDB.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized actions: Attacker can perform actions within SurrealDB that they are not authorized to perform, such as accessing, modifying, or deleting data outside their intended scope.
    *   Data breach: Potential for accessing sensitive data within SurrealDB due to escalated privileges.
    *   System compromise: Escalated privileges within SurrealDB can lead to further system compromise or data manipulation.
*   **Affected SurrealDB Component:** Permission System, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Robust Permission Model:** Carefully design and implement a robust permission model using SurrealDB's RBAC features to enforce access control.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Authorization):** Grant only the minimum necessary permissions to each role or user within SurrealDB's permission system.
    *   **Regular Permission Audits:** Regularly audit and review database permissions within SurrealDB to identify and correct misconfigurations or overly permissive settings.
    *   **Thorough Testing:** Thoroughly test authorization rules within SurrealDB to ensure they function as intended and prevent bypasses or unintended privilege escalation.
    *   **Separation of Duties:** Implement separation of duties within SurrealDB's user and role management to prevent a single user from accumulating excessive privileges.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle Attacks due to Lack of TLS Enforcement](./threats/man-in-the-middle_attacks_due_to_lack_of_tls_enforcement.md)

*   **Description:** If TLS/SSL encryption is not properly configured and enforced for communication between the application and the SurrealDB server, an attacker can intercept network traffic. This allows eavesdropping on sensitive data transmitted to and from SurrealDB, including credentials, queries, and data itself.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data breach: Exposure of sensitive data transmitted between the application and SurrealDB, including authentication tokens, SurrealQL queries, and database records.
