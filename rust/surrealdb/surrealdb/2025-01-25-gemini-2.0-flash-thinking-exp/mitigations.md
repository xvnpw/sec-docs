# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for surrealdb/surrealdb

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_robust_role-based_access_control__rbac_.md)

**Description:**
1.  Leverage SurrealDB's Scopes and Permissions system to define granular access control.
2.  Create dedicated SurrealDB users with minimal necessary privileges for each application component or service interacting with SurrealDB, avoiding the root user in application code.
3.  Define Scopes in SurrealDB that correspond to application roles (e.g., administrator scope, editor scope, viewer scope).
4.  Within each SurrealDB Scope, meticulously define permissions, specifying allowed actions (create, read, update, delete) on specific SurrealDB resources (namespaces, databases, tables, records, functions).
5.  In your application's authentication and authorization logic, map application roles to the appropriate SurrealDB Scopes. Upon successful application authentication, the application should establish a SurrealDB connection using credentials associated with the user's assigned Scope.
6.  Ensure all SurrealDB queries executed by the application are performed within the context of the authenticated user's SurrealDB Scope.
7.  Regularly audit and review SurrealDB Scope definitions and user assignments to ensure they adhere to the principle of least privilege and remain aligned with evolving application requirements.
**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Unauthorized Data Access (High Severity) - Prevents users from accessing SurrealDB data beyond their authorized Scopes and permissions.
*   Privilege Escalation within SurrealDB (High Severity) - Prevents users from gaining higher privileges within SurrealDB than intended by exploiting misconfigured Scopes or permissions.
*   Data Manipulation within SurrealDB (Medium Severity) - Reduces the risk of unauthorized modification or deletion of data within SurrealDB by limiting write and delete permissions based on Scopes.
**Impact:**
*   Unauthorized Data Access: Significantly reduces the risk by enforcing strict access controls directly within SurrealDB.
*   Privilege Escalation within SurrealDB: Significantly reduces the risk by limiting the capabilities granted by each Scope.
*   Data Manipulation within SurrealDB: Moderately reduces the risk by controlling write and delete access at the database level.
**Currently Implemented:**
*   Partially implemented. Basic SurrealDB Scopes are used to differentiate between 'admin' and 'user' roles in the application.
*   SurrealDB Scopes are applied for user profile data access and basic content retrieval.
**Missing Implementation:**
*   Granular permissions within SurrealDB Scopes are not fully defined for all tables and SurrealDB functions.
*   RBAC enforcement within the application is not consistently applied to all modules interacting with SurrealDB, especially reporting and analytics.
*   No automated auditing of SurrealDB Scopes and permissions is in place.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Parameterize SurrealQL Queries](./mitigation_strategies/parameterize_surrealql_queries.md)

**Description:**
1.  Identify all locations in the application code where SurrealQL queries are constructed to interact with SurrealDB.
2.  Refactor all dynamic SurrealQL queries to utilize parameterized queries or prepared statements provided by the SurrealDB client library.
3.  Employ the parameter binding mechanisms of the SurrealDB client library. Use placeholders in SurrealQL query strings (e.g., `$variable` or `?`) and pass user-provided input as separate parameters to the SurrealDB query execution function.
4.  Rely on the SurrealDB client library to handle the secure escaping and sanitization of parameters before sending the query to the SurrealDB server. This prevents user input from being directly interpreted as SurrealQL code.
5.  Thoroughly test all parameterized SurrealQL queries with diverse user inputs, including edge cases and potentially malicious strings, to validate the effectiveness of parameterization against SurrealQL injection vulnerabilities.
**Threats Mitigated:**
*   SurrealQL Injection (High Severity) - Prevents attackers from injecting malicious SurrealQL code through user input, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, data breaches, data manipulation within SurrealDB, or denial of service of the SurrealDB instance.
**Impact:**
*   SurrealQL Injection: Significantly reduces the risk by ensuring user input is treated as data, not executable SurrealQL code, when interacting with SurrealDB.
**Currently Implemented:**
*   Implemented in user authentication and registration modules using the SurrealDB JavaScript client.
*   Used for data retrieval operations in the main application content display that query SurrealDB.
**Missing Implementation:**
*   Not consistently implemented in all data modification operations (updates and deletes) interacting with SurrealDB across the application.
*   Legacy code sections or administrative scripts might still use string concatenation for building SurrealQL queries.
*   No automated code analysis or linting rules are in place to enforce the use of parameterized SurrealQL queries.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure SurrealDB Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/secure_surrealdb_configuration.md)

**Description:**
1.  Review and harden the SurrealDB server configuration file (`surreal.conf` or command-line arguments).
2.  Disable any unnecessary SurrealDB features or functionalities that are not required by your application to reduce the attack surface.
3.  Change default ports used by SurrealDB (if applicable and if it adds to your security posture in your specific network setup).
4.  Restrict network access to the SurrealDB server. Use firewall rules to allow connections only from authorized application servers or trusted networks.  Prevent direct public access to the SurrealDB server.
5.  If using SurrealDB's built-in authentication, ensure strong password policies are enforced for SurrealDB users.
6.  Regularly review SurrealDB's security best practices documentation and apply relevant recommendations to your SurrealDB configuration.
**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Unauthorized Access to SurrealDB Server (High Severity) - Prevents unauthorized individuals or systems from directly accessing the SurrealDB server and its data.
*   Exploitation of Default Configurations (Medium Severity) - Reduces the risk of attackers exploiting known vulnerabilities or weaknesses associated with default SurrealDB configurations.
*   Denial of Service against SurrealDB (Medium Severity) - By limiting access and disabling unnecessary features, the attack surface for DoS attacks against SurrealDB is reduced.
**Impact:**
*   Unauthorized Access to SurrealDB Server: Significantly reduces the risk by limiting network exposure and enforcing access controls at the server level.
*   Exploitation of Default Configurations: Moderately reduces the risk by hardening the server configuration.
*   Denial of Service against SurrealDB: Moderately reduces the risk by limiting attack vectors.
**Currently Implemented:**
*   Basic firewall rules are in place to restrict access to the SurrealDB server to application servers.
*   Default SurrealDB ports are used.
**Missing Implementation:**
*   Detailed review and hardening of `surreal.conf` is not yet performed.
*   Unnecessary SurrealDB features are not explicitly disabled.
*   Strong password policies for SurrealDB users are not formally defined or enforced beyond general password complexity guidelines in the application.
*   Regular review of SurrealDB security best practices and configuration is not scheduled.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Query Complexity Limits and Timeouts in SurrealDB](./mitigation_strategies/implement_query_complexity_limits_and_timeouts_in_surrealdb.md)

**Description:**
1.  Configure SurrealDB server-side settings to enforce limits on the complexity of incoming SurrealQL queries.  Consult SurrealDB documentation for specific configuration parameters related to query complexity limits (if available in the current version).
2.  Set appropriate timeouts for SurrealDB query execution. Configure SurrealDB to automatically terminate queries that exceed a defined execution time limit.
3.  These limits and timeouts should be configured to be reasonable for legitimate application queries but restrictive enough to prevent resource exhaustion from excessively complex or long-running malicious queries.
4.  Test the configured limits and timeouts to ensure they effectively prevent resource exhaustion without negatively impacting legitimate application functionality.
**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Denial of Service (DoS) via Complex Queries (High Severity) - Prevents attackers from overwhelming the SurrealDB server with excessively complex or resource-intensive queries, leading to performance degradation or service unavailability.
*   Resource Exhaustion on SurrealDB Server (High Severity) - Protects the SurrealDB server from resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, I/O) caused by malicious or poorly optimized queries.
**Impact:**
*   Denial of Service (DoS) via Complex Queries: Significantly reduces the risk by preventing resource exhaustion from complex queries.
*   Resource Exhaustion on SurrealDB Server: Significantly reduces the risk by limiting the impact of resource-intensive operations.
**Currently Implemented:**
*   No explicit query complexity limits or timeouts are currently configured in SurrealDB server settings.
**Missing Implementation:**
*   Configuration of query complexity limits and timeouts in SurrealDB server is not yet implemented.
*   Testing and tuning of appropriate limit values are required.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep SurrealDB Updated](./mitigation_strategies/keep_surrealdb_updated.md)

**Description:**
1.  Establish a proactive process for monitoring SurrealDB releases and security updates. Regularly check the official SurrealDB GitHub repository, release notes, and security advisory channels.
2.  Subscribe to SurrealDB's security mailing lists or notification services (if available) to receive timely alerts about security vulnerabilities and updates.
3.  Plan and schedule regular updates of the SurrealDB server and client libraries used in your application to the latest stable versions.
4.  Prioritize security updates and apply them promptly, especially for critical vulnerabilities.
5.  Thoroughly test updates in a non-production environment before deploying them to production to ensure compatibility and prevent regressions.
6.  Maintain a rollback plan to revert to the previous SurrealDB version in case an update introduces unforeseen issues.
**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Exploitation of Known SurrealDB Vulnerabilities (High Severity) - Prevents attackers from exploiting publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities present in older versions of SurrealDB.
*   Zero-Day Exploits (Medium Severity - Reduces Attack Surface) - While updates cannot directly prevent zero-day exploits, staying updated reduces the overall attack surface and ensures you benefit from the latest security improvements and bug fixes in SurrealDB.
**Impact:**
*   Exploitation of Known SurrealDB Vulnerabilities: Significantly reduces the risk by patching known weaknesses in SurrealDB.
*   Zero-Day Exploits: Moderately reduces the risk by maintaining a more secure and up-to-date SurrealDB system.
**Currently Implemented:**
*   SurrealDB server and client libraries are updated during major application deployments (approximately every 3-6 months).
**Missing Implementation:**
*   No automated system for tracking SurrealDB releases or security advisories.
*   Updates are not applied frequently enough to address potential vulnerabilities in a timely manner.
*   Testing of SurrealDB updates before production deployment is not consistently rigorous.
*   A formal rollback plan for SurrealDB updates is not documented or tested.
