### High and Critical SurrealDB Specific Threats

This document outlines potential security threats with high or critical severity that directly involve the SurrealDB database.

*   **Threat:** Leaked or Compromised SurrealDB Credentials
    *   **Description:** An attacker obtains valid credentials (username/password, API token) used to access the SurrealDB instance. This could be due to weak password policies, insecure storage of credentials by users or administrators, or vulnerabilities in systems managing these credentials. Once obtained, the attacker can authenticate and perform actions allowed by those credentials, such as reading, modifying, or deleting data.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach (unauthorized access to sensitive data), data manipulation (altering or deleting critical information), potential denial of service (if the attacker deletes essential data or configurations).
    *   **Affected Component:** Authentication module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong password policies for SurrealDB users and mandate regular password changes.
        *   Rotate API tokens regularly.
        *   Apply the principle of least privilege when granting permissions to users within SurrealDB, limiting their access to only the necessary data and operations.
        *   Monitor access logs for suspicious login attempts or activity within SurrealDB.

*   **Threat:** Insufficient or Incorrectly Configured SurrealDB Permissions
    *   **Description:** The SurrealDB schema or record-level permissions are not configured correctly, allowing users or even unauthenticated attackers (if authentication is bypassed or misconfigured within SurrealDB) to access or modify data they should not. This could involve overly permissive roles, missing row-level security policies, or flaws in the permission logic defined within SurrealDB. An attacker could exploit these misconfigurations to read sensitive data, modify critical records, or escalate their privileges within the database.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach (accessing unauthorized data), data manipulation (altering or deleting data without authorization), privilege escalation (gaining access to more powerful roles or data within SurrealDB).
    *   **Affected Component:** Authorization module, record permissions, schema definition.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully design and implement the SurrealDB schema and permissions based on the application's specific access control requirements.
        *   Utilize SurrealDB's granular permission system to restrict access at the record and field level.
        *   Regularly review and audit SurrealDB permissions to ensure they remain appropriate and aligned with the application's needs.
        *   Implement thorough testing of permission rules within SurrealDB to identify and rectify any vulnerabilities.
        *   Avoid using overly broad permissions like `ALL` unless absolutely necessary and with careful consideration of the potential risks.

*   **Threat:** SurrealQL Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious SurrealQL code into input fields or parameters that are directly incorporated into SurrealDB queries without proper sanitization or parameterization *within the application interacting with SurrealDB*. This allows the attacker to manipulate the intended query logic within SurrealDB, potentially bypassing security checks, accessing unauthorized data, modifying existing data, or even executing arbitrary commands on the SurrealDB server (depending on the server's configuration and permissions).
    *   **Impact:** Data breach (accessing sensitive data), data manipulation (altering or deleting data), potential server compromise (if the attacker can execute arbitrary commands within the SurrealDB context).
    *   **Affected Component:** Query parser, query execution engine.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements** when constructing SurrealQL queries with user-supplied input from the application. This prevents the interpretation of user input as executable code by SurrealDB.
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the application side *before* sending data to SurrealDB to filter out potentially malicious characters or patterns.

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) through Malicious Queries
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts complex, resource-intensive, or infinite loop-inducing SurrealQL queries that consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory, I/O) *within the SurrealDB instance*. By sending a large number of these malicious queries, the attacker can overwhelm the SurrealDB server, making it unresponsive and denying service to legitimate users.
    *   **Impact:** Application unavailability, performance degradation, potential SurrealDB server crash.
    *   **Affected Component:** Query execution engine, resource management.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement query timeouts on the application side to prevent long-running queries from monopolizing SurrealDB resources.
        *   Monitor SurrealDB server performance and resource usage to detect suspicious query patterns.
        *   Consider implementing query complexity limits or resource quotas within SurrealDB if available or through external mechanisms.
        *   Educate developers on writing efficient and optimized SurrealQL queries.
        *   Implement rate limiting on API endpoints that interact with SurrealDB to prevent a flood of malicious requests.

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Access to Underlying SurrealDB Data Files
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the file system where SurrealDB stores its data files. This could be due to misconfigured file system permissions or vulnerabilities in the operating system hosting SurrealDB. With direct access to the data files, the attacker can bypass SurrealDB's access control mechanisms and potentially read, modify, or delete the raw data.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach (accessing raw data), data corruption (modifying data directly), potential data loss (deleting data files).
    *   **Affected Component:** Storage engine, file system access.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure the file system where SurrealDB data is stored has appropriate permissions, restricting access to only authorized users and processes.
        *   Consider using disk encryption to protect the data at rest.
        *   Regularly back up SurrealDB data to a secure, off-site location.
        *   Harden the operating system and infrastructure hosting the SurrealDB instance.

*   **Threat:** Data Corruption or Loss due to SurrealDB Bugs or Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** A bug or vulnerability within the SurrealDB software itself could lead to data corruption or loss. This could be triggered by specific data inputs, query patterns, or internal errors within the database engine.
    *   **Impact:** Data integrity issues, application malfunction, potential data loss.
    *   **Affected Component:** Storage engine, potentially other core modules.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Stay updated with the latest SurrealDB releases and security patches.
        *   Monitor SurrealDB's issue tracker and security advisories for reported bugs and vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement robust data validation and integrity checks within the application to detect potential data corruption.
        *   Regularly back up SurrealDB data to enable recovery in case of data corruption or loss.

*   **Threat:** Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on SurrealDB Connections
    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts the network communication directly between the application and the SurrealDB server. If the connection is not properly encrypted using TLS/SSL *as configured within SurrealDB and the connecting client*, the attacker can eavesdrop on the communication, potentially capturing sensitive data like credentials or application data being exchanged with SurrealDB. They might also be able to modify the communication, leading to data manipulation or other malicious actions.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach (interception of sensitive data), credential compromise (capturing authentication details for SurrealDB), data manipulation (altering data in transit to or from SurrealDB).
    *   **Affected Component:** Network communication layer.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always use secure connections (TLS/SSL) when connecting to SurrealDB.** Ensure that the SurrealDB server is configured to enforce secure connections.
        *   Verify the authenticity of the SurrealDB server certificate to prevent connection to rogue servers.
        *   Ensure that the client library used by the application also supports and enforces secure connections to SurrealDB.

*   **Threat:** Insecure SurrealDB Server Configuration
    *   **Description:** The SurrealDB server is configured with insecure settings, such as using default passwords, exposing unnecessary ports, disabling security features, or running with overly permissive user accounts *within the SurrealDB instance*. These misconfigurations can create vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit to gain unauthorized access or compromise the server.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the database, data breach, potential server compromise, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Server configuration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow SurrealDB's security best practices for server configuration.
        *   Change default passwords immediately after installation.
        *   Only expose necessary ports and services for SurrealDB.
        *   Disable unnecessary features or plugins within SurrealDB.
        *   Run the SurrealDB server with the least privileged user account necessary on the host system.
        *   Regularly review and audit the SurrealDB server configuration.
