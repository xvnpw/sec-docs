## Focused Threat Model: High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes

**Objective:**
Attacker Goal: Compromise Application via SurrealDB Exploitation

**Sub-Tree of High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

*   Exploit SurrealDB Instance Directly **[CRITICAL]**
    *   Exploit Authentication/Authorization Weaknesses **[CRITICAL]**
        *   Default Credentials Exploitation **[CRITICAL]**
        *   Authentication Bypass Vulnerability **[CRITICAL]**
*   Exploit Application's Interaction with SurrealDB **[CRITICAL]**
    *   SurrealQL Injection **[CRITICAL]**
        *   Unsanitized Input in Queries **[CRITICAL]**

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**1. Exploit SurrealDB Instance Directly (Critical Node):**

*   This represents a direct attack on the SurrealDB database instance itself, bypassing the application layer. Success here grants the attacker significant control over the database and its data.

**2. Exploit Authentication/Authorization Weaknesses (Critical Node):**

*   This category focuses on compromising the mechanisms that control access to SurrealDB. If successful, an attacker can gain unauthorized entry and perform actions as a legitimate user or administrator.

**3. Default Credentials Exploitation (Critical Node, Part of High-Risk Path):**

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to log in to SurrealDB using default usernames and passwords that are often documented or easily guessable. If the administrators haven't changed these default credentials, access is trivially gained.
*   **Impact:** Full administrative access to the SurrealDB instance, allowing for complete data manipulation, deletion, and potentially even control over the server if vulnerabilities exist.

**4. Authentication Bypass Vulnerability (Critical Node, Part of High-Risk Path):**

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting a flaw or vulnerability in SurrealDB's authentication logic. This could involve sending specially crafted requests that trick the system into granting access without proper credentials. This often relies on known vulnerabilities or zero-day exploits.
*   **Impact:** Complete bypass of the authentication mechanism, granting the attacker full access to SurrealDB as if they were a legitimate, highly privileged user.

**5. Exploit Application's Interaction with SurrealDB (Critical Node):**

*   This category focuses on vulnerabilities arising from how the application interacts with the SurrealDB database. Even if the database itself is secure, flaws in the application's code can be exploited.

**6. SurrealQL Injection (Critical Node, Part of High-Risk Path):**

*   This is a critical vulnerability where attacker-controlled input is incorporated into SurrealDB queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**7. Unsanitized Input in Queries (Critical Node, Part of High-Risk Path):**

*   **Attack Vector:** The application directly embeds user-provided data into SurrealDB queries without proper escaping or using parameterized queries. An attacker can then inject malicious SurrealQL code within their input, which is then executed by the database.
*   **Impact:**  The attacker can execute arbitrary SurrealQL queries, potentially leading to:
    *   **Data Breach:** Stealing sensitive data from the database.
    *   **Data Manipulation:** Modifying or deleting data.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:**  Executing queries with higher privileges than the application normally has.
    *   **Denial of Service:** Crafting queries that consume excessive resources.
    *   In some cases, depending on SurrealDB's features and configuration, it might even be possible to achieve remote code execution on the database server.
