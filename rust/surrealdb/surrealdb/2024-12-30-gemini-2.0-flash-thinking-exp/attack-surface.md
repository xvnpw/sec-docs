Here's the updated key attack surface list focusing on high and critical risks directly involving SurrealDB:

*   **Unencrypted Client-Server Communication**
    *   **Description:** Data transmitted between the application and the SurrealDB server is not encrypted.
    *   **How SurrealDB Contributes:**  While SurrealDB supports TLS, it might not be enforced by default or properly configured. The underlying protocol itself, if unencrypted, is vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** An attacker on the same network as the application and SurrealDB server intercepts credentials or sensitive data being transmitted.
    *   **Impact:** Confidential data breach, unauthorized access to the database.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce TLS Encryption: Configure SurrealDB to require TLS encryption for all client connections.
        *   Proper Certificate Management: Ensure valid and properly configured TLS certificates are used.

*   **SurrealQL Injection Vulnerabilities**
    *   **Description:** User-provided input is directly incorporated into SurrealQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.
    *   **How SurrealDB Contributes:**  SurrealDB's query language, SurrealQL, is susceptible to injection attacks if developers don't follow secure coding practices.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious input that, when used in a SurrealQL query, allows them to bypass authentication, access unauthorized data, or modify existing data. For instance, `SELECT * FROM user WHERE name = '"+ malicious_input +"'`.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion; potential for command execution on the database server (depending on future features or vulnerabilities).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Parameterized Queries: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to ensure user input is treated as data, not executable code.
        *   Input Sanitization and Validation:  Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user-provided input before incorporating it into SurrealQL queries.

*   **Weak or Default Authentication Credentials**
    *   **Description:**  Default or easily guessable credentials are used for root, namespace, or database level access.
    *   **How SurrealDB Contributes:** SurrealDB requires proper configuration of authentication credentials. If defaults are not changed or weak passwords are used, it becomes a significant vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uses default credentials to gain administrative access to the SurrealDB instance, allowing them to manipulate data, create new users, or even shut down the database.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the database, including data breaches, data manipulation, and denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strong Password Policies: Enforce strong password policies for all SurrealDB users.
        *   Change Default Credentials: Immediately change all default usernames and passwords upon installation.

*   **Insufficient Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
    *   **Description:**  Permissions within SurrealDB are not configured granularly enough, granting users excessive privileges.
    *   **How SurrealDB Contributes:** SurrealDB's RBAC system needs to be carefully configured to limit user access to only the necessary data and operations.
    *   **Example:** A user with read access to a specific table gains unintended write access due to overly broad role assignments, allowing them to modify sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion by internal users or compromised accounts.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Principle of Least Privilege:  Grant users only the minimum necessary permissions required for their roles.
        *   Granular Role Definition: Define specific roles with fine-grained permissions for different database objects and operations.

*   **Exposure of Unprotected SurrealDB Port**
    *   **Description:** The default SurrealDB port (e.g., 8000 or 8001) is exposed to the internet without proper firewalling or access controls.
    *   **How SurrealDB Contributes:**  SurrealDB listens on a specific port for client connections. If this port is publicly accessible, it becomes a direct target for attacks.
    *   **Example:** An attacker scans open ports and finds an exposed SurrealDB instance. They can then attempt to exploit authentication vulnerabilities or launch denial-of-service attacks.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access attempts, potential data breaches, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Firewall Configuration: Configure firewalls to restrict access to the SurrealDB port to only authorized IP addresses or networks.
        *   Network Segmentation:  Keep the SurrealDB server on an internal network, not directly exposed to the internet.
