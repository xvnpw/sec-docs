# Threat Model Analysis for surrealdb/surrealdb

## Threat: [Weak or Default Root Credentials](./threats/weak_or_default_root_credentials.md)

*   **Threat:** Weak or Default Root Credentials
    *   **Description:** An attacker could attempt to log in to the SurrealDB instance using default credentials (if not changed) or easily guessable passwords for the root user. This could be done through direct connection if exposed.
    *   **Impact:** Full administrative control over the SurrealDB instance, allowing the attacker to read, modify, or delete any data, create or drop databases, and potentially execute arbitrary code if SurrealDB features allow for it (e.g., through functions).
    *   **Affected Component:** Authentication Module
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong, unique passwords for the root user and any other administrative accounts during initial setup.
        *   Disable or remove default accounts if possible.
        *   Regularly rotate administrative credentials.
        *   Restrict network access to the SurrealDB instance to prevent direct unauthorized connections.

## Threat: [SurrealQL Injection](./threats/surrealql_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** SurrealQL Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious SurrealQL code into application inputs that are then used to construct database queries. This could be achieved by manipulating data sources that the application uses to build dynamic SurrealQL queries. The injected code could be designed to bypass security checks, access unauthorized data, modify existing data, or even execute database functions with elevated privileges.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach (reading sensitive data), data manipulation (modifying or deleting data), potential for privilege escalation if injected code manipulates roles or permissions.
    *   **Affected Component:** SurrealQL Query Parser and Execution Engine
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Utilize parameterized queries or prepared statements:** This prevents user-supplied input from being directly interpreted as code.
        *   **Implement strict input validation and sanitization:**  Validate all inputs against expected formats and sanitize any potentially harmful characters before incorporating them into SurrealQL queries.
        *   Apply the principle of least privilege to the database user used by the application.

## Threat: [Insecure User-Defined Functions](./threats/insecure_user-defined_functions.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure User-Defined Functions
    *   **Description:** If SurrealDB allows for user-defined functions, an attacker could exploit vulnerabilities within these functions. This could involve injecting malicious code into the function definition itself (if allowed) or providing crafted input that triggers vulnerabilities within the function's logic, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the server hosting SurrealDB, potentially leading to full server compromise. Data breaches or manipulation could also occur depending on the function's purpose and privileges.
    *   **Affected Component:** User-Defined Function Execution Engine
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly vet and audit all user-defined functions.
        *   Apply strict input validation within functions.
        *   Restrict the capabilities of user-defined functions.
        *   Consider disabling user-defined functions if not strictly necessary.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in SurrealDB Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_surrealdb_dependencies.md)

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in SurrealDB Dependencies
    *   **Description:** SurrealDB, like any software, relies on other libraries and dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could potentially be exploited to compromise the SurrealDB instance.
    *   **Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency, but could range from denial of service to remote code execution.
    *   **Affected Component:** SurrealDB's Dependency Management and potentially various internal modules utilizing vulnerable dependencies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability (can be High or Critical).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update SurrealDB to the latest version.
        *   Monitor security advisories for SurrealDB and its dependencies.
        *   Consider using dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities.
