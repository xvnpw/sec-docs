## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit SurrealDB Authentication/Authorization Weaknesses [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_surrealdb_authenticationauthorization_weaknesses__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers aim to bypass or compromise the mechanisms that control access to the SurrealDB instance. This could involve exploiting flaws in how users are authenticated (verified) or how their permissions are managed (authorized). Successful exploitation grants unauthorized access to the database.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Brute-force/Dictionary Attack on SurrealDB Credentials [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__brute-forcedictionary_attack_on_surrealdb_credentials__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to guess valid usernames and passwords for SurrealDB accounts by systematically trying a large number of possibilities. This is particularly effective if default or weak passwords are used. Successful brute-forcing grants direct access to the SurrealDB instance.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Token Leakage/Theft](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__token_leakagetheft.md)

**Attack Vector:** SurrealDB often uses tokens for authentication. If these tokens are stored or transmitted insecurely (e.g., in plain text, over unencrypted connections, in easily accessible locations), attackers can steal them and use them to impersonate legitimate users, gaining unauthorized access without needing credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit SurrealQL Injection Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_surrealql_injection_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the application constructs SurrealQL queries by directly embedding user-supplied input without proper sanitization or parameterization, attackers can inject malicious SurrealQL code. This injected code can manipulate the query's logic, allowing attackers to bypass security checks, access or modify unauthorized data, or potentially execute commands on the database server.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit SurrealDB Server Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_surrealdb_server_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** This involves targeting security flaws within the SurrealDB server software itself. These vulnerabilities could allow attackers to perform various malicious actions, such as remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in SurrealDB Version](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_surrealdb_version.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the application uses an outdated version of SurrealDB, it may be susceptible to publicly known security vulnerabilities for which exploits are readily available. Attackers can leverage these exploits to compromise the SurrealDB instance.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers craft specific SurrealQL queries or initiate actions that are designed to consume excessive resources on the SurrealDB server (e.g., CPU, memory, I/O). This can overwhelm the server, making it unresponsive and denying service to legitimate users of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Misconfigurations in SurrealDB Deployment [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_misconfigurations_in_surrealdb_deployment__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** This category covers vulnerabilities arising from how SurrealDB is set up and configured. Insecure configurations can create pathways for attackers to gain unauthorized access or disrupt the service.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Insecure Network Configuration [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__insecure_network_configuration__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the SurrealDB instance is exposed to the public internet or untrusted networks without proper firewall rules and access controls, attackers can directly connect to the database and attempt to exploit vulnerabilities or brute-force credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Weak or Default Configuration Settings](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__weak_or_default_configuration_settings.md)

**Attack Vector:** Using default or weak configuration settings for SurrealDB (e.g., default passwords, insecure listeners, overly permissive access controls) makes it easier for attackers to gain unauthorized access or exploit known weaknesses.
