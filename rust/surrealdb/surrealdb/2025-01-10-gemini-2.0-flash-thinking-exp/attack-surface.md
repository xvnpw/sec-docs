# Attack Surface Analysis for surrealdb/surrealdb

## Attack Surface: [SurrealQL Injection](./attack_surfaces/surrealql_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious SurrealQL code into application inputs that are then used to construct database queries. This can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or even code execution within the database context.
*   **How SurrealDB Contributes:** SurrealDB's query language, SurrealQL, is the primary interface for interacting with the database. If input sanitization is lacking, applications are vulnerable to SurrealQL injection.
*   **Example:** An application takes a user-provided name to search for records. A malicious user inputs: `"test" OR 1=1 --`. If the query is constructed as `SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '` + userInput + `'`, the injected code will bypass the intended `WHERE` clause, potentially returning all user data.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, privilege escalation within the database, potential denial of service if malicious queries are resource-intensive.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements:**  Use SurrealDB's mechanisms for parameterized queries to separate SQL code from user-provided data. This prevents the database from interpreting user input as executable code.
    *   **Input Sanitization and Validation:**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user inputs before using them in SurrealQL queries. Enforce data types and expected formats.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant database users and application connections only the necessary permissions required for their operations. Avoid using highly privileged accounts for routine tasks.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication and Authorization Bypass](./attack_surfaces/authentication_and_authorization_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers find ways to circumvent authentication mechanisms or bypass authorization checks to gain unauthorized access to the database or specific data.
*   **How SurrealDB Contributes:** SurrealDB's authentication methods (username/password, tokens) and authorization model (namespaces, databases, permissions) are crucial for security. Weaknesses in their implementation or configuration can lead to bypasses.
*   **Example:** An application uses JWT tokens for authentication with SurrealDB. If the secret key used to sign these tokens is compromised, an attacker can forge valid tokens and gain access as any user. Alternatively, if database permissions are misconfigured, a user might gain access to namespaces or tables they shouldn't.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data manipulation, account takeover, potential compromise of the entire application and its data.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Authentication Practices:** Enforce strong password policies, consider multi-factor authentication where applicable, and securely manage API keys and tokens.
    *   **Secure Token Management:**  Use secure methods for generating, storing, and transmitting authentication tokens. Protect signing keys and use appropriate expiration times.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Authorization):**  Carefully configure SurrealDB's authorization model, granting only the necessary permissions to users and roles at the namespace, database, table, and even record level. Regularly review and audit these permissions.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct periodic security audits of the application's authentication and authorization implementation, including SurrealDB configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of SurrealDB Endpoints](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_surrealdb_endpoints.md)

*   **Description:** The SurrealDB server's API endpoints (e.g., `/sql`, `/rpc`) are directly accessible, potentially allowing attackers to interact with the database without going through the application's intended access controls.
*   **How SurrealDB Contributes:** SurrealDB exposes these endpoints for client communication. If not properly secured, they become direct attack vectors.
*   **Example:** If the SurrealDB server is exposed directly to the internet without proper firewall rules, an attacker could send arbitrary SurrealQL queries to the `/sql` endpoint, potentially bypassing application logic and accessing or modifying data directly.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, denial of service, potential for complete database compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Network Segmentation and Firewalls:** Restrict access to the SurrealDB server to only authorized hosts and networks (e.g., the application server). Use firewalls to block external access to the database ports.
    *   **Secure Connection Protocols (TLS/HTTPS):** Enforce the use of TLS/HTTPS for all communication between the application and SurrealDB to encrypt data in transit and prevent eavesdropping.
    *   **Authentication Required for Endpoints:** Ensure that all SurrealDB API endpoints require proper authentication before allowing access.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**  SurrealDB is configured with insecure default settings or configurations that introduce vulnerabilities.
*   **How SurrealDB Contributes:**  Like any software, SurrealDB has configuration options that can impact security. Insecure defaults or misconfigurations can create weaknesses.
*   **Example:**  The default `root` user having a weak or default password, or allowing anonymous access to certain namespaces or databases. Disabling security features for development and forgetting to re-enable them in production.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, data breaches, potential for complete database compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Follow Security Hardening Guidelines:**  Consult the official SurrealDB documentation and security best practices for recommended configurations.
    *   **Change Default Credentials:**  Immediately change all default passwords and credentials for administrative accounts.
    *   **Disable Unnecessary Features:** Disable any features or functionalities that are not required for the application's operation.
    *   **Regularly Review Configuration:** Periodically review SurrealDB's configuration settings to ensure they align with security best practices.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in SurrealDB Software](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_surrealdb_software.md)

*   **Description:**  Bugs or security flaws exist within the SurrealDB codebase itself, which attackers can exploit.
*   **How SurrealDB Contributes:**  As with any software, SurrealDB is susceptible to vulnerabilities in its code.
*   **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability in the SurrealDB server could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server by sending a specially crafted request.
*   **Impact:**  Denial of service, arbitrary code execution on the database server, data breaches, potential for complete system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep SurrealDB Updated:**  Regularly update SurrealDB to the latest stable version to patch known security vulnerabilities. Subscribe to security advisories and release notes.
    *   **Monitor for Security Advisories:** Stay informed about any reported security vulnerabilities in SurrealDB and apply necessary patches promptly.
    *   **Consider Security Scanning:** Use security scanning tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in the SurrealDB installation and configuration.

## Attack Surface: [Data Serialization/Deserialization Issues](./attack_surfaces/data_serializationdeserialization_issues.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities arise from how data is converted into a format for transmission or storage (serialization) and then back into its original format (deserialization). Attackers might inject malicious payloads during this process.
*   **How SurrealDB Contributes:** SurrealDB handles data serialization and deserialization for communication and storage. Flaws in these processes can be exploited.
*   **Example:** If SurrealDB uses a vulnerable serialization library, an attacker might send a crafted serialized object that, when deserialized by the server, executes arbitrary code.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the database server, denial of service, data corruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use Secure Serialization Libraries:** Ensure SurrealDB and its dependencies use secure and up-to-date serialization libraries.
    *   **Input Validation on Deserialized Data:**  Thoroughly validate data after it has been deserialized to prevent the execution of unexpected code or actions.
    *   **Restrict Deserialization Sources:** Limit the sources from which the application accepts serialized data.
