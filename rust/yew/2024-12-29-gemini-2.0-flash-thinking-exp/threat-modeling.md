### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving Yew

Here's an updated threat list focusing on high and critical severity threats that directly involve the Yew framework:

*   **Threat:** Unsafe Rust Code Exploitation
    *   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities arising from the use of `unsafe` Rust code within the Yew application's logic. This might involve crafting specific inputs or triggering certain application states that cause memory corruption (e.g., buffer overflows, use-after-free) within the WebAssembly module.
    *   **Impact:**  Memory corruption can lead to application crashes, denial of service, or potentially, in more severe scenarios, the ability to execute arbitrary code within the WASM sandbox.
    *   **Affected Yew Component:** Rust code compiled to WebAssembly, specifically modules or functions containing `unsafe` blocks or performing manual memory management.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Minimize the use of `unsafe` code.
        *   Thoroughly review and audit all `unsafe` blocks.
        *   Utilize memory-safe Rust abstractions and libraries.
        *   Employ static analysis tools to detect potential memory safety issues.
        *   Conduct rigorous testing, including fuzzing, to identify memory corruption vulnerabilities.

*   **Threat:** Passing Unsanitized Data to JavaScript Interop
    *   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities if data from the Rust/WASM side is passed to JavaScript without proper sanitization or encoding. This could lead to client-side vulnerabilities like DOM-based XSS if the JavaScript code directly renders this unsanitized data into the DOM.
    *   **Impact:**  Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.
    *   **Affected Yew Component:** The `wasm-bindgen` layer and any Rust code that interacts with JavaScript through `JsValue` or similar mechanisms.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always sanitize or encode data before passing it from Rust/WASM to JavaScript, especially if it will be rendered in the DOM.
        *   Be cautious when using methods like `JsValue::from_str_unchecked`.
        *   Prefer safer methods for passing data and interacting with the DOM.

*   **Threat:** Supply Chain Attacks on Yew Dependencies
    *   **Description:** An attacker could compromise dependencies used by the Yew project itself, injecting malicious code that gets included in the final WebAssembly bundle.
    *   **Impact:**  Potentially severe, as malicious code could gain significant control over the application's functionality and data.
    *   **Affected Yew Component:**  The Yew project's dependencies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use dependency scanning tools to detect potential issues.
        *   Verify the integrity of dependencies using checksums or other methods.
        *   Be mindful of the security practices of upstream crate maintainers.
        *   Consider using a private registry for internal dependencies.
        *   Regularly audit the project's dependency tree.
