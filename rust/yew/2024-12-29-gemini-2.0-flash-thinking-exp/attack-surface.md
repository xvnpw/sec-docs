* **Unsafe HTML Rendering in Components:**
    * **Description:** Rendering user-provided or external data directly as HTML within a Yew component without proper sanitization.
    * **How Yew Contributes:** While Yew's virtual DOM generally encourages safe rendering, developers can bypass this by using methods like `dangerously_set_inner_html` or by directly manipulating DOM elements through JavaScript interop after rendering.
    * **Example:** A blog application component that displays user comments directly using `dangerously_set_inner_html` without sanitizing the comment content. An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript within a comment.
    * **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, or arbitrary actions on behalf of the user.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Always sanitize user-provided or external data before rendering it as HTML. Utilize libraries specifically designed for HTML sanitization in Rust (e.g., `ammonia`). Avoid `dangerously_set_inner_html` unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution. Rely on Yew's virtual DOM for safe rendering of dynamic content.

* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via JavaScript Interoperability:**
    * **Description:**  Exploiting the interaction between Yew (Rust/Wasm) and JavaScript to inject and execute malicious scripts in the user's browser.
    * **How Yew Contributes:** Yew applications often need to interact with the browser's JavaScript environment using `wasm-bindgen`. If data passed from Rust to JavaScript is used to dynamically manipulate the DOM or execute code without proper sanitization on the JavaScript side, it can lead to XSS.
    * **Example:** A Yew component sends user input to a JavaScript function that directly inserts it into the DOM using `innerHTML` without escaping.
    * **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), with the same potential consequences as above.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Sanitize data on the Rust side *before* passing it to JavaScript. If DOM manipulation is necessary in JavaScript, use safe methods like creating and appending elements with text content instead of directly using `innerHTML` with unsanitized data. Review and secure any JavaScript code interacting with the Yew application.

* **Insecure Route Handling:**
    * **Description:** Flaws in how Yew applications define and handle routes, potentially allowing unauthorized access or manipulation of application state.
    * **How Yew Contributes:** Yew's routing mechanism, while generally secure, relies on developers to define routes and associated logic correctly. Incorrect route guards or flawed matching logic can create vulnerabilities.
    * **Example:** A route guard intended to restrict access to admin pages has a logic error, allowing unauthenticated users to bypass it by crafting a specific URL.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality, privilege escalation.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Implement robust and well-tested route guards to control access to different parts of the application. Carefully define route matching patterns to avoid unintended overlaps or bypasses. Regularly review and audit routing configurations.

* **State Management Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Description:** Security issues arising from how component state is managed and updated, potentially leading to data corruption or unauthorized modifications.
    * **How Yew Contributes:** Yew's component model relies on managing state. If state updates are not handled securely, especially in asynchronous scenarios or when dealing with shared state, vulnerabilities can occur.
    * **Example:** A race condition in state updates allows an attacker to manipulate the application's state in an unintended way, leading to incorrect data being displayed or processed.
    * **Impact:** Data corruption, inconsistent application behavior, potential for privilege escalation if state controls access.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Carefully manage state updates, especially in asynchronous operations. Consider using state management patterns that provide better control and predictability. Avoid directly mutating state and rely on Yew's update mechanisms.
