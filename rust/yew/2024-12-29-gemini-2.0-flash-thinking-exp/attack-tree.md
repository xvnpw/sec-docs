## Focused Threat Model: High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes in Yew Application

**Goal:** Compromise Yew Application

**Sub-Tree:**

* Compromise Yew Application (CRITICAL NODE)
    * AND
        * Manipulate Rendering and DOM Interactions (CRITICAL NODE)
            * OR
                * Client-Side XSS via Unsafe Rendering of User Input (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)
        * Abuse Interoperability with JavaScript (CRITICAL NODE)
            * OR
                * Exploit `js_sys` or `wasm_bindgen` Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH)
        * Exploit WebAssembly Specifics (CRITICAL NODE)
            * OR
                * WASM Runtime Vulnerabilities (Less Yew Specific, but Relevant) (CRITICAL NODE)
                * Memory Corruption within WASM Module (HIGH-RISK PATH)

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**Critical Nodes:**

* **Compromise Yew Application (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized access or control over the application or its data.

* **Manipulate Rendering and DOM Interactions (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * This category of attacks targets how Yew renders the user interface and interacts with the browser's Document Object Model (DOM). Successful attacks here can lead to the execution of malicious scripts in the user's browser.

* **Abuse Interoperability with JavaScript (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * Yew applications often need to interact with JavaScript code. This boundary can be a point of weakness if not handled securely. Exploiting this can allow attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code or bypass security restrictions.

* **Exploit WebAssembly Specifics (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * Since Yew compiles to WebAssembly, vulnerabilities specific to the WASM environment can be exploited. These attacks can have a significant impact on the application's security and stability.

* **WASM Runtime Vulnerabilities (Less Yew Specific, but Relevant) (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * While not directly a vulnerability in Yew itself, flaws in the underlying WebAssembly runtime environment (typically within the browser) can be exploited to compromise the application.

**High-Risk Paths:**

* **Client-Side XSS via Unsafe Rendering of User Input (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE):**
    * **Description:** Exploiting Yew's rendering mechanisms to inject and execute malicious scripts when displaying user-provided data without proper sanitization.
    * **Likelihood:** High
    * **Impact:** High (client-side XSS)
    * **Effort:** Low to Medium
    * **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

* **Exploit `js_sys` or `wasm_bindgen` Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * **Description:** Leveraging known vulnerabilities or misuse of the `js_sys` or `wasm_bindgen` crates to execute arbitrary JavaScript code or bypass security restrictions.
    * **Likelihood:** Low
    * **Impact:** High (arbitrary JavaScript execution)
    * **Effort:** Medium to High
    * **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High

* **Memory Corruption within WASM Module (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * **Description:** Triggering memory corruption within the compiled WASM module through specific interactions or data manipulation, potentially leading to crashes or exploitable states.
    * **Likelihood:** Low
    * **Impact:** High (potential for crashes or exploitable states)
    * **Effort:** High
    * **Skill Level:** Advanced
    * **Detection Difficulty:** High
