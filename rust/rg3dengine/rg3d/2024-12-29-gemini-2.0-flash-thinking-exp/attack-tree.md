Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:

* **[[Compromise Application Using rg3d]] (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * This is the ultimate goal and represents any successful exploitation of rg3d vulnerabilities leading to control or access over the application.

* **[[Exploit Asset Loading Vulnerabilities]] (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * **Supply Malicious 3D Model -> Crafted Model with Buffer Overflow -> Potential for remote code execution:**
        * Attack Vector: An attacker crafts a 3D model file with malicious data that, when parsed by rg3d, overflows a buffer, potentially allowing the attacker to overwrite memory and execute arbitrary code.
    * **Supply Malicious Texture -> Crafted Texture with Buffer Overflow -> Potential for remote code execution:**
        * Attack Vector: Similar to the model exploit, a crafted texture file contains malicious data leading to a buffer overflow and potential remote code execution.
    * **Exploit Path Traversal in Asset Loading -> Load arbitrary files from the application's file system -> Access sensitive configuration files:**
        * Attack Vector: By manipulating file paths during asset loading, an attacker can trick the application into loading files from unintended locations, potentially exposing sensitive configuration data.
    * **Exploit Path Traversal in Asset Loading -> Load arbitrary files from the application's file system -> Overwrite application binaries or data:**
        * Attack Vector: With write access or by exploiting further vulnerabilities, an attacker could use path traversal to overwrite critical application files, leading to compromise or denial of service.
    * **Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities (if rg3d uses serialization for assets) -> Supply crafted serialized asset containing malicious code -> Achieve remote code execution upon deserialization:**
        * Attack Vector: If rg3d uses serialization for asset loading, a crafted serialized asset can contain malicious code that gets executed when the asset is deserialized.

* **[[Exploit Rendering Pipeline Vulnerabilities]] (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * **Supply Malicious Shader Code (if application allows custom shaders) -> Leak sensitive information (e.g., memory contents):**
        * Attack Vector: A malicious shader program is injected that reads and potentially transmits sensitive data from the application's memory.
    * **Supply Malicious Shader Code (if application allows custom shaders) -> Achieve arbitrary code execution on the GPU (potentially impacting the system):**
        * Attack Vector: A carefully crafted shader program exploits vulnerabilities in the GPU driver or rendering pipeline to execute arbitrary code on the GPU, potentially affecting the entire system.

* **[[Exploit Networking Vulnerabilities (If application utilizes rg3d's networking features)]] (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * **Send Malformed Network Packets -> Trigger buffer overflows leading to potential code execution:**
        * Attack Vector: Sending specially crafted network packets with oversized or unexpected data can overflow buffers in the networking code, potentially allowing for remote code execution.
    * **Exploit Protocol Logic Errors -> Manipulate network communication to bypass authentication or authorization:**
        * Attack Vector: By understanding and exploiting flaws in the network protocol's logic, an attacker can bypass authentication or authorization mechanisms to gain unauthorized access.

* **[[Exploit Scripting Engine Vulnerabilities (If application utilizes rg3d's scripting capabilities)]] (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * **Inject Malicious Script Code -> Execute arbitrary code within the application's scripting environment:**
        * Attack Vector: An attacker injects malicious code into the scripting environment, allowing them to execute arbitrary commands within the application's context.
    * **Inject Malicious Script Code -> Execute arbitrary code within the application's scripting environment -> Gain access to application data or resources:**
        * Attack Vector: Once code execution is achieved within the scripting environment, the attacker can access and manipulate application data and resources.
    * **Inject Malicious Script Code -> Execute arbitrary code within the application's scripting environment -> Potentially escalate privileges:**
        * Attack Vector: By exploiting further vulnerabilities or misconfigurations, the attacker might be able to escalate their privileges within the application or even the underlying system.

* **[[Exploit Native Code Vulnerabilities in rg3d]] (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * **Trigger Memory Safety Issues (Despite Rust's safety features, logic errors can exist) -> Cause crashes due to out-of-bounds access or use-after-free (if unsafe code is used):**
        * Attack Vector: Logic errors in rg3d's native code, especially within `unsafe` blocks, can lead to memory safety violations like out-of-bounds access or use-after-free, causing crashes.
    * **Trigger Memory Safety Issues (Despite Rust's safety features, logic errors can exist) -> Potentially lead to memory corruption that can be exploited:**
        * Attack Vector: More severe memory safety issues can lead to memory corruption that an attacker can manipulate to achieve code execution.

* **[[Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities in rg3d's Libraries]] (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * **Identify known vulnerabilities in rg3d's dependencies -> Exploit these vulnerabilities through the application's use of rg3d -> Achieve remote code execution:**
        * Attack Vector: rg3d relies on third-party libraries. If these libraries have known vulnerabilities, an attacker can exploit them through the application's use of rg3d, potentially achieving remote code execution.
