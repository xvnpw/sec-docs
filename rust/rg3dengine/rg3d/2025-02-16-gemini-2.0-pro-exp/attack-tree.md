## Attack Tree Path: [[Exploit Resource Loading Vulnerabilities] [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/_exploit_resource_loading_vulnerabilities___hr_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the primary high-risk attack vector.  It involves exploiting vulnerabilities in how rg3d loads and processes various resource types (scenes, models, textures). The attacker crafts a malicious resource that, when loaded by the application, triggers a vulnerability, leading to RCE.
    *   **Why High-Risk:**
        *   **Higher Likelihood:** Resource parsing code is often complex, handling various formats and edge cases, making it prone to vulnerabilities.
        *   **High Impact:** Successful exploitation typically leads to RCE, granting the attacker significant control over the application and potentially the underlying system.
        *   **Easier Exploitation (URL Vector):** The ability to load resources from a URL controlled by the attacker significantly simplifies the attack.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies (High-Level):**
        *   Strict input validation and sanitization of URLs and file paths.
        *   Loading resources only from trusted sources.
        *   Implementing integrity checks (checksums, digital signatures) for loaded resources.
        *   Using secure resource loading mechanisms (sandboxing, separate processes).
        *   Thorough format validation of loaded resources before processing.
        *   Fuzz testing of resource loading and parsing functions.

## Attack Tree Path: [[Malicious Scene] [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/_malicious_scene___hr_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker creates a specially crafted scene file (.rgs or other supported formats) that exploits vulnerabilities in the scene parser within rg3d.
    *   **Attack Steps (Example):**
        1.  The attacker identifies a vulnerability in the rg3d scene parser (e.g., a buffer overflow, an integer overflow, a type confusion error).
        2.  The attacker crafts a scene file that triggers this vulnerability when parsed.
        3.  The attacker hosts the malicious scene file on a web server they control.
        4.  The attacker tricks the application into loading the scene file from the malicious URL (e.g., through social engineering, a phishing link, or exploiting another vulnerability that allows them to control the scene loading process).
        5.  When rg3d parses the malicious scene file, the vulnerability is triggered, leading to RCE.
    *   **Example Vulnerability Types:**
        *   Buffer overflows in string handling.
        *   Integer overflows in array indexing.
        *   Type confusion errors when handling different scene node types.
        *   Use-after-free errors due to incorrect memory management.

## Attack Tree Path: [[Malicious Model] [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/_malicious_model___hr_.md)

*   **Description:** Similar to a malicious scene, but the attacker crafts a malicious model file (e.g., FBX, glTF, or other formats supported by rg3d).
    *   **Attack Steps (Example):** Analogous to the Malicious Scene attack steps, but targeting the model loading and processing code.
    *   **Example Vulnerability Types:**
        *   Vulnerabilities in the parsing of complex model formats (e.g., handling animation data, skeletal structures, material properties).
        *   Buffer overflows when processing vertex data or texture coordinates.
        *   Integer overflows in calculations related to model geometry.

## Attack Tree Path: [[Malicious Texture] [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/_malicious_texture___hr_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker crafts a malicious image file (PNG, JPG, etc.) that exploits vulnerabilities in the image decoding libraries used by rg3d (e.g., image-rs or other dependencies).
    *   **Attack Steps (Example):** Analogous to the Malicious Scene attack steps, but targeting the image decoding process.
    *   **Example Vulnerability Types:**
        *   Vulnerabilities in specific image format parsers (e.g., a heap overflow in a PNG decoder).
        *   Integer overflows in image dimension calculations.
        *   Out-of-bounds reads or writes during image processing.

## Attack Tree Path: [[URL] [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/_url___hr_.md)

*   **Description:** This represents the delivery mechanism for the malicious resource. The attacker hosts the malicious file on a web server under their control and induces the application to load it via a URL.
    *   **Why High-Risk:**
        *   **Remote Exploitation:** This allows for remote attacks without requiring prior access to the target system.
        *   **Ease of Delivery:** Attackers can use various techniques (phishing, social engineering, XSS) to trick users or applications into loading resources from malicious URLs.
        *   **Bypass Local Protections:** Loading from a URL can bypass some local security measures that might be in place for files on the local filesystem.
