# Threat Model Analysis for rg3dengine/rg3d

## Threat: [Malicious Model Loading (Buffer Overflow)](./threats/malicious_model_loading__buffer_overflow_.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Model Loading (Buffer Overflow)

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious 3D model file (e.g., FBX, glTF) containing specially crafted data designed to trigger a buffer overflow in rg3d's model parsing code.  The vulnerability lies within rg3d's handling of the model data.
    *   **Impact:**  Code execution within the Wasm module, potentially leading to game manipulation, data theft, or (in a worst-case scenario, if a Wasm sandbox escape is possible) compromise of the user's browser.
    *   **Affected rg3d Component:** `rg3d::resource::model` (Model loading and parsing functions), potentially specific format parsers (e.g., FBX, glTF importers).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Implement rigorous validation of all model file data before parsing. Check for expected data sizes, types, and structures.
        *   **Fuzz Testing:**  Fuzz the model loading functions with a variety of malformed and edge-case inputs to identify potential vulnerabilities.
        *   **Memory Safety:** Utilize Rust's memory safety features (borrow checker, etc.) to prevent buffer overflows and other memory-related errors.
        *   **Sandboxing:** If feasible, isolate the model parsing process in a separate Wasm module or thread with limited privileges.
        *   **Asset Integrity:** Verify the integrity of model files using cryptographic hashes (e.g., SHA-256) before loading.

## Threat: [Malicious Texture Loading (Code Injection)](./threats/malicious_texture_loading__code_injection_.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Texture Loading (Code Injection)

    *   **Description:** An attacker creates a malicious texture file (e.g., PNG, JPEG) that exploits a vulnerability in rg3d's image decoding library. This is a direct vulnerability within rg3d's texture handling or its chosen image decoding libraries.
    *   **Impact:** Code execution within the Wasm module, similar to the malicious model loading threat.
    *   **Affected rg3d Component:** `rg3d::resource::texture` (Texture loading and decoding functions), potentially specific image format decoders (e.g., PNG, JPEG libraries).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Image Libraries:** Use well-vetted and up-to-date image decoding libraries with a strong security track record.
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate image file headers and data before decoding.
        *   **Fuzz Testing:** Fuzz the texture loading and decoding functions.
        *   **Asset Integrity:** Verify texture file integrity using cryptographic hashes.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Consider isolating the image decoding process.

## Threat: [Physics Engine Exploit (Deterministic Simulation Bypass)](./threats/physics_engine_exploit__deterministic_simulation_bypass_.md)

*   **Threat:**  Physics Engine Exploit (Deterministic Simulation Bypass)

    *   **Description:** An attacker identifies a flaw in the *rg3d physics engine's* calculations or exploits non-deterministic behavior to gain an unfair advantage. This focuses on vulnerabilities *within* the physics engine's logic, not just general game logic.
    *   **Impact:** Disruption of gameplay, unfair advantage for the attacker, potential for denial-of-service if the exploit causes instability *due to a physics engine bug*.
    *   **Affected rg3d Component:** `rg3d::physics` (Physics engine module, including collision detection, rigid body simulation, and constraint solvers).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Server-Side Authority:** Implement server-side validation of all physics-related events and game state.  The server should be the ultimate authority on object positions, velocities, and interactions.  This mitigates the *impact* of a physics engine bug.
        *   **Deterministic Physics:**  Use deterministic physics simulations whenever possible to ensure consistency.  Avoid randomness in critical physics calculations *within rg3d*.
        *   **Input Sanitization:**  Sanitize and validate all user input that affects physics parameters (forces, impulses, object properties) *before they reach the rg3d physics engine*.
        *   **Anti-Cheat Measures:** Implement anti-cheat systems to detect and prevent common physics exploits. This is a secondary mitigation.
        *   **Fuzz Testing:** Fuzz test the physics engine with a variety of inputs and edge cases.

## Threat: [Sound Engine Exploit (Malicious Audio File)](./threats/sound_engine_exploit__malicious_audio_file_.md)

*   **Threat:**  Sound Engine Exploit (Malicious Audio File)

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious audio file (e.g., WAV, OGG) that exploits a vulnerability in *rg3d's sound engine* or its chosen audio decoding library. This is a direct vulnerability within rg3d's audio handling.
    *   **Impact:** Code execution within the Wasm module.
    *   **Affected rg3d Component:** `rg3d::sound` (Sound engine module, including audio decoding and playback).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Audio Libraries:** Use well-vetted and up-to-date audio decoding libraries.
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate audio file headers and data before decoding.
        *   **Fuzz Testing:** Fuzz the audio decoding functions.
        *   **Asset Integrity:** Verify audio file integrity.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Consider isolating the audio decoding process.

## Threat: [Scripting Engine Vulnerability (Malicious Script Injection)](./threats/scripting_engine_vulnerability__malicious_script_injection_.md)

*   **Threat:** Scripting Engine Vulnerability (Malicious Script Injection)

    *   **Description:** If the game uses rg3d's scripting capabilities, and if user-provided scripts are allowed *or* if the scripting engine has access to sensitive rg3d APIs, an attacker could inject a malicious script. The vulnerability is in how rg3d exposes its API to the scripting engine or in the scripting engine itself.
    *   **Impact:**  Code execution within the Wasm module, potentially with access to game state and other sensitive data *managed by rg3d*.
    *   **Affected rg3d Component:** `rg3d::script` (Scripting engine integration), and the specific scripting engine used (e.g., Lua runtime).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (if user-provided scripts are allowed or if rg3d APIs are exposed),
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Restricted Scripting Environment:**  Carefully restrict the capabilities of the scripting engine.  Limit access to sensitive *rg3d* APIs and resources.  Use a sandbox.
        *   **Input Validation:**  Sanitize and validate all user-provided scripts before execution.
        *   **Secure Scripting Engine:** Use a well-vetted and up-to-date scripting engine.
        *   **Code Review:**  Thoroughly review the code that integrates the scripting engine with *rg3d* to ensure that it is secure.  Focus on the API exposed to scripts.
