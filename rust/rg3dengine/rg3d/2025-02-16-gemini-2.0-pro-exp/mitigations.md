# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for rg3dengine/rg3d

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rigorous `unsafe` Code Management (rg3d Core)](./mitigation_strategies/rigorous__unsafe__code_management__rg3d_core_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify:** Locate all instances of `unsafe` code blocks within the rg3d codebase.
    2.  **Minimize:** Refactor rg3d's internal code to reduce reliance on `unsafe` where safe alternatives exist. Prioritize safe Rust constructs.
    3.  **Isolate:** Encapsulate `unsafe` operations within small, well-defined functions or modules *within rg3d*. Create safe, public interfaces.
    4.  **Document:** Thoroughly document *every* `unsafe` block in the rg3d source. Explain *why* `unsafe` is necessary, assumptions, and risks.
    5.  **Review:** Mandate code reviews by at least two experienced developers for *any* change to `unsafe` code *within rg3d*. Focus on memory safety.
    6.  **Static Analysis:** Integrate static analysis tools (Clippy, rust-analyzer) into rg3d's CI/CD pipeline. Configure strict rules.
    7.  **Fuzzing:** Develop fuzz tests specifically targeting the inputs and outputs of `unsafe` functions *within rg3d*. Use `cargo fuzz`.
    8.  **Runtime Checks (Debug):** Add `debug_assert!` statements within `unsafe` blocks in rg3d to check for invalid conditions during development.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Memory Corruption (Critical):** Reduces risk of memory corruption within rg3d itself.
    *   **Data Races (High):** Minimizes data races in rg3d's multi-threaded code (if any).
    *   **Undefined Behavior (High):** Prevents undefined behavior originating from rg3d's `unsafe` code.
    *   **Use-After-Free (Critical):** Prevents usage of memory after it has been freed inside rg3d.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Memory Corruption:** Significantly reduces risk within the engine (e.g., 80-90%).
    *   **Data Races:** Moderate to high reduction (e.g., 60-80%).
    *   **Undefined Behavior:** High reduction (e.g., 70-90%).
    *   **Use-After-Free:** Significantly reduces the risk (e.g., 80-90% reduction with comprehensive measures).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   rg3d uses `unsafe` in various places.
    *   Some `unsafe` blocks are likely documented.
    *   Clippy and rust-analyzer are likely used.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive documentation of *all* `unsafe` blocks.
    *   Formalized, rigorous code review process for `unsafe` changes.
    *   Extensive fuzzing of all `unsafe` interaction points.
    *   Systematic use of `debug_assert!` in all `unsafe` blocks.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Dependency Management (rg3d's `Cargo.toml`)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_dependency_management__rg3d's__cargo_toml__.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Audit:** Run `cargo audit` regularly on rg3d's `Cargo.toml` (CI/CD pipeline).
    2.  **Outdated:** Use `cargo outdated` to identify outdated dependencies of rg3d.
    3.  **Pinning:** In rg3d's `Cargo.toml`, pin dependencies to specific versions using `=`.
    4.  **Review:** Before adding *any* new dependency to rg3d, review its source code.
    5.  **Minimalism:** Avoid adding unnecessary dependencies to rg3d.
    6.  **Update Carefully:** When updating rg3d's dependencies, review changelogs and diffs.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks (High):** Reduces risk of rg3d incorporating malicious dependencies.
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities (High):** Prevents rg3d from using dependencies with known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Dependency Confusion (Medium):** Pinning versions helps prevent accidentally pulling in a malicious package with a similar name in rg3d.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks:** Moderate reduction (e.g., 50-70%).
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities:** High reduction (e.g., 80-90%).
    *   **Dependency Confusion:** High reduction (e.g. 90% reduction).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   rg3d has a `Cargo.toml`.
    *   Basic dependency management exists.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Automated `cargo audit` and `cargo outdated` in rg3d's CI/CD.
    *   Formal dependency review process before adding to rg3d.
    *   Strict version pinning might not be consistent.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Robust Resource Validation (rg3d's Internal Loaders)](./mitigation_strategies/robust_resource_validation__rg3d's_internal_loaders_.md)

*   **Description:** This focuses on rg3d's *own* internal resource loading, *not* the game using rg3d.
    1.  **Identify Resources:** List all resource types *internally* loaded by rg3d (e.g., for its editor, built-in shaders).
    2.  **Define Schemas:** For each internal resource type, define a clear schema.
    3.  **Validate:** Implement validation logic *within rg3d* before parsing/deserializing its own resources. Check file type, data types, size limits, data ranges, and structure.
    4.  **Safe Deserialization:** Use `serde` (or similar) within rg3d for its internal deserialization.
    5.  **Error Handling:** Handle parsing and validation errors gracefully within rg3d.
    6.  **Limit File Access:** Restrict rg3d's ability to read files to only necessary directories.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution (Critical):** Prevents exploits through malformed resources loaded *by rg3d itself*.
    *   **Denial of Service (High):** Mitigates DoS against rg3d via large/malformed internal resources.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium):** Reduces risk of info leaks from rg3d's error handling.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** High reduction (e.g., 80-95%) within rg3d.
    *   **Denial of Service:** High reduction (e.g., 70-90%) for rg3d's internal operations.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Moderate reduction (e.g., 50-70%).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   rg3d likely has internal resource loading.
    *   `serde` is probably used.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive, schema-based validation for *all* of rg3d's *internal* resources.
    *   Strict size/range checks might be inconsistent.
    *   Robust error handling and prevention of information leakage in rg3d's loaders.
    *   Limiting file access might not be implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Physics Engine Hardening (Rapier within rg3d)](./mitigation_strategies/physics_engine_hardening__rapier_within_rg3d_.md)

* **Description:**
    1. **Input Clamping:** Within rg3d's integration with Rapier, clamp or limit the values of inputs to the physics engine (forces, velocities, etc.) to prevent extreme values.
    2. **Sanity Checks:** Add sanity checks within rg3d's physics simulation loop (where it interacts with Rapier) to detect and handle unrealistic situations.
    3. **Fuzzing (Rapier Integration):** If rg3d has custom code that heavily interacts with Rapier, fuzz those interaction points *within rg3d's codebase*.
    4. **Rapier Updates:** Keep the Rapier dependency within rg3d updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security improvements in Rapier itself.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (High):** Reduces the risk of crashes or hangs caused by extreme physics inputs or unexpected simulation behavior within rg3d.
    *   **Logic Errors (Medium):** Helps prevent unexpected game behavior due to physics glitches originating from rg3d's interaction with Rapier.

* **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service:** Moderate to high reduction (e.g., 60-80%) in rg3d.
    *   **Logic Errors:** Moderate reduction (e.g., 40-60%).

* **Currently Implemented:**
    *   rg3d uses Rapier.
    *   Some basic input handling likely exists.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive input clamping and sanity checks in all of rg3d's Rapier interaction code.
    *   Dedicated fuzzing of rg3d's Rapier integration.
    *   A process for ensuring timely updates of the Rapier dependency within rg3d.
