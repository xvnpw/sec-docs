# Attack Surface Analysis for rg3dengine/rg3d

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Asset Loading (Scene, Model, Texture, Sound, Shader Files)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_asset_loading__scene__model__texture__sound__shader_files_.md)

*Description:* Attackers craft malicious asset files (e.g., .rgs, .fbx, .png, .ogg, shaders) to exploit vulnerabilities in rg3d's parsing and processing logic.
*How rg3d Contributes:* rg3d *is directly responsible* for parsing and loading these assets. Vulnerabilities in its parsing code (or the parsing libraries it *directly uses and integrates*) are the core issue.
*Example:* A crafted .rgs file with an excessively large string triggers a buffer overflow in rg3d's .rgs parser. A malicious FBX file exploits a vulnerability in the Assimp library *as used by rg3d*. A malicious shader exploits a vulnerability in how rg3d passes data to the graphics API.
*Impact:* Denial of service (application crash), arbitrary code execution (gaining control of the user's system), data exfiltration.
*Risk Severity:* Critical (for code execution), High (for denial of service).
*Mitigation Strategies:
    *Developers:*
        *   **Fuzz Testing:** Rigorously fuzz test *all* asset parsers within rg3d (including those using external libraries) with malformed inputs.
        *   **Input Validation:** Implement strict validation of *all* data read from asset files within rg3d's parsing code.
        *   **Memory Safety:** Maximize Rust's memory safety features. Minimize and thoroughly review `unsafe` code in rg3d's asset handling.
        *   **Dependency Management:** Keep third-party libraries *directly used by rg3d* (Assimp, image/audio decoders) up-to-date. Use `cargo audit`.  Consider vendoring critical dependencies for tighter control.
        *   **Sandboxing (Advanced):** Isolate rg3d's asset loading in a separate, less-privileged process.

## Attack Surface: [Network Protocol Exploits (if rg3d's networking is used)](./attack_surfaces/network_protocol_exploits__if_rg3d's_networking_is_used_.md)

*Description:* If the application uses rg3d's *own* networking features (not just a separate networking library), attackers can send malicious packets to exploit vulnerabilities in rg3d's network protocol handling.
*How rg3d Contributes:* This applies *only if* rg3d provides its *own* networking implementation or significantly modifies/wraps a lower-level library. The vulnerability lies in *rg3d's code* handling network communication.
*Example:* A crafted packet with an invalid length field causes a buffer overflow in *rg3d's network code*.  rg3d's game state synchronization logic has flaws allowing manipulation.
*Impact:* Denial of service, remote code execution, game manipulation, data breaches.
*Risk Severity:* Critical (for remote code execution), High (for denial of service and game manipulation).
*Mitigation Strategies:
    *Developers:*
        *   **If Custom Protocol:** Design with security in mind (clear formats, length fields, checksums).  Thorough code review and fuzz testing of *rg3d's network code*.
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate *all* data received from the network *within rg3d's handling*.
        *   **Authentication/Authorization/Encryption:** Implement these within rg3d's networking if it handles these aspects.

## Attack Surface: [Scripting Engine Vulnerabilities (if rg3d integrates scripting)](./attack_surfaces/scripting_engine_vulnerabilities__if_rg3d_integrates_scripting_.md)

*Description:* If rg3d *directly integrates* a scripting engine (e.g., Lua), attackers can provide malicious scripts to escape the sandbox and execute arbitrary code.
*How rg3d Contributes:* The vulnerability lies in how rg3d *integrates and configures* the scripting engine, and the security of the bindings *rg3d provides* to the engine.
*Example:* A malicious script exploits a vulnerability in the Lua engine's API bindings *as exposed by rg3d* to access system functions.
*Impact:* Arbitrary code execution, system compromise.
*Risk Severity:* Critical.
*Mitigation Strategies:
    *Developers:*
        *   **Secure Scripting Engine:** Choose an engine with a strong security record.
        *   **Restrict API Access:** *Carefully control* which system APIs are exposed to the scripting engine *through rg3d's bindings*.
        *   **Code Review:** Thoroughly review rg3d's scripting engine integration and API bindings.
        *   **Script Signing (Advanced):** Implement within rg3d if it handles script loading.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep the scripting engine version used by rg3d updated.
