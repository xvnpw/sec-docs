# Deep Analysis: Scripting Engine Vulnerability (Malicious Script Injection) in rg3d

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to:

*   Fully understand the potential attack vectors related to malicious script injection within an rg3d-based application.
*   Identify specific vulnerabilities within the application's use of rg3d's scripting capabilities.
*   Assess the potential impact of a successful attack.
*   Provide concrete, actionable recommendations to mitigate the identified risks.
*   Prioritize remediation efforts based on the severity and likelihood of exploitation.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the interaction between the application, the `rg3d::script` module, and the chosen scripting engine (e.g., Lua, potentially others supported by rg3d in the future).  It considers:

*   **User-Provided Scripts:**  Scenarios where the application allows users to upload or input scripts (e.g., mods, custom game logic).  This is the highest-risk scenario.
*   **Developer-Provided Scripts:**  Even scripts written by the development team can be a source of vulnerabilities if they inadvertently expose sensitive APIs or handle user input insecurely.
*   **rg3d API Exposure:**  The specific rg3d functions and data accessible to the scripting environment.  This is crucial for understanding the potential damage an attacker could inflict.
*   **Scripting Engine Choice:** The inherent security characteristics of the chosen scripting engine (e.g., Lua's sandboxing capabilities, or lack thereof).
*   **Wasm Module Context:**  The limitations and capabilities of the WebAssembly environment in which the game and scripting engine operate.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   General WebAssembly security vulnerabilities unrelated to scripting.
*   Vulnerabilities in other parts of the application that are not directly related to the scripting engine integration.
*   Network-level attacks (unless they directly facilitate script injection).

### 1.3. Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methods:

1.  **Code Review:**  A thorough examination of the application's source code, focusing on:
    *   How the scripting engine is initialized and configured.
    *   How scripts are loaded, validated (or not), and executed.
    *   The interface between the rg3d engine and the scripting environment (the exposed API).
    *   Any handling of user input within scripts.
    *   Error handling and logging related to script execution.

2.  **Static Analysis:**  Using automated tools (if available and suitable for the chosen scripting language and Wasm) to identify potential security flaws, such as:
    *   Unsanitized input.
    *   Use of dangerous functions.
    *   Potential buffer overflows or other memory safety issues.

3.  **Dynamic Analysis (Fuzzing):**  If user-provided scripts are allowed, fuzzing will be used to test the scripting engine's resilience to malformed or malicious input.  This involves providing a wide range of unexpected inputs to the script execution process and monitoring for crashes, errors, or unexpected behavior.

4.  **Dependency Analysis:**  Examining the chosen scripting engine and any related libraries for known vulnerabilities.  This includes checking for CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) and reviewing security advisories.

5.  **Threat Modeling Refinement:**  Iteratively refining the threat model based on the findings of the code review, static analysis, and dynamic analysis.

6.  **Documentation Review:**  Reviewing the rg3d documentation and the documentation for the chosen scripting engine to understand best practices and security recommendations.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

### 2.1. Attack Vectors

Several attack vectors could lead to malicious script injection:

*   **Direct Script Upload:**  If the application allows users to upload script files (e.g., for mods), an attacker could upload a malicious script.
*   **In-Game Script Editor:**  If the application provides an in-game script editor, an attacker could directly enter malicious code.
*   **Network-Based Injection:**  If scripts are loaded from a remote server, an attacker could compromise the server or perform a man-in-the-middle attack to inject a malicious script.
*   **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Developer-Provided Scripts:**  An attacker could find a vulnerability in a pre-existing script (e.g., a script that processes user input) and use it to inject their own code.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in UI:** If the game's UI is implemented using web technologies and is vulnerable to XSS, an attacker could inject JavaScript that interacts with the Wasm module and potentially triggers malicious script execution.

### 2.2. Vulnerability Analysis (rg3d Specifics)

The core vulnerability lies in the potential for the scripting engine to access and manipulate sensitive parts of the rg3d engine.  Here's a breakdown of potential issues:

*   **Unrestricted API Access:**  If the scripting engine has unrestricted access to the `rg3d::scene::Scene` object, an attacker could:
    *   Modify the game world (add/remove nodes, change properties).
    *   Access and manipulate other players' data (if the game is multiplayer and this data is stored in the scene).
    *   Potentially trigger crashes or denial-of-service by creating excessive objects or performing resource-intensive operations.
*   **Access to `rg3d::resource::ResourceManager`:**  An attacker could potentially load malicious resources or overwrite existing resources.
*   **Access to `rg3d::engine::Engine`:**  This would provide the highest level of control, potentially allowing the attacker to:
    *   Modify engine settings.
    *   Access input events.
    *   Even potentially shut down the engine.
*   **Lack of Sandboxing:**  If the scripting engine (e.g., Lua) is not properly sandboxed, a malicious script could potentially:
    *   Access the file system (if the Wasm environment allows it).
    *   Make network requests (again, if allowed by the Wasm environment).
    *   Interact with other parts of the Wasm module in unintended ways.
*   **Insecure Script Loading:**  If scripts are loaded without proper validation, an attacker could inject malicious code disguised as a legitimate script.
* **Vulnerabilities in Scripting Engine** Itself, like Lua, can be exploited.

### 2.3. Impact Assessment

The impact of a successful attack could range from minor annoyances to severe consequences:

*   **Minor:**  Glitches, visual artifacts, minor gameplay disruptions.
*   **Moderate:**  Significant gameplay disruptions, cheating, unfair advantages.
*   **Major:**  Denial-of-service, data breaches (if sensitive data is accessible to the scripting engine), potential compromise of the user's system (depending on the Wasm environment's security).
* **Critical:** Remote code execution.

### 2.4. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

Here are detailed mitigation strategies, building upon the initial threat model:

*   **1. Restricted Scripting Environment (Sandboxing):**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  The scripting engine should only have access to the *absolute minimum* set of rg3d APIs required for its intended functionality.
    *   **API Whitelisting:**  Create a whitelist of allowed rg3d functions and data that scripts can access.  *Do not* use a blacklist (it's too easy to miss something).
    *   **Custom API Wrapper:**  Instead of directly exposing rg3d APIs, create a custom wrapper layer that provides a safer, more controlled interface to the scripting engine.  This wrapper can perform additional validation and sanitization.
    *   **Lua Sandboxing (if using Lua):**  Lua has built-in sandboxing capabilities.  Use them!  This typically involves creating a new environment with a restricted set of global variables and functions.  Carefully control what is exposed to this environment.
        *   `setfenv` (Lua 5.1) or `_ENV` (Lua 5.2+) are key functions for this.
        *   Consider using a dedicated Lua sandboxing library for enhanced security.
    *   **Resource Limits:**  Implement limits on the resources that scripts can consume (e.g., memory, CPU time, number of objects created).  This can prevent denial-of-service attacks.

*   **2. Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Strict Validation:**  If user-provided scripts are allowed, implement *extremely* strict validation.  This goes beyond simple syntax checks.
    *   **Whitelist-Based Approach:**  Define a whitelist of allowed characters, keywords, and constructs.  Reject anything that doesn't match the whitelist.
    *   **Static Analysis (if possible):**  Use static analysis tools to scan user-provided scripts for potentially dangerous patterns before execution.
    *   **No Dynamic Code Generation:**  Avoid using functions like `eval()` or `loadstring()` (in Lua) with user-provided input.  These are extremely dangerous.

*   **3. Secure Scripting Engine:**
    *   **Keep it Updated:**  Regularly update the scripting engine to the latest version to patch any known security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Vulnerability Research:**  Before choosing a scripting engine, research its security track record.  Look for CVEs and security advisories.
    *   **Consider Alternatives:**  If the chosen scripting engine has a history of security issues, consider using a different engine or even writing a custom, highly restricted scripting language specifically for the game.

*   **4. Code Review (Focus Areas):**
    *   **API Exposure:**  Pay close attention to how rg3d APIs are exposed to the scripting engine.  Ensure that only the necessary functions and data are accessible.
    *   **Script Loading:**  Review the code that loads and executes scripts.  Ensure that it performs proper validation and sanitization.
    *   **Error Handling:**  Ensure that errors during script execution are handled gracefully and do not expose sensitive information or lead to further vulnerabilities.
    *   **Input Handling:**  If scripts interact with user input, review how this input is handled to prevent injection attacks.

*   **5. WebAssembly Security Considerations:**
    *   **WASI (WebAssembly System Interface):**  If using WASI, carefully control the capabilities granted to the Wasm module.  Limit access to the file system, network, and other system resources.
    *   **Memory Safety:**  WebAssembly is generally memory-safe, but vulnerabilities can still exist.  Use a language with strong memory safety guarantees (like Rust) for the core game logic.

* **6. Monitoring and Logging:**
    *  Implement robust logging of script execution, including any errors or warnings.
    *  Monitor script behavior for anomalies that could indicate malicious activity.

## 3. Prioritized Recommendations

1.  **Immediate Action (Highest Priority):**
    *   **Implement API Whitelisting:**  Create a strict whitelist of allowed rg3d APIs for the scripting engine.  This is the most critical step to limit the potential damage of a successful attack.
    *   **Implement Basic Sandboxing:**  Use the scripting engine's built-in sandboxing capabilities (e.g., `setfenv` in Lua) to create a restricted execution environment.
    *   **Review Script Loading Code:**  Ensure that scripts are loaded securely and that any user-provided input is properly validated.

2.  **Short-Term (High Priority):**
    *   **Implement a Custom API Wrapper:**  Create a wrapper layer around the rg3d APIs to provide a safer and more controlled interface for scripts.
    *   **Implement Resource Limits:**  Set limits on the resources that scripts can consume.
    *   **Thorough Code Review:**  Conduct a comprehensive code review of the scripting engine integration, focusing on the areas mentioned above.

3.  **Long-Term (Medium Priority):**
    *   **Fuzzing:**  If user-provided scripts are allowed, implement fuzzing to test the scripting engine's resilience to malicious input.
    *   **Static Analysis:**  Explore the use of static analysis tools to automatically identify potential vulnerabilities in scripts.
    *   **Continuous Monitoring:**  Implement ongoing monitoring of script behavior and security logs.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of the entire application, including the scripting engine integration.
