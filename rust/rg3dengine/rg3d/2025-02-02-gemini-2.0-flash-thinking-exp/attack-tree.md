```

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise rg3d Application [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_rg3d_application__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** This is the ultimate goal. All subsequent nodes and paths contribute to achieving this.
    * **Impact:** Full compromise of the application, including unauthorized access, control, data breaches, and disruption of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit rg3d Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_rg3d_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:**  Focuses on exploiting weaknesses inherent in the rg3d engine itself, rather than application-specific logic.
    * **Impact:**  Can lead to a wide range of compromises depending on the specific vulnerability, from crashes and DoS to remote code execution and data breaches.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Asset Exploitation [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/3__asset_exploitation__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vectors**:
    * **Malicious Asset Injection [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Mechanism:** Injecting malicious assets (3D models, textures, scenes, sounds) into the application's asset loading process. This could be through modifying asset files, manipulating asset paths, or exploiting vulnerabilities in asset management systems.
        * **Impact:** Code execution if assets contain embedded scripts or exploit parsing vulnerabilities, memory corruption due to malformed assets, DoS by resource exhaustion, data exfiltration if malicious assets are designed to steal data.
    * **Asset Format Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Mechanism:** Exploiting vulnerabilities within rg3d's asset parsers. These parsers handle various file formats (model formats, texture formats, scene formats). Vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, integer overflows, or logic errors in these parsers can be triggered by malformed asset files.
        * **Impact:** Buffer overflows and memory corruption leading to crashes or arbitrary code execution during asset loading.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Client-Side Exploits via Network Messages [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/4__client-side_exploits_via_network_messages__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Crafting malicious network messages and sending them to clients running the rg3d application.
    * **Mechanism:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in how the client-side rg3d application handles network messages. This could involve vulnerabilities in network protocol parsing, game logic triggered by network messages, or deserialization of network data.
    * **Impact:** Client-side crashes, remote code execution on client machines, manipulation of the game state on the client, potentially leading to unfair advantages or other forms of game compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Engine API Misuse/Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/5__engine_api_misusevulnerabilities.md)

* **Unsafe API Usage by Application Developers [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Application developers unintentionally introduce vulnerabilities by misusing the rg3d API.
        * **Mechanism:** Incorrect memory management (leaks, double frees), insecure function calls, improper handling of API return values, or using deprecated/vulnerable API functions.
        * **Impact:** Memory leaks leading to performance degradation or crashes, crashes due to memory corruption, security vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers if the misuse creates exploitable conditions.
    * **Vulnerabilities in rg3d API Itself [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Exploiting inherent vulnerabilities within the rg3d engine's API code.
        * **Mechanism:** Buffer overflows, integer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, logic errors, or other common software vulnerabilities present in the rg3d API functions themselves.
        * **Impact:** Application crashes, remote code execution if API vulnerabilities are exploitable, privilege escalation if vulnerabilities allow bypassing security checks or gaining elevated permissions.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Dependency Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/6__dependency_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

* **Vulnerable Third-Party Libraries [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries that rg3d depends on.
        * **Mechanism:** rg3d uses various third-party libraries for tasks like image loading, audio processing, networking, etc. If these libraries have known vulnerabilities, and rg3d uses vulnerable versions, attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities through the rg3d application.
        * **Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the specific vulnerability in the dependency, including remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, and other forms of compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. Application is Vulnerable to Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/7__application_is_vulnerable_to_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** This is a prerequisite for exploiting any rg3d vulnerability. The application must be designed and implemented in a way that allows rg3d vulnerabilities to be reachable and exploitable by attackers.
    * **Impact:**  Without application-level vulnerabilities, even if rg3d has weaknesses, they might not be exploitable in a real-world scenario.

## Attack Tree Path: [8. Application Exposes rg3d Functionality to Untrusted Input [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/8__application_exposes_rg3d_functionality_to_untrusted_input__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:**  The application design directly exposes rg3d engine functionality to untrusted input sources (user input, external data).
    * **Mechanism:** Allowing user-provided data or data from external sources to directly influence rg3d engine operations without proper validation or sanitization. Examples include loading assets based on user-provided paths, processing network messages without input validation, or using user input in API calls without proper checks.
    * **Impact:**  Significantly increases the attack surface and makes it much easier for attackers to exploit rg3d vulnerabilities. It bridges the gap between potential rg3d weaknesses and actual application compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [9. Application Lacks Security Measures [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/9__application_lacks_security_measures__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The application is built without basic security best practices.
    * **Mechanism:** Lack of input validation, insufficient error handling, no resource limits, absence of security testing, and other general security omissions in the application's development.
    * **Impact:** Makes the application significantly more vulnerable to all types of attacks, including those targeting rg3d. It lowers the bar for attackers and increases the likelihood of successful exploitation.
