# Threat Model Analysis for rg3dengine/rg3d

## Threat: [Malicious Asset Injection](./threats/malicious_asset_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts malicious game assets (models, textures, scenes, audio) and tricks the application into loading them. By exploiting vulnerabilities in rg3d's asset parsing, the attacker could achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the user's machine.
**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE). Attackers gain full control of the user's machine.
**Affected rg3d Component:** Asset Loader module, Scene Loader module, specific asset parsing functions within `resource_manager` and format-specific loaders.
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all loaded assets.
* Use a secure asset loading pipeline with integrity checks (e.g., checksums, signatures).
* Sandbox asset loading processes if feasible.
* Keep rg3d engine updated to the latest version.
* For web builds, enforce Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict asset sources.
* Conduct code reviews of asset loading and parsing code.

## Threat: [Path Traversal in Asset Loading (High Severity)](./threats/path_traversal_in_asset_loading__high_severity_.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates asset paths provided to the application to access files outside the intended asset directories. If successful, and if the application or rg3d engine has unintended write access due to misconfiguration or vulnerabilities, an attacker could potentially modify or delete critical application files.
**Impact:** Data Modification/Deletion. Attackers could overwrite or delete critical application files.
**Affected rg3d Component:** Asset Loader module, File System access functions within `resource_manager`.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict path sanitization and validation.
* Ensure asset paths are always relative to a defined asset root directory.
* Apply the principle of least privilege for file system access, minimizing write permissions.
* Whitelist allowed asset directories or path patterns.

## Threat: [Malicious Shaders (High Severity)](./threats/malicious_shaders__high_severity_.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides crafted shaders (GLSL, HLSL) that exploit vulnerabilities in the graphics driver or rendering pipeline exposed through rg3d's shader handling. This could lead to Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing the graphics driver or freezing the application.
**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS). Shaders crash the graphics driver or freeze the application.
**Affected rg3d Component:** Shader Compiler module, Rendering Pipeline module, Graphics API integration (OpenGL, Vulkan, WebGL).
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement shader validation and compilation checks.
* Consider shader sandboxing if feasible.
* Encourage users to keep graphics drivers updated.
* Review shader code for potential vulnerabilities, especially if dynamically loaded.

## Threat: [Network Protocol Vulnerabilities in rg3d (if used)](./threats/network_protocol_vulnerabilities_in_rg3d__if_used_.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in rg3d's built-in networking protocol implementation (if used) could be exploited. By sending malformed packets or exploiting protocol weaknesses, an attacker could achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) on servers or clients using rg3d networking features.
**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE). Attackers gain control of servers or clients using rg3d networking.
**Affected rg3d Component:** Network System module, Network Protocol implementation within rg3d.
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use secure network protocol design principles.
* Implement robust input validation and sanitization for network data.
* Keep rg3d engine updated.
* Conduct network security audits.
* Consider using established and vetted networking protocols instead of relying solely on rg3d's built-in networking if it's less mature.

## Threat: [Script Injection (if used)](./threats/script_injection__if_used_.md)

**Description:** If the application utilizes scripting features provided by rg3d or integrated scripting languages, an attacker could inject malicious scripts. Successful script injection could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on the user's machine.
**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE). Attackers execute arbitrary code on the user's machine.
**Affected rg3d Component:** Scripting Engine module (if rg3d provides one or if integrated external scripting), Script Execution Environment.
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use a secure and sandboxed scripting environment.
* Validate and sanitize user-provided script input.
* Apply the principle of least privilege to script permissions.
* Review script code for vulnerabilities.
* Consider disabling scripting if not essential.

## Threat: [Memory Corruption Bugs in rg3d Core](./threats/memory_corruption_bugs_in_rg3d_core.md)

**Description:** General memory corruption vulnerabilities (buffer overflows, use-after-free, etc.) within the rg3d engine core itself. Exploiting these vulnerabilities could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing attackers to gain control of the application and potentially the user's system.
**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE). Attackers gain control of the application and potentially the user's system.
**Affected rg3d Component:** Core Engine Components (Rendering, Asset Loading, Input, etc.), any part of rg3d written in unsafe languages like C/C++.
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep rg3d engine updated to benefit from bug fixes.
* Use static and dynamic analysis tools to identify memory corruption vulnerabilities (if modifying engine code).
* Employ fuzzing techniques to test engine robustness.
