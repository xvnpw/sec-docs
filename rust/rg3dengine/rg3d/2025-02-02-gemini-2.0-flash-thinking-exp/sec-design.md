# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, rg3dengine, is an open-source, general-purpose 3D game engine written in Rust.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
 - Provide a feature-rich, stable, and performant 3D game engine.
 - Foster a community of users and contributors around the engine.
 - Enable game developers to create high-quality 3D games and applications.
 - Offer an alternative to existing commercial and open-source game engines.
 - Promote the use of Rust in game development.

- Most Important Business Risks:
 - Security vulnerabilities in the engine could lead to exploitation in games built with it, damaging the engine's reputation and user trust.
 - Lack of community adoption and contribution could hinder the engine's development and long-term viability.
 - Performance issues or instability could deter developers from using the engine.
 - Competition from established game engines could limit market share and adoption.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
 - security control: Code is publicly available on GitHub for review. Implemented: GitHub repository.
 - security control: Bug reports and issues are tracked publicly. Implemented: GitHub issues.
 - security control: Contributions are reviewed via pull requests. Implemented: GitHub pull requests.
 - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability identification and patching.
 - accepted risk: Limited dedicated security team or resources for proactive security measures.

- Recommended Security Controls:
 - security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code.
 - security control: Integrate Dependency Scanning to identify and manage known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
 - security control: Conduct regular security code reviews, focusing on critical components and areas identified by SAST.
 - security control: Establish a clear process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities, including a security policy and contact information.
 - security control: Consider implementing Fuzz testing to discover input validation vulnerabilities and unexpected behavior.

- Security Requirements:
 - Authentication: Not directly applicable to the game engine itself. Authentication might be relevant for related services like asset stores or online game services built using the engine, but these are out of scope for the engine design itself.
 - Authorization: Authorization is relevant within the engine's editor and runtime environment to control access to engine features and game assets. This should be implemented within the engine's code.
 - Input Validation: Robust input validation is crucial for handling various file formats (models, textures, scenes, etc.) to prevent vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, path traversal, and arbitrary code execution. Input validation should be implemented in asset loading and parsing modules.
 - Cryptography: Cryptography might be required for features like:
  - Secure storage of game assets, potentially using encryption at rest. Implemented in asset management modules.
  - Secure network communication for multiplayer games built with the engine, using TLS/SSL. Implemented in networking modules.
  - Protection of sensitive game data, such as save games or configuration files, using encryption. Implemented in game save/load and configuration modules.

- Build Process Description:
 - Developer writes code and commits changes to the GitHub repository.
 - Code changes trigger the CI/CD system (e.g., GitHub Actions).
 - CI/CD system fetches dependencies from the Rust package registry (crates.io).
 - CI/CD system compiles the code in a controlled build environment.
 - Security checks are performed during the build process, including:
  - Static Application Security Testing (SAST) to identify potential code vulnerabilities.
  - Code linters to enforce coding standards and best practices.
  - Dependency scanning to check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
 - Build artifacts (binaries, source packages) are created.
 - Build artifacts are uploaded to the artifact repository (GitHub Releases).
 - Users and developers can download the build artifacts from GitHub Releases.

- Build Security Controls:
 - security control: Automated build process using CI/CD (GitHub Actions). Implemented: GitHub Actions workflows.
 - security control: Dependency management using `Cargo.toml` and `crates.io`. Implemented: Rust build system.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
 - Development and maintenance of the rg3dengine source code.
 - Distribution of the rg3dengine to game developers.
 - Community engagement and support.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
 - Source code of rg3dengine: High sensitivity (Intellectual Property, competitive advantage).
 - Build artifacts (binaries, packages): Medium sensitivity (Integrity and availability for users).
 - User data (community forum, website): Low to Medium sensitivity (depending on data collected, typically user profiles, posts).

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
 - What is the target audience for rg3dengine (indie developers, studios, hobbyists)?
 - Are there any specific security compliance requirements for the engine or games built with it?
 - Are there plans for commercialization or monetization of rg3dengine or related services?
 - What is the process for handling security vulnerability reports from the community?
 - Are there any specific areas of the engine that are considered high-risk from a security perspective?

- Assumptions:
 - rg3dengine is primarily intended for open-source use and community contribution.
 - Security is a concern, but resources for dedicated security efforts are limited.
 - The primary deployment model is distribution of source code and pre-built binaries via GitHub Releases.
 - The engine is not currently integrated with any commercial services or platforms that impose strict security requirements.
 - Game developers using rg3dengine are responsible for the security of their own games built with the engine.
