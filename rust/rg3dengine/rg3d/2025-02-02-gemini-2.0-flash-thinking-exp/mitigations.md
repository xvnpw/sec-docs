# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for rg3dengine/rg3d

## Mitigation Strategy: [Robust rg3d Asset Validation](./mitigation_strategies/robust_rg3d_asset_validation.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: **Utilize rg3d's Asset Loading Features Securely:**  Leverage rg3d's built-in asset manager and loading functions, ensuring they are used as intended and not bypassed in a way that could introduce vulnerabilities. Understand rg3d's asset handling pipeline to identify potential weak points.
    *   Step 2: **Validate Asset Formats Supported by rg3d:** Focus validation efforts on the specific asset formats that rg3d engine natively supports (e.g., `.rgs`, `.fbx`, `.png`, `.wav`). Ensure that parsing and loading of these formats within rg3d are robust and resistant to malformed files.
    *   Step 3: **Implement Size and Complexity Limits within rg3d Scene Structure:** Utilize rg3d's scene graph and object management features to enforce limits on the number of nodes, meshes, textures, and other scene elements loaded from assets. This prevents resource exhaustion within the rg3d engine itself.
    *   Step 4: **Sanitize Data Loaded into rg3d Scene Nodes:** When loading data from assets into rg3d scene nodes (e.g., mesh data, material properties, animation data), sanitize this data to ensure it conforms to rg3d's expected data structures and does not contain unexpected or malicious values that could cause engine crashes or unexpected behavior.
    *   Step 5: **Extend rg3d's Asset Pipeline with Custom Validation (If Necessary):** If rg3d's default asset loading is insufficient for security needs, extend the asset pipeline with custom validation steps that are integrated *within* the rg3d engine's asset loading process. This could involve custom asset processors or loaders.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Malicious Asset Loading via rg3d (High Severity): Loading assets through rg3d's engine that are crafted to exploit vulnerabilities in rg3d's asset parsing or rendering pipeline.
    *   rg3d Engine Denial of Service (Medium Severity): Loading assets that are excessively complex and cause resource exhaustion *within the rg3d engine*, leading to crashes or performance degradation.
    *   Data Corruption within rg3d Scene (Medium Severity): Loading malformed assets that corrupt rg3d's internal scene data structures, leading to instability or unpredictable behavior within the engine.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Malicious Asset Loading via rg3d: High Reduction - Significantly reduces the risk of engine-specific exploits triggered by malicious assets loaded through rg3d.
    *   rg3d Engine Denial of Service: Medium Reduction - Limits the impact of DoS attacks targeting rg3d's resource handling by enforcing complexity constraints within the engine's scene management.
    *   Data Corruption within rg3d Scene: Medium Reduction - Reduces the risk of data corruption within the rg3d scene by validating asset data against rg3d's expected structures.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partial implementation within rg3d's core asset loading functions. rg3d likely performs basic format checks and parsing validation for its supported asset types.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Schema validation specifically tailored to rg3d's scene and asset structures.
    *   Content sanitization focused on data being loaded into rg3d scene nodes and engine components.
    *   Explicit configuration and enforcement of complexity limits *within rg3d's scene management* for different asset types.
    *   Customizable and extensible asset validation pipeline *integrated into rg3d*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Strict Script Sandboxing within rg3d (If Applicable)](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_strict_script_sandboxing_within_rg3d__if_applicable_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: **Utilize rg3d's Scripting Capabilities Securely:** If using rg3d's scripting features (e.g., Rust scripting integration), understand the intended security model and ensure it is correctly implemented and not bypassed.
    *   Step 2: **Restrict rg3d API Access for Scripts:**  Carefully curate the rg3d API exposed to scripts. Only allow access to the minimum necessary engine functionalities required for scripting logic.  Specifically restrict access to sensitive rg3d engine components or functions that could be misused for exploits.
    *   Step 3: **Validate and Sanitize Script Inputs within rg3d Scripting Environment:** When scripts receive input from the application or external sources, validate and sanitize this input *within the rg3d scripting environment* before it interacts with the rg3d engine or game logic.
    *   Step 4: **Implement Resource Limits for rg3d Scripts:**  Utilize rg3d's scripting environment (if it provides such features) or implement custom mechanisms to limit resource consumption by scripts, such as CPU time, memory usage, and access to rg3d engine resources.
    *   Step 5: **Regularly Audit rg3d Scripting API for Security:** Periodically review the rg3d API exposed to scripts to identify any new potential security vulnerabilities or unintended access points that might arise from engine updates or API changes.

    *   Step 2: **Vulnerability Scanning for rg3d Dependencies:** Regularly scan the dependencies of the rg3d engine for known vulnerabilities. Use vulnerability scanning tools that can analyze the specific dependency versions used by rg3d.
    *   Step 3: **Update Vulnerable rg3d Dependencies (If Possible):** If vulnerabilities are found in rg3d's dependencies, check if newer versions of rg3d are available that include updated and patched dependencies. If possible, update to a newer rg3d version. If direct dependency updates are feasible within the rg3d build environment, consider updating them directly (with caution and testing).
    *   Step 4: **Monitor Security Advisories for rg3d Dependencies:** Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases related to the dependencies used by rg3d. Stay informed about newly discovered vulnerabilities that might affect the engine.

        *   **Resource Usage Analysis by rg3d (If Available):** If rg3d provides features for analyzing shader resource usage (e.g., instruction count, texture lookups), utilize these to reject shaders that exceed predefined limits *within the rg3d rendering context*.
        *   **Security Checks within rg3d Shader Pipeline (Limited):**  Perform basic security checks for potentially malicious shader code patterns *within rg3d's shader processing*, although this is challenging and limited.
    *   Step 3: **rg3d Shader Complexity Limits:**  Enforce limits on shader complexity *within rg3d's shader system*, such as maximum instruction count, texture lookups, or branching complexity. This prevents overly complex shaders from causing performance issues or denial-of-service *specifically within rg3d's rendering pipeline*.
    *   Step 4: **Keep rg3d Engine and Graphics Drivers Updated:** Encourage users to keep their graphics drivers updated, as this benefits the stability and security of shader compilation and execution *within rg3d and the underlying graphics system*.
