# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - rg3dengine is an open-source, general-purpose 2D and 3D game engine written in Rust.
  - The primary goal is to provide a feature-rich, performant, and easy-to-use game engine for developers.
  - Priorities include:
    - Feature development and engine capabilities.
    - Stability and reliability of the engine.
    - Community growth and adoption.
    - Cross-platform compatibility.
    - Performance optimization.
- Business Risks:
  - Adoption risk: Lack of adoption by game developers could lead to project stagnation.
  - Competition risk: Competition from established game engines (Unity, Unreal Engine, Godot) and other emerging engines.
  - Security risk: Vulnerabilities in the engine could be exploited in games built with it, damaging the reputation and trust in the engine.
  - Community support risk:  Insufficient community support could hinder user adoption and feature development.
  - Sustainability risk: Long-term maintenance and development of an open-source project depend on contributions and funding.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: GitHub repository access control - Implemented in GitHub repository settings.
  - security control: GitHub security scanning - Implemented by GitHub Dependabot and code scanning features.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability discovery and patching.
  - accepted risk: Security vulnerabilities might be discovered after release.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated security testing in CI/CD pipeline (SAST, DAST, dependency scanning).
  - security control: Establish a process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Conduct regular security code reviews, especially for critical components.
  - security control: Provide security guidelines for developers using rg3dengine to build games.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: Authentication is required for contributors to the GitHub repository.
    - Requirement: No authentication is required for users downloading and using the engine.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Authorization is required for contributors to push code changes to the repository. Implemented via GitHub branch protection rules.
    - Requirement: Access to the GitHub repository is controlled via GitHub roles and permissions.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Engine should perform input validation to prevent crashes or unexpected behavior when loading game assets or handling user input in games built with the engine. This is the responsibility of the engine developers.
    - Requirement: Game developers using the engine are responsible for implementing input validation in their game logic to prevent vulnerabilities in their games.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: If the engine provides features for networking or saving game data, ensure that cryptography is used appropriately to protect sensitive data. This might be relevant for game developers using the engine features.
    - Requirement: Secure storage of any API keys or secrets used in the build or deployment processes.

- Build Process Description:
  - Developers write code and push changes to the GitHub repository.

  - GitHub Actions executes build jobs on Build Agents.
  - Build process includes:
    - Code compilation (Rust compilation).
    - Running linters and code formatters.
    - Running Security Scanners (SAST, dependency vulnerability scanning).
    - Running unit and integration tests.
    - Building artifacts (libraries, editor tools, examples).
  - Build Artifacts are created and stored.
  - Successful build artifacts (engine libraries) are published to a package registry (crates.io).

- Build Process Security Controls:
  - security control: Automated build process using GitHub Actions - Implemented using GitHub Workflows.
  - security control: Source code hosted on GitHub with access control - Implemented by GitHub repository permissions.
  - security control: Dependency scanning - Implemented by GitHub Dependabot and potentially other dependency scanning tools in CI.
  - security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) - Recommended to integrate SAST scanners into the CI pipeline.

  - security control: Secure build environment - GitHub Actions runners are isolated environments.
  - security control: Code signing for release artifacts - Recommended for distribution of editor tools and game packages.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Development and maintenance of the rg3dengine.
  - Distribution of the rg3dengine libraries and tools.
  - Building games using rg3dengine by game developers.
- Data to Protect:
  - Source code of rg3dengine - Sensitivity: High (Intellectual Property, competitive advantage).
  - Game engine libraries and build artifacts - Sensitivity: Medium (Distribution integrity, prevent supply chain attacks).
  - Game assets (example projects, demos) - Sensitivity: Low to Medium (Depending on the asset, mostly for demonstration and community purposes).
  - Developer credentials and access keys - Sensitivity: High (Access to source code, build systems, and distribution channels).
- Data Sensitivity:
  - Source code: Highly sensitive. Unauthorized access or modification could lead to intellectual property theft, introduction of vulnerabilities, or project disruption.
  - Build artifacts: Moderately sensitive. Compromised build artifacts could lead to distribution of malware or vulnerable engine versions.
  - Game assets: Low to moderately sensitive. Depending on the asset type, they might have some value but are generally less critical than source code.
  - Developer credentials: Highly sensitive. Compromise could lead to unauthorized access to all project resources.
