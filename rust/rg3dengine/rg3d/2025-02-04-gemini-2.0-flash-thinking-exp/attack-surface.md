# Attack Surface Analysis for rg3dengine/rg3d

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Asset Injection](./attack_surfaces/malicious_asset_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities by injecting crafted or malicious asset files (models, textures, scenes, audio) into the application.
*   **rg3d Contribution:** rg3d's core functionality relies on loading and parsing various asset formats. Vulnerabilities in rg3d's asset loaders or underlying libraries can be directly triggered by malicious assets.
*   **Example:** A user provides a crafted glTF model file that exploits a buffer overflow in rg3d's glTF parser. When rg3d loads this model, it leads to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary Code Execution, Denial of Service, Memory Corruption, Path Traversal.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** to **High**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation:** Implement robust validation of asset file types and basic structure before loading.
    *   **Secure Asset Sources:** Load assets only from trusted sources or utilize content delivery networks with integrity checks.
    *   **Sandboxing:** If loading user-provided assets is necessary, process them in a sandboxed environment to limit potential damage.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep rg3d and its dependencies updated to patch known vulnerabilities in asset loaders and parsers.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Asset Parsers](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_asset_parsers.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting bugs within the code directly responsible for parsing different asset formats (FBX, glTF, PNG, etc.) used by rg3d.
*   **rg3d Contribution:** rg3d inherently includes and uses parsers for various asset formats as part of its asset loading pipeline. Bugs in these parsers are a direct vulnerability within the engine.
*   **Example:** A specially crafted PNG texture file triggers an integer overflow vulnerability in rg3d's PNG parser. Loading this texture results in memory corruption and potentially arbitrary code execution.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary Code Execution, Denial of Service, Memory Corruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates:** Ensure rg3d is updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes in asset parsers.
    *   **Fuzzing:** Consider performing fuzzing on rg3d's asset parsers to proactively identify potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Static Analysis:** Utilize static analysis tools to scan rg3d's codebase for potential parser vulnerabilities if possible.

## Attack Surface: [Shader Vulnerabilities (Custom Shaders)](./attack_surfaces/shader_vulnerabilities__custom_shaders_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in custom shaders or the shader compilation/processing pipeline, if the application allows the use of custom shaders within rg3d.
*   **rg3d Contribution:** If the application leverages rg3d's capabilities to load and utilize custom shaders, vulnerabilities in rg3d's shader handling and rendering pipeline become relevant.
*   **Example:** A malicious custom shader is loaded that contains an infinite loop or excessively complex computations. When this shader is used by rg3d during rendering, it causes a Denial of Service by overloading the GPU and potentially crashing the application.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service, GPU Instability.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (if custom shaders are allowed from untrusted sources).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Shader Whitelisting:** Restrict the use of shaders to a pre-approved, vetted set.
    *   **Shader Code Review:** Implement a mandatory code review process for all custom shaders before they are allowed to be used in the application.
    *   **Shader Compilation Limits:** Enforce limits on shader complexity and resource usage during compilation to prevent resource exhaustion.
    *   **Disable Custom Shaders:** If custom shader functionality is not a core requirement, consider disabling the feature entirely to eliminate this attack surface.

## Attack Surface: [Network Protocol Vulnerabilities (in rg3d Networking Integration)](./attack_surfaces/network_protocol_vulnerabilities__in_rg3d_networking_integration_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the network protocol implementation *if* the application uses external networking libraries and integrates them with rg3d in a way that exposes rg3d's data handling or scene management to network traffic.
*   **rg3d Contribution:** If the application's networking integration directly interacts with rg3d's data structures or scene management, vulnerabilities in handling network data within this integration can become rg3d-related attack surfaces.
*   **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the application's network message handling code when processing scene data received over the network and passed to rg3d. Sending a crafted network packet with oversized scene data triggers the overflow, potentially leading to remote code execution.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution, Denial of Service, Data Manipulation, Data Spoofing.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** to **High** (if networking integration with rg3d is vulnerable).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Network Integration Design:** Design and implement network integration with security as a primary concern, focusing on robust input validation and bounds checking when handling network data within rg3d context.
    *   **Regular Updates (Networking Libraries):** Keep any external networking libraries used in conjunction with rg3d updated to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Network Fuzzing (Integration Points):** Fuzz test the network integration points where network data interacts with rg3d to identify potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Encryption and Authentication:** Implement strong encryption (e.g., TLS/SSL) and authentication mechanisms for all network communication.

## Attack Surface: [Serialization/Deserialization Vulnerabilities (Network Messages related to rg3d Data)](./attack_surfaces/serializationdeserialization_vulnerabilities__network_messages_related_to_rg3d_data_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities during the serialization and deserialization of data exchanged over the network, specifically when this data is directly related to rg3d's internal data structures or scene representation.
*   **rg3d Contribution:** If network communication involves serialization of rg3d-related data, vulnerabilities in these serialization/deserialization processes become directly relevant to rg3d's attack surface.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability exists in the deserialization routine for network messages that contain serialized scene objects. Sending a crafted network message with malicious serialized scene data triggers a buffer overflow during deserialization within rg3d's scene loading or object creation process, leading to memory corruption and potential code execution.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary Code Execution, Denial of Service, Memory Corruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use Secure Serialization Libraries:** Utilize well-vetted and secure serialization libraries for handling network data related to rg3d.
    *   **Input Validation (Deserialized rg3d Data):** Implement rigorous validation of deserialized data before it is used to update rg3d's scene or game state. Ensure data conforms to expected formats and ranges.
    *   **Regular Updates (Serialization Libraries):** Keep serialization libraries updated to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Minimize Deserialization of Untrusted Data:** Limit the deserialization of data originating from untrusted network sources as much as possible.

## Attack Surface: [Scripting Engine Vulnerabilities (if used within rg3d application)](./attack_surfaces/scripting_engine_vulnerabilities__if_used_within_rg3d_application_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the scripting engine integrated with the rg3d application, or in the integration layer between rg3d and the scripting engine.
*   **rg3d Contribution:** If the application utilizes a scripting engine (like Lua, or a custom one) and integrates it with rg3d to control game logic or engine features, vulnerabilities in the scripting engine or its rg3d bindings become a direct attack surface.
*   **Example:** A malicious script is injected into the game (e.g., through a mod or configuration file) that exploits a vulnerability in the scripting engine to execute arbitrary code within the application's context, potentially gaining control over rg3d engine functionalities.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary Code Execution, Sandbox Escape (if scripting is sandboxed), Data Manipulation, Data Theft.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** to **High**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Scripting Engine:** Choose and use a well-established and security-focused scripting engine.
    *   **Sandboxing (Scripting Environment):** Implement a robust sandbox for the scripting environment to strictly limit its access to system resources and rg3d engine functionalities.
    *   **Script Whitelisting/Blacklisting:** Implement strict control over which scripts are allowed to be executed, ideally using a whitelisting approach.
    *   **Code Review (Scripts):** Conduct thorough security code reviews of all scripts before they are deployed or allowed to be executed in the application.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Scripting API):**  Expose only the absolutely necessary rg3d API functionalities to the scripting environment, following the principle of least privilege.
