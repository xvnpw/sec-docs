### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Bypass Script Input Sanitization

#### 4.1. Attack Vector Breakdown

The attack vector is described as follows:

*   **Application uses scripting and allows user input to influence script execution.**
    *   **Analysis:** rg3d engine heavily relies on Lua scripting for game logic, UI interactions, and scene management.  Applications built with rg3d often expose functionalities to users that indirectly or directly interact with Lua scripts. This interaction could be through:
        *   **Configuration Files:**  Users might be able to modify configuration files (e.g., game settings, level definitions) that are parsed and processed by Lua scripts.
        *   **In-Game Input Fields:**  Some applications might have in-game input fields (e.g., chat, console commands, custom game object names) where user-provided text is directly or indirectly passed to Lua scripts for processing.
        *   **Modding/Plugin Systems:** If the application supports modding or plugins, users might be able to provide scripts or data that are executed by the engine.
        *   **Network Communication:** Data received from network clients could be used to dynamically generate or modify scripts executed on the server or client.

*   **Attacker injects malicious script code through user input.**
    *   **Analysis:**  If the application doesn't properly handle user input before passing it to the scripting engine, an attacker can craft input that contains malicious Lua code. This code could be designed to:
        *   **Execute arbitrary Lua functions:** Gain control over game logic, manipulate game state, or access engine functionalities.
        *   **Access and manipulate data:** Read or modify game data, player data, configuration files, or potentially even system files if the scripting environment has excessive permissions.
        *   **Cause denial of service:** Execute resource-intensive scripts to crash the application or degrade performance.
        *   **Exfiltrate data:** Send sensitive information to an attacker-controlled server if network access is available from the scripting environment.

*   **Application fails to sanitize script inputs, allowing malicious code to be executed within the scripting engine's context.**
    *   **Analysis:** This is the critical failure point. Input sanitization is the process of cleaning or filtering user input to remove or neutralize potentially harmful content.  If the application fails to implement effective sanitization, or if the sanitization is bypassed, the injected malicious script code will be interpreted and executed by the Lua engine. Common reasons for sanitization bypass include:
        *   **Insufficient or Incomplete Sanitization:**  The sanitization might only address a limited set of known attack patterns, leaving room for bypass through novel or more complex injection techniques.
        *   **Incorrect Sanitization Logic:**  The sanitization logic itself might be flawed, allowing attackers to craft input that appears safe but still contains malicious code when processed by the scripting engine.
        *   **Contextual Sanitization Failure:** Sanitization might be applied in one context but not in another, or might not be appropriate for the specific way the input is used within the scripting engine.
        *   **Lack of Sanitization Entirely:** The application might completely neglect input sanitization, assuming user input is always safe or relying on implicit sanitization mechanisms that are insufficient.

#### 4.2. Critical Node Analysis: Bypass Script Input Sanitization

The "Bypass Script Input Sanitization" node is critical because it represents the point of failure in the application's security measures. Effective input sanitization is the primary defense against script injection attacks. If this defense is bypassed, the attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary code within the scripting engine's context.

**Common Sanitization Weaknesses and Bypass Techniques:**

*   **Blacklisting instead of Whitelisting:**  Blacklisting attempts to block known malicious patterns. This is inherently flawed as attackers can always find new ways to bypass blacklists. Whitelisting, which only allows explicitly permitted characters or patterns, is generally more secure but can be more restrictive.
*   **Insufficient Character Escaping:**  If sanitization relies on escaping special characters (e.g., escaping quotes, backslashes), attackers can use double escaping, encoding, or other techniques to bypass the escaping mechanism.
*   **Context-Insensitive Sanitization:** Sanitization might be applied without considering the context in which the input will be used in the script. For example, sanitizing for HTML injection might be ineffective against Lua script injection.
*   **Regular Expression Vulnerabilities:** If sanitization uses regular expressions, poorly written regex can be vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks or may not correctly capture all malicious patterns.
*   **Logic Errors in Sanitization Code:**  Bugs or logical flaws in the sanitization code itself can create bypass opportunities.
*   **Encoding Issues:**  Incorrect handling of character encodings (e.g., UTF-8, ASCII) can lead to sanitization bypasses, especially when dealing with multi-byte characters.
*   **Cascading Vulnerabilities:**  Sanitization might be bypassed due to vulnerabilities in other parts of the application that allow attackers to manipulate the input before it reaches the sanitization routine, or after it has been sanitized but before it is used by the scripting engine.

#### 4.3. Impact Analysis: Code Execution (Scripting Engine Context), Data Access, Application Logic Manipulation

Successful script injection via bypassed sanitization can have significant impacts:

*   **Code Execution (Scripting Engine Context):** This is the most direct and immediate impact. The attacker can execute arbitrary Lua code within the rg3d application's scripting environment. The capabilities are limited by the permissions and functionalities exposed to the Lua scripting engine by rg3d and the application itself. However, even within this context, attackers can achieve significant damage.
*   **Data Access:**  Depending on the scripting engine's access to application data and resources, attackers can:
    *   **Read sensitive game data:** Player profiles, game state, level information, configuration files, potentially even credentials if stored insecurely and accessible from scripts.
    *   **Modify game data:** Cheat by altering game state, player stats, or level design.
    *   **Access system resources:** In some cases, scripting engines might have access to file system operations, network communication, or other system resources, allowing attackers to read or write arbitrary files, communicate with external servers, or perform other malicious actions.
*   **Application Logic Manipulation:** Attackers can completely alter the intended behavior of the application by:
    *   **Modifying game rules and mechanics:** Change gameplay, introduce exploits, or create unfair advantages.
    *   **Disrupting application functionality:** Cause crashes, freezes, or unexpected behavior.
    *   **Implementing backdoor access:** Create persistent access points for future attacks.
    *   **Manipulating UI and user experience:** Display misleading information, inject advertisements, or deface the application's interface.
*   **Privilege Escalation (Potential):** While direct privilege escalation to the operating system level might be less common from within a scripting engine, it's not impossible. If the scripting engine or the application has vulnerabilities that can be exploited from script code (e.g., buffer overflows, command injection), it could potentially lead to privilege escalation.
*   **Reputation Damage:**  If an application is known to be vulnerable to script injection, it can severely damage the developer's reputation and user trust.

#### 4.4. Potential Vulnerabilities in rg3d Applications

Based on the analysis, potential vulnerabilities in rg3d applications that could lead to bypassed sanitization and script injection include:

*   **Lack of Input Sanitization in Lua Script Handlers:** Developers might not implement any sanitization for user inputs that are processed by Lua scripts, assuming the input is always safe or relying on implicit sanitization that doesn't exist.
*   **Inadequate Sanitization Functions:**  If sanitization is implemented, it might be done using weak or flawed sanitization functions that are easily bypassed. Developers might create custom sanitization routines that are not robust enough.
*   **Misuse of rg3d API Functions:**  rg3d API functions that interact with Lua scripting might be misused in a way that bypasses intended sanitization or introduces new injection points.
*   **Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Libraries:** If the rg3d application uses third-party Lua libraries, vulnerabilities in these libraries could be exploited through script injection.
*   **Configuration File Injection:** If configuration files (e.g., `.toml`, `.json`, custom formats) are parsed by Lua scripts and user-modifiable, vulnerabilities in the parsing logic or lack of sanitization in configuration values could lead to injection.
*   **Modding API Weaknesses:** If the application has a modding API, vulnerabilities in how mods are loaded, validated, or executed could allow malicious mods to inject scripts.
*   **Network Protocol Vulnerabilities:** If network communication is used to influence scripting, vulnerabilities in the network protocol or data parsing could allow injection through network messages.

#### 4.5. Mitigation Strategies

To mitigate the risk of script injection through bypassed sanitization in rg3d applications, the following strategies should be implemented:

1.  **Principle of Least Privilege for Scripting Engine:**  Limit the permissions and capabilities of the Lua scripting engine as much as possible. Avoid granting unnecessary access to file system operations, network communication, or sensitive application data. Use rg3d's features to restrict the Lua environment.
2.  **Robust Input Sanitization:** Implement strong input sanitization for all user inputs that are processed by Lua scripts.
    *   **Whitelisting is preferred:**  Define a strict whitelist of allowed characters, patterns, or commands for user input.
    *   **Context-Aware Sanitization:**  Sanitize input based on the specific context in which it will be used in the script.
    *   **Use established sanitization libraries (if applicable):** If Lua or rg3d provides any built-in sanitization functions, use them correctly and thoroughly. If not, consider using well-vetted Lua sanitization libraries if available and appropriate.
    *   **Regularly review and update sanitization logic:**  Keep sanitization mechanisms up-to-date with evolving attack techniques.
3.  **Parameterization and Prepared Statements (if applicable):** If the application constructs Lua scripts dynamically based on user input, use parameterization or prepared statements to separate code from data. This can prevent injection by ensuring user input is treated as data, not code. (Note: Direct parameterization might be less common in Lua compared to SQL, but the principle of separating code and data is still relevant).
4.  **Code Review and Security Audits:** Conduct regular code reviews and security audits of the application, specifically focusing on areas where user input interacts with Lua scripting. Look for potential injection points and weaknesses in sanitization.
5.  **Security Testing:** Perform penetration testing and vulnerability scanning to identify potential script injection vulnerabilities. Include fuzzing of input fields and configuration files that are processed by Lua scripts.
6.  **Error Handling and Logging:** Implement proper error handling and logging to detect and respond to potential injection attempts. Log suspicious input and script execution errors.
7.  **Content Security Policy (CSP) (if applicable to web-based rg3d applications):** If the rg3d application is deployed in a web context (e.g., using WebAssembly), consider using Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded, further mitigating the impact of successful injection.
8.  **Educate Developers:** Train developers on secure coding practices, specifically focusing on input sanitization and the risks of script injection in the context of rg3d and Lua scripting.

By implementing these mitigation strategies, developers can significantly reduce the risk of script injection attacks in rg3d applications and protect their users and systems from potential harm.
