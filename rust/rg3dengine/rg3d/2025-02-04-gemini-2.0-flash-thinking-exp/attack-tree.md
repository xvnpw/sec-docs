## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Asset Loading Vulnerabilities - Malicious Asset Injection - Bypass Input Validation on Asset Upload](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_asset_loading_vulnerabilities_-_malicious_asset_injection_-_bypass_input_validation_on_asset_744d92b9.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Attacker uploads a specially crafted malicious asset file (e.g., modified 3D model, texture, scene, audio file) to the application.
    *   The application's input validation for asset uploads is bypassed, allowing the malicious file to be processed.
    *   rg3d engine then parses this malicious asset.
*   **Critical Node:** Bypass Input Validation on Asset Upload - Failure to properly validate uploaded files is the key enabler for this attack.
*   **Impact:** Code Execution, Denial of Service, Memory Corruption - Exploiting vulnerabilities in asset parsers can lead to severe consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Asset Loading Vulnerabilities - Malicious Asset Injection - rg3d Parses Malicious Asset - Exploit Buffer Overflow in Asset Parser (Mesh, Texture, Scene, Audio, Integer Overflow/Underflow)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_asset_loading_vulnerabilities_-_malicious_asset_injection_-_rg3d_parses_malicious_asset_-_ex_2a9ffc34.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Attacker provides a malicious asset file (either uploaded or from a compromised source).
    *   rg3d engine's asset parsers (for mesh, texture, scene, audio formats) contain buffer overflow or integer overflow/underflow vulnerabilities.
    *   Parsing the malicious asset triggers these vulnerabilities.
*   **Critical Node:** rg3d Parses Malicious Asset - This is the point where the engine's parsing logic becomes vulnerable.
*   **Critical Node:** Exploit Buffer Overflow in Asset Parser - Buffer overflows are the primary vulnerability type in this path.
*   **Impact:** Code Execution, Denial of Service, Memory Corruption - Successful exploitation of buffer overflows allows attackers to control program execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Asset Loading Vulnerabilities - Asset Path Traversal - Manipulate Asset Paths via User Input - Bypass Path Sanitization/Validation](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_asset_loading_vulnerabilities_-_asset_path_traversal_-_manipulate_asset_paths_via_user_input_3c38973f.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Application allows users to specify asset paths (directly or indirectly).
    *   Attacker manipulates these paths to include path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`, `../../`).
    *   Application fails to properly sanitize or validate these paths.
    *   rg3d engine loads assets based on the manipulated paths.
*   **Critical Node:** Manipulate Asset Paths via User Input - Allowing user control over asset paths opens the door for path traversal.
*   **Critical Node:** Bypass Path Sanitization/Validation - Failure to sanitize user-provided paths is the key weakness.
*   **Impact:** Information Disclosure, Configuration Data Theft, Access to Server-Side Files (if applicable) - Attackers can read sensitive files outside the intended asset directories.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Engine Vulnerabilities - Exploit Resource Management Issues in Renderer - Trigger Resource Exhaustion](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_engine_vulnerabilities_-_exploit_resource_management_issues_in_renderer_-_trigger_resource_e_f45550b1.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Attacker crafts a scene or game content that intentionally overloads the rendering pipeline.
    *   This can be achieved by including excessive numbers of objects, draw calls, textures, or complex shaders.
    *   rg3d engine attempts to render this content, leading to resource exhaustion (GPU or CPU).
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service - The application becomes unresponsive or crashes due to resource overload.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Physics Engine Vulnerabilities - Trigger Physics Engine Crashes - Supply Malformed Physics Data](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_physics_engine_vulnerabilities_-_trigger_physics_engine_crashes_-_supply_malformed_physics_d_4ac07d9f.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Attacker provides malformed or extreme physics data (e.g., objects with infinite mass, extreme velocities, invalid shapes).
    *   rg3d engine's physics engine (Rapier) attempts to simulate this data.
    *   Malformed data triggers crashes or unexpected behavior in the physics engine.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service, Unpredictable Game Behavior - The application becomes unstable or crashes due to physics engine errors.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Scripting Engine Vulnerabilities - Script Injection - Bypass Script Input Sanitization](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_scripting_engine_vulnerabilities_-_script_injection_-_bypass_script_input_sanitization.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Application uses scripting and allows user input to influence script execution.
    *   Attacker injects malicious script code through user input.
    *   Application fails to sanitize script inputs, allowing malicious code to be executed within the scripting engine's context.
*   **Critical Node:** Bypass Script Input Sanitization - Failure to sanitize script inputs enables script injection.
*   **Impact:** Code Execution (Scripting Engine Context), Data Access, Application Logic Manipulation - Attackers can control game logic, access data, or potentially escalate privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Networking Vulnerabilities - Exploit Network Protocol Vulnerabilities - Buffer Overflows in Packet Parsing](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_networking_vulnerabilities_-_exploit_network_protocol_vulnerabilities_-_buffer_overflows_in__77a156fe.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Application uses rg3d networking features and implements a custom network protocol.
    *   The network protocol parsing logic in rg3d or the application contains buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
    *   Attacker sends specially crafted network packets that trigger these buffer overflows during parsing.
*   **Critical Node:** Buffer Overflows in Packet Parsing - Buffer overflows in network packet handling are the core vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Code Execution, Denial of Service - Exploiting buffer overflows in network code can lead to remote code execution or application crashes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Networking Vulnerabilities - Lack of Encryption/Authentication](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_networking_vulnerabilities_-_lack_of_encryptionauthentication.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Application uses rg3d networking without implementing encryption or authentication.
    *   Network communication is vulnerable to eavesdropping and tampering.
    *   Attacker performs Man-in-the-Middle attacks to intercept or modify network traffic.
*   **Impact:** Man-in-the-Middle Attacks, Data Interception, Data Tampering - Sensitive game data or user information can be compromised. Game state can be manipulated.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Networking Vulnerabilities - Denial of Service via Network Flooding - Send Excessive Network Traffic](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_networking_vulnerabilities_-_denial_of_service_via_network_flooding_-_send_excessive_network_48618e40.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Attacker sends a large volume of network traffic to the application or server.
    *   This overwhelms the network resources and application's ability to process legitimate requests.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (Application/Server) - The application becomes unavailable to legitimate users.
