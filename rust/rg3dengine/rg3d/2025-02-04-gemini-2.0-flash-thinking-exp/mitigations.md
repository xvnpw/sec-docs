# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for rg3dengine/rg3d

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Asset Validation](./mitigation_strategies/strict_asset_validation.md)

### Description:
1.  **Leverage rg3d Asset Loaders:** Understand and utilize rg3d's built-in asset loading mechanisms and file format support.  Focus validation efforts on the specific file formats rg3d handles (e.g., `.rgs`, `.fbx`, `.gltf`, `.png`, `.wav`).
2.  **Extend rg3d Validation (if needed):** If rg3d's default loaders lack sufficient validation for your security needs, extend them or implement custom asset pre-processing steps *before* loading assets into rg3d. This could involve writing custom parsers or using external validation libraries *before* rg3d handles the data.
3.  **Utilize rg3d Error Handling:**  Properly handle errors reported by rg3d during asset loading. Ensure your application gracefully handles asset loading failures and doesn't expose sensitive information in error messages.
4.  **Focus on rg3d Supported Formats:** Prioritize validation for asset formats directly processed by rg3d. Vulnerabilities are more likely to exist in the parsing logic of these formats within the engine.
### List of Threats Mitigated:
*   **Malicious Asset Injection (High Severity):** Prevents loading of crafted assets designed to exploit parsing vulnerabilities *within rg3d's asset loaders*, potentially leading to code execution or denial of service *within the rg3d engine context*.
*   **Denial of Service via Large Assets (Medium Severity):** Mitigates attempts to overload the application *through rg3d's asset loading system* by providing excessively large or complex assets that consume excessive memory or processing power *during rg3d asset processing*.
*   **Data Corruption via Malformed Assets (Medium Severity):** Prevents the application from crashing or behaving unpredictably due to malformed assets that could corrupt internal data structures *managed by rg3d*.
### Impact:
*   **Malicious Asset Injection: High Impact.** Significantly reduces the risk of successful exploitation through malicious assets *targeting rg3d's parsing capabilities*.
*   **Denial of Service via Large Assets: Medium Impact.** Reduces the likelihood of DoS attacks through asset loading *specifically within rg3d's processing*, but resource limits (strategy 2) are also crucial for full mitigation.
*   **Data Corruption via Malformed Assets: High Impact.** Effectively prevents crashes and unpredictable behavior caused by malformed assets *processed by rg3d*.
### Currently Implemented:
*   Partially implemented.
    *   rg3d engine itself performs basic file format checks and some internal validation during asset loading as part of its core functionality.
    *   Project likely relies on rg3d's built-in loaders and thus implicitly benefits from rg3d's default validation, but might not have *additional* validation layers.
### Missing Implementation:
*   **Custom Validation Extension for rg3d:** Lack of explicit, custom validation routines *specifically tailored to rg3d's asset handling* and application-specific security policies.
*   **Detailed Error Logging within rg3d Context:**  Potentially insufficient logging of asset validation failures *within the rg3d engine's error reporting*, hindering security auditing and debugging related to rg3d asset processing.
*   **Validation Integrated into rg3d Pipeline:**  Validation logic might be separate from the core rg3d asset loading pipeline, making it less consistently applied *within the engine's workflow*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limits during Asset Loading](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limits_during_asset_loading.md)

### Description:
1.  **Utilize rg3d's Resource Management:** Understand rg3d's resource management system. Explore if rg3d provides built-in mechanisms to limit resource consumption during asset loading (e.g., memory pools, object limits).
2.  **Implement Limits Around rg3d Loading Calls:**  If rg3d doesn't offer sufficient built-in limits, implement resource monitoring and limits *around the calls to rg3d asset loading functions* in your application code. Track memory allocated *by rg3d* during loading, CPU time spent *in rg3d asset loading functions*, and file sizes *before passing them to rg3d*.
3.  **Set Limits Relevant to rg3d Resources:** Define resource limits that are meaningful in the context of rg3d's resource usage. Consider limits on:
    *   **rg3d Scene Memory:**  Memory allocated for scene nodes, meshes, textures *managed by rg3d*.
    *   **rg3d Texture Memory:** Memory used for textures *loaded and managed by rg3d*.
    *   **rg3d Mesh Complexity:** Number of vertices, triangles in meshes *processed by rg3d*.
4.  **Graceful Handling of rg3d Loading Errors:** When resource limits are exceeded during rg3d asset loading, ensure your application gracefully handles the errors *reported by rg3d or your custom limit checks*. Prevent crashes and provide informative feedback related to rg3d asset loading issues.
### List of Threats Mitigated:
*   **Denial of Service via Large Assets (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from crashing the application by providing extremely large or complex assets that exhaust system resources *during rg3d's asset processing*.
*   **Resource Exhaustion Exploits (Medium Severity):** Mitigates potential exploits that rely on triggering excessive resource consumption *within rg3d's asset loading and resource management* to disrupt application functionality.
### Impact:
*   **Denial of Service via Large Assets: High Impact.** Effectively prevents DoS attacks based on resource exhaustion *during rg3d asset processing*.
*   **Resource Exhaustion Exploits: Medium Impact.** Reduces the attack surface for exploits that rely on resource exhaustion *within rg3d*, but may not prevent all types of exploits.
### Currently Implemented:
*   Partially implemented.
    *   rg3d engine likely has some internal limits to prevent catastrophic crashes due to extremely large assets as part of its resource management.
    *   Project might have implicit limits based on system resources and performance considerations when using rg3d, but likely lacks explicit, configurable resource limits *specifically controlling rg3d's resource usage for security*.
### Missing Implementation:
*   **Configurable Resource Limits for rg3d:** Lack of configurable resource limits *specifically targeting rg3d's resource consumption* that can be adjusted based on application requirements and security needs.
*   **Explicit Monitoring of rg3d Resources:** Absence of dedicated monitoring of memory allocation and CPU time consumption *specifically within rg3d asset loading and resource management*.
*   **Consistent Limit Enforcement around rg3d Calls:** Inconsistent application of resource limits across all asset loading paths and asset types *that utilize rg3d's loading functions*.
*   **Detailed Logging of rg3d Resource Limit Exceedances:**  Potentially insufficient logging of resource limit exceedances *related to rg3d operations* for security auditing and debugging.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Shader Validation and Sanitization](./mitigation_strategies/shader_validation_and_sanitization.md)

### Description:
1.  **Utilize rg3d Shader System:** Understand rg3d's shader system and how it handles shaders. Focus validation efforts on the shader languages and formats rg3d supports (e.g., GLSL, HLSL, potentially custom shader formats).
2.  **Leverage rg3d Shader Compiler:** Use rg3d's built-in shader compiler for shader validation. Check for compilation errors and warnings reported by rg3d's compiler.
3.  **Extend rg3d Shader Validation (if needed):** If rg3d's shader compiler validation is insufficient, implement additional validation steps *before or after* rg3d shader compilation. This could involve using external shader validation tools or writing custom checks based on shader code analysis.
4.  **Restrict Shader Input to rg3d Formats:** If possible, limit shader input to formats directly supported by rg3d and processed by its shader compiler. This simplifies validation and reduces the risk of vulnerabilities in handling external or unsupported shader formats.
5.  **Sanitize Shader Parameters Passed to rg3d:** When passing shader parameters to rg3d rendering functions, sanitize and validate these parameters to prevent unexpected behavior or exploits *within rg3d's rendering pipeline*.
### List of Threats Mitigated:
*   **Malicious Shader Injection (High Severity):** Prevents injection of crafted shader code that could be used to execute arbitrary code on the GPU, bypass security restrictions, or cause denial of service *within rg3d's rendering context*.
*   **Denial of Service via Complex Shaders (Medium Severity):** Mitigates attempts to overload the GPU *through rg3d's rendering pipeline* by providing excessively complex shaders that consume excessive GPU resources or cause rendering pipeline stalls *within rg3d*.
*   **Information Disclosure via Shaders (Low Severity):** Prevents shaders from being used to extract sensitive information from the rendering pipeline or system memory *through rg3d's rendering operations* (less likely in rg3d, but a potential concern in some rendering contexts).
### Impact:
*   **Malicious Shader Injection: High Impact.**  Significantly reduces the risk of shader injection attacks *targeting rg3d's shader processing*.
*   **Denial of Service via Complex Shaders: Medium Impact.** Reduces the likelihood of DoS attacks through shader complexity *within rg3d's rendering*, but resource limits (strategy 2, applied to shaders) are also important.
*   **Information Disclosure via Shaders: Low Impact.** Minimizes the potential for information leakage through shaders *processed by rg3d*.
### Currently Implemented:
*   Partially implemented.
    *   rg3d engine performs basic shader compilation and syntax checks as part of its rendering pipeline.
    *   Project likely relies on rg3d's built-in shader handling and thus benefits from rg3d's default shader validation, but might not have *additional* custom shader validation.
### Missing Implementation:
*   **Custom Shader Validation Extension for rg3d:** Lack of explicit, custom shader validation routines *specifically tailored to rg3d's shader system* and application-specific security policies.
*   **Resource Usage Analysis for rg3d Shaders:** Lack of analysis to detect and reject shaders with excessive resource consumption *within rg3d's rendering pipeline*.
*   **Security-Focused Shader Validation for rg3d:**  Absence of specific security checks within the shader validation process *integrated with rg3d's shader handling*.
*   **Shader Parameter Sanitization for rg3d:** Potentially insufficient sanitization and validation of shader parameters *passed to rg3d rendering functions* that are provided by users or external sources.
