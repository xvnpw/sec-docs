# Threat Model Analysis for rg3dengine/rg3d

## Threat: [Malicious Asset Exploitation](./threats/malicious_asset_exploitation.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Asset Exploitation
*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious game asset (model, texture, scene, sound, etc.) and provides it to the application to exploit vulnerabilities in rg3d's asset loading and parsing code. This could be done by uploading a malicious asset, injecting it into asset bundles, or compromising asset sources. The malicious asset, when loaded by rg3d, triggers a vulnerability such as a buffer overflow or format string bug in the engine's C++ code.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server or client.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) through application crash.
    *   Data Corruption by overwriting memory.
*   **Affected rg3d Component:** Asset loading and parsing modules (e.g., scene loader, model loader, texture loader, audio loader). Specifically, the C++ code responsible for parsing various asset file formats.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict validation and sanitization of all loaded assets, checking file headers, sizes, and internal structures against expected formats.
    *   Use fuzzing tools to test rg3d's asset parsers with a wide range of malformed and crafted asset files.
    *   Isolate asset loading and processing in a sandboxed environment if possible.
    *   Keep rg3d engine updated to benefit from bug fixes and security patches in asset loading code.
    *   Ensure assets are loaded from trusted and secure sources and implement integrity checks (e.g., checksums).
    *   If user asset uploads are necessary, implement rigorous security checks and consider manual review.

## Threat: [Networking Protocol Exploits (rg3d Networking)](./threats/networking_protocol_exploits__rg3d_networking_.md)

*   **Threat:** Networking Protocol Exploits
*   **Description:** If using rg3d's built-in networking, an attacker sends crafted network packets to the application. These packets exploit vulnerabilities in rg3d's network protocol implementation, packet parsing, or event handling. This could target buffer overflows, logic errors, or other weaknesses in the networking stack.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) on server or client.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing network components.
    *   Cheating or game manipulation in multiplayer scenarios.
*   **Affected rg3d Component:** rg3d's networking module, including network protocol implementation, packet parsing, and network event handling code.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if RCE is possible), High (for DoS or cheating)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Follow secure design principles for custom network protocols. If using existing protocols, ensure proper and secure implementation within rg3d.
    *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all incoming network data.
    *   Use network fuzzing tools to test rg3d's networking stack.
    *   Keep rg3d engine updated to benefit from security patches in the networking module.
    *   Implement network security measures like firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and rate limiting.
    *   Consider using well-vetted and established networking libraries instead of relying solely on rg3d's built-in networking if it's less mature or less secure.

## Threat: [Insecure Network Configuration (rg3d Networking)](./threats/insecure_network_configuration__rg3d_networking_.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Network Configuration
*   **Description:** rg3d's networking is configured to use insecure protocols (e.g., unencrypted UDP or TCP) or lacks proper security measures. An attacker can intercept network traffic, perform man-in-the-middle attacks, or tamper with data transmitted between clients and servers.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data Breach: Interception of sensitive game data or user information.
    *   Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:  Injection of malicious data or impersonation.
*   **Affected rg3d Component:** rg3d's networking module configuration and protocol selection.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always use encryption for network communication, preferably TLS/SSL or similar secure protocols, especially for sensitive data.
    *   Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    *   Carefully configure rg3d's networking settings to use secure protocols and disable any unnecessary or insecure features.
    *   Conduct regular security audits of network configurations and communication protocols.

## Threat: [Scripting Engine Exploits (If Applicable)](./threats/scripting_engine_exploits__if_applicable_.md)

*   **Threat:** Scripting Engine Exploits
*   **Description:** If rg3d uses a scripting engine, an attacker injects malicious scripts or crafts scripts to exploit vulnerabilities in the scripting engine or its integration with rg3d's core functionalities. This could involve escaping scripting sandboxes, exploiting vulnerabilities in the scripting language interpreter, or abusing engine APIs exposed to scripts.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) by escaping the sandbox.
    *   Logic Bugs and Game Manipulation through malicious scripts.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) via resource-intensive or crashing scripts.
*   **Affected rg3d Component:** Scripting engine (if present), scripting API bindings, and script execution environment.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if RCE is possible), High (for game manipulation or DoS)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use a well-vetted and secure scripting engine and keep it updated.
    *   Implement a strong sandbox environment for script execution.
    *   Carefully design and review the API exposed to scripts, minimizing access to dangerous engine features.
    *   Implement strict validation and sanitization for scripts loaded from external sources or user input.
    *   Grant scripts only the minimum necessary permissions.
    *   Conduct code reviews and security audits of scripting engine integration and script handling logic.

## Threat: [Rendering Pipeline Vulnerabilities](./threats/rendering_pipeline_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Rendering Pipeline Vulnerabilities
*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious shaders or scenes that exploit vulnerabilities in rg3d's rendering pipeline or shader processing. This could target shader compilers, graphics API interactions (OpenGL, Vulkan, etc.), or resource management within the rendering pipeline. Exploits might trigger crashes, unexpected behavior, or potentially even code execution in rare cases.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing the rendering engine or causing performance issues.
    *   Unexpected Visual Artifacts/Glitches, potentially disruptive.
    *   Potentially (less likely) Code Execution through shader compiler or driver exploits.
*   **Affected rg3d Component:** Rendering pipeline, shader compiler, graphics API interaction layer (OpenGL, Vulkan), resource management in rendering.
*   **Risk Severity:** Medium (DoS, visual glitches), Potentially High (if RCE is possible, but less likely) - Considering as High for filtering.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement shader validation and sanitization.
    *   Implement resource limits in the rendering pipeline.
    *   Keep rg3d engine and graphics drivers updated.
    *   Follow graphics API best practices.
    *   Conduct code reviews and security audits of the rendering pipeline and shader processing code.

*   **Threat:** Engine Logic Exploits
*   **Description:** Attackers exploit logic flaws or bugs within rg3d's core engine logic (game logic, physics, input handling, etc.). This involves finding unexpected behaviors or edge cases in the engine's code that can be triggered through specific game actions or inputs.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Game Breaking Bugs/Cheating: Exploiting logic flaws for unfair advantages.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) by triggering engine errors or resource exhaustion through specific actions.
    *   Data Corruption in certain cases.
