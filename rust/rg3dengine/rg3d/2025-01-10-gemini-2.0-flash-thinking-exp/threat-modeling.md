# Threat Model Analysis for rg3dengine/rg3d

## Threat: [Malicious Model Injection](./threats/malicious_model_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a crafted 3D model file that, when loaded by the rg3d engine, exploits a vulnerability such as a buffer overflow or integer overflow in the model parsing logic.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine, potentially allowing the attacker to gain control of the system, steal data, or install malware.

**Affected Component:** `rg3d::resource::model::loader` module, specifically the functions responsible for parsing model formats (e.g., `.FBX`, `.GLTF`).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all loaded model files.
*   Utilize a well-fuzzed and regularly updated version of the rg3d engine.
*   Consider sandboxing the asset loading process to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities.
*   Implement integrity checks for downloaded or user-provided model files.

## Threat: [Malicious Texture Injection](./threats/malicious_texture_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a crafted texture file (e.g., `.PNG`, `.JPEG`) that exploits a vulnerability in the rg3d engine's texture loading or decoding logic.

**Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution, denial of service (application crash), or potentially information disclosure if the vulnerability allows reading memory outside of the intended buffer.

**Affected Component:** `rg3d::resource::texture::loader` module, specifically the functions responsible for decoding image formats.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all loaded texture files.
*   Utilize a well-fuzzed and regularly updated version of the rg3d engine, including its image decoding libraries.
*   Consider sandboxing the asset loading process.
*   Implement integrity checks for texture files.

## Threat: [Shader Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/shader_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a crafted shader program (GLSL or similar) that exploits a vulnerability in the rg3d engine's shader compiler or runtime environment.

**Impact:** Denial of service (application crash or GPU hang), potentially arbitrary code execution on the GPU (although less common but theoretically possible), or visual glitches that could be used for social engineering attacks.

**Affected Component:** `rg3d::renderer::shader` module, `rg3d::renderer::gpu_program` module, and potentially the underlying graphics API (e.g., `wgpu`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Carefully review and validate any user-provided shaders.
*   Keep the rg3d engine and its rendering backend updated to benefit from security fixes in shader compilers and drivers.
*   Implement restrictions on shader complexity or resource usage.
*   Consider running shaders in a more isolated environment if feasible.

## Threat: [Network Packet Exploitation (if using rg3d's networking features)](./threats/network_packet_exploitation__if_using_rg3d's_networking_features_.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends specially crafted network packets to an application using rg3d's built-in networking capabilities, exploiting vulnerabilities in the packet parsing or handling logic.

**Impact:** Denial of service (crashing the server or client), potentially arbitrary code execution if buffer overflows or other memory corruption issues exist in the networking code.

**Affected Component:** Modules within `rg3d::network` (if used), specifically functions handling incoming network data and protocol parsing.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all incoming network data.
*   Use secure and well-vetted networking protocols and libraries if possible, potentially abstracting away rg3d's built-in networking.
*   Implement rate limiting and connection throttling to mitigate denial-of-service attacks.
*   Regularly audit and test the networking code for vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Exploitation of `unsafe` Code Blocks within rg3d](./threats/exploitation_of__unsafe__code_blocks_within_rg3d.md)

**Description:** While Rust's safety features mitigate many memory safety issues, `unsafe` blocks in rg3d code could introduce vulnerabilities if not handled carefully.

**Impact:** Memory corruption, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Any module within rg3d containing `unsafe` code blocks.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Thoroughly audit and review all `unsafe` code blocks within the rg3d engine.
*   Minimize the use of `unsafe` code where possible.
*   Utilize memory safety tools and techniques during development of rg3d.
