# Attack Surface Analysis for rg3dengine/rg3d

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Asset Loading](./attack_surfaces/malicious_asset_loading.md)

**Description:**  The rg3d engine's core functionality of loading and processing various asset types (models, textures, sounds) makes it vulnerable to maliciously crafted assets that can exploit parsing and processing logic within the engine itself.

**How rg3d Contributes:** rg3d's asset loading pipeline directly interprets asset files, and vulnerabilities in its parsing libraries or logic can be triggered by malicious input.

**Example:** A specially crafted FBX model file containing a buffer overflow that is triggered when rg3d attempts to parse it, leading to arbitrary code execution within the application's process.

**Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution, denial-of-service (engine crashes), memory corruption.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Input Validation within rg3d:**  While application-level validation is crucial, improvements in rg3d's internal asset parsing to detect and reject malformed files would reduce this risk.
* **Sandboxing within rg3d:**  If feasible, sandboxing the asset loading process within the engine could limit the impact of exploits.
* **Regular Updates:** Keeping rg3d and its underlying asset parsing libraries updated is critical to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Networking Features (If Enabled)](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_networking_features__if_enabled_.md)

**Description:** If rg3d's built-in networking capabilities are enabled, vulnerabilities in the engine's network protocol implementation can be directly exploited by sending malicious network packets targeting the engine.

**How rg3d Contributes:** rg3d's own networking code is the direct source of these vulnerabilities.

**Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability in rg3d's network packet handling code that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a machine running an application using rg3d with networking enabled.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, denial-of-service, data breaches (if sensitive data is handled by rg3d's networking).

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (if remote code execution is possible).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Secure Coding Practices within rg3d:**  Rigorous code reviews and testing of rg3d's networking components are essential.
* **Input Validation within rg3d's Networking:**  Ensure rg3d properly validates and sanitizes all data received over its network interfaces.
* **Regular Updates:** Keeping rg3d updated is crucial to patch any discovered networking vulnerabilities.
* **Disable Unused Features:** If the application doesn't require rg3d's networking features, disabling them within the engine's configuration would eliminate this attack surface.

## Attack Surface: [Scripting Engine Vulnerabilities (If Enabled)](./attack_surfaces/scripting_engine_vulnerabilities__if_enabled_.md)

**Description:** If rg3d integrates a scripting language, vulnerabilities within that scripting engine or its interface with the core rg3d engine can be exploited by providing malicious scripts.

**How rg3d Contributes:** rg3d's choice of scripting engine and the way it integrates with it directly contributes to this attack surface.

**Example:** A vulnerability in the scripting engine used by rg3d that allows an attacker to escape the scripting sandbox and execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, data manipulation within the game, potentially compromising the user's system.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Secure Scripting Engine Choice:**  rg3d developers should choose scripting engines with a strong security track record and actively maintained security updates.
* **Sandboxing within rg3d's Scripting Integration:**  Ensure rg3d's integration properly sandboxes the scripting environment to limit its access to system resources.
* **Regular Updates:** Keeping the integrated scripting engine (if it's a separate component) and rg3d updated is vital.

## Attack Surface: [Build Process and Supply Chain Compromise (Impacting rg3d Directly)](./attack_surfaces/build_process_and_supply_chain_compromise__impacting_rg3d_directly_.md)

**Description:** If the build process of rg3d itself is compromised, malicious code can be injected directly into the engine's binaries, affecting all applications that use that compromised version.

**How rg3d Contributes:** This is a vulnerability in the development and distribution pipeline of the rg3d engine itself.

**Example:** A malicious actor gaining access to the rg3d development infrastructure and injecting a backdoor into the engine's compiled libraries.

**Impact:**  Introduction of malware or backdoors into any application using the compromised rg3d version.

**Risk Severity:** Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Secure Build Infrastructure for rg3d:**  The rg3d development team needs to maintain a highly secure build environment with strict access controls and integrity checks.
* **Dependency Verification for rg3d:**  The rg3d project should rigorously verify the integrity and authenticity of all its dependencies.
* **Code Signing for rg3d:**  Signing the official rg3d binaries allows developers and users to verify their authenticity and integrity.
* **Transparency and Audits:**  Open communication about the build process and regular security audits can help build trust and identify potential weaknesses.
