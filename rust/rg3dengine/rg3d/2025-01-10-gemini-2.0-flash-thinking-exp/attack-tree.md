## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Asset Loading Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_asset_loading_vulnerabilities.md)

Attack Vector: Loading malicious asset files (models, textures, scenes) crafted to exploit vulnerabilities in rg3d's asset loading and parsing mechanisms.

Potential Impact: Remote Code Execution (RCE), code execution within the application context, denial of service.

Critical Nodes:

    Load Malicious Model File:
        Attack Vector: Loading model files containing crafted data to trigger buffer overflows or exploit parser vulnerabilities.
        Specific Examples:
            Crafted to Trigger Buffer Overflow in Model Parsing: Exploiting weaknesses in how rg3d parses model file formats (e.g., glTF, FBX) leading to memory corruption and potential RCE.
            Exploits Vulnerability in Specific Model Format Parser (e.g., glTF, FBX): Targeting known or zero-day vulnerabilities within the libraries used by rg3d to parse specific model formats.

    Load Malicious Texture File:
        Attack Vector: Loading texture files containing crafted data to trigger buffer overflows or exploit decoder vulnerabilities.
        Specific Example:
            Crafted to Trigger Buffer Overflow in Texture Decoding: Exploiting weaknesses in how rg3d decodes image formats (e.g., PNG, JPEG) leading to memory corruption and potential RCE.

    Load Malicious Scene File:
        Attack Vector: Loading scene files containing malicious scripting logic or exploiting vulnerabilities in scene graph parsing.
        Specific Example:
            Contains Malicious Scripting Logic: Injecting and executing malicious scripts embedded within the scene file, potentially gaining control over the application's logic and data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Networking Vulnerabilities (if application utilizes rg3d's networking features)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_networking_vulnerabilities__if_application_utilizes_rg3d's_networking_features_.md)

Attack Vector: Exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application handles network communication using rg3d's networking features.

Potential Impact: Remote Code Execution (RCE), denial of service, unintended application behavior.

Critical Nodes:

    Malicious Server Response Exploitation:
        Attack Vector: The application receives a malicious response from a server that exploits vulnerabilities in rg3d's network handling.
        Specific Example:
            Crafted Server Response Triggers Buffer Overflow in Network Handling: A specially crafted server response overwhelms a buffer in the application's network handling code, potentially leading to RCE.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Scripting Engine Vulnerabilities (if application utilizes rg3d's scripting features)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_scripting_engine_vulnerabilities__if_application_utilizes_rg3d's_scripting_features_.md)

Attack Vector: Injecting and executing malicious scripts within the application's scripting environment.

Potential Impact: Code execution within the application context, potentially leading to data breaches or manipulation.

Critical Nodes:

    Inject Malicious Scripts:
        Attack Vector: Injecting malicious scripts into the application's scripting engine.
        Specific Example:
            Through User Input Fields: Injecting malicious script code through user input fields that are then processed by the scripting engine without proper sanitization.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Native Code Integration (if application uses custom native code with rg3d)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_native_code_integration__if_application_uses_custom_native_code_with_rg3d_c6485b92.md)

Attack Vector: Exploiting vulnerabilities in custom native code that interfaces with rg3d.

Potential Impact: Remote Code Execution (RCE), application crashes, unexpected behavior.

Critical Nodes:

    Buffer Overflows in Native Code Interfaces:
        Attack Vector: Passing data from rg3d to native code interfaces in a way that causes a buffer overflow in the native code, potentially leading to RCE.
