# Threat Model Analysis for rg3dengine/rg3d

## Threat: [Asset Parsing Buffer Overflow](./threats/asset_parsing_buffer_overflow.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious 3D model or texture file (e.g., `.fbx`, `.gltf`, `.png`, `.jpg`) with oversized or malformed data. When the rg3d engine attempts to parse this asset, it causes a buffer overflow in memory. This can be exploited to overwrite adjacent memory regions, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or application crash.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Code Execution:** In a critical scenario, the attacker could gain control of the application by injecting and executing malicious code.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The application crashes, becoming unavailable to users.
        *   **Data Corruption:** Overwritten memory could lead to data corruption and unpredictable application behavior.
    *   **Affected rg3d Component:** Asset loading module, specifically functions handling parsing of 3D model and image file formats (e.g., within `resource_manager` and format-specific loaders).
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High** (potentially Critical if code execution is possible)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use Latest rg3d Version:** Update to the latest rg3d version as it may contain fixes for known parsing vulnerabilities.
        *   **Input Validation:** Implement input validation on asset files before loading them, checking for file size limits and basic format integrity (though this is difficult for complex binary formats).
        *   **Fuzzing:** Perform fuzz testing on asset parsing functions with malformed files to identify potential buffer overflows.
        *   **Memory Safety Practices:**  rg3d developers should employ memory-safe coding practices in asset parsing code, using bounds checking and safe memory allocation functions.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Run the application in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of potential code execution.

## Threat: [Audio Decoding Vulnerability](./threats/audio_decoding_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a malicious audio file (e.g., `.wav`, `.ogg`, `.mp3`) that exploits a vulnerability in the audio decoding libraries used by rg3d. This could lead to buffer overflows, code execution, or application crashes during audio loading or playback.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Code Execution:** In a critical scenario, the attacker could gain control of the application.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The application crashes or becomes unresponsive.
    *   **Affected rg3d Component:** Audio engine module, specifically functions handling audio file decoding and playback (e.g., within `audio` module and potentially external audio decoding libraries).
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High** (potentially Critical if code execution is possible)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use Latest rg3d Version:** Update to the latest rg3d version, which may include updated and patched audio decoding libraries.
        *   **Input Validation:** Implement basic validation on audio files, checking file types and sizes.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Run the application in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of potential code execution.
        *   **Dependency Updates:** Ensure that the audio decoding libraries used by rg3d are regularly updated and patched for known vulnerabilities (rg3d developers responsibility).
