        *   Utilizing memory safety tools (Valgrind, AddressSanitizer) during rg3d development and testing.
        *   Fuzzing asset loaders and other input processing components to detect memory corruption issues.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1. Buffer Overflow in Asset Loading](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1__buffer_overflow_in_asset_loading.md)

*   **Why High-Risk/Critical:** Asset loading (models, textures, scenes) is a frequent and critical operation in game engines. Buffer overflows in asset loaders are a common vulnerability type and easily triggered by malicious assets.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **1.1.1.1. Malicious 3D Model (e.g., .FBX, .GLTF) Parsing [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Crafted 3D model files designed to trigger buffer overflows during parsing by rg3d's model loaders.
        *   **1.1.1.2. Malicious Texture (e.g., .PNG, .JPEG) Loading [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Crafted texture files designed to trigger buffer overflows during image decoding by rg3d's image loading libraries.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Fuzzing:**  Extensively fuzz rg3d's model and texture loaders with a wide range of malformed and malicious files.
        *   **Input Validation and Bounds Checking:** Implement strict input validation and bounds checking in all asset parsing and loading code within rg3d.
        *   **Safe Libraries:** Use well-vetted and secure third-party libraries for image and model format parsing. Keep these libraries updated.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Dependencies of rg3d](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_dependencies_of_rg3d.md)

*   **Why High-Risk/Critical:** rg3d relies on third-party libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be indirectly exploited to compromise applications using rg3d. Dependency vulnerabilities are often widespread and easily discoverable.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in outdated or vulnerable third-party libraries used by rg3d (e.g., image loading libraries, physics engines, audio libraries).
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Software Bill of Materials (SBOM):** Maintain a detailed SBOM of all rg3d dependencies.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan rg3d's dependencies for known vulnerabilities using vulnerability scanners.
        *   **Dependency Updates:**  Keep all rg3d dependencies updated to the latest secure versions.
        *   **Dependency Pinning:** Use dependency pinning to ensure consistent and controlled dependency versions.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1. Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Libraries used by rg3d](./attack_tree_paths/2_1__vulnerabilities_in_third-party_libraries_used_by_rg3d.md)

*   **Why High-Risk/Critical:** This node highlights the specific risk associated with third-party libraries. These libraries are often complex and may contain vulnerabilities that are not directly under rg3d's control.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Same as node 2, focusing on vulnerabilities within the libraries themselves.
    *   **Mitigation:** Same as node 2, emphasizing proactive dependency management.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1. Outdated or Vulnerable Libraries (e.g., image loading, physics, audio)](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1__outdated_or_vulnerable_libraries__e_g___image_loading__physics__audio_.md)

*   **Why High-Risk/Critical:** Outdated libraries are a prime target for attackers as known vulnerabilities are often publicly documented and easily exploitable.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities (e.g., CVEs) in outdated versions of image loading, physics, audio, or other libraries used by rg3d.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Aggressively prioritize updating outdated dependencies. Implement automated dependency update processes and vulnerability scanning.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1.1. Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities in Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1_1__exploiting_known_vulnerabilities_in_dependencies.md)

*   **Why High-Risk/Critical:** This is the direct action of exploiting a known vulnerability in a dependency. Successful exploitation can lead to code execution or other severe impacts.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Using exploit code or techniques targeting specific CVEs in rg3d's dependencies.
    *   **Mitigation:**  The primary mitigation is to *prevent* this by keeping dependencies updated and addressing vulnerabilities proactively (as outlined in previous dependency-related nodes).

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Misconfigurations or Misuse of rg3d in the Application](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_misconfigurations_or_misuse_of_rg3d_in_the_application.md)

*   **Why High-Risk/Critical:** Even a secure engine can be rendered vulnerable if it's misused or misconfigured by the application developer. This path highlights risks arising from application-level code interacting with rg3d.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Insecure asset handling, insecure network integration, improper use of rg3d APIs, and other application-specific vulnerabilities related to rg3d integration.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Secure coding practices in the application code that interacts with rg3d.
        *   Thorough security testing of the application, focusing on rg3d integration points.
        *   Security training for developers on secure rg3d usage.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1. Insecure Asset Handling by the Application](./attack_tree_paths/3_1__insecure_asset_handling_by_the_application.md)

*   **Why High-Risk/Critical:** If the application handles assets insecurely (e.g., loading from untrusted sources without validation), it can bypass rg3d's security and introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Loading malicious assets from untrusted sources (user uploads, network downloads) without proper sanitization and validation before passing them to rg3d.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Secure Asset Pipeline:** Implement a secure asset pipeline that includes validation, sanitization, and integrity checks for all assets before loading them into rg3d.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Avoid loading assets directly from untrusted sources if possible. Use a controlled and secure asset management system.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1.1. Loading Assets from Untrusted Sources without Validation](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_1__loading_assets_from_untrusted_sources_without_validation.md)

*   **Why High-Risk/Critical:** Directly loading untrusted assets without validation is a very common and easily exploitable vulnerability. Attackers can provide malicious assets to trigger vulnerabilities in rg3d's asset loaders.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **3.1.1.1. Application directly loads user-provided or network-fetched assets without sanitization [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** The application directly uses user-provided files or files fetched from the network as assets for rg3d without any security checks.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Never directly load untrusted assets:** Always validate and sanitize assets from untrusted sources before loading them into rg3d.
        *   **Asset Validation:** Implement robust validation checks to ensure assets conform to expected formats and do not contain malicious content.
        *   **Sandboxing/Isolation:** Consider processing and validating assets in a sandboxed or isolated environment to limit the impact of potential exploits.
