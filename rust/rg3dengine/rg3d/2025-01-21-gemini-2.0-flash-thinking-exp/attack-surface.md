# Attack Surface Analysis for rg3dengine/rg3d

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Asset Loading](./attack_surfaces/malicious_asset_loading.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities within rg3d's asset parsing libraries to execute arbitrary code or cause denial of service when loading game assets.
*   **How rg3d contributes to the attack surface:** rg3d's engine code directly handles parsing of various asset formats (e.g., `.rgs`, `.fbx`, `.obj`, `.png`, `.wav`). Vulnerabilities in *rg3d's* parsing logic for these formats are the direct attack vector.
*   **Example:** A crafted `.rgs` scene file, when loaded by an application using rg3d, triggers a buffer overflow in *rg3d's* FBX parser, leading to remote code execution.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), System Compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation in rg3d Integration:** Implement validation checks *before* passing asset files to rg3d for loading.
    *   **Regular rg3d Updates:** Keep rg3d updated to benefit from patches to asset loading vulnerabilities within the engine.
    *   **Sandboxing Asset Loading (Application Level):**  If feasible, isolate asset loading processes in a sandboxed environment within the application using rg3d.
    *   **Asset Integrity Checks (Application Level):** Implement checksum or signature verification of assets *before* loading them with rg3d.

## Attack Surface: [Shader Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/shader_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Injecting malicious shader code that, when processed by rg3d, causes rendering issues, denial of service, or potentially exploits GPU driver vulnerabilities.
*   **How rg3d contributes to the attack surface:** rg3d's rendering pipeline compiles and executes shaders. Vulnerabilities in *rg3d's* shader compilation or handling process, or allowing loading of untrusted shaders *into rg3d*, creates this attack surface.
*   **Example:** A custom material with a malicious shader, loaded into rg3d, triggers a vulnerability in *rg3d's* shader compiler, leading to a GPU driver crash and denial of service.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), Potential GPU Driver Exploitation, Rendering Instability.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (Critical if GPU driver exploitation is possible).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Shader Code Review (Application Level):**  Carefully review and sanitize any shader code *before* it's loaded and used by rg3d.
    *   **Restrict Shader Sources (Application Level):** Limit the ability to load shaders from untrusted sources *into rg3d* in production.
    *   **Shader Whitelisting (Application Level):** Implement a whitelist of allowed shaders or material properties that can be used with rg3d.
    *   **Regular rg3d Updates:** Keep rg3d updated to benefit from any fixes related to shader processing vulnerabilities within the engine.

## Attack Surface: [Scripting Engine Exploits (Lua/WASM)](./attack_surfaces/scripting_engine_exploits__luawasm_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in rg3d's Lua or WASM scripting integration to inject malicious scripts and escape the scripting sandbox, leading to unauthorized access or control.
*   **How rg3d contributes to the attack surface:** rg3d directly integrates Lua and WASM. The security of the scripting sandbox and the integration itself are managed by *rg3d*. Weaknesses in *rg3d's* scripting implementation are the vulnerability.
*   **Example:** An attacker injects malicious Lua code into a game save file. When the game loads this save and rg3d executes the script through its Lua integration, the attacker escapes the sandbox and gains unauthorized access to engine functionalities or system resources.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized Access, Data Manipulation, Game Logic Manipulation, System Compromise (if sandbox escape is successful).
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (Critical if sandbox escape leads to system compromise).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Sandbox Configuration (rg3d Level):** Ensure rg3d's scripting integration utilizes a robust and properly configured sandbox. (This might be limited by rg3d's design, requiring careful application-level sandboxing on top).
    *   **Restrict Script Sources (Application Level):** Avoid loading scripts from untrusted sources *into rg3d*.
    *   **Input Sanitization for Scripts (Application Level):** If dynamic script loading is necessary, carefully validate and sanitize script inputs *before* they are processed by rg3d's scripting engine.
    *   **Regular rg3d Updates:** Keep rg3d and its scripting engine components updated to patch sandbox vulnerabilities within *rg3d*.

## Attack Surface: [Unsafe Rust Code Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/unsafe_rust_code_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Memory safety issues (buffer overflows, use-after-free, etc.) arising from `unsafe` Rust code *within rg3d's codebase*, potentially leading to remote code execution or denial of service.
*   **How rg3d contributes to the attack surface:** As a Rust engine, rg3d might use `unsafe` blocks for performance or low-level operations. Memory safety vulnerabilities in *rg3d's own `unsafe` code* are a direct attack surface.
*   **Example:** An `unsafe` code block in *rg3d's* rendering module contains a buffer overflow. By providing a specific scene that triggers this code path, an attacker can cause a crash or potentially achieve remote code execution by exploiting this *rg3d-internal* vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), Remote Code Execution (RCE), Memory Corruption, System Compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular rg3d Updates:**  Rely on rg3d developers to identify and fix `unsafe` code vulnerabilities. Keeping rg3d updated is crucial to receive these fixes.
    *   **Community Security Audits (External):** Encourage and support community security audits of the rg3d engine codebase to identify potential `unsafe` code vulnerabilities.
    *   **Report Potential Issues:** If developers using rg3d suspect memory safety issues, report them to the rg3d development team.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in rg3d's dependencies (Rust crates) to compromise applications using rg3d.
*   **How rg3d contributes to the attack surface:** rg3d relies on external Rust crates. Vulnerabilities in *rg3d's chosen dependencies* indirectly become part of the attack surface for applications using rg3d.  *rg3d's dependency choices* and update practices influence this risk.
*   **Example:** A critical vulnerability is discovered in an image processing crate used by rg3d. An attacker exploits this vulnerability by providing a crafted image asset that triggers the vulnerability through *rg3d's* asset loading pipeline, leveraging the vulnerable dependency.
*   **Impact:** Various impacts depending on the dependency vulnerability, including Remote Code Execution, Denial of Service, Data Breach, System Compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (Critical depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular rg3d Updates:** Keep rg3d updated, as engine updates often include dependency updates that patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Dependency Auditing (rg3d Development):** Encourage rg3d developers to regularly audit their dependencies using tools like `cargo audit` and proactively update vulnerable dependencies.
    *   **Security Monitoring (rg3d Development & Application Level):** Monitor security advisories for Rust crates used by rg3d and for rg3d itself to be aware of potential dependency vulnerabilities.
