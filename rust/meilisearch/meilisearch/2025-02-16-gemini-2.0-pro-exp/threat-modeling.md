# Threat Model Analysis for meilisearch/meilisearch

## Threat: [Unauthorized Data Access via Compromised API Key](./threats/unauthorized_data_access_via_compromised_api_key.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Data Access via Compromised API Key

    *   **Description:** An attacker obtains a Meilisearch API key (especially the master key or a key with excessive permissions) and uses it to directly query the Meilisearch API. They can retrieve all indexed data.
    *   **Impact:** Complete data breach; loss of confidentiality, integrity, and potentially availability (if the attacker deletes data).
    *   **Affected Component:** Meilisearch API (specifically, `/indexes/{index_uid}/documents`, `/indexes/{index_uid}/search`, `/keys`). The key management system itself.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Least Privilege Principle:** Use API keys with the minimum necessary permissions. Create separate keys for searching, indexing, and administration. Avoid using the master key in the application.
        *   **Key Rotation:** Regularly rotate API keys, especially the master key.
        *   **Tenant Tokens (Multi-tenancy):** For multi-tenant applications, use tenant tokens.
        *   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Monitor API key usage and set up alerts for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion

    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a large volume of complex or computationally expensive search queries, overwhelming Meilisearch's resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O), causing it to become slow or unresponsive.
    *   **Impact:** Service unavailability; disruption of business operations.
    *   **Affected Component:** Meilisearch's search engine core (query processing and ranking), the indexing engine (if many update requests are sent), and the underlying server infrastructure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement strict rate limiting on the Meilisearch API, both globally and per API key/tenant token.
        *   **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor Meilisearch's resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O) and set up alerts.
        *   **Horizontal/Vertical Scaling:** Design the Meilisearch deployment to be scalable.

## Threat: [Index Corruption/Deletion via Compromised Write Key](./threats/index_corruptiondeletion_via_compromised_write_key.md)

*   **Threat:** Index Corruption/Deletion via Compromised Write Key

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to a Meilisearch API key with write permissions (or the master key) and uses it to delete the index or add/modify documents to corrupt it.
    *   **Impact:** Data loss or corruption; service unavailability.
    *   **Affected Component:** Meilisearch API (`/indexes/{index_uid}/documents`, `/indexes/{index_uid}`, `/tasks`). The indexing engine.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Key Management:** Protect write-enabled keys carefully. Use the least privilege principle.
        *   **Regular Backups:** Implement a robust backup and recovery strategy.
        *   **Audit Logging:** Enable and monitor audit logs to track write operations.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Meilisearch Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_meilisearch_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploitation of Meilisearch Vulnerabilities

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known or zero-day vulnerability in Meilisearch or its dependencies, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, data breaches, or denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Varies, but could range from data breaches to complete system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Potentially any part of the Meilisearch codebase or its dependencies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Meilisearch and its dependencies updated.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use vulnerability scanning tools.
        *   **Security Monitoring:** Monitor security advisories and mailing lists.
