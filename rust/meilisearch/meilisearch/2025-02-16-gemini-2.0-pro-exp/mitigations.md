# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for meilisearch/meilisearch

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict API Key Management (Meilisearch-Specific Aspects)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_api_key_management__meilisearch-specific_aspects_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Create separate API keys:** For each distinct interaction with Meilisearch (searching, indexing, settings updates), create a dedicated API key *within Meilisearch*.
2.  **Assign least privilege:** Use Meilisearch's built-in action controls (`documents.add`, `search`, `indexes.create`, `settings.get`, `settings.update`, etc.) and index restrictions (using wildcards or specific index names) to grant *only* the minimum necessary permissions to each key.  *Never* use the master key in application code.  Leverage tenant tokens if your use case involves multi-tenancy.
3.  **Rotation schedule:** Establish a regular schedule for rotating API keys *within Meilisearch*.  Automate this process if possible, using Meilisearch's API.
4.  **Monitoring (Meilisearch Logs):** If Meilisearch's logging is configured to include API key information, regularly review these logs to detect unusual API key activity.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from gaining full control of the Meilisearch instance if an API key is compromised. Limits the blast radius.
*   **Data Exfiltration (High Severity):** Restricts an attacker's ability to retrieve all data if they obtain a key with limited read permissions.
*   **Data Modification/Deletion (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from adding, modifying, or deleting data if they obtain a key without write permissions.
*   **Denial of Service (via API abuse) (Medium Severity):** Limits the ability of an attacker to abuse the API with a compromised key.

**Impact:**
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk significantly reduced. A compromised key grants only limited access.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Risk significantly reduced. Attackers can only access data permitted by the compromised key.
*   **Data Modification/Deletion:** Risk significantly reduced. Attackers cannot modify data without appropriate permissions.
*   **Denial of Service (via API abuse):** Risk moderately reduced.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Separate API keys for searching and indexing are used.
*   Basic monitoring of API requests is in place via server logs (assuming Meilisearch logs are configured to include this).

**Missing Implementation:**
*   API key rotation is not yet automated (within Meilisearch).
*   Granular permissions within indexes (using wildcards) are not fully utilized.
*   Dedicated monitoring for API key abuse within Meilisearch logs is not in place.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limitation (Meilisearch Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limitation__meilisearch_configuration_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Analyze typical usage:** Determine the expected maximum index size, document size, and other resource requirements for your application.
2.  **Configure Meilisearch limits:** Use Meilisearch's configuration options (e.g., `max-index-size`, `max-payload-size`, `http-payload-size-limit`, `max-indexing-memory`, `max-indexing-threads`) to set appropriate limits *directly within Meilisearch's configuration*. These settings control how Meilisearch allocates resources.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from overwhelming Meilisearch with excessively large payloads or causing it to consume excessive resources.
*   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Limits the resources consumed by Meilisearch, preventing it from crashing due to excessive memory or disk usage.

**Impact:**
*   **Denial of Service:** Risk significantly reduced. Configuration limits prevent excessive resource consumption.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk significantly reduced.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Basic Meilisearch resource limits (`max-index-size`, `max-payload-size`) are configured.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   More granular limits (e.g., `max-indexing-memory`, `max-indexing-threads`) are not yet configured based on a thorough analysis of resource usage.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Careful Index Design and Search Result Filtering (Using Meilisearch Features)](./mitigation_strategies/careful_index_design_and_search_result_filtering__using_meilisearch_features_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Minimize indexed fields:** Only index the fields that are *absolutely necessary* for searching *within Meilisearch*. Avoid indexing sensitive fields unless strictly required.
2.  **Use `attributesToRetrieve`:** In your search queries *sent to Meilisearch*, explicitly specify the attributes you want to retrieve using the `attributesToRetrieve` parameter. *Never* retrieve all attributes by default.
3. **Use `attributesToHighlight`:** If highlighting is needed, use `attributesToHighlight` to specify which attributes should be highlighted.
4. **Use `filter`:** If filtering is needed, use `filter` to specify which attributes should be filtered.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Data Exfiltration (High Severity):** Limits the amount of data exposed in search results returned by Meilisearch, even if an attacker gains access to the search API.
*   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of unintentionally revealing sensitive information through search queries.

**Impact:**
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Risk significantly reduced. Only specified attributes are returned by Meilisearch.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Risk moderately reduced. Careful index design minimizes exposure.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   `attributesToRetrieve` is used in some search queries.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Not all search queries consistently use `attributesToRetrieve`.
*   A comprehensive review of indexed fields to identify and potentially remove unnecessary sensitive data has not been performed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Proactive Vulnerability Management (Updating Meilisearch)](./mitigation_strategies/proactive_vulnerability_management__updating_meilisearch_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Subscribe to updates:** Subscribe to Meilisearch's release announcements, security advisories, and any relevant mailing lists.
2.  **Regular updates:** Establish a process for regularly updating the *Meilisearch software itself* to the latest stable version. Automate this process if possible.
3.  **Rollback plan:** Have a documented plan for quickly rolling back to a previous, known-good version of *Meilisearch* in case an update causes problems.
4.  **Testing:** Before deploying *Meilisearch updates* to production, thoroughly test them in a staging environment.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of attackers exploiting known vulnerabilities in the Meilisearch software.
*   **Zero-Day Exploits (Unknown Severity, Potentially High):** While not directly preventable, staying up-to-date reduces the window of opportunity.

**Impact:**
*   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities:** Risk significantly reduced. Regular updates patch known vulnerabilities.
*   **Zero-Day Exploits:** Risk moderately reduced (by minimizing the attack window).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Meilisearch is updated periodically, but not on a strict schedule.
*   A basic rollback plan exists.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Automated updates are not implemented.
*   Subscription to security advisories is not formalized.
*   Testing of updates in a staging environment is not consistently performed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Backups (Using Meilisearch's Snapshot Feature)](./mitigation_strategies/regular_backups__using_meilisearch's_snapshot_feature_.md)

**Description:**
1. **Determine Backup Frequency:** Decide how often backups should be taken.
2. **Automate Backups:** Use a script or tool to automate the backup process, leveraging *Meilisearch's built-in snapshot feature*. This creates a point-in-time copy of the Meilisearch data.
3. **Secure Storage:** Store the snapshots in a secure location.
4. **Test Restoration:** Regularly test restoring from the Meilisearch snapshots.
5. **Retention Policy:** Define a retention policy.

**Threats Mitigated:**
* **Data Loss (High Severity):** Protects against data loss.
* **Data Corruption (High Severity):** Allows restoring to a previous, uncorrupted state.
* **Ransomware Attacks (High Severity):** Provides a way to recover data.

**Impact:**
* **Data Loss:** Risk significantly reduced.
* **Data Corruption:** Risk significantly reduced.
* **Ransomware Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced.

**Currently Implemented:**
* Manual backups using Meilisearch's snapshot feature are performed occasionally.

**Missing Implementation:**
* Automated backups using the snapshot feature are not implemented.
* Restoration testing is not performed regularly.
* A formal backup retention policy is not defined.
