# BUSINESS POSTURE

Meilisearch is a search engine designed to be fast, relevant, and easy to integrate. It aims to provide a powerful search-as-you-type experience with minimal setup and configuration. The project is open-source, targeting developers and businesses that need a flexible and customizable search solution without the complexity of traditional search engines like Elasticsearch.

Business Priorities:

- Provide a fast and relevant search experience.
- Easy integration and deployment for developers.
- Customizable and extensible to fit various use cases.
- Maintain a strong open-source community.
- Offer a viable alternative to existing search solutions.

Business Goals:

- Increase adoption by developers and businesses.
- Expand the feature set based on community feedback.
- Ensure scalability and reliability for production use.
- Maintain high performance and low latency.

Most Important Business Risks:

- Data breaches or unauthorized access to search data.
- Performance degradation or service unavailability under heavy load.
- Inability to scale to meet growing demand.
- Vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.
- Loss of community trust due to security or privacy issues.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

- security control: API keys for authentication and access control. Described in documentation and implemented in the code.
- security control: HTTPS support for secure communication. Described in documentation and implemented in the code.
- security control: Basic input sanitization to prevent common injection attacks. Implemented in the code.
- security control: Regular updates and dependency management to address known vulnerabilities. Managed through GitHub and package managers.
- security control: Documentation on secure deployment and configuration. Available in the official documentation.

Accepted Risks:

- accepted risk: Limited built-in protection against DDoS attacks.
- accepted risk: Reliance on third-party libraries, which may introduce vulnerabilities.
- accepted risk: Potential for misconfiguration by users, leading to security issues.

Recommended Security Controls:

- Implement rate limiting and throttling to mitigate DDoS attacks.
- Introduce comprehensive input validation and sanitization to prevent a wider range of injection attacks.
- Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) and other security headers.
- Provide detailed security hardening guides for production deployments.
- Implement robust monitoring and alerting for security-related events.

Security Requirements:

- Authentication:
    - All API requests must be authenticated using API keys.
    - Support for multiple API keys with different permission levels.
    - Secure storage and management of API keys.
- Authorization:
    - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to restrict access to specific API endpoints and data.
    - Granular control over search and indexing operations.
- Input Validation:
    - Strict validation of all input parameters to prevent injection attacks.
    - Sanitization of search queries and indexed data.
    - Protection against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, etc.).
- Cryptography:
    - Use of HTTPS for all communication.
    - Secure generation and storage of API keys.
    - Encryption of sensitive data at rest (if applicable).
