## Attack Tree Path: [Attacker's Goal: Unauthorized Data Access/Modification/Exfiltration or Service Disruption](./attack_tree_paths/attacker's_goal_unauthorized_data_accessmodificationexfiltration_or_service_disruption.md)

*   **Description:** The ultimate objective of the attacker: to gain unauthorized access to data, modify it, steal it, or disrupt the Meilisearch service.
*   **Likelihood:** N/A (This is the goal, not an attack step)
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** N/A
*   **Skill Level:** N/A
*   **Detection Difficulty:** N/A

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Exfiltration/Modification](./attack_tree_paths/data_exfiltrationmodification.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker aims to steal or alter data stored within Meilisearch.
*   **Likelihood:** High (if vulnerabilities exist)
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Varies
*   **Skill Level:** Varies
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Admin API](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_admin_api.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker gains access to the Meilisearch admin API, granting full control.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (if key is secured) / High (if key is exposed)
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Varies greatly
*   **Skill Level:** Varies greatly
*   **Detection Difficulty:** High

## Attack Tree Path: [Read Admin Key](./attack_tree_paths/read_admin_key.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker obtains the admin API key.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (if key is secured) / High (if exposed)
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Varies greatly (from Very Low if exposed, to Very High if requiring server compromise)
*   **Skill Level:** Varies greatly (from Very Low if exposed, to Very High if requiring server compromise)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** High (requires monitoring access to the key storage location)

## Attack Tree Path: [Write Admin Key](./attack_tree_paths/write_admin_key.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker overwrites the admin API key with one they control.
*   **Likelihood:** Very Low (requires significant system compromise)
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Very High
*   **Skill Level:** Very High
*   **Detection Difficulty:** High (requires monitoring system configuration changes)

## Attack Tree Path: [Unauthorized Access to Meilisearch Instance](./attack_tree_paths/unauthorized_access_to_meilisearch_instance.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker gains unauthorized access to the Meilisearch instance, a prerequisite for many other attacks.
*   **Likelihood:** High (if vulnerabilities exist)
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Varies
*   **Skill Level:** Varies
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High

## Attack Tree Path: [Brute-Force Keys](./attack_tree_paths/brute-force_keys.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker attempts to guess the API key through repeated attempts.
*   **Likelihood:** High (if weak keys are used) / Very Low (if strong keys are used)
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Weak API Key](./attack_tree_paths/weak_api_key.md)

*   **Description:** A weak or easily guessable API key is used.
*   **Likelihood:** High (if a weak key is used) / Very Low (if a strong key is used)
*   **Impact:** Very High (full access to the specific API key's permissions)
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium (depending on key strength)
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (requires monitoring failed authentication attempts)

## Attack Tree Path: [Steal Keys](./attack_tree_paths/steal_keys.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker obtains the API key through means other than brute-forcing (e.g., finding it in exposed code).
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (depends on development practices)
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Very Low (if the key is publicly exposed)
*   **Skill Level:** Very Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High

## Attack Tree Path: [Leaked API Key](./attack_tree_paths/leaked_api_key.md)

*   **Description:** The API key is accidentally exposed in a publicly accessible location.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (depends on development practices)
*   **Impact:** Very High (full access to the specific API key's permissions)
*   **Effort:** Very Low (if the key is publicly exposed)
*   **Skill Level:** Very Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High (requires monitoring code repositories, logs, etc.)

## Attack Tree Path: [Exposed API Key in GitHub/logs](./attack_tree_paths/exposed_api_key_in_githublogs.md)

*   **Description:** The API key is found in a code repository or log files.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (depends on development practices)
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Very Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfiguration](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker leverages a misconfiguration in the Meilisearch setup.
*   **Likelihood:** High (if misconfigurations exist)
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Default API Key](./attack_tree_paths/default_api_key.md)

*   **Description:** The default Meilisearch API key has not been changed.
*   **Likelihood:** High (if not changed) / Very Low (if changed)
*   **Impact:** Very High (full access)
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Very Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Low (easily detectable with basic security checks)

## Attack Tree Path: [No Rate Limiting](./attack_tree_paths/no_rate_limiting.md)

*   **Description:** Rate limiting is not implemented, making other attacks easier.
*   **Likelihood:** High (if not implemented)
*   **Impact:** Increases the likelihood and impact of other attacks (DoS, brute-force)
*   **Effort:** N/A (this is a lack of a security measure)
*   **Skill Level:** N/A
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Low (easily detectable with basic security checks)

## Attack Tree Path: [Exposed Admin Key](./attack_tree_paths/exposed_admin_key.md)

*   **Description:** The admin key is exposed, granting full access.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (depends on security practices)
*   **Impact:** Very High (full control)
*   **Effort:** Very Low (if exposed)
*   **Skill Level:** Very Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High
