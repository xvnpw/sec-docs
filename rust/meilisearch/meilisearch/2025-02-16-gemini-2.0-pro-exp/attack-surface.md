# Attack Surface Analysis for meilisearch/meilisearch

## Attack Surface: [API Key Exposure and Misuse](./attack_surfaces/api_key_exposure_and_misuse.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized access and control of the Meilisearch instance due to compromised or improperly used API keys.
*   **Meilisearch Contribution:** Meilisearch relies on API keys for authentication and authorization. The level of access granted depends on the key type (master, private, public).
*   **Example:** A developer accidentally commits the master key to a public GitHub repository. An attacker finds the key and uses it to delete all indexes.
*   **Impact:** Complete data loss, data modification, service disruption, potential data exfiltration.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never** commit API keys to version control.
    *   Use environment variables or a secure secret management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
    *   Generate separate API keys with the *minimum necessary permissions* (principle of least privilege) for different applications and users (e.g., search-only keys for front-end applications).
    *   Implement a key rotation policy and automate the rotation process.
    *   Regularly audit API key usage and permissions.
    *   Use strong, randomly generated keys.

## Attack Surface: [Unintended Data Exposure](./attack_surfaces/unintended_data_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive data is unintentionally revealed through search results due to misconfigured index settings.
*   **Meilisearch Contribution:** Meilisearch's indexing and search capabilities can expose data if `displayedAttributes`, `searchableAttributes`, and `filterableAttributes` are not configured correctly.
*   **Example:** An index containing user data includes email addresses in `searchableAttributes` without proper access controls.  A public search query reveals these email addresses.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, privacy violation, potential for phishing attacks or identity theft.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully define `displayedAttributes`, `searchableAttributes`, and `filterableAttributes` to control which fields are returned in search results and which are searchable/filterable.
    *   Use `attributesForFaceting` strategically.
    *   Thoroughly test search queries with different API keys and user roles to ensure only intended data is exposed.
    *   Consider data masking or tokenization for highly sensitive fields *before* indexing them in Meilisearch.
    *   Implement strong access controls at the application layer to restrict access to sensitive data.

## Attack Surface: [Index Poisoning / Data Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/index_poisoning__data_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with write access modifies the index by adding malicious documents, altering existing ones, or deleting data.
*   **Meilisearch Contribution:** Meilisearch allows adding, updating, and deleting documents via its API.  Compromised write access allows an attacker to manipulate the index.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains access to a private API key and adds documents containing malicious JavaScript code (intended for XSS if the application displaying results is vulnerable).  Alternatively, they could delete crucial documents, disrupting service.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, service disruption, potential for XSS attacks (if the application layer is vulnerable), misinformation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly control write access to the index using API keys with limited permissions.
    *   Implement robust input validation *at the application layer* before sending data to Meilisearch. This is crucial to prevent malicious content from being indexed.
    *   Monitor index size and content for anomalies (sudden spikes in document count, unexpected data).
    *   Regularly back up the Meilisearch data directory.
    *   Implement audit logging to track changes to the index.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker overwhelms the Meilisearch instance, making it unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **Meilisearch Contribution:** Meilisearch, like any service, is susceptible to resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, disk).  Its search and indexing operations can be targeted.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a flood of complex search queries with extremely long keywords or wildcard patterns, consuming excessive CPU and memory.  Alternatively, they could repeatedly create and delete indexes.
*   **Impact:** Service unavailability, disruption of business operations.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement rate limiting on API requests (per API key, per IP address).
    *   Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, disk) and set alerts for unusual activity.
    *   Use a firewall or Web Application Firewall (WAF) to filter malicious traffic.
    *   Consider using a load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple Meilisearch instances (horizontal scaling).
    *   Stay updated with Meilisearch releases, as they often include performance improvements and mitigations for potential DoS vulnerabilities.
    *   Tune Meilisearch configuration parameters (e.g., maximum index size, maximum document size) to limit resource consumption.

## Attack Surface: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities (CVEs)](./attack_surfaces/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities__cves_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit known or unknown vulnerabilities in the Meilisearch software.
*   **Meilisearch Contribution:** Like all software, Meilisearch may have vulnerabilities, especially in older versions.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a known CVE in an outdated version of Meilisearch to gain unauthorized access or execute arbitrary code.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, ranging from data breaches to complete system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the CVE)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Meilisearch to the latest stable version.
    *   Subscribe to Meilisearch security advisories and mailing lists.
    *   Use a vulnerability scanner to identify outdated software and known vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement a robust patch management process.
    *   While not a direct mitigation for zero-days, following general security best practices (least privilege, input validation, monitoring) reduces the overall attack surface and potential impact.

## Attack Surface: [Network Exposure](./attack_surfaces/network_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Exposing the Meilisearch instance directly to the public internet without adequate network protection.
*   **Meilisearch Contribution:** Meilisearch listens on a network port (default 7700). If this port is exposed without proper controls, anyone can connect.
*   **Example:** A Meilisearch instance is deployed on a cloud server with a public IP address and no firewall rules, allowing anyone on the internet to access it.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the Meilisearch instance, potential for data breaches, DoS attacks, and complete control by an attacker.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use a firewall (e.g., `iptables`, cloud provider's security groups) to restrict access to the Meilisearch port (default 7700) to only authorized IP addresses or networks.
    *   Do *not* expose Meilisearch directly to the public internet unless absolutely necessary. If public access is required, use a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, Apache) with proper authentication and authorization.
    *   Consider using a VPN or private network to isolate the Meilisearch instance.
    *   Bind Meilisearch to a specific network interface (e.g., localhost) if it only needs to be accessible from the same machine.
