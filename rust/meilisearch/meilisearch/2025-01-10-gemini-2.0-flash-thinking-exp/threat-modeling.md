# Threat Model Analysis for meilisearch/meilisearch

## Threat: [Unauthorized Data Access via Meilisearch API](./threats/unauthorized_data_access_via_meilisearch_api.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to Meilisearch API keys (e.g., through exposed configuration files, compromised developer machines, or network sniffing). Using these keys, the attacker can directly query the Meilisearch API to retrieve indexed data. They might iterate through search queries or use specific filters to extract sensitive information.

**Impact:** Confidential data indexed within Meilisearch can be exposed, leading to privacy violations, reputational damage, and potential legal repercussions.

**Affected Component:** `Meilisearch API` (specifically the search endpoints and potentially the documents endpoint if write access is also gained).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Securely store and manage Meilisearch API keys using environment variables or dedicated secrets management solutions.
*   Implement strict access controls on systems and networks that store or transmit API keys.
*   Regularly rotate API keys.
*   Utilize Meilisearch's built-in API key permissions to restrict access to read-only operations if write access is not required.
*   Monitor API access logs for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Data Injection/Modification via Meilisearch API](./threats/data_injectionmodification_via_meilisearch_api.md)

**Description:** An attacker with compromised or overly permissive API keys uses the Meilisearch API (specifically the documents endpoint) to inject malicious or incorrect data into the index or modify existing data. This could involve adding spam, misinformation, or corrupting legitimate records.

**Impact:** Search results can be manipulated, leading users to incorrect information or malicious content. The integrity of the indexed data is compromised, potentially affecting application functionality and user trust.

**Affected Component:** `Meilisearch API` (specifically the documents endpoint).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict input validation and sanitization on data before indexing it in Meilisearch.
*   Utilize Meilisearch's API key permissions to restrict write access to only authorized components or services.
*   Implement auditing and logging of data modifications within Meilisearch.
*   Regularly back up Meilisearch data to facilitate recovery from data corruption.

## Threat: [Exposure of Meilisearch Snapshots/Dumps](./threats/exposure_of_meilisearch_snapshotsdumps.md)

**Description:** Meilisearch data snapshots or dumps, which contain the entire indexed dataset, are stored in an insecure location or with insufficient access controls. An attacker gains access to these files, either intentionally or unintentionally.

**Impact:** All data indexed within Meilisearch is exposed, leading to a significant data breach with severe consequences.

**Affected Component:** `Meilisearch Snapshot/Dump Functionality` and the storage location of these files.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Securely store Meilisearch snapshots and backups in a dedicated, access-controlled location.
*   Encrypt Meilisearch snapshots and backups at rest.
*   Regularly review and restrict access permissions to the storage location of snapshots and backups.
*   Avoid storing snapshots in publicly accessible locations.

## Threat: [Insecure Meilisearch Configuration](./threats/insecure_meilisearch_configuration.md)

**Description:** The Meilisearch instance is configured with insecure settings, such as default API keys, disabled authentication, or overly permissive access rules. An attacker exploiting these misconfigurations can gain unauthorized access or control over the Meilisearch instance.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the Meilisearch instance, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, and potential service disruption.

**Affected Component:** `Meilisearch Configuration`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Follow Meilisearch security best practices during installation and configuration.
*   Change default API keys immediately.
*   Enable authentication and authorization mechanisms.
*   Carefully configure network access rules to restrict access to the Meilisearch instance.
*   Regularly review and audit Meilisearch configuration settings.

## Threat: [Bypassing Application Authentication via Direct Meilisearch Access](./threats/bypassing_application_authentication_via_direct_meilisearch_access.md)

**Description:** If the Meilisearch instance is directly accessible from the internet or an untrusted network without proper network segmentation, an attacker could bypass the application's authentication mechanisms and interact with the Meilisearch API directly, potentially performing actions they are not authorized for within the application context.

**Impact:** Attackers can bypass application-level security controls and directly access or manipulate data within Meilisearch.

**Affected Component:** `Meilisearch API` and network configuration.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement network segmentation to isolate the Meilisearch instance within a private network.
*   Use firewall rules to restrict access to the Meilisearch instance to only authorized application components.
*   Ensure that the Meilisearch instance is not directly exposed to the public internet.

## Threat: [API Key Exposure in Client-Side Code](./threats/api_key_exposure_in_client-side_code.md)

**Description:**  If the application uses Meilisearch's API directly from client-side code (e.g., JavaScript in a web browser) and includes API keys in that code, these keys can be easily exposed to attackers inspecting the client-side code.

**Impact:** Compromised API keys allow attackers to perform actions against the Meilisearch instance, potentially leading to data breaches or manipulation.

**Affected Component:** `Meilisearch API` and the application's client-side code.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Never** include Meilisearch API keys directly in client-side code.
*   Implement a backend proxy or API gateway to handle communication with Meilisearch, keeping API keys secure on the server-side.
*   Utilize session-based authentication and authorization to control access to search functionality.
