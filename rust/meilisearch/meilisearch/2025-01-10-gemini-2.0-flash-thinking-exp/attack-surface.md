# Attack Surface Analysis for meilisearch/meilisearch

## Attack Surface: [Exposed Meilisearch API Keys](./attack_surfaces/exposed_meilisearch_api_keys.md)

**Description:** Meilisearch relies on API keys (public and private) for authentication. If these keys are exposed, unauthorized individuals can interact with the Meilisearch instance.

**How Meilisearch Contributes:** Meilisearch's security model relies on these keys to control access to its API endpoints. Their exposure grants direct access to Meilisearch functionality.

**Example:**  API keys are hardcoded in client-side JavaScript, committed to a public Git repository, or stored in easily accessible configuration files without proper encryption.

**Impact:**  Data breaches (reading sensitive indexed data), data manipulation (creating, updating, or deleting indexes and documents), denial of service (overloading the instance with requests).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Store API keys securely using environment variables or a dedicated secrets management system.
*   Avoid hardcoding API keys in application code, especially client-side.
*   Implement proper access controls and permissions within Meilisearch using API key roles if available (future Meilisearch feature).
*   Regularly rotate API keys.
*   Monitor API key usage for suspicious activity.

## Attack Surface: [Direct Access to Meilisearch Instance](./attack_surfaces/direct_access_to_meilisearch_instance.md)

**Description:** The Meilisearch instance is directly accessible over the network without proper access controls, allowing anyone to interact with its API if they know the address and potentially an API key.

**How Meilisearch Contributes:** Meilisearch, by default, listens on a specific port and can be accessed if the network allows it.

**Example:** A Meilisearch instance running on a public cloud server with an open port and no firewall rules restricting access.

**Impact:**  Unauthorized access to data, potential data manipulation or deletion, denial of service by overwhelming the instance.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement network security measures such as firewall rules to restrict access to the Meilisearch instance to only authorized IPs or networks.
*   Ensure Meilisearch is not directly exposed to the public internet if not required. Consider using a private network or VPN.
*   Utilize Meilisearch's upcoming feature for granular API key permissions to further restrict access based on the key.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service via Resource-Intensive Search Queries](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service_via_resource-intensive_search_queries.md)

**Description:** Attackers can craft complex or resource-intensive search queries that overwhelm the Meilisearch instance, leading to performance degradation or denial of service.

**How Meilisearch Contributes:** Meilisearch processes search queries, and poorly optimized or overly complex queries can consume significant resources.

**Example:**  Submitting searches with extremely broad filters, very long query strings, or using computationally expensive features if available.

**Impact:**  Temporary unavailability of search functionality, impacting the application's usability, potential for complete service disruption.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement rate limiting on search requests to the Meilisearch API.
*   Monitor Meilisearch instance resource usage and identify potentially malicious queries.
*   Educate users on appropriate search practices (if applicable).
*   Consider implementing query complexity limits or timeouts on the application side before sending queries to Meilisearch.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Meilisearch Configuration](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_meilisearch_configuration.md)

**Description:**  If Meilisearch configuration files (containing API keys, settings, etc.) are inadvertently exposed, attackers can gain critical information to compromise the instance.

**How Meilisearch Contributes:** Meilisearch's configuration dictates its behavior and security settings.

**Example:** Leaving the `.env` file containing the Meilisearch master key accessible in a publicly accessible directory.

**Impact:**  Complete compromise of the Meilisearch instance, including access to all data and administrative functions.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Securely store Meilisearch configuration files with appropriate permissions.
*   Avoid including sensitive information directly in configuration files if possible; use environment variables or secrets management.
*   Regularly review and audit Meilisearch configurations.
