# Attack Surface Analysis for meilisearch/meilisearch

## Attack Surface: [API Key Compromise](./attack_surfaces/api_key_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized access to Meilisearch functionalities due to leaked or weak API keys.
*   **Meilisearch Contribution:** Meilisearch's authentication and authorization model is fundamentally based on API keys. Compromising these keys grants attackers significant control over the Meilisearch instance.
*   **Example:** A private API key is exposed through a misconfigured server, a compromised developer machine, or a code leak. An attacker uses this key to gain administrative access, delete indexes, modify sensitive settings, or exfiltrate indexed data.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of Meilisearch instance, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, and denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure API Key Management:**  Utilize robust secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, cloud provider secret managers) to store and access API keys. Avoid storing keys in code, configuration files directly, or easily accessible locations.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for API Keys:**  Always use the least privileged API key necessary for each operation. Employ public keys for search-only operations, private keys for indexing, and reserve admin keys solely for administrative tasks.
    *   **Regular API Key Rotation:** Implement a mandatory and automated API key rotation policy to minimize the window of opportunity for compromised keys.
    *   **Strict Access Control to Key Storage:**  Enforce stringent access controls to any system or storage mechanism holding API keys, limiting access to only authorized personnel and systems.
    *   **API Key Usage Monitoring and Auditing:** Implement monitoring and logging of API key usage to detect suspicious activities or unauthorized access attempts.

## Attack Surface: [Search Query Injection](./attack_surfaces/search_query_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in Meilisearch's query parsing logic through crafted search queries to cause unintended behavior or gain unauthorized information.
*   **Meilisearch Contribution:** As a search engine, Meilisearch must parse and process potentially complex and user-provided search queries. Vulnerabilities in this parsing process can be exploited.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious search query with specific syntax or characters that triggers a parsing error leading to information disclosure (e.g., revealing internal paths or configurations in error messages) or causes excessive resource consumption, leading to a denial-of-service condition. While direct code execution is less likely, unexpected behavior and instability are potential outcomes.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, information disclosure through verbose error messages, potential for unexpected behavior and instability of the Meilisearch service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Sanitization and Validation at Application Level:** While Meilisearch handles query parsing, the application using Meilisearch should still sanitize and validate user-provided search inputs to remove or escape potentially harmful characters or patterns *before* sending them to Meilisearch.
    *   **Rate Limiting on Search Queries:** Implement aggressive rate limiting on search API endpoints to mitigate potential DoS attacks through query flooding and limit the impact of resource-intensive queries.
    *   **Regular Meilisearch Updates and Security Patching:** Keep Meilisearch updated to the latest stable version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches that address potential query parsing vulnerabilities.
    *   **Security Audits and Penetration Testing Focused on Query Handling:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing, specifically targeting Meilisearch's query handling mechanisms to identify and address potential injection vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:**  Overwhelming the Meilisearch instance with a flood of requests, consuming excessive resources and rendering it unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **Meilisearch Contribution:** Meilisearch, like any service, is susceptible to resource exhaustion attacks if not properly protected. Its API endpoints, especially search and indexing, can be targeted for DoS.
*   **Example:** An attacker launches a botnet to send a massive volume of search requests or indexing operations to the Meilisearch instance. This overwhelms the server's CPU, memory, and network bandwidth, causing slow response times or complete service outage for legitimate users.
*   **Impact:** Service disruption, unavailability of search functionality, negative impact on applications relying on Meilisearch, and potential financial losses due to downtime.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Robust Rate Limiting and Throttling:** Implement strict rate limiting and throttling mechanisms on all Meilisearch API endpoints, particularly search and indexing, to control the number of requests from individual IP addresses or users.
    *   **Resource Monitoring and Automated Alerting:** Continuously monitor Meilisearch server resource utilization (CPU, memory, network I/O) and configure automated alerts to trigger when resource usage exceeds predefined thresholds, indicating a potential DoS attack.
    *   **Load Balancing and Scalability:** Deploy Meilisearch behind a load balancer and consider scaling out to multiple instances to distribute traffic and enhance resilience against DoS attacks and handle legitimate traffic spikes.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Implement a WAF in front of Meilisearch to filter malicious traffic patterns, block known bad actors, and provide protection against common web attacks, including DoS attempts.
    *   **Query Complexity and Size Limits:**  Consider implementing limits on the complexity and size of search queries and indexing requests to prevent excessively resource-intensive operations that could be used for DoS attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Deployment Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_deployment_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Deploying Meilisearch with insecure default settings or in an exposed and unhardened environment, significantly increasing its vulnerability to various attacks.
*   **Meilisearch Contribution:**  Meilisearch's security posture is directly dependent on its deployment environment and configuration. Insecure defaults or exposed deployments create significant vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** Deploying a Meilisearch instance directly on the public internet without a firewall, using default ports, and without enabling HTTPS. This makes it easily discoverable by attackers, exposes unencrypted communication, and leaves it vulnerable to attacks targeting default configurations.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches due to unencrypted communication, unauthorized access to the Meilisearch instance and its data, denial of service, and potential compromise of the underlying infrastructure.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Network Segmentation and Firewall Configuration:** Deploy Meilisearch within a secure network segment behind a properly configured firewall. Restrict access to only necessary ports and services, and limit access to authorized networks and IP ranges.
    *   **Disable or Change Default Ports:** If feasible and applicable to your environment, change default ports to less common ports to reduce automated scanning and discovery attempts.
    *   **Enforce HTTPS/TLS for All Communication:**  Mandatory enable HTTPS/TLS for all communication with Meilisearch, ensuring encryption of data in transit, including API keys, search queries, and indexed data.
    *   **Regular Security Audits of Deployment Configuration:** Conduct periodic security audits of the Meilisearch deployment configuration to identify and rectify any misconfigurations, insecure settings, or deviations from security best practices.
    *   **Harden the Deployment Environment:**  Harden the operating system and underlying infrastructure where Meilisearch is deployed by applying security patches, disabling unnecessary services, and following security hardening guidelines for the specific environment.
