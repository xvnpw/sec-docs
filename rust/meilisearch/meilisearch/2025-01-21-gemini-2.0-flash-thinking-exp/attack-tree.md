## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Meilisearch API Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_meilisearch_api_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

**Description:** The Meilisearch API is the primary interface for interacting with the search engine. Vulnerabilities in the API itself, or in how it's exposed and secured, represent a critical attack surface. Exploiting these vulnerabilities can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and service disruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify Publicly Accessible Meilisearch API [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/identify_publicly_accessible_meilisearch_api__critical_node_.md)

**Description:**  Before attackers can exploit API vulnerabilities, they need to find the API endpoint. If the Meilisearch API is publicly accessible, it significantly lowers the barrier to entry for attackers and increases the likelihood of attacks.

    *   **1.1.1. Meilisearch API Exposed Directly to Internet (Misconfiguration) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:**  This occurs when the Meilisearch instance is directly exposed to the public internet without proper network segmentation or access controls.
        *   **Why High-Risk:**
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Common misconfiguration, especially in quick deployments or lack of security expertise.
            *   **Impact:** High - Direct access to the API opens up all API-related attack vectors, potentially leading to data breaches and service disruption.
            *   **Effort:** Low - Easy to achieve through misconfiguration.
            *   **Skill Level:** Low - Requires basic misconfiguration.
            *   **Mitigation:**  Ensure Meilisearch is behind a firewall and only accessible from trusted networks (e.g., application servers). Use network segmentation.

*   **Attack Vector:**  This occurs when the Meilisearch instance is directly exposed to the public internet without proper network segmentation or access controls.
*   **Why High-Risk:**
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Common misconfiguration, especially in quick deployments or lack of security expertise.
    *   **Impact:** High - Direct access to the API opens up all API-related attack vectors, potentially leading to data breaches and service disruption.
    *   **Effort:** Low - Easy to achieve through misconfiguration.
    *   **Skill Level:** Low - Requires basic misconfiguration.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication/Authorization Weaknesses [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authenticationauthorization_weaknesses__critical_node_.md)

**Description:** Meilisearch relies on API keys for authentication. Weaknesses in how API keys are managed, generated, or enforced can allow attackers to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access.

    *   **1.2.1. Default API Keys or Weak API Keys [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Description:** Using default API keys or easily guessable/brute-forceable keys is a fundamental authentication flaw.

        *   **1.2.1.2. Guess Default API Keys (if any) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to guess default API keys if they exist and are publicly known or easily predictable.
            *   **Why High-Risk:**
                *   **Likelihood:** Low (if defaults are not widely known), but if defaults exist and are guessable, likelihood increases significantly.
                *   **Impact:** High - Full API access if default keys are valid.
                *   **Effort:** Low - Requires minimal effort to try default keys.
                *   **Skill Level:** Low - Very basic attack.
                *   **Mitigation:**  Never use default API keys. Change them immediately upon installation. Ensure no default keys are shipped with Meilisearch or are easily guessable.

        *   **1.2.1.3. Find Exposed API Keys (e.g., in client-side code, logs, config files) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers search for accidentally exposed API keys in publicly accessible locations like client-side JavaScript code, logs, configuration files, or version control systems.
            *   **Why High-Risk:**
                *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Common developer mistake to accidentally expose secrets.
                *   **Impact:** High - Full API access if keys are found.
                *   **Effort:** Low - Can be automated with scripts and search engines.
                *   **Skill Level:** Low - Requires basic search and reconnaissance skills.
                *   **Mitigation:**  Never embed API keys in client-side code. Store API keys securely (environment variables, secrets management). Avoid logging API keys. Secure configuration files and version control.

    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers craft API requests to bypass intended data access restrictions and retrieve data they are not authorized to access. This often relies on weaknesses in application-level authorization logic *before* queries are sent to Meilisearch.
    *   **Why High-Risk:**
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium - If application authorization is not robustly implemented.
        *   **Impact:** High - Exposure of sensitive data through unauthorized access.
        *   **Effort:** Medium - Requires understanding of the application's authorization logic and API structure.
        *   **Skill Level:** Medium - Requires some API manipulation and authorization bypass skills.
        *   **Mitigation:** Implement strong authorization checks in the application layer *before* sending queries to Meilisearch. Carefully design index structure and searchable attributes to minimize unintended data exposure.
