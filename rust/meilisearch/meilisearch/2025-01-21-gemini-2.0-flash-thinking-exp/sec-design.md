    *   Typically implemented using an embedded key-value database for performance and efficiency.
*   **'Persistent Storage' (Disk/SSD):**  The physical storage medium where 'Data Storage' persists data. This is usually disk or SSD storage attached to the server.

### 4.2. Detailed Component Architecture (Further Elaboration)

#### 4.2.1. 'API Gateway' (HTTP REST) - Security Focus

*   **API Key Authentication:** Implements API key-based authentication. API keys are typically bearer tokens passed in headers. Secure generation, storage, and transmission of API keys are paramount.
*   **Authorization:** Enforces authorization policies based on API key permissions. Different API keys can be granted varying levels of access (e.g., read-only, index creation, admin).
*   **HTTPS Enforcement:**  Mandates HTTPS for all API communication to encrypt data in transit and protect against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   **Rate Limiting & Throttling:**  Implements configurable rate limiting and request throttling to prevent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and abuse.
*   **CORS Policy:**  Enforces a strict CORS policy to control which origins are permitted to access the API, mitigating cross-site scripting (XSS) risks and unauthorized API usage from untrusted domains.
*   **Input Sanitization (Initial Stage):** Performs initial input sanitization and validation at the API gateway level to reject malformed requests early in the processing pipeline.

#### 4.2.2. 'Request Router' - Minimal Security Role

*   Primarily focused on routing efficiency. Security considerations are minimal at this stage, as authentication and authorization are handled by the 'API Gateway'.
*   May perform basic request validation to ensure requests are well-formed before forwarding.

#### 4.2.3. 'Index Manager' - Data Integrity and Access Control

*   **Index-Level Access Control (Potential Future Feature):** Could potentially enforce access control at the index level, allowing for more granular permissions (e.g., API key access to specific indexes only).
*   **Data Validation during Indexing:**  Performs validation of incoming documents during indexing to ensure data integrity and prevent indexing of malicious or corrupted data.
*   **Index Backup and Restore Security:**  Secure backup and restore mechanisms are crucial to prevent unauthorized access to backups and ensure data recovery in case of failures. Backups should be protected with appropriate access controls.

#### 4.2.4. 'Search Engine Core' - Query Security and Performance

*   **Query Parsing and Sanitization:**  Performs robust query parsing and sanitization to prevent query injection attacks. Ensures user-provided search terms are handled safely and do not lead to unintended data access or manipulation.
*   **Resource Limits:**  Implements resource limits on search queries to prevent resource exhaustion and denial-of-service attacks caused by overly complex or resource-intensive queries.
*   **Performance Optimization:**  Optimized for speed and efficiency to minimize response times and reduce the attack surface associated with slow processing.

#### 4.2.5. 'Configuration Manager' - Critical Security Component

*   **API Key Management Security:**  Securely manages API keys, including generation, storage (ideally hashed and salted), revocation, and rotation.
*   **Access Control Configuration:**  Defines and enforces access control policies, determining which API keys have access to which functionalities and data.
*   **Audit Logging:**  Logs security-relevant events, such as API key creation, revocation, authentication failures, and authorization violations, to facilitate security monitoring and incident response.
*   **Secure Configuration Defaults:**  Ensures secure default configurations are in place and guides users towards secure configuration practices.

#### 4.2.6. 'Data Storage' (Index Data) - Data at Rest Security

*   **Data at Rest Encryption (Future Enhancement):**  Consideration for implementing data at rest encryption to protect sensitive indexed data stored in 'Data Storage'. This would require secure key management practices.
*   **Access Control to Storage:**  Operating system-level access controls must be configured to restrict access to the underlying 'Persistent Storage' and the 'Data Storage' files, preventing unauthorized access to the raw data.
*   **Data Integrity Mechanisms:**  Employs mechanisms to ensure data integrity and prevent data corruption or tampering within 'Data Storage'.
