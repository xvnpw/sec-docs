    * **Lack of Rate Limiting:**  Absence or insufficient rate limiting on API endpoints, allowing attackers to overwhelm the service with requests, leading to DoS.
    * **Resource Exhaustion:** Exploiting API endpoints to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O), causing performance degradation or service outage.

* **Data Leakage and Information Disclosure:**
    * **Verbose Error Messages:**  API responses revealing sensitive information in error messages (e.g., internal paths, database details, configuration information).
    * **Unintended Data Exposure:**  API endpoints inadvertently returning more data than intended, potentially exposing sensitive information from indexes.
    * **Insecure API Responses:**  Lack of proper sanitization or encoding of data in API responses, potentially leading to client-side vulnerabilities (e.g., Cross-Site Scripting - XSS if responses are rendered in a web browser).

* **API Misconfiguration:**
    * **Default Credentials:** Using default API keys or settings that are publicly known.
    * **Unnecessary API Endpoints Enabled:** Exposing API endpoints that are not required for the application's functionality, increasing the attack surface.
    * **Insecure Transport (HTTP instead of HTTPS):**  Transmitting API requests and responses over unencrypted HTTP, allowing eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

* **Business Logic Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Abuse of API Functionality:**  Exploiting the intended functionality of the API in unintended ways to achieve malicious goals (e.g., data scraping, manipulating search results for malicious purposes).

#### 4.2 Attack Vectors

Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities through various vectors:

* **Direct API Requests:**  Crafting malicious API requests directly using tools like `curl`, `Postman`, or custom scripts. This is the most common vector for API attacks.
* **Web Application Front-end:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in the web application's front-end that interacts with the Meilisearch API. This could involve manipulating user inputs or intercepting API requests made by the application.
* **Compromised Client-Side Code:** If API keys or sensitive information are embedded in client-side code (JavaScript), attackers can extract this information and use it to directly access the API.
* **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** If API communication is not properly secured (e.g., using HTTP instead of HTTPS), attackers can intercept and modify API requests and responses.
* **Social Engineering:** Tricking authorized users into revealing API keys or performing actions that could compromise API security.
* **Insider Threats:** Malicious or negligent insiders with access to API keys or Meilisearch infrastructure could exploit vulnerabilities.

#### 4.3 Impact Assessment
