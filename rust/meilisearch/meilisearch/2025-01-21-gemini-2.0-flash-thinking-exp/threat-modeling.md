# Threat Model Analysis for meilisearch/meilisearch

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Indexed Data via Search API](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_indexed_data_via_search_api.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker, bypassing application-level authorization, directly queries the Meilisearch search API to retrieve sensitive data that should be restricted. This is achieved by crafting specific search queries and exploiting potential weaknesses in application's access control integration with Meilisearch.
*   **Impact:** Confidential data leakage, privacy violations, regulatory non-compliance, reputational damage.
*   **Affected Component:** Search API, Indexing Module.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust server-side authorization in your application layer to control access to search functionality *before* querying Meilisearch.
    *   Filter search results in the application backend based on user permissions *after* receiving them from Meilisearch, ensuring only authorized data is presented to the user.
    *   Consider data masking or anonymization for sensitive fields *before* indexing them in Meilisearch.
    *   Regularly audit the data indexed in Meilisearch to prevent unintentional exposure of sensitive information.

## Threat: [Data Leakage through API Keys Exposure](./threats/data_leakage_through_api_keys_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to Meilisearch API keys (especially the master key) through insecure storage, accidental exposure (e.g., in logs, version control), or interception. With these keys, the attacker can bypass Meilisearch authentication and gain full administrative control, potentially leading to data exfiltration.
*   **Impact:** Complete data breach, mass data exfiltration, data manipulation (modification, deletion), service disruption, complete compromise of Meilisearch instance.
*   **Affected Component:** API Key Management, Authentication Module.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never hardcode API keys in application code or configuration files.**
    *   Utilize secure secrets management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, cloud provider secret managers) or environment variables with restricted access to store and retrieve API keys.
    *   Implement strict access control for API keys, limiting access to only authorized personnel and systems.
    *   Regularly rotate API keys.
    *   Enforce HTTPS for all communication with the Meilisearch API to prevent interception of keys in transit.
    *   Monitor API key usage for suspicious activity and unauthorized access attempts.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Data Modification via Admin API](./threats/unauthorized_data_modification_via_admin_api.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Meilisearch Admin API, typically by compromising API keys or exploiting misconfigurations that expose the Admin API to untrusted networks. This allows the attacker to modify or delete indexed data, alter Meilisearch settings, and disrupt search functionality.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, inaccurate search results, application malfunction, data loss, service disruption, potential reputational damage.
*   **Affected Component:** Admin API, Authentication Module, Indexing Module, Settings Module.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the criticality of the data and search service).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure the Meilisearch Admin API by restricting network access to trusted sources only (e.g., internal network, specific IP ranges of administrative systems).**
    *   Use strong, randomly generated API keys exclusively for Admin API access, separate from Search API keys if possible.
    *   Implement network firewalls to strictly control access to the Admin API port, blocking public access.
    *   Disable or restrict access to the Admin API from public networks unless absolutely necessary and protected by additional layers of security.
    *   Implement comprehensive audit logging for all administrative actions performed via the Admin API to detect and investigate unauthorized modifications.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion through Malicious Search Queries (DoS)](./threats/resource_exhaustion_through_malicious_search_queries__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts and sends a high volume of complex or computationally expensive search queries to the Meilisearch Search API. These queries are designed to consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory, I/O), leading to performance degradation or a complete denial of service for legitimate search requests.
*   **Impact:** Search service unavailability, application downtime, performance degradation for legitimate users, potential financial losses due to service disruption.
*   **Affected Component:** Search API, Query Processing Module.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust rate limiting on the Search API to restrict the number of requests from a single IP address or user within a defined timeframe.
    *   Configure resource limits for the Meilisearch process (CPU, memory) within the deployment environment to prevent complete system exhaustion.
    *   Monitor Meilisearch resource usage and performance metrics in real-time to detect potential DoS attacks and trigger alerts.
    *   Optimize search queries and indexing strategies to minimize resource consumption for typical search patterns.
    *   Consider implementing query complexity analysis or filtering to reject excessively resource-intensive queries before they are fully processed.
    *   Utilize a CDN or caching layer in front of Meilisearch to absorb some search traffic and mitigate simple volumetric DoS attacks.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Meilisearch Software](./threats/exploitation_of_known_vulnerabilities_in_meilisearch_software.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities present in a specific, outdated version of Meilisearch being used. Successful exploitation can lead to a range of severe outcomes, including remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, potentially including remote code execution, data breaches, data manipulation, service disruption, and complete system compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** Potentially any Meilisearch component depending on the specific vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Proactively monitor Meilisearch security advisories, release notes, and security mailing lists for vulnerability announcements.**
    *   **Establish a process for regularly updating Meilisearch to the latest stable version to promptly patch known vulnerabilities.**
    *   Implement a comprehensive vulnerability management program to track and remediate known vulnerabilities in all software components, including Meilisearch and its dependencies.
    *   Conduct regular security scanning of your Meilisearch deployment using vulnerability scanners to identify known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Misconfiguration of Security-Relevant Settings](./threats/misconfiguration_of_security-relevant_settings.md)

*   **Description:**  Meilisearch offers various configuration settings that can impact security. Misconfiguring these settings, such as disabling security features, weakening authentication, or exposing sensitive information through logs, can create vulnerabilities and increase the attack surface.
*   **Impact:** Data exposure, unauthorized access, weakened security posture, potential for exploitation of other vulnerabilities.
*   **Affected Component:** Settings Module, potentially Authentication Module, Logging Module.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly review and understand the security implications of all Meilisearch configuration settings.
    *   Follow security best practices and Meilisearch's security recommendations when configuring settings.
    *   Regularly audit Meilisearch configurations to ensure they align with security policies and best practices.
    *   Use infrastructure-as-code and configuration management tools to enforce consistent and auditable security configurations across deployments.
    *   Minimize the exposure of sensitive information in Meilisearch logs and ensure logs are securely stored and accessed.
