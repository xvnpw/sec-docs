Here's an updated list of high and critical threats directly involving MeiliSearch:

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized API Key Usage
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to a valid MeiliSearch API key (e.g., through code leaks, network interception, or insider threat). They then use this key to perform unauthorized actions against the MeiliSearch instance. This could involve reading, modifying, or deleting data.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach (confidentiality loss), data manipulation (integrity loss), data deletion (availability loss), potential disruption of application functionality relying on MeiliSearch.
    *   **Affected Component:** API Key Management module, potentially affecting all API endpoints (search, documents, indices, settings).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store API keys securely using environment variables or dedicated secrets management solutions.
        *   Avoid embedding API keys directly in client-side code.
        *   Implement regular API key rotation.
        *   Enforce the principle of least privilege when assigning API key permissions (e.g., use read-only keys where appropriate).
        *   Monitor API usage for suspicious activity and unauthorized access attempts.
        *   Utilize MeiliSearch's built-in API key management features effectively.

*   **Threat:** Data Exfiltration via Search API
    *   **Description:** An attacker with unauthorized access (or by exploiting vulnerabilities within MeiliSearch) crafts specific search queries to extract sensitive data from the MeiliSearch index. This could involve using filters, sorting, or pagination to retrieve large amounts of data.
    *   **Impact:** Loss of confidential information, potential regulatory compliance violations.
    *   **Affected Component:** Search API module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust API access controls.
        *   Carefully consider what data is indexed and whether sensitive information needs to be masked or anonymized before indexing.
        *   Implement granular access control within the application layer to restrict what data users can search and retrieve.
        *   Monitor search query patterns for unusual or excessive data retrieval.

*   **Threat:** Data Tampering via Documents API
    *   **Description:** An attacker with write access to the Documents API (either through a compromised API key or by exploiting a vulnerability in MeiliSearch's document handling) modifies existing documents in the MeiliSearch index. This could involve changing sensitive information, injecting malicious content, or corrupting data.
    *   **Impact:** Data integrity loss, application malfunction due to incorrect data, potential for malicious content injection affecting users.
    *   **Affected Component:** Documents API module (add/update/delete document endpoints).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong API access controls, limiting write access to authorized entities only.
        *   Implement data validation and sanitization on the application side before indexing data.
        *   Maintain backups of MeiliSearch data to enable recovery from tampering.
        *   Monitor document update activity for unauthorized modifications.

*   **Threat:** Data Deletion via Indices or Documents API
    *   **Description:** An attacker with sufficient privileges (compromised API key or by exploiting a vulnerability in MeiliSearch's index or document management) deletes entire indices or individual documents from the MeiliSearch instance.
    *   **Impact:** Data loss, disruption of application functionality relying on the deleted data, potential service outage.
    *   **Affected Component:** Indices API module (delete index endpoint), Documents API module (delete document endpoints).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict API access controls, limiting deletion privileges.
        *   Implement mechanisms for soft deletion or data archiving instead of permanent deletion where possible.
        *   Maintain regular backups of MeiliSearch data.
        *   Monitor deletion activity for unauthorized actions.

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Known MeiliSearch Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** Attackers exploit publicly known security vulnerabilities in specific versions of MeiliSearch. This could lead to various outcomes depending on the nature of the vulnerability, such as remote code execution within the MeiliSearch process, data breaches, or denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Wide range of potential impacts, from complete system compromise to data loss or service disruption.
    *   **Affected Component:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep MeiliSearch updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Subscribe to security advisories and release notes from the MeiliSearch team.
        *   Implement a vulnerability management process to identify and address potential weaknesses.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Default Configuration
    *   **Description:** If MeiliSearch is deployed with default or insecure configurations (e.g., weak or no authentication, exposed to the public internet without proper access controls), it becomes an easy target for attackers to gain unauthorized access and perform malicious actions.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access, data breaches, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Configuration settings, deployment setup.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow MeiliSearch's security best practices for deployment and configuration.
        *   Ensure strong authentication is enabled and properly configured.
        *   Restrict network access to the MeiliSearch instance using firewalls or network segmentation.
        *   Regularly review and audit MeiliSearch configuration settings.
