# Threat Model Analysis for meilisearch/meilisearch

## Threat: [Unauthorized Data Access via API Key Compromise](./threats/unauthorized_data_access_via_api_key_compromise.md)

- **Description:** An attacker gains access to valid Meilisearch API keys and uses them to bypass authentication and directly query the Meilisearch API, retrieving sensitive indexed data.
- **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive user data, application data, or business-critical information. Potential regulatory compliance violations.
- **Affected Meilisearch Component:** API Key Authentication Module, Search API, Documents API
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Implement secure API key generation, storage, and rotation practices.
    - Utilize environment variables or dedicated secret management systems for storing API keys.
    - Enforce the principle of least privilege when assigning API key permissions.
    - Regularly audit API key usage and revoke compromised keys immediately.
    - Consider IP address whitelisting for API access if applicable.

## Threat: [Index Poisoning via Unauthorized Data Modification](./threats/index_poisoning_via_unauthorized_data_modification.md)

- **Description:** An attacker, having gained unauthorized write access, injects malicious or misleading data into the Meilisearch index. This can manipulate search results, leading to misinformation, phishing attempts, or reputational damage.
- **Impact:** Integrity violation, manipulation of search results, potential for misinformation campaigns, damage to application trust and reputation.
- **Affected Meilisearch Component:** Documents API, Indexing Engine
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Enforce strict API key permissions, limiting write access to authorized services only.
    - Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all data being indexed.
    - Monitor indexed data for anomalies and suspicious content.
    - Consider data signing or checksumming to detect unauthorized modifications.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Meilisearch Software Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_meilisearch_software_vulnerabilities.md)

- **Description:** An attacker exploits known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the Meilisearch software itself. This could allow them to gain unauthorized access to the server, execute arbitrary code, cause denial of service, or steal sensitive data.
- **Impact:** Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability compromise. Full system compromise is possible depending on the vulnerability.
- **Affected Meilisearch Component:** Core Meilisearch Engine, various modules depending on the vulnerability.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical (if remote code execution) to High (for other vulnerabilities)
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Regularly update Meilisearch to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
    - Subscribe to Meilisearch security advisories and mailing lists to stay informed about potential vulnerabilities.
    - Implement vulnerability scanning and penetration testing to identify potential weaknesses.
    - Follow Meilisearch's security best practices and recommendations for deployment and configuration.

## Threat: [Exposure of Meilisearch Admin/Configuration Interface](./threats/exposure_of_meilisearch_adminconfiguration_interface.md)

- **Description:** An attacker gains access to the Meilisearch administrative or configuration interface, either due to misconfiguration, default credentials, or lack of proper access control. This allows them to modify settings, access logs, or potentially gain deeper access to the system.
- **Impact:** Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability compromise. Full control over Meilisearch instance and potentially underlying system.
- **Affected Meilisearch Component:** Admin API, Configuration Module
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Restrict access to the Meilisearch admin interface to authorized personnel only.
    - Change default credentials immediately upon installation.
    - Disable or secure any unnecessary administrative interfaces if possible.
    - Implement strong authentication and authorization for admin access.
    - Regularly audit access to the admin interface.
