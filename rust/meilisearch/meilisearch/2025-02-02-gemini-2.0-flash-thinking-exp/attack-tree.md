## Attack Tree Path: [1. Publicly Exposed Meilisearch Instance (No API Key Required) [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1__publicly_exposed_meilisearch_instance__no_api_key_required___critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Unauthenticated API Access
*   **Description:** Meilisearch instance is directly accessible over the network (e.g., internet) without requiring any API key for authentication.
*   **Likelihood:** High
*   **Impact:** Critical (Full control over Meilisearch data, potential application compromise)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always require API keys for all Meilisearch API operations, especially in production.**
    *   **Ensure Meilisearch is not directly exposed to the public internet without proper access control.** Use firewalls or network segmentation.
    *   **Regularly audit network configurations and Meilisearch access settings.**

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Weak or Default API Key (Easily Guessable/Brute-forceable) [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2__weak_or_default_api_key__easily_guessablebrute-forceable___critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Unauthenticated API Access via Weak Credentials
*   **Description:** Meilisearch is protected by an API key, but the key is weak, easily guessable (e.g., "password", "admin"), or a default key that is publicly known. Attackers can brute-force or guess the key.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High (Significant data manipulation, potential application impact)
*   **Effort:** Low-Medium (Brute-forcing requires some tools, guessing is easy)
*   **Skill Level:** Low-Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Generate strong, unique API keys.** Avoid default or easily guessable keys.
    *   **Implement account lockout or rate limiting for failed API authentication attempts.**
    *   **Monitor for unusual API activity and failed authentication attempts.**

## Attack Tree Path: [3. API Key Leakage (Code, Logs, Configuration Files, Network Interception) [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/3__api_key_leakage__code__logs__configuration_files__network_interception___critical_node__high_risk_fff085ba.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** API Key Compromise via Leakage
*   **Description:** API keys are inadvertently exposed in insecure locations such as:
    *   Hardcoded in application source code.
    *   Stored in application logs.
    *   Present in configuration files committed to version control.
    *   Transmitted insecurely over the network (e.g., unencrypted HTTP).
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High (Significant data manipulation, potential application impact)
*   **Effort:** Low-Medium (Finding keys in code/logs is easy, network interception harder)
*   **Skill Level:** Low-Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Securely store and manage API keys.** Use environment variables or dedicated secrets management systems.
    *   **Never hardcode API keys in application code.**

*   **Likelihood:** Very Low
*   **Impact:** Critical (Full system compromise, complete application takeover)
*   **Effort:** High (Requires finding and exploiting a complex vulnerability)
*   **Skill Level:** Very High
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard

*   **Attack Vector:** Misconfiguration by Application Developers - API Key Exposure
*   **Description:** Developers mistakenly expose a highly privileged Meilisearch API key (e.g., the "admin" key) in untrusted environments, such as:
    *   Embedded directly in frontend JavaScript code.
    *   Committed to public version control repositories (e.g., GitHub).
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High (Significant data manipulation, potential application impact)
*   **Effort:** Low (Finding keys in code/repositories is easy)
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

    *   **Implement code review processes to catch accidental API key exposure.**
    *   **Use repository scanning tools to detect secrets in code.**

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Injecting Data to Trigger Application-Side Vulnerabilities (e.g., if application blindly trusts search results and processes them unsafely) [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/6__injecting_data_to_trigger_application-side_vulnerabilities__e_g___if_application_blindly_trusts_s_c3a98d19.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Malicious Data Indexing - Data Injection
*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious data into Meilisearch during the indexing process. This malicious data is designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the application that consumes and processes search results from Meilisearch. For example, if the application blindly renders search results without sanitization, injected data could contain XSS payloads.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High (Application compromise, XSS, other application-specific vulnerabilities)
*   **Effort:** Medium (Requires understanding application logic and crafting specific payloads)
*   **Skill Level:** Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium-Hard
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the application side *before* indexing data in Meilisearch.**
    *   **Implement output encoding and sanitization in the application when displaying or processing search results from Meilisearch.**
    *   **Follow secure coding practices when handling data retrieved from Meilisearch.**

## Attack Tree Path: [7. Injecting Data to Bypass Application Logic (e.g., if search results are used for authorization decisions) [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/7__injecting_data_to_bypass_application_logic__e_g___if_search_results_are_used_for_authorization_de_ce5427d6.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Malicious Data Indexing - Data Injection for Logic Bypass
*   **Description:** Attackers inject data into Meilisearch to manipulate search results in a way that bypasses application logic, particularly authorization or access control mechanisms that rely on search results. For example, if authorization checks are based on whether a user's ID appears in search results, data poisoning could be used to manipulate these results.
*   **Likelihood:** Low-Medium
*   **Impact:** High (Unauthorized access, application logic bypass)
*   **Effort:** Medium (Requires understanding application logic and crafting specific data)
*   **Skill Level:** Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid relying solely on search results for critical application logic, especially authorization.**
    *   **Implement robust and independent authorization mechanisms that do not depend on search results.**
    *   **Validate and sanitize data before indexing to prevent data poisoning.**
    *   **Monitor data integrity and search result accuracy for anomalies.**

## Attack Tree Path: [8. Unauthorized Data Deletion/Modification (If API key is compromised) [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/8__unauthorized_data_deletionmodification__if_api_key_is_compromised___high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Data Manipulation via API - API Key Compromise
*   **Description:** If an attacker compromises a Meilisearch API key (through leakage, weak keys, etc.), they can use the API to perform unauthorized data deletion or modification operations within Meilisearch indexes.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High (Data integrity loss, application disruption)
*   **Effort:** Low (Simple API calls)
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

*   **Attack Vector:** Supply Chain Vulnerabilities - Compromised Binary
*   **Description:** The application uses a compromised version of the Meilisearch binary or its dependencies. This compromised version could contain malware, backdoors, or known vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit. This is more likely if using unofficial or outdated sources.
*   **Likelihood:** Very Low
*   **Impact:** Critical (Full system compromise, malware infection)
*   **Effort:** Low (Simply using a compromised version)
*   **Skill Level:** Low/High (Unknowingly using a compromised version / High for creating a backdoored version)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard
