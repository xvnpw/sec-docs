# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for meilisearch/meilisearch

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce API Key Authentication](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_api_key_authentication.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Meilisearch to require API keys:** In your Meilisearch server configuration (e.g., command-line arguments, configuration file, environment variables), ensure that the `--master-key` or `MEILI_MASTER_KEY` environment variable is set to a strong, randomly generated secret key. This activates API key authentication.
    2.  **Generate API keys:** Use the Meilisearch API (using the master key initially) to generate `public` and `private` API keys.  `Public` keys should be used for search operations in client-side applications. `Private` keys should be reserved for administrative tasks and server-side operations.
    3.  **Implement API key usage in application:** Modify your application code to include the appropriate API key in the `Authorization` header for all requests to the Meilisearch API. Use `public` keys for search queries from the frontend and `private` keys for backend indexing and administration.
    4.  **Securely store API keys:** Store `private` keys in a secure secrets management system (like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) or environment variables on your backend servers.  `Public` keys can be embedded in frontend code, but consider limiting their scope as much as possible.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to Data (High Severity):  Without API keys, anyone can access and query your indexed data.
    *   Data Modification/Deletion (High Severity): Without API keys and proper key separation, unauthorized users could potentially modify or delete your indexed data.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity): Open access can make your Meilisearch instance more vulnerable to DoS attacks by allowing unauthenticated and potentially malicious requests.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to Data: High reduction - API keys effectively prevent unauthorized data access.
    *   Data Modification/Deletion: High reduction - Private keys, when properly managed, restrict administrative actions to authorized users.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): Medium reduction - Authentication makes it harder for anonymous attackers to flood the system, but rate limiting is still recommended for robust DoS protection.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   API key authentication is enabled on the Meilisearch server. Master key is set via environment variable `MEILI_MASTER_KEY` in the Docker Compose configuration for the development environment. Public API key is used in the frontend application for search queries, configured in `frontend/src/config.js`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   API key rotation is not yet implemented. Private API keys are currently stored as environment variables on the backend server but not managed by a dedicated secrets management system in production.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Document Filtering and Searchable Attributes](./mitigation_strategies/implement_document_filtering_and_searchable_attributes.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define searchable attributes:** In your Meilisearch index settings, explicitly define the `searchableAttributes`. Only include fields that are intended to be searchable by users. Exclude sensitive or irrelevant fields from this list.
    2.  **Implement document filtering (if applicable):** If your application requires user-specific data access control within search results, utilize Meilisearch's filtering capabilities.  This might involve adding user group or permission information to documents and using filters in search queries to restrict results based on the current user's context.  This often requires backend logic to dynamically generate filters based on user authentication and authorization.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Data Exposure through Search (Medium Severity):  Indexing and making all fields searchable can unintentionally expose sensitive data through search results.
    *   Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):  Overly broad search capabilities can reveal more information than intended to unauthorized users.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data Exposure through Search: Medium reduction - Carefully selecting searchable attributes significantly reduces the risk of unintentional data exposure.
    *   Information Disclosure: Medium reduction - Filtering and controlled searchable attributes limit the scope of information accessible through search.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Searchable attributes are defined in the Meilisearch index settings during index creation in the backend service (`backend/src/meilisearch_config.js`). Only relevant fields are marked as searchable.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Document filtering based on user roles or permissions is not yet implemented. All users currently see the same search results.  This is planned for future implementation to support user-specific data access.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Backups](./mitigation_strategies/regular_backups.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose backup strategy:** Decide on a backup frequency (e.g., daily, hourly) and retention policy (how long backups are kept). Consider full backups and incremental backups for efficiency.
    2.  **Implement backup process:**  Use Meilisearch's built-in snapshot feature or file system-level backups to create backups of your Meilisearch data directory. Automate this process using cron jobs or scheduling tools.
    3.  **Secure backup storage:** Store backups in a secure and separate location from your Meilisearch server. Use encrypted storage and access controls to protect backups from unauthorized access. Offsite backups are recommended for disaster recovery.
    4.  **Test backup and restore process:** Regularly test your backup and restore process to ensure backups are valid and can be restored successfully in a timely manner.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Data Loss (High Severity): Backups are crucial for recovering from data loss due to hardware failures, software errors, accidental deletions, or security incidents.
    *   System Failure (High Severity): Backups enable quick recovery from system failures by restoring the Meilisearch instance to a previous state.
    *   Ransomware Attacks (High Severity): Backups are essential for recovering data encrypted by ransomware without paying the ransom.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data Loss: High reduction - Backups provide a reliable mechanism for data recovery in case of data loss events.
    *   System Failure: High reduction - Enables rapid system recovery and minimizes downtime.
    *   Ransomware Attacks: High reduction - Allows data restoration without succumbing to ransomware demands.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Daily backups of the Meilisearch data directory are performed using a cron job on the server. Backups are stored locally on the server in a separate directory.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Offsite backups are not yet implemented. Backups are not encrypted. The backup and restore process has not been formally tested. Backup retention policy needs to be defined and implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep Meilisearch Updated](./mitigation_strategies/keep_meilisearch_updated.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor Meilisearch releases:** Subscribe to Meilisearch's release notes, security advisories, and community channels to stay informed about new releases and security updates.
    2.  **Establish update process:** Define a process for regularly updating your Meilisearch instance. This should include testing updates in a staging environment before applying them to production.
    3.  **Apply updates promptly:** When security updates are released, prioritize applying them to your Meilisearch instance as quickly as possible to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (High Severity): Outdated software is vulnerable to known security exploits that are patched in newer versions.
    *   Security Breaches (High Severity): Unpatched vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to your system and data.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities: High reduction - Regularly updating patches known vulnerabilities, significantly reducing the attack surface.
    *   Security Breaches: High reduction - Minimizes the risk of security breaches caused by exploiting known software flaws.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Meilisearch version is tracked in the `docker-compose.yml` file.  The development team is generally aware of new releases through community channels.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A formal process for monitoring Meilisearch releases and security advisories is not yet in place.  Automated update process or notifications for new releases are missing.  Staging environment testing of Meilisearch updates is not consistently performed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Review and Audit Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/review_and_audit_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Regularly review Meilisearch configuration:** Periodically review your Meilisearch configuration files, command-line arguments, and environment variables.
    2.  **Audit security settings:** Specifically audit security-related settings such as API key enforcement, searchable attributes, document filtering (if implemented), and any other access control mechanisms.
    3.  **Document configuration:** Maintain clear documentation of your Meilisearch configuration, including security settings and rationale behind choices.
    4.  **Automate configuration checks (optional):** Consider automating configuration checks using scripts or configuration management tools to detect deviations from desired security settings.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Misconfiguration (Medium Severity): Incorrect or insecure configuration can introduce vulnerabilities and weaken security measures.
    *   Security Drift (Medium Severity): Over time, configurations can drift from secure baselines, potentially weakening security posture.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Misconfiguration: Medium reduction - Regular reviews and audits help identify and correct misconfigurations.
    *   Security Drift: Medium reduction - Periodic audits ensure configurations remain aligned with security best practices and prevent security drift.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Meilisearch configuration is managed through `docker-compose.yml` and environment variables. Configuration is reviewed during deployment setup.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Regular, scheduled configuration reviews and security audits are not formally implemented. Documentation of Meilisearch configuration and security settings is not comprehensive. Automated configuration checks are not in place.
