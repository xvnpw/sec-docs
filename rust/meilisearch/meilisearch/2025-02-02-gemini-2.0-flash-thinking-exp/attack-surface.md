# Attack Surface Analysis for meilisearch/meilisearch

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated API Access](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_api_access.md)

**Description:** Gaining access to Meilisearch's API without proper authentication, bypassing intended access controls.
*   **Meilisearch Contribution:** Meilisearch relies on API keys for authentication. Failure to enforce API key usage directly exposes the API.
*   **Example:** Meilisearch is deployed with API key requirement disabled in the configuration, or network configurations allow direct public access to the Meilisearch port without API key enforcement. An attacker can directly interact with the Meilisearch API using tools like `curl` without any credentials.
*   **Impact:** Full administrative control over the Meilisearch instance, enabling data exfiltration, index manipulation (creation, deletion, modification), and denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory API Key Enforcement:** Ensure Meilisearch configuration strictly requires API keys for all API endpoints. Double-check configuration settings to confirm API key enforcement is active.
    *   **Network Access Control:** Restrict network access to the Meilisearch instance. Use firewalls or network segmentation to limit access only to authorized services or networks that require API interaction.

## Attack Surface: [Weak or Default API Keys](./attack_surfaces/weak_or_default_api_keys.md)

**Description:** Utilizing easily guessable or default API keys for Meilisearch authentication, making them vulnerable to compromise.
*   **Meilisearch Contribution:** Meilisearch's security posture is directly tied to the strength of the API keys. Weak keys undermine the authentication mechanism.
*   **Example:** Developers use default API keys like "masterKey" or "public", or choose simple, predictable keys. Attackers can brute-force or easily guess these weak keys, gaining unauthorized API access.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the Meilisearch API, leading to potential data breaches, unauthorized data modification, and service disruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong API Key Generation:** Generate cryptographically strong, random API keys for both master and public keys. Utilize secure random key generators.
    *   **Avoid Default Keys:** Never use default or example API keys provided in documentation or tutorials in production environments.
    *   **Regular API Key Rotation:** Implement a policy for periodic rotation of API keys to limit the lifespan of potentially compromised keys.

## Attack Surface: [Data Injection via Indexing API](./attack_surfaces/data_injection_via_indexing_api.md)

**Description:** Injecting malicious payloads into Meilisearch indexes through the indexing API due to insufficient input validation by the application.
*   **Meilisearch Contribution:** Meilisearch indexes data provided via its API. If the application feeding data to Meilisearch lacks proper sanitization, it becomes a vector for injection attacks that are then processed and stored by Meilisearch.
*   **Example:** An application indexes user-provided text content into Meilisearch without sanitizing HTML or JavaScript. An attacker injects a malicious JavaScript payload within a text field. When search results containing this injected payload are retrieved from Meilisearch and displayed on the frontend without proper output encoding, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities are introduced.
*   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks against users interacting with search results, potentially leading to account compromise, malware distribution, or data theft.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Sanitization and Validation (Application-Side):**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate all data *before* sending it to Meilisearch for indexing. Escape HTML, JavaScript, and other potentially harmful characters based on the context of how the data will be used in search results.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP) (Frontend-Side):** Implement a strong Content Security Policy in the frontend application to mitigate the impact of XSS vulnerabilities by controlling the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources.
    *   **Output Encoding (Frontend-Side):**  Properly encode search results when displaying them in the frontend application to prevent browsers from interpreting injected malicious code as executable code.

## Attack Surface: [Search Query Manipulation for Resource Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/search_query_manipulation_for_resource_exhaustion.md)

**Description:** Crafting excessively complex or resource-intensive search queries to overload the Meilisearch instance, leading to denial of service.
*   **Meilisearch Contribution:** Meilisearch processes and executes search queries.  Maliciously crafted queries can exploit Meilisearch's search engine capabilities to consume excessive resources.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a high volume of search queries with extremely broad wildcards (e.g., `*`) or deeply nested filters, forcing Meilisearch to perform computationally expensive searches, exhausting CPU and memory resources and causing a denial of service for legitimate users.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) or significant performance degradation of the search functionality, impacting application availability and user experience.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Query Complexity Limits (Application or Meilisearch Proxy):** Implement limits on the complexity of search queries, such as maximum query length, number of filters, or depth of nested queries. This can be enforced at the application level before sending queries to Meilisearch, or by using a proxy in front of Meilisearch to filter requests.
    *   **Rate Limiting (Application or Meilisearch Proxy):** Limit the number of search requests originating from a single IP address or user within a specific timeframe to prevent abuse.
    *   **Resource Monitoring and Alerting (Meilisearch Server):** Continuously monitor Meilisearch server resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O) and set up alerts to detect unusual spikes that might indicate a DoS attack.

## Attack Surface: [Unpatched Meilisearch Instances](./attack_surfaces/unpatched_meilisearch_instances.md)

**Description:** Running outdated versions of Meilisearch software that contain known security vulnerabilities, leaving the system exposed to exploits.
*   **Meilisearch Contribution:** Like all software, Meilisearch may have security vulnerabilities discovered over time.  Failing to apply updates and patches released by the Meilisearch team leaves instances vulnerable to known exploits targeting these vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** A development team deploys or maintains an older version of Meilisearch that has a publicly disclosed remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker exploits this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access and control over the server running Meilisearch.
*   **Impact:** Full system compromise, including data breaches, data manipulation, denial of service, and potential lateral movement within the network.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Meilisearch Updates:** Establish a process for regularly updating Meilisearch instances to the latest stable versions. Prioritize applying security patches and updates promptly after release.
    *   **Security Advisory Subscriptions:** Subscribe to Meilisearch's official security advisory channels (mailing lists, release notes, security pages) to receive timely notifications about security updates and vulnerabilities.
    *   **Automated Patch Management:** Implement automated patch management systems or processes to streamline the application of security updates to Meilisearch instances.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan Meilisearch instances using vulnerability scanning tools to proactively identify known vulnerabilities in the deployed version.
