### rg3d Engine High and Critical Threats

This list details high and critical security threats that directly involve the rg3d game engine.

*   **Threat:** Malicious Asset Loading - Arbitrary Code Execution
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious game asset (e.g., a model, texture, or scene file) that exploits a vulnerability in rg3d's asset loading or parsing logic. Upon loading this asset, the engine executes arbitrary code provided by the attacker. This could involve embedding shellcode within the asset data or exploiting buffer overflows in the parsing routines.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying system. The attacker could gain full control, steal data, install malware, or perform other malicious actions.
    *   **Affected Component:** `resource::manager::ResourceManager` module, specific asset loaders (e.g., `gltf::loader::load`, `texture::loader::load`), and potentially underlying parsing libraries used by rg3d.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all loaded asset data.
        *   Utilize memory-safe parsing libraries and techniques.
        *   Employ sandboxing or isolation techniques when loading untrusted assets.
        *   Regularly update rg3d to benefit from security patches.
        *   Implement content security policies or integrity checks for assets.

*   **Threat:** Malicious Asset Loading - Denial of Service
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted game asset that, when loaded by rg3d, causes excessive resource consumption (CPU, memory, GPU) or triggers a crash within the engine. This could involve extremely large or complex assets, assets with infinite loops in their data structures, or assets that exploit algorithmic complexity vulnerabilities in the loading process.
    *   **Impact:** The application becomes unresponsive or crashes, leading to a denial of service for legitimate users. This can disrupt gameplay, cause data loss, or damage the application's reputation.
    *   **Affected Component:** `resource::manager::ResourceManager` module, specific asset loaders, rendering pipeline (`renderer` module), and potentially physics engine (`physics` module) if the asset affects physics calculations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement resource limits and timeouts for asset loading.
        *   Perform thorough testing with a wide range of asset types and sizes, including potentially malicious ones.
        *   Implement checks for excessively large or complex assets before loading.
        *   Consider asynchronous asset loading to prevent blocking the main thread.

*   **Threat:** Asset Path Traversal
    *   **Description:** If the application allows users (directly or indirectly) to specify paths for loading assets, an attacker could manipulate these paths to access files outside the intended asset directories. This is achieved by using relative path components like "..".
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure by accessing sensitive application files, configuration files, or even system files, depending on the application's file system permissions.
    *   **Affected Component:** `resource::manager::ResourceManager` module, functions that handle asset path resolution (e.g., within `load` functions).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Never directly use user-provided input as file paths without validation.
        *   Implement strict whitelisting of allowed asset directories.
        *   Use canonicalization techniques to resolve relative paths and prevent traversal.
        *   Ensure the application runs with the least necessary file system permissions.

*   **Threat:** Networking Vulnerabilities in Multiplayer (If Applicable)
    *   **Description:** If the application uses rg3d's networking capabilities (or integrates with a networking library), vulnerabilities in *rg3d's* implementation could be exploited. This includes issues like buffer overflows in packet handling within rg3d's networking code, lack of proper input validation on network messages processed by rg3d, or weak authentication mechanisms provided by rg3d.
    *   **Impact:** Can lead to denial of service for game servers or clients, man-in-the-middle attacks, data manipulation, unauthorized access to game state, or even remote code execution on connected clients or servers *through rg3d's networking components*.
    *   **Affected Component:** Modules related to networking *within rg3d* (if it provides them directly).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the severity of the vulnerability and the importance of networking).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement secure network protocols (e.g., TLS) if supported by rg3d's networking.
        *   Perform thorough input validation and sanitization on all received network data *processed by rg3d*.
        *   Use memory-safe networking libraries *if integrating external libraries with rg3d*.
        *   Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms *within rg3d's networking layer*.
        *   Regularly audit and pen-test *rg3d's networking implementation*.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Libraries Used by rg3d
    *   **Description:** rg3d depends on various third-party libraries. If these libraries contain security vulnerabilities, the application using rg3d could inherit those vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the third-party library. It could range from denial of service and information disclosure to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Affected Component:** The specific third-party library with the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability (can be High or Critical).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep rg3d and its dependencies up-to-date.
        *   Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `cargo audit` (for Rust dependencies).
        *   Consider using alternative libraries if vulnerabilities are found and not patched.
