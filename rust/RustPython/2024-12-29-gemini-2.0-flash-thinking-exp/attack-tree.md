## Threat Model: RustPython Application - High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes

**Objective:** Execute arbitrary code within the application's context via RustPython.

**Sub-Tree of High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

* Compromise Application via RustPython **[CRITICAL NODE]**
    * **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Exploit Malicious Python Code Injection **[CRITICAL NODE]**
        * Crafted Input Exploiting Parser/Compiler Bugs
        * Exploiting Built-in Functions/Modules **[CRITICAL NODE]**
        * Exploiting Import Mechanisms **[CRITICAL NODE]**
    * Exploit Rust Implementation Vulnerabilities **[CRITICAL NODE]**
    * **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Exploit Interaction with External Libraries/Modules (Rust) **[CRITICAL NODE]**
        * **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Vulnerabilities in Rust Crate Dependencies **[CRITICAL NODE]**

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

* **Compromise Application via RustPython [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * This is the root goal of the attacker, representing the successful compromise of the application by exploiting vulnerabilities within the RustPython interpreter.

* **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Malicious Python Code Injection [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * This path involves injecting malicious Python code that is then executed by the RustPython interpreter, leading to compromise.

    * **Crafted Input Exploiting Parser/Compiler Bugs:**
        * Provide specially crafted Python code that triggers vulnerabilities in RustPython's parsing or compilation stages. This can lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or even arbitrary code execution.

    * **Exploiting Built-in Functions/Modules [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * Utilize built-in Python functions or modules that interact with the operating system or file system in unintended ways due to RustPython's implementation. This can allow attackers to perform actions like reading/writing files or executing system commands.

    * **Exploiting Import Mechanisms [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * Manipulate the Python import system to load malicious code from unexpected locations due to vulnerabilities in RustPython's module loading logic. This allows attackers to introduce and execute their own code within the application's context.

* **Exploit Rust Implementation Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * This category focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities within the Rust code that makes up the RustPython interpreter itself. While individual instances might have lower likelihood, the potential impact is high, making this a critical area.

* **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Interaction with External Libraries/Modules (Rust) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * This path involves exploiting vulnerabilities that arise from RustPython's interaction with external Rust libraries (crates).

    * **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Vulnerabilities in Rust Crate Dependencies [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * Exploit vulnerabilities present in the Rust crates that RustPython depends on. If a dependency has a known vulnerability, it can be leveraged to compromise the application using RustPython.
