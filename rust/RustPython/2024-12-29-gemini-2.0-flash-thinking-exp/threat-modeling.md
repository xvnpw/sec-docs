*   **Threat:** Arbitrary Python Code Execution via `eval()`
    *   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious Python code into input that is subsequently passed to the `eval()` function within the RustPython environment. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary Python commands.
    *   **Impact:** Full control over the RustPython interpreter, potentially leading to data breaches, modification of application state, denial of service, or further exploitation of the host application's resources.
    *   **Affected RustPython Component:** `builtins` module, specifically the `eval()` function.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using `eval()` with untrusted input.
        *   If dynamic execution is necessary, explore safer alternatives like a restricted execution environment or a domain-specific language parser.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization to prevent the injection of malicious code.

*   **Threat:** Arbitrary Python Code Execution via `exec()`
    *   **Description:** Similar to `eval()`, an attacker could inject malicious Python code into input that is passed to the `exec()` function. This allows the execution of arbitrary Python statements.
    *   **Impact:** Same as arbitrary code execution via `eval()`.
    *   **Affected RustPython Component:** `builtins` module, specifically the `exec()` function.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using `exec()` with untrusted input.
        *   If dynamic execution is necessary, explore safer alternatives.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization.

*   **Threat:** Arbitrary Python Code Execution via `compile()` and `exec()`
    *   **Description:** An attacker could provide malicious Python code that is first compiled using the `compile()` function and then executed using `exec()`. This allows for more complex code injection scenarios.
    *   **Impact:** Same as arbitrary code execution via `eval()` or `exec()`.
    *   **Affected RustPython Component:** `builtins` module, specifically the `compile()` and `exec()` functions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using `compile()` with untrusted input that will later be executed.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization before compilation.

*   **Threat:** Deserialization of Untrusted Data (e.g., `pickle` vulnerability)
    *   **Description:** If the application deserializes Python objects from untrusted sources using modules like `pickle`, an attacker can craft malicious serialized data. When deserialized, this data can execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Impact:** Full control over the RustPython interpreter, potentially leading to system compromise.
    *   **Affected RustPython Component:** Standard library modules like `pickle`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources.
        *   If deserialization is necessary, use safer serialization formats like JSON or MessagePack, which do not inherently allow code execution.
        *   If `pickle` must be used, implement strong authentication and integrity checks on the serialized data.

*   **Threat:** Resource Exhaustion through Infinite Loops or Deep Recursion
    *   **Description:** Malicious or poorly written Python code executed within RustPython could contain infinite loops or deeply recursive function calls, consuming excessive CPU time and potentially leading to a denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service for the RustPython interpreter and potentially the entire host application, making it unresponsive.
    *   **Affected RustPython Component:** The core interpreter execution engine.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement timeouts for Python code execution.
        *   Monitor CPU usage and implement mechanisms to terminate long-running or runaway Python processes.
        *   Implement checks for recursion depth limits.

*   **Threat:** Memory Exhaustion through Large Object Allocation
    *   **Description:** Malicious Python code could allocate excessively large data structures (e.g., very large lists or dictionaries), leading to memory exhaustion within the RustPython interpreter and potentially impacting the host application's memory.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, potential crashes of the host application due to out-of-memory errors.
    *   **Affected RustPython Component:** The memory management within the interpreter.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement memory limits for the RustPython interpreter.
        *   Monitor memory usage and implement mechanisms to prevent excessive allocation.
        *   Consider using memory-efficient data structures and algorithms in Python code.

*   **Threat:** Access to Unintended Functionality or System Resources
    *   **Description:** Depending on how RustPython is integrated and the available Python modules, malicious code might be able to access functionality or system resources that should be restricted (e.g., file system access, network access).
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, modification of system files, network attacks originating from the application.
    *   **Affected RustPython Component:** Standard library modules like `os`, `subprocess`, `socket`, etc.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully control the modules and functions accessible within the RustPython environment. Consider using a restricted or "jailed" environment.
        *   Implement sandboxing or isolation mechanisms to limit the interpreter's access to sensitive resources.
        *   Review the imported modules and their potential impact.
