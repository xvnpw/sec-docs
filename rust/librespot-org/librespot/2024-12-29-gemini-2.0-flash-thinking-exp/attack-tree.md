Here's the thought process to extract the High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:

1. **Identify Marked Elements:** The first step is to scan the full attack tree and identify all nodes and paths explicitly marked as `[HIGH RISK PATH]` or `[CRITICAL NODE]`.

2. **Trace High-Risk Paths:** For each `[HIGH RISK PATH START]`, follow the tree downwards until the corresponding `[HIGH RISK PATH END]` is reached. Include all nodes within this path.

3. **Include Critical Nodes:**  Independently of the high-risk paths, include all nodes marked as `[CRITICAL NODE]`. Ensure that if a critical node is already part of a high-risk path, it's not duplicated in the output.

4. **Construct the Sub-Tree:** Create a new attack tree structure containing only the identified high-risk paths and critical nodes. Maintain the hierarchical relationships from the original tree.

5. **Extract Detailed Breakdowns:** For each node in the sub-tree, retrieve the detailed breakdown (Likelihood, Impact, Effort, Skill Level, Detection Difficulty) from the original attack tree.

6. **Format the Output:** Present the extracted information according to the specified format: Title, Goal, Sub-tree (using markdown lists), and detailed breakdowns (using markdown lists). Crucially, avoid markdown tables.

7. **Review for Completeness and Accuracy:** Double-check that all marked high-risk paths and critical nodes are included in the sub-tree. Verify that the detailed breakdowns are correctly associated with each node. Ensure the formatting adheres to the requirements (no tables, use lists).

**Example of Self-Correction During the Process:**

Initially, I might only extract the top-level nodes marked as high-risk. However, the requirement is to extract the *paths*, meaning all the intermediate nodes within a high-risk path must also be included in the sub-tree. I need to trace the entire path from start to end. Similarly, I need to ensure that critical nodes are included even if they don't belong to a currently identified high-risk *path* but are significant on their own. Also, I need to be careful not to duplicate information if a critical node is part of a high-risk path.

Another self-correction might involve the formatting. I might initially think of using tables for the detailed breakdowns, but the prompt explicitly forbids them. I need to ensure I'm using markdown lists for all parts of the output.
