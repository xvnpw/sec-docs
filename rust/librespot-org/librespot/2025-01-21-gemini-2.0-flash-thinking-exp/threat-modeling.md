# Threat Model Analysis for librespot-org/librespot

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack against Spotify API](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_against_spotify_api.md)

*   **Description:** If `librespot` fails to properly enforce HTTPS or perform adequate certificate validation when communicating with Spotify's servers, an attacker positioned on the network can intercept communication. This allows the attacker to eavesdrop on data exchanged between `librespot` and Spotify, potentially stealing session tokens or manipulating communication.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking leading to unauthorized access to Spotify accounts through `librespot`. Potential for data manipulation, although less likely for audio streaming content itself.
*   **Affected Component:** `librespot`'s network communication module, specifically TLS/SSL implementation and certificate validation within `librespot`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Ensure `librespot` is compiled and configured to strictly use HTTPS for all communication with Spotify servers.** Verify this by checking `librespot`'s build configuration and runtime settings.
    *   **Verify that `librespot` and its underlying libraries correctly perform server certificate validation.** This ensures that `librespot` is connecting to legitimate Spotify servers and not being tricked by forged certificates.
    *   Use up-to-date versions of `librespot` and its networking dependencies, as these often include improvements to TLS/SSL security and certificate handling.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/dependency_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** `librespot` relies on external libraries for core functionalities. If these dependencies contain known security vulnerabilities (e.g., in networking, audio decoding, or cryptography libraries), attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities through `librespot`. Attack vectors could include crafted network packets processed by `librespot`, malicious audio streams, or other inputs that trigger the vulnerable dependency code through `librespot`'s usage.
*   **Impact:**  Depending on the specific vulnerability in the dependency, impacts can range from denial of service and information disclosure to remote code execution on the system running `librespot`. Remote code execution would allow an attacker to completely compromise the system.
*   **Affected Component:** `librespot`'s dependency management, specifically vulnerable external libraries used by `librespot`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (Critical if remote code execution is possible through a dependency vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regularly update `librespot` to the latest version.** Newer versions often include updates to dependencies that address known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Monitor security advisories for `librespot` and its dependencies.** Stay informed about reported vulnerabilities and apply updates or patches promptly.
    *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in the dependencies used by your specific build of `librespot`.
    *   When building `librespot`, ensure you are using up-to-date and patched versions of all required dependencies.

## Threat: [Memory Safety Vulnerabilities in `librespot` (Buffer Overflow, Use-After-Free, etc.)](./threats/memory_safety_vulnerabilities_in__librespot___buffer_overflow__use-after-free__etc__.md)

*   **Description:**  `librespot`'s codebase itself might contain memory safety vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, use-after-free errors, or other memory corruption issues. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities by sending specially crafted inputs to `librespot`. These inputs could be triggered through network interactions, manipulated audio streams, or crafted metadata, leading to memory corruption.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service (crashing `librespot`), memory corruption, information disclosure (leaking memory contents), and potentially remote code execution. Remote code execution would allow an attacker to gain full control over the system running `librespot`.
*   **Affected Component:** Core `librespot` code, potentially across various modules including network protocol handling, audio decoding, metadata parsing, and core logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (Critical if remote code execution is possible due to memory safety issues)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always use the latest stable version of `librespot`.**  The `librespot` development team likely addresses memory safety issues as they are discovered and reported.
    *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for reports specifically related to memory safety issues in `librespot`.
    *   If possible, contribute to or support security audits and code reviews of `librespot` to help proactively identify and fix memory safety vulnerabilities.
    *   Compile `librespot` with memory safety sanitizers (like AddressSanitizer or MemorySanitizer during development and testing) to detect memory errors early.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Network Attacks on `librespot`](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__through_network_attacks_on__librespot_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a flood of malicious or malformed network traffic specifically designed to overwhelm `librespot`'s network handling capabilities or exploit vulnerabilities in its network protocol processing. This can cause `librespot` to become unresponsive, consume excessive resources, or crash, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Impact:**  Service disruption. Applications relying on `librespot` will be unable to function correctly, and users will be unable to stream music or use `librespot`-related features.
*   **Affected Component:** `librespot`'s network communication module, resource management within `librespot`, and potentially network protocol parsing logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (if easily exploitable and significantly impacts service availability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement network-level rate limiting and traffic filtering** to mitigate volumetric DoS attacks targeting `librespot`.
    *   Ensure the system running `librespot` is adequately resourced to handle expected network traffic and potential spikes.
    *   Monitor `librespot`'s resource usage (CPU, memory, network) and responsiveness to detect potential DoS attacks in progress.
    *   Use the latest stable version of `librespot`, which may include fixes for DoS vulnerabilities or improvements in network handling robustness.
    *   Consider using a reverse proxy or firewall in front of the system running `librespot` to provide an additional layer of DoS protection.
