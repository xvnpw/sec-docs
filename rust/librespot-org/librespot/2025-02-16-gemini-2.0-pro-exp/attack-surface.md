## Attack Surface: [Audio Decoding Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/audio_decoding_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploitation of vulnerabilities in the audio decoding libraries used *internally* by Librespot (e.g., `vorbis-java`, `libvorbis`, or other codecs) through a crafted malicious audio stream. This is a direct attack on Librespot's decoding process.
*   **Librespot Contribution:** Librespot is *directly* responsible for fetching, decrypting, and decoding the audio stream from Spotify. It relies on external libraries for the decoding process, and vulnerabilities in these libraries directly impact Librespot.
*   **Example:** An attacker compromises Spotify's servers (or performs a man-in-the-middle attack) and injects a specially crafted Ogg Vorbis stream that triggers a buffer overflow vulnerability in `libvorbis` *within Librespot's process*, leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Impact:**  Potential for arbitrary code execution within the context of the application using Librespot, leading to potential system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers (of Librespot):**
        *   Keep all audio decoding dependencies (e.g., `libvorbis`, `vorbis-java`) up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Perform regular security audits and fuzzing of the audio decoding components.
        *   Consider using memory-safe languages or techniques (e.g., Rust's memory safety guarantees) for critical parts of the decoding process.
        *   Implement robust error handling and input validation within the decoding pipeline to prevent unexpected behavior.
    *   **Developers (of applications *using* Librespot):**
        *   Keep Librespot updated to the latest version to incorporate any security fixes in the library and its dependencies.
        *   Use Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to monitor for vulnerabilities in Librespot and its dependencies.
        *   Consider sandboxing or containerizing the entire application (including Librespot) to limit the impact of a successful exploit. This is a defense-in-depth measure.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Keep the application that uses Librespot updated. There is little a user can do *directly* to mitigate this beyond ensuring they are running the latest version of the application.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (Direct)](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities__direct_.md)

* **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the external libraries that librespot depends on *and directly uses*.
    * **Librespot Contribution:** Librespot directly incorporates and uses these external libraries. A vulnerability in a dependency is a direct vulnerability in Librespot's operation.
    * **Example:** A critical vulnerability is discovered in a cryptographic library used by Librespot for secure communication with Spotify. An attacker could exploit this to intercept or modify data *during Librespot's communication*.
    * **Impact:** Varies greatly depending on the specific dependency and vulnerability. Could range from information disclosure to arbitrary code execution *within the context of Librespot*.
    * **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the specific vulnerability)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers (of Librespot):**
            *   Regularly update all dependencies to the latest versions.
            *   Use Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to identify and track known vulnerabilities.
            *   Use a dependency management system that supports vulnerability scanning and alerts.
            *   Consider vendoring critical dependencies (including them directly in the Librespot repository) after careful security review, to have more control over their versions and patching.
            *   Actively monitor security advisories related to all dependencies.
        *   **Developers (of applications *using* Librespot):**
            *   Keep Librespot updated to the latest version.
            *   Use SCA tools to monitor for vulnerabilities in Librespot and its dependencies.
        * **Users:** Keep the application using Librespot updated.
