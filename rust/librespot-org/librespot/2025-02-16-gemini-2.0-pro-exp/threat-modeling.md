# Threat Model Analysis for librespot-org/librespot

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass (Token Manipulation)](./threats/authentication_bypass__token_manipulation_.md)

*   **Threat:** Authentication Bypass via Token Manipulation
*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts or crafts Spotify authentication tokens to gain unauthorized access to a user's account. They exploit flaws in `librespot`'s token handling logic to generate valid-seeming tokens or bypass authentication checks.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized access to user's Spotify account.
    *   Ability to control playback, modify playlists, and access user data.
    *   Potential for financial loss (if premium features are abused).
    *   Reputational damage to the application.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   `librespot-core::session`: Functions related to handling authentication tokens (e.g., `Session::new`, `Session::connect`, and any internal functions that process or store tokens).
    *   `librespot-protocol`: The implementation of the Spotify authentication protocol, including message parsing and validation.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   Ensure `librespot` is updated to the latest version.
        *   Implement robust input validation *around* `librespot` calls to prevent injection of malicious tokens.
        *   Monitor `librespot`'s issue tracker for security advisories related to authentication.
        *   Consider adding two-factor authentication (2FA) to your application's own authentication system, independent of Spotify's.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (Resource Exhaustion)](./threats/denial_of_service__resource_exhaustion_.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion
*   **Description:** An attacker sends a large number of requests or specially crafted data to `librespot`, causing it to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) and become unresponsive. This exploits vulnerabilities in `librespot`'s handling of network traffic or protocol messages.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Application becomes unresponsive or crashes.
    *   Other users of the application are unable to access Spotify features.
    *   Potential for increased infrastructure costs.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   `librespot-core::session`: Functions related to handling network connections and processing incoming data.
    *   `librespot-protocol`: Parsing and handling of various Spotify protocol messages (e.g., search requests, playlist loading).
    *   `librespot-playback`: Audio decoding and buffering components (if malformed audio data can trigger excessive resource use).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   Implement rate limiting on requests *to* `librespot`.
        *   Set reasonable limits on the size of playlists, search results, and other data handled *by* `librespot`.
        *   Use timeouts to prevent `librespot` from getting stuck.
        *   Monitor resource usage of `librespot` and implement alerts.
        *   Consider running `librespot` in a separate process or container.

## Threat: [Data Leakage (Credentials in Logs)](./threats/data_leakage__credentials_in_logs_.md)

*   **Threat:** Data Leakage via Logging
*   **Description:** `librespot` inadvertently logs sensitive information, such as Spotify credentials, session tokens, or user data, due to flaws in its logging implementation or overly verbose default settings.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exposure of Spotify credentials and user data.
    *   Potential for account takeover and identity theft.
    *   Violation of user privacy.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   `librespot-core::session`: Any logging statements within the session management code.
    *   `librespot-protocol`: Logging of protocol messages.
    *   Any component that uses the logging facilities.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   Carefully configure `librespot`'s logging level (e.g., `WARN` or `ERROR` in production).
        *   Review and sanitize logs *before* storing or transmitting them.
        *   Use a secure logging system.
        *   Avoid logging raw protocol messages or authentication tokens.

## Threat: [Remote Code Execution (Buffer Overflow)](./threats/remote_code_execution__buffer_overflow_.md)

*   **Threat:** Remote Code Execution via Buffer Overflow (or other memory corruption)
*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a buffer overflow or other memory corruption vulnerability in `librespot`'s handling of Spotify protocol messages or audio data to inject and execute arbitrary code. This leverages a flaw *within* `librespot`'s code (or potentially unsafe interactions with dependencies).
*   **Impact:**
    *   Complete compromise of the application.
    *   Ability to execute arbitrary code.
    *   Potential for data theft, system damage, and lateral movement.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   `librespot-protocol`: Parsing of protocol messages, especially those with variable-length fields.
    *   `librespot-playback`: Handling of audio data (decoding and buffering).
    *   Any component that uses `unsafe` code blocks.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   Regularly update `librespot` and its dependencies.
        *   Use memory-safe coding practices (minimize `unsafe` code).
        *   Use static analysis tools and fuzz testing.
        *   Run `librespot` with least privileges.
        *   Employ security hardening techniques (ASLR, DEP).

## Threat: [Protocol Downgrade Attack](./threats/protocol_downgrade_attack.md)

*   **Threat:** Protocol Downgrade Attack
*   **Description:**  An attacker intercepts communication and forces `librespot` to use an older, less secure version of the Spotify protocol. This exploits a weakness in `librespot`'s protocol negotiation or a lack of verification of the negotiated protocol version.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Increased susceptibility to other attacks.
    *   Potential for man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   `librespot-core::session`: Initial connection establishment and protocol negotiation.
    *   `librespot-protocol`: Implementation of different protocol versions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   Ensure `librespot` uses the latest supported protocol version.
            *   Implement checks to verify the negotiated protocol version is secure.
            *   Monitor for downgrade attempts.
            *   Use secure communication channels (HTTPS).
