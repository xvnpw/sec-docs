# Threat Model Analysis for librespot-org/librespot

## Threat: [Spotify Account Spoofing](./threats/spotify_account_spoofing.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in `librespot`'s authentication handling or network communication to impersonate a legitimate Spotify account. This could involve crafting malicious network packets or exploiting weaknesses in session token validation within `librespot`.
**Impact:** Unauthorized access to Spotify features through the application, misuse of the user's Spotify account, potentially leading to actions performed under the user's identity within the Spotify ecosystem.
**Librespot Component Affected:** Authentication module, Session management, Network communication.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Keep Librespot Updated:** Regularly update `librespot` to the latest version to benefit from security patches and improvements in authentication handling.
* **Secure Build and Configuration:** Ensure `librespot` is built and configured securely, following best practices recommended by the `librespot` project.
* **Network Security:** Use HTTPS for all communication initiated by the application and ensure the network environment where `librespot` runs is secure.
* **Input Validation (if applicable):** If your application passes user-provided data to `librespot` related to authentication, ensure proper input validation to prevent injection attacks.

## Threat: [Exposure of Spotify Credentials](./threats/exposure_of_spotify_credentials.md)

**Description:**  Vulnerabilities in how `librespot` handles or stores Spotify credentials (within its memory or temporary files) could be exploited by an attacker. While `librespot` aims to handle credentials securely, unforeseen bugs or misconfigurations in its credential management could lead to exposure if an attacker gains access to the process memory or filesystem where `librespot` is running.
**Impact:** Full compromise of the user's Spotify account, allowing the attacker to access personal data, control playback, potentially make purchases or change account settings, and use the account for malicious purposes.
**Librespot Component Affected:** Authentication module, Credential handling (internal to `librespot`).
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run `librespot` with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact if it is compromised.
* **Secure Environment:** Deploy `librespot` in a secure environment with restricted access to the filesystem and process memory.
* **Memory Protection:** Utilize operating system level memory protection features to isolate `librespot`'s memory space.
* **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct security audits of your application's integration with `librespot` and, if feasible, review `librespot`'s code for potential credential handling vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Exploiting Librespot Vulnerabilities for Denial of Service (DoS)](./threats/exploiting_librespot_vulnerabilities_for_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

**Description:**  Attackers exploit vulnerabilities within `librespot`'s code, such as buffer overflows, memory leaks, or processing errors, to cause denial of service. This could be achieved by sending crafted network packets, malformed audio data, or exploiting weaknesses in input parsing within `librespot`.
**Impact:** Application downtime, system instability, resource exhaustion, and potential impact on other services running on the same infrastructure.
**Librespot Component Affected:** Various modules depending on the specific vulnerability (e.g., Network communication, Audio decoding, Input parsing, Resource management).
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Regularly Update Librespot:** Keep `librespot` updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities that could be exploited for DoS attacks.
* **Resource Limits:** Implement resource limits (CPU, memory, network) for the process running `librespot` to mitigate the impact of resource exhaustion vulnerabilities.
* **Input Validation and Sanitization:** While you may not directly control all inputs to `librespot`, ensure your application validates and sanitizes any data it passes to `librespot` that could influence its behavior.
* **Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement monitoring and alerting for application and system health to detect and respond to DoS attacks quickly.

## Threat: [Exploiting Librespot to Escape Sandbox (if applicable)](./threats/exploiting_librespot_to_escape_sandbox__if_applicable_.md)

**Description:** If your application runs `librespot` within a sandboxed environment for security, vulnerabilities in `librespot` could be exploited to escape this sandbox. This could involve bugs in `librespot`'s interaction with the operating system or underlying libraries that allow gaining elevated privileges or accessing resources outside the intended sandbox.
**Impact:** Full system compromise, unauthorized access to sensitive data on the host system, ability to perform arbitrary actions on the host system, bypassing the security controls intended by the sandbox.
**Librespot Component Affected:** System interaction, Operating system calls, potentially various modules depending on the specific vulnerability that allows sandbox escape.
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Strong Sandboxing:** Utilize robust and well-configured sandboxing technologies to minimize the attack surface and restrict `librespot`'s capabilities.
* **Principle of Least Privilege within Sandbox:** Run `librespot` with the minimum necessary privileges within the sandbox environment.
* **Regularly Update Librespot and Sandbox Environment:** Keep both `librespot` and the sandboxing environment updated to patch vulnerabilities that could be exploited for sandbox escape.
* **Security Audits of Sandbox Configuration and Librespot Integration:** Regularly audit the sandbox configuration and your application's integration with `librespot` to identify and address potential sandbox escape vulnerabilities.
