# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
 - Provide an open-source library for interacting with the Spotify Connect protocol.
 - Enable developers to build custom Spotify clients and integrations.
 - Offer an alternative to the official Spotify client, potentially with different features or platform support.
 - Foster a community around reverse engineering and understanding the Spotify Connect protocol.
- Business Risks:
 - Legal risks associated with reverse engineering and interacting with Spotify's proprietary protocol and API.
 - Risk of Spotify changing their protocol or API, rendering librespot incompatible or broken.
 - Security vulnerabilities in librespot could expose users' Spotify accounts or devices to attacks.
 - Lack of official support and maintenance could lead to stagnation or security issues over time.
 - Potential misuse of the library for unauthorized access or distribution of copyrighted content.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
 - security control: Open source project with public code repository on GitHub (https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot).
 - security control: Utilizes Rust programming language, known for memory safety features.
 - security control: Relies on Spotify's authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Accepted Risks:
 - accepted risk: Reverse engineering of Spotify's proprietary protocol carries inherent risks of instability and potential legal challenges.
 - accepted risk: Dependence on Spotify's API and infrastructure means changes on Spotify's side can impact librespot's functionality and security.
 - accepted risk: As a community-driven open-source project, the speed and responsiveness to security vulnerabilities may vary.
- Recommended Security Controls:
 - recommended security control: Implement automated vulnerability scanning and dependency checking in the build process.
 - recommended security control: Establish a clear process for reporting and addressing security vulnerabilities.
 - recommended security control: Provide guidelines and best practices for developers using librespot to build secure applications.
 - recommended security control: Conduct regular security audits and code reviews, especially for critical components like networking and protocol handling.
- Security Requirements:
 - Authentication:
  - Requirement: Securely authenticate with Spotify's service using user credentials or device keys.
  - Requirement: Handle Spotify's authentication protocols (e.g., username/password, OAuth, device authentication).
  - Existing control: Relies on Spotify's authentication mechanisms, implementation details within librespot code.
 - Authorization:
  - Requirement: Enforce Spotify's authorization policies to ensure users only access allowed content and features.
  - Requirement: Properly handle Spotify's access tokens and permissions.
  - Existing control: Relies on Spotify's authorization mechanisms, implementation details within librespot code.
 - Input Validation:
  - Requirement: Validate all input received from the network (Spotify protocol messages) to prevent injection attacks and protocol manipulation.
  - Requirement: Sanitize any user input if the library exposes any user-facing interfaces (though primarily a library).
  - Existing control: Input validation practices within the codebase need to be reviewed and strengthened.
 - Cryptography:
  - Requirement: Securely implement cryptographic algorithms for communication with Spotify's servers (e.g., TLS, encryption of sensitive data).
  - Requirement: Properly manage and protect cryptographic keys if any are handled locally.
  - Existing control: Likely uses standard Rust crypto libraries, needs verification of correct implementation and usage.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes to Protect:
 - For librespot as a library: Providing core Spotify Connect functionality reliably and securely. Maintaining compatibility with Spotify's protocol.
 - For applications using librespot: Audio streaming, Spotify account access, user experience.
- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
 - Spotify Credentials (username/password, device keys): Highly sensitive. Compromise could lead to unauthorized access to Spotify accounts.
 - Spotify Access Tokens: Sensitive. Used for authorization to Spotify services.
 - Audio Streams: Moderately sensitive. Copyrighted content, but less sensitive than credentials.
 - User Data (depending on application using librespot): Sensitivity varies depending on what data the application collects and stores. Librespot itself should not handle user data beyond Spotify interaction.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
 - What are the primary use cases and target applications for librespot? (e.g., embedded systems, desktop clients, server-side integrations).
 - Are there specific security compliance requirements or industry standards that need to be considered?
 - What is the expected lifespan and maintenance plan for the librespot project?
 - What are the community's expectations regarding security and vulnerability management?
 - Are there any specific deployment environments or constraints that need to be considered for security?
- Assumptions:
 - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to provide a functional and open-source Spotify Connect library for developers and enthusiasts. Legal and Spotify API compatibility risks are acknowledged but accepted.
 - SECURITY POSTURE: Security is important, but the project is community-driven and may have resource limitations for extensive security measures. Focus is on core security principles and addressing critical vulnerabilities. Secure Software Development Lifecycle practices are encouraged but may not be fully formalized.
 - DESIGN: The design is centered around a library architecture that applications can integrate. Deployment scenarios are varied, depending on the application using librespot. Build process utilizes standard Rust tooling and can be enhanced with security checks.
