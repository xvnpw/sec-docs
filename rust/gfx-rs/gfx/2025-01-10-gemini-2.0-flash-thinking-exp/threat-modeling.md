# Threat Model Analysis for gfx-rs/gfx

## Threat: [Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Shader](./threats/arbitrary_code_execution_via_malicious_shader.md)

**Threat:** Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Shader
    * **Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted shader (vertex, fragment, or compute) that, when compiled and executed by the GPU via `gfx`, leverages vulnerabilities within `gfx`'s shader handling or the interaction with the underlying graphics API to execute arbitrary code. This could be achieved by exploiting weaknesses in how `gfx` processes shader bytecode or manages shader state.
    * **Impact:** Full system compromise, including data theft, installation of malware, and denial of service.
    * **Affected gfx Component:** `shade` module (shader compilation and management), `PipelineState` (which uses shaders), the interface between `gfx` and the underlying graphics API.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Shader Sanitization:** Thoroughly sanitize and validate any user-provided shader code before compilation using `gfx`'s capabilities if available, or external tools.
        * **Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation for all shader parameters and uniforms passed through `gfx`'s API.
        * **Shader Compilation Whitelisting:** If feasible, allow only pre-approved, known-safe shaders to be used within the application's `gfx` context.
        * **Sandboxing:** Isolate shader execution within a restricted environment if the application architecture allows for it and `gfx`'s usage supports it.
        * **Regular Updates:** Keep `gfx` updated to benefit from bug fixes and security patches in its shader handling logic.

## Threat: [GPU Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion](./threats/gpu_denial_of_service_via_resource_exhaustion.md)

**Threat:** GPU Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion
    * **Description:** An attacker crafts input or exploits application logic to cause the application to allocate excessive GPU resources (e.g., textures, buffers, render targets) *through the `gfx` API*, leading to GPU memory exhaustion and a denial of service. This could involve repeatedly calling `gfx`'s resource creation functions with large sizes or in rapid succession without proper cleanup.
    * **Impact:** Application freeze or crash, system instability, temporary or permanent inability to use the graphics card.
    * **Affected gfx Component:** `Device` (resource creation and management functions provided by `gfx`), `Factory` (resource factory functions in `gfx`), specific resource types like `Texture`, `Buffer`, `RenderPass` managed by `gfx`.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Resource Limits:** Implement limits on the number and size of GPU resources that can be allocated *via the `gfx` API*.
        * **Resource Tracking:** Monitor GPU resource usage initiated through `gfx` and identify potential leaks or excessive allocation.
        * **Rate Limiting:** Limit the rate at which resource allocation requests are processed through `gfx`.
        * **Proper Resource Management:** Ensure resources created and managed by `gfx` are properly deallocated when no longer needed using RAII principles or explicit destruction through `gfx`'s API.

## Threat: [Memory Corruption via Buffer Overflows in Resource Handling](./threats/memory_corruption_via_buffer_overflows_in_resource_handling.md)

**Threat:** Memory Corruption via Buffer Overflows in Resource Handling
    * **Description:** An attacker provides malformed or oversized data when creating or updating GPU resources (e.g., textures, buffers) *using `gfx`'s API*. This can lead to buffer overflows within `gfx`'s internal handling of resource data or in the underlying graphics API calls made by `gfx`, potentially overwriting adjacent memory regions.
    * **Impact:** Application crash, potential for arbitrary code execution if the memory corruption within `gfx` or the driver interface is exploitable.
    * **Affected gfx Component:** `Buffer`, `Texture`, `Image`, and related modules in `gfx` involved in data uploading and updating (e.g., functions like `update_buffer`, `update_texture`).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Strict Size Validation:** Thoroughly validate the size and dimensions of data provided for resource creation and updates against the allocated resource size *before passing it to `gfx`*.
        * **Bounds Checking:** Ensure that all data access within the application code interacting with `gfx`'s resource update functions is within the allocated bounds.
        * **Use Safe APIs:** Prefer `gfx` APIs that provide bounds checking or safer alternatives where available for resource manipulation.
