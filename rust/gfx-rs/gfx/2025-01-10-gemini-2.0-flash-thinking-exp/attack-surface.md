# Attack Surface Analysis for gfx-rs/gfx

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Shader Code Injection/Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/malicious_shader_code_injectionexploitation.md)

**Description:**  An attacker injects malicious code into shader programs (vertex, fragment, compute shaders) that are then compiled and executed by the GPU.

**How gfx Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `gfx` provides the API for loading, compiling, and executing shader code. If the application allows user-provided or influenced shader code, `gfx` becomes the conduit for this malicious code to reach the GPU.

**Example:** A game allows users to create custom materials by providing shader snippets. An attacker injects a shader that performs excessive memory reads, potentially leaking data from the GPU's memory or causing a denial of service by creating an infinite loop.

**Impact:** Denial of service (GPU hang, application crash), information disclosure (reading GPU memory), potential exploitation of underlying graphics driver vulnerabilities.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Strictly validate and sanitize any user-provided shader code.** Implement a whitelist of allowed shader operations and keywords.
* **Use pre-compiled shaders whenever possible.** Avoid dynamic shader compilation based on user input.
* **Implement shader sandboxing techniques** if dynamic shaders are necessary, limiting the capabilities of user-provided code.
* **Regularly update the `gfx` library and graphics drivers** to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Underlying Graphics Drivers](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_underlying_graphics_drivers.md)

**Description:**  `gfx` relies on underlying graphics drivers (Vulkan, Metal, DirectX, OpenGL). Vulnerabilities in these drivers can be triggered through specific `gfx` usage patterns or crafted data.

**How gfx Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `gfx` acts as an abstraction layer over these drivers. While it aims to provide a safe interface, specific sequences of `gfx` calls or particular data structures passed through `gfx` might inadvertently trigger bugs or vulnerabilities in the underlying driver.

**Example:** A specific combination of `gfx` draw calls with particular texture formats triggers a buffer overflow in a specific version of a Vulkan driver, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the graphics driver (potentially system-level), system crashes, information disclosure.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Keep graphics drivers updated.** Encourage users to install the latest stable drivers from their GPU vendor.
* **Use the `gfx` API according to best practices and documentation.** Avoid patterns that are known to cause issues with certain drivers.
* **Test the application on a wide range of graphics drivers and hardware.**
* **Report any suspected driver bugs triggered by `gfx` to the relevant driver vendor.**

## Attack Surface: [Input Data Manipulation Leading to Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/input_data_manipulation_leading_to_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** If the application loads and processes external graphical assets (models, textures, etc.), malicious actors can provide crafted files that exploit parsing vulnerabilities within `gfx` or its direct dependencies involved in asset loading.

**How gfx Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `gfx` or libraries directly used in conjunction with `gfx` for loading image formats, model formats need to parse this external data. Vulnerabilities in these parsing routines, when used by `gfx`'s asset loading pipeline, can be exploited.

**Example:** A malformed texture file (e.g., a PNG with an invalid header) is loaded, triggering a buffer overflow in the image decoding library used by `gfx` or the application's direct asset loading mechanisms interacting with `gfx`, potentially leading to a crash or code execution.

**Impact:** Application crash, potential arbitrary code execution.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Thoroughly validate and sanitize all external graphical assets before loading them.**
* **Use well-vetted and regularly updated libraries for loading image and model formats.**
* **Implement robust error handling during asset loading** to gracefully handle malformed data.
* **Consider using safer, memory-managed languages for asset loading if possible.**
