*   Security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors.
*   Lack of adoption due to complexity or competition from other libraries.
*   Difficulty in maintaining compatibility across different platforms and APIs.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Code reviews: All changes to the codebase are subject to review by other developers. (Mentioned in CONTRIBUTING.md)
*   security control: Continuous Integration (CI): Automated builds and tests are run on every commit to ensure code quality and prevent regressions. (Visible in GitHub Actions workflows)
*   security control: Static Analysis: The project uses static analysis tools to identify potential bugs and security vulnerabilities. (Mentioned in CONTRIBUTING.md and visible in CI workflows)
*   security control: Fuzz Testing: The project uses fuzz testing to find potential vulnerabilities by providing invalid, unexpected, or random data as inputs to the library. (Mentioned in CONTRIBUTING.md and visible in CI workflows)
*   security control: Memory Safety: The project is written in Rust, a language that provides memory safety guarantees, preventing common vulnerabilities like buffer overflows and use-after-free errors. (Implicit in the choice of Rust)
*   security control: Dependency Management: The project uses Cargo, Rust's package manager, to manage dependencies and ensure that only trusted and up-to-date libraries are used. (Implicit in the use of Cargo)

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Reliance on underlying graphics APIs: The project relies on the security of the underlying graphics APIs (Vulkan, Metal, DX12, etc.) and drivers. Vulnerabilities in these components could impact the security of the project.
*   accepted risk: Complexity of graphics programming: Graphics programming is inherently complex, and subtle errors can lead to security vulnerabilities.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST): Implement DAST to test the running application for vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Regular Security Audits: Conduct regular security audits by independent experts to identify potential vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Security Training: Provide security training to developers to raise awareness of common vulnerabilities and best practices.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication: Not directly applicable, as this is a library, not a service. Authentication would be handled by the application using the library.
*   Authorization: Not directly applicable. Authorization would be handled by the application using the library.
*   Input Validation:
    *   The library should validate all inputs from the user application to prevent unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities. This includes validating buffer sizes, texture formats, shader parameters, and other inputs.
    *   The library should handle invalid inputs gracefully, returning error codes or panicking in a controlled manner.
*   Cryptography:
    *   If the library handles any sensitive data (e.g., encryption keys), it should use appropriate cryptographic algorithms and protocols to protect that data.
    *   The library should not implement its own cryptographic primitives but rely on established and well-vetted libraries.
*   Error Handling:
    *   The library should have robust error handling to prevent information leaks and ensure that errors are handled gracefully.
    *   Error messages should be informative but not reveal sensitive information.

## DEPLOYMENT

Possible Deployment Solutions:

1.  Static Linking: The GFX library can be statically linked into the user application. This is the simplest deployment model, as it results in a single executable file.
2.  Dynamic Linking: The GFX library can be dynamically linked into the user application. This allows for smaller executable sizes and easier updates to the library, but it requires the library to be distributed alongside the application.
3.  System-Wide Installation: The GFX library can be installed system-wide, making it available to all applications. This is common on Linux systems, where libraries are typically installed in standard locations.

Chosen Solution (Dynamic Linking):

    Developer["Developer"] -- "Commits Code" --> Git_Repository["Git Repository (GitHub)"]
    Git_Repository -- "Triggers" --> CI_System["CI System (GitHub Actions)"]
    CI_System -- "Runs" --> Build_Script["Build Script (Cargo Build, Tests, etc.)"]

    Static_Analyzers -- "Reports" --> CI_System
    Fuzz_Tests -- "Reports" --> CI_System

```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developers write code and commit it to the Git repository hosted on GitHub.
2.  GitHub Actions, the CI/CD system, is triggered by new commits.
3.  The CI system runs build scripts defined in the repository (using Cargo, Rust's build system). These scripts compile the code, run tests, and generate documentation.
4.  Static analysis tools (like Clippy) are run as part of the CI process to identify potential code quality and security issues.
5.  Fuzz tests are executed to discover potential vulnerabilities by providing random or malformed inputs.
6.  The build process produces build artifacts, such as compiled libraries and documentation.
7.  The results of static analysis and fuzz tests are reported back to the CI system, and any failures prevent the build from succeeding.

Security Controls:

*   security control: CI/CD Pipeline: GitHub Actions automates the build and testing process, ensuring consistency and reducing the risk of manual errors.
*   security control: Static Analysis: Clippy and other static analysis tools are used to identify potential code quality and security issues early in the development process.
*   security control: Fuzz Testing: Fuzz tests are run to discover potential vulnerabilities that might be missed by traditional testing methods.
*   security control: Dependency Management: Cargo ensures that only trusted and up-to-date dependencies are used.
*   security control: Code Review: All code changes are reviewed by other developers before being merged.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Providing a reliable and performant graphics abstraction layer.
*   Maintaining compatibility with various hardware and software platforms.
*   Enabling developers to create high-quality graphics applications.

Data to Protect and Sensitivity:

*   Source Code: The source code of the GFX library itself is not highly sensitive, as it is open source. However, protecting the integrity of the codebase is crucial to prevent the introduction of malicious code.
*   Build Artifacts: The compiled libraries are moderately sensitive. Tampering with these artifacts could lead to the distribution of malicious code to users.
*   User Data: The GFX library itself does not directly handle user data. However, applications built using GFX may handle sensitive user data. The security of that data is the responsibility of the application developer, but GFX should provide a secure foundation.
*   Graphics Data: The library processes graphics data (textures, models, shaders, etc.). The sensitivity of this data depends on the application. GFX should ensure that this data is handled securely within the library's memory management.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA) that the applications using GFX need to adhere to? This would influence the security requirements for GFX.
*   What is the expected threat model for applications using GFX? Are they primarily client-side applications, web applications, or server-side applications?
*   What level of security expertise is expected from the developers using GFX? This will influence the design of the API and the documentation.
*   What are the specific performance requirements for different target platforms?
*   What is the long-term support plan for different graphics APIs (e.g., OpenGL)?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to provide a high-quality, open-source graphics library. Profitability is not a direct concern, but adoption and community growth are important.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: The project follows standard secure development practices, including code reviews, static analysis, and fuzz testing. The developers are security-conscious but may not be security experts.
*   DESIGN: The library is designed to be used in a variety of applications, from games to scientific visualization. The primary deployment model is dynamic linking, but static linking is also supported. The build process is automated using GitHub Actions.
