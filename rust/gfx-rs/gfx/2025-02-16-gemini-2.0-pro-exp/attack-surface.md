# Attack Surface Analysis for gfx-rs/gfx

## Attack Surface: [Application-Level Resource Management Errors](./attack_surfaces/application-level_resource_management_errors.md)

*Description:* Incorrect handling of `gfx-rs` resources (buffers, textures, command buffers, etc.) *within the application code* can lead to memory leaks, use-after-free errors, double-frees, and other memory corruption vulnerabilities.  This is a direct consequence of how the application uses `gfx-rs`.
*How `gfx-rs` Contributes:* `gfx-rs` provides low-level control over GPU resources. The application is *entirely* responsible for managing these resources correctly. The library's low-level nature increases the risk of programmer error, making this a direct `gfx-rs` related issue.
*Example:*  Forgetting to call `destroy_buffer` on a `gfx::Buffer` after it's no longer needed. Using a `gfx::CommandBuffer` after it has been submitted. Accessing a buffer after it has been destroyed.
*Impact:* Denial of service (due to memory exhaustion), application crashes, potentially exploitable memory corruption vulnerabilities.
*Risk Severity:* **High** (can be Critical in some cases)
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization):**  Leverage Rust's ownership and borrowing system. Use smart pointers and other RAII techniques.
    *   **Code Review:** Thorough code reviews, focusing on resource management.
    *   **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools (e.g., Clippy).
    *   **Dynamic Analysis:** Use dynamic analysis tools (e.g., Valgrind, AddressSanitizer).
    *   **Higher-Level Abstractions:** Use higher-level abstractions *within the application* to encapsulate `gfx-rs` resource management.

## Attack Surface: [Application-Level Synchronization Errors](./attack_surfaces/application-level_synchronization_errors.md)

*Description:* Incorrect use of synchronization primitives (fences, semaphores) *within the application code* can lead to race conditions, data corruption, and potentially exploitable undefined behavior when interacting with the GPU *through* `gfx-rs`.
*How `gfx-rs` Contributes:* `gfx-rs` provides the synchronization mechanisms, but the application is responsible for using them correctly. The asynchronous nature of GPU operations, exposed through `gfx-rs`, makes synchronization errors more likely and directly tied to the use of the library.
*Example:* Submitting a draw call that reads from a buffer before a previous command that writes to that buffer has completed, without proper synchronization. Multiple threads accessing the same `gfx-rs` resources without proper locking.
*Impact:* Data corruption, rendering artifacts, application crashes, potentially exploitable undefined behavior.
*Risk Severity:* **High**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Careful Design:** Design the rendering pipeline to minimize complex synchronization. Understand GPU execution and dependencies.
    *   **Synchronization Primitives:** Use `gfx-rs`'s fences and semaphores correctly.
    *   **Higher-Level Abstractions:** Consider using higher-level synchronization abstractions (if available).
    *   **Testing:** Thoroughly test with multiple threads and different GPU architectures.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious or Erroneous Shaders (Application-Provided)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_or_erroneous_shaders__application-provided_.md)

*Description:* Shaders provided by the application and used *via gfx-rs* can contain errors or malicious code. While the ultimate vulnerability might be in the *driver*, the shader is processed *through* `gfx-rs`. This item is included because the application's interaction with `gfx-rs` is the vector for providing the potentially malicious shader.
*How `gfx-rs` Contributes:* `gfx-rs` is the mechanism by which the application provides the shader to the GPU. It's the conduit for this potential attack, even if the underlying vulnerability is in the driver.  The application's use of `gfx-rs` to load and use the shader is the direct involvement.
*Example:* A shader with a division-by-zero, an infinite loop, or code that attempts out-of-bounds memory access. A shader crafted to trigger a *driver* vulnerability.
*Impact:* Rendering artifacts, application crashes, denial of service, *potentially* system compromise (if a driver vulnerability is exploited - but that's indirect).
*Risk Severity:* **High** (because it *can* lead to driver exploitation, even though the driver vulnerability itself isn't directly in `gfx-rs`)
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Shader Validation:** Use shader validation tools (e.g., SPIR-V validators).
    *   **Sandboxing:** If processing untrusted shaders, run the rendering component in a sandboxed environment. This is crucial.
    *   **Input Validation (Limited):** Perform basic checks on shader source code, but this is not foolproof.
    *   **Shader Preprocessing:** Use a shader preprocessor or compiler to catch errors early.
    *   **Limit Shader Complexity:** Avoid overly complex shaders, especially with untrusted input.
