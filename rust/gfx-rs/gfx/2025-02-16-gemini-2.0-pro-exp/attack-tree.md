# Attack Tree Analysis for gfx-rs/gfx

Objective: To achieve *arbitrary code execution* on the target system running the application that uses `gfx-rs/gfx`, or to cause a *denial-of-service (DoS)* specifically leveraging vulnerabilities in `gfx-rs/gfx`. Arbitrary code execution is prioritized.

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit gfx-rs/gfx Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_gfx-rsgfx_vulnerabilities__high-risk_.md)

This branch represents vulnerabilities *within* the `gfx` library itself. The use of Rust significantly reduces the risk of many common vulnerabilities, but `unsafe` code and interactions with external libraries (like graphics drivers) remain potential attack vectors.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.a. Buffer Overflows in Shader Handling [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_a__buffer_overflows_in_shader_handling__high-risk_.md)

Shaders are complex programs that are often parsed and compiled by `gfx`. This process can be vulnerable to buffer overflows if not handled carefully.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.a.1. Malformed Shader [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_a_1__malformed_shader__critical_.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted, syntactically *incorrect* shader that triggers a buffer overflow when `gfx` attempts to parse or compile it. This is a classic attack.
**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** High (Potential for arbitrary code execution)
**Effort:** Medium (Requires understanding of shader formats and `gfx` internals)
**Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
**Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Fuzzing and static analysis can help, but subtle bugs might be missed)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.a.2. Craft Shader to Cause BOF (Valid Syntax)](./attack_tree_paths/1_a_2__craft_shader_to_cause_bof__valid_syntax_.md)

**Description:** The attacker crafts a shader that is syntactically *valid* but contains logic that, during a later stage of processing (e.g., optimization or execution), causes a buffer overflow. This is more difficult than exploiting a malformed shader.
**Likelihood:** Low to Medium
**Impact:** High (Arbitrary code execution)
**Effort:** High (Requires significant reverse engineering and exploit development)
**Skill Level:** Advanced to Expert
**Detection Difficulty:** Hard (Requires dynamic analysis and potentially manual code review)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.a.3. Integer Overflows in Size Calculations](./attack_tree_paths/1_a_3__integer_overflows_in_size_calculations.md)

**Description:** If `gfx` performs calculations to determine buffer sizes related to shaders (or other resources), an integer overflow could lead to allocating a buffer that is too small.  Subsequent writes to this undersized buffer would then cause a buffer overflow.
**Likelihood:** Low
**Impact:** High (Arbitrary code execution)
**Effort:** Medium to High
**Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
**Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [1.a.4. Out-of-Bounds Writes](./attack_tree_paths/1_a_4__out-of-bounds_writes.md)

**Description:** Similar to buffer overflows, but specifically focusing on writes that go beyond the allocated memory region, even if not a traditional "overflow" of a contiguous buffer.
**Likelihood:** Low
**Impact:** High (Arbitrary code execution)
**Effort:** Medium to High
**Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
**Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Driver/GPU Vulnerabilities (via gfx interface) [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_drivergpu_vulnerabilities__via_gfx_interface___high-risk_.md)

This branch represents vulnerabilities in the underlying graphics driver or GPU hardware.  `gfx` acts as an intermediary, and carefully crafted `gfx` API calls can be used to trigger these vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.a. Driver Bugs (via gfx interface)](./attack_tree_paths/2_a__driver_bugs__via_gfx_interface_.md)

Graphics drivers are complex pieces of software and are frequently found to contain vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.a.1. Known Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2_a_1__known_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a *known* vulnerability in the graphics driver.  Exploits for these vulnerabilities are often publicly available.
**Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on how quickly users update their drivers)
**Impact:** High (Often allows for arbitrary code execution or privilege escalation)
**Effort:** Low to Medium (Exploits might be publicly available)
**Skill Level:** Intermediate (If using existing exploits) to Advanced (If developing new exploits)
**Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (Requires monitoring for driver vulnerabilities and potentially intrusion detection systems)

## Attack Tree Path: [2.a.2. Zero-Day Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2_a_2__zero-day_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

**Description:** An attacker discovers and exploits a *previously unknown* (zero-day) vulnerability in the graphics driver.  These are rare and highly valuable to attackers.
**Likelihood:** Very Low (Rare and valuable)
**Impact:** Very High (Can bypass all defenses)
**Effort:** Very High (Requires significant expertise and resources)
**Skill Level:** Expert
**Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard (Often requires advanced behavioral analysis or anomaly detection)
