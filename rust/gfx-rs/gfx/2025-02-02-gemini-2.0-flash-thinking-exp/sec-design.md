# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, gfx-rs/gfx, is an open-source, low-level graphics library written in Rust. Its primary goal is to provide a portable and efficient abstraction over modern graphics APIs like Vulkan, Metal, and DirectX 12.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a robust and performant graphics abstraction layer for Rust developers.
  - Enable cross-platform graphics development in Rust.
  - Foster a community around Rust graphics programming.
  - Maintain compatibility with various graphics backends and operating systems.
  - Ensure the library is reliable and secure for its users.

- Business Risks:
  - Risk of vulnerabilities in the library leading to security issues in applications using it.
  - Risk of instability or bugs affecting application performance and reliability.
  - Risk of lack of adoption if the library is not performant, feature-rich, or easy to use.
  - Risk of community fragmentation or lack of contributions impacting maintenance and development.
  - Risk of dependency on external graphics backend libraries introducing vulnerabilities or instability.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Code is open source and publicly reviewed on GitHub. (Implemented: GitHub Repository)
  - security control: Pull requests are used for code contributions, allowing for review before merging. (Implemented: GitHub Workflow)
  - security control: Rust's memory safety features mitigate certain classes of vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows). (Implemented: Language Choice - Rust)
  - security control: Use of crates.io for dependency management, which has some level of package verification. (Implemented: Dependency Management)

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on external contributors for security vulnerability identification and patching.
  - accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in underlying graphics backend drivers and libraries that are outside the control of gfx-rs/gfx.
  - accepted risk: Open-source nature means vulnerabilities are publicly known once discovered.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to detect potential vulnerabilities early.
  - security control: Conduct regular security audits of the codebase, potentially involving external security experts.
  - security control: Establish a clear process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities, including a security policy and contact information.
  - security control: Implement fuzz testing to identify potential crashes and vulnerabilities in the library.
  - security control: Sign release artifacts to ensure integrity and authenticity.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable as a library. However, for any related services (website, documentation), standard authentication practices should be used.
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable as a library. Access control is relevant for repository maintainers and contributors on GitHub.
  - Input Validation: Crucial for library APIs to prevent unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities when applications pass data to the library. Validate all inputs from applications to gfx-rs/gfx APIs.
  - Cryptography: May be relevant if the library handles any cryptographic operations or interacts with systems that use cryptography. Ensure proper and secure use of cryptographic libraries if needed.
