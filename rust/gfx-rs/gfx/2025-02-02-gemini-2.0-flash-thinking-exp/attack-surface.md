# Attack Surface Analysis for gfx-rs/gfx

## Attack Surface: [Shader Compilation Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/shader_compilation_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Bugs or weaknesses in the shader compiler (e.g., `shaderc`, driver compilers) that can be triggered by maliciously crafted shaders during compilation.
* **gfx Contribution:** `gfx-rs` relies on shader compilation to convert shader code into GPU-executable code, using external tools or driver-provided compilers, thus inheriting their potential vulnerabilities.
* **Example:** A specially crafted GLSL shader submitted to `gfx-rs` for compilation triggers a buffer overflow in `shaderc`, leading to code execution on the host system during the compilation process.
* **Impact:** Code execution on the host system, denial of service (compiler crash), information disclosure (if compiler leaks internal data).
* **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Use up-to-date shader toolchains (ensure `shaderc` and graphics drivers are updated).
    * Implement pre-compilation shader validation steps (e.g., using linters or static analysis tools).
    * Consider sandboxing the shader compilation process.
    * Restrict shader sources to trusted origins and avoid dynamic shader generation from untrusted input.

## Attack Surface: [Shader Out-of-Bounds Memory Access](./attack_surfaces/shader_out-of-bounds_memory_access.md)

* **Description:** Shaders attempting to read or write memory outside of allocated buffers or textures during GPU execution.
* **gfx Contribution:** `gfx-rs` provides APIs for creating and managing buffers and textures that shaders operate on. Incorrect shader logic or vulnerabilities in shaders can lead to out-of-bounds access when using these resources managed by `gfx-rs`.
* **Example:** A fragment shader in a `gfx-rs` application, due to flawed logic, reads texture data beyond the allocated texture size, potentially leaking data from other parts of GPU memory or causing a crash.
* **Impact:** Data corruption, information disclosure (reading sensitive data from GPU memory), denial of service (GPU crash or application crash).
* **Risk Severity:** **Medium** to **High**
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Thoroughly review and test shader code for out-of-bounds access issues.
    * Use shader debuggers and validation layers during development.
    * Implement bounds checking within shaders, especially for user-controlled inputs.
    * Validate resource sizes to prevent shaders from accessing beyond allocated regions due to incorrect setup.
    * Utilize address sanitizers (if available) during shader development and testing.

## Attack Surface: [Use-After-Free/Double-Free of Graphics Resources](./attack_surfaces/use-after-freedouble-free_of_graphics_resources.md)

* **Description:** Bugs in the application's resource management logic leading to using graphics resources (buffers, textures, pipelines) after they have been freed or attempting to free them multiple times.
* **gfx Contribution:** `gfx-rs` relies on the application to correctly manage the lifetime of graphics resources created through its API. Incorrect resource management when using `gfx-rs` APIs can lead to these memory safety issues.
* **Example:** An application incorrectly frees a buffer created via `gfx-rs` that is still being used by a command buffer. When the command buffer is executed, it attempts to access the freed buffer, leading to a crash or potentially exploitable memory corruption.
* **Impact:** Application crash, memory corruption, potential for code execution (in more complex scenarios).
* **Risk Severity:** **Medium** to **High**
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Utilize RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) principles and smart pointers for `gfx-rs` resources.
    * Implement clear ownership and lifetime tracking for `gfx-rs` resources.
    * Thoroughly review and test resource management code, especially around `gfx-rs` resource handling.
    * Use memory debugging tools and graphics API validation layers during development.
