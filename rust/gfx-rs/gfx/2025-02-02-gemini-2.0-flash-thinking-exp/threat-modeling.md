# Threat Model Analysis for gfx-rs/gfx

## Threat: [Shader Buffer Overflow/Underflow](./threats/shader_buffer_overflowunderflow.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious shader code (GLSL, HLSL) that, when executed by the GPU through `gfx`, attempts to read or write memory outside of allocated buffer boundaries. This can be achieved by manipulating shader inputs or exploiting vulnerabilities in shader logic.
*   **Impact:** Application crash, unexpected behavior, memory corruption, potential for arbitrary code execution (though less likely in typical application context, more likely driver instability).
*   **Affected gfx component:** Shader execution pipeline, GPU driver interaction via `gfx`, Buffer resources managed by `gfx`.
*   **Risk severity:** High
*   **Mitigation strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly review and test shader code, especially boundary checks.
    *   Utilize shader validation tools during development.
    *   Implement robust error handling for shader loading and compilation within the `gfx` application.
    *   Employ memory safety practices in shader design.

## Threat: [Use-After-Free/Double-Free in gfx/Dependencies](./threats/use-after-freedouble-free_in_gfxdependencies.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability within the `gfx` library itself or its underlying dependencies (including system graphics libraries used by `gfx`) allows an attacker to trigger a use-after-free or double-free condition. This could be exploited by crafting specific `gfx` API calls or input data that exposes the underlying vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Application crash, memory corruption, potential for arbitrary code execution (though less likely in typical application context, more likely driver instability).
*   **Affected gfx component:** `gfx` core library, underlying graphics API bindings used by `gfx`, system graphics drivers interacted with by `gfx`.
*   **Risk severity:** High
*   **Mitigation strategies:**
    *   Keep `gfx` and its dependencies updated to the latest versions to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
    *   Report potential memory safety issues found in `gfx` to the maintainers.
    *   Carefully audit any `unsafe` code blocks used in the application's `gfx` integration and within `gfx` itself if contributing.

## Threat: [GPU Driver Exploit via gfx Commands](./threats/gpu_driver_exploit_via_gfx_commands.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a sequence of `gfx` API calls or input data through `gfx` that exploits a vulnerability in the underlying GPU driver. This could involve sending unexpected or malformed commands via `gfx` that trigger driver bugs.
*   **Impact:** Application crash, system instability, potential privilege escalation (less likely in typical application context, more likely driver instability or system hang).
*   **Affected gfx component:** `gfx` API calls, `gfx` command submission pipeline, GPU driver interaction initiated by `gfx`.
*   **Risk severity:** High
*   **Mitigation strategies:**
    *   Encourage users to keep GPU drivers updated to the latest versions.
    *   Implement input validation and sanitization for data passed to `gfx` commands, especially if the data originates from untrusted sources.
    *   In sandboxed environments, consider limiting the available graphics API features or driver access if possible to reduce the attack surface exposed through `gfx`.

## Threat: [Malicious Shader Injection](./threats/malicious_shader_injection.md)

*   **Description:** If the application loads shaders from untrusted sources (user-provided, external files without validation) and uses `gfx` to process them, an attacker can inject malicious shaders designed to crash the driver, leak information, or perform other malicious actions when executed by the GPU via `gfx`.
*   **Impact:** Application crash, information disclosure (potentially through rendering output controlled by `gfx`), potential for other malicious actions depending on shader capabilities and driver vulnerabilities exposed through `gfx`.
*   **Affected gfx component:** Shader loading and compilation pipeline within the `gfx` application, Shader module used by `gfx`, GPU driver interaction via `gfx`.
*   **Risk severity:** High
*   **Mitigation strategies:**
    *   Avoid loading shaders from untrusted sources if possible.
    *   If user-provided shaders are necessary, implement strict validation and sanitization processes before loading and using them with `gfx`.
    *   Consider using shader compilers and validators provided by graphics API vendors to detect potentially malicious or problematic shader code before using it with `gfx`.
    *   Implement a secure shader compilation pipeline that minimizes the risk of introducing vulnerabilities during the compilation process within the `gfx` application.
