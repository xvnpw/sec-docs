## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Shader Processing Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_shader_processing_vulnerability.md)

*   This path focuses on vulnerabilities that arise during the processing of shader code. Shaders are programs executed on the GPU, and flaws in how gfx-rs handles them can be exploited.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Shader Code](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_shader_code.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts malicious shader code and supplies it to the application. This code exploits weaknesses in the shader parser, compiler, or runtime environment of gfx-rs.
*   **Mechanism:** The malicious shader code could contain instructions that lead to out-of-bounds memory access, buffer overflows, or other exploitable conditions when processed by the GPU. Successful injection can result in arbitrary code execution on the GPU, and potentially the CPU depending on the system architecture and driver implementation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Resource Handling Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_resource_handling_vulnerability.md)

*   This path targets vulnerabilities related to how gfx-rs manages resources like textures, buffers, and render targets. Improper handling can lead to memory corruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Out-of-Bounds Access](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_out-of-bounds_access.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker manipulates input data or API calls to cause gfx-rs to read or write memory outside the bounds of an allocated buffer.
*   **Mechanism:** This can occur due to incorrect size calculations, missing bounds checks, or manipulation of resource indices or offsets. Successful out-of-bounds access can lead to memory corruption, potentially overwriting critical data or code, leading to crashes or arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Use-After-Free](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_use-after-free.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker causes gfx-rs to access a memory location that has been previously freed.
*   **Mechanism:** This often happens when a resource is deallocated, but a pointer to that memory is still held and later dereferenced. If the freed memory is reallocated for another purpose, the application might operate on unintended data, leading to unpredictable behavior, crashes, or exploitable conditions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Memory Management Vulnerability within gfx-rs](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_memory_management_vulnerability_within_gfx-rs.md)

*   This path focuses on general memory management vulnerabilities within the gfx-rs library itself, independent of specific resource types.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Heap Overflow](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_heap_overflow.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker provides input data that exceeds the allocated size of a buffer on the heap, overwriting adjacent memory regions.
*   **Mechanism:** This can occur due to incorrect size calculations when allocating memory or insufficient bounds checking when copying data into a buffer. By carefully crafting the overflowing data, an attacker can overwrite critical data structures or function pointers, potentially gaining control of the program's execution flow and achieving arbitrary code execution.
