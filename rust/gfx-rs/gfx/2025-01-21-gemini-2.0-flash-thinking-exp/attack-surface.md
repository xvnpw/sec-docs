# Attack Surface Analysis for gfx-rs/gfx

## Attack Surface: [Malicious or Crafted Buffer Data](./attack_surfaces/malicious_or_crafted_buffer_data.md)

**Description:** The application provides data to `gfx-rs/gfx` through buffers (vertex, index, uniform). If this data is maliciously crafted or exceeds expected bounds, it can lead to vulnerabilities.

**How gfx Contributes:** `gfx` directly consumes and processes the data provided in these buffers for rendering. It relies on the application to provide valid data.

**Example:** An attacker provides an index buffer with indices pointing outside the bounds of the vertex buffer.

**Impact:** Buffer overflows, out-of-bounds memory access, crashes, potential for arbitrary code execution (depending on driver vulnerabilities).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developer:** Implement robust input validation on all data before passing it to `gfx` buffer creation or update functions.
*   **Developer:** Enforce strict size limits on buffer data based on application logic.
*   **Developer:** Utilize safe Rust data structures and avoid manual memory management where possible.

## Attack Surface: [Shader Source Injection (If Allowed)](./attack_surfaces/shader_source_injection__if_allowed_.md)

**Description:** If the application allows users to provide or influence shader source code, this introduces a significant risk of injecting malicious code.

**How gfx Contributes:** `gfx` provides mechanisms for compiling and using shaders. If the application exposes this functionality to untrusted sources, it becomes an attack vector.

**Example:** A user provides a malicious GLSL shader that attempts to read from arbitrary memory locations or execute infinite loops.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the GPU (potentially leading to system compromise), information disclosure, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developer:** **Avoid allowing untrusted shader source code.**
*   **Developer:** If dynamic shaders are necessary, implement strict sandboxing and validation of the provided code.
*   **Developer:** Use a restricted shader language or a safer shader compilation pipeline.
