# Threat Model Analysis for gfx-rs/gfx

## Threat: [Exploiting Underlying Graphics Driver Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploiting_underlying_graphics_driver_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Underlying Graphics Driver Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts specific rendering commands or provides input that triggers a known vulnerability in the underlying graphics driver (Vulkan, Metal, DirectX). This is possible because `gfx` acts as an abstraction layer and ultimately relies on these drivers for rendering. The attacker leverages `gfx`'s API to send the malicious commands.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, system instability, potential for arbitrary code execution at the driver level, leading to full system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Graphics API Abstraction Layer (within `gfx` that interacts with the native drivers).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Encourage users to keep their graphics drivers updated to the latest stable versions.
        *   Implement robust error handling when interacting with `gfx` and the underlying graphics API to gracefully handle driver errors.
        *   Report any suspected driver issues triggered by the application to the driver vendor.
        *   Consider providing fallback rendering paths or disabling problematic features if specific driver issues are encountered.

## Threat: [Incorrect Graphics API Usage Leading to GPU Memory Corruption](./threats/incorrect_graphics_api_usage_leading_to_gpu_memory_corruption.md)

*   **Threat:** Incorrect Graphics API Usage Leading to GPU Memory Corruption
    *   **Description:** The application developer makes mistakes in using the `gfx` API, such as incorrect resource binding, out-of-bounds access to GPU memory managed by `gfx`, or improper synchronization when interacting with `gfx`'s resources. An attacker might trigger these conditions through specific game actions or by manipulating input data that leads to these incorrect `gfx` API calls.
    *   **Impact:** Rendering glitches, application crashes, potential for information disclosure if corrupted memory managed by `gfx` is read back, or even code execution if memory corruption leads to control flow hijacking on the GPU.
    *   **Affected Component:** Resource Management (buffers, textures, render targets managed by `gfx`), Command Buffer Submission (through `gfx`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly test all rendering paths and resource management logic that utilizes `gfx`, especially edge cases and error conditions.
        *   Utilize validation layers provided by the underlying graphics APIs during development and testing to catch API usage errors within `gfx`.
        *   Adhere strictly to `gfx`'s API documentation and best practices for resource management and synchronization.
        *   Employ memory-safe programming practices in the application code interacting with `gfx`.

## Threat: [Shader Injection via User-Provided Content](./threats/shader_injection_via_user-provided_content.md)

*   **Threat:** Shader Injection via User-Provided Content
    *   **Description:** If the application allows users to provide or influence shader code, this code is then processed and executed by `gfx`. An attacker can inject malicious shader code that, when compiled and run by `gfx`, performs unintended operations on the GPU, such as reading sensitive data from GPU memory managed by `gfx` or causing a denial of service by overloading the GPU through `gfx`'s rendering pipeline.
    *   **Impact:** Information leakage from GPU memory managed by `gfx`, denial of service by exhausting GPU resources through `gfx`, rendering of malicious or inappropriate content using `gfx`'s capabilities, potential for exploiting driver vulnerabilities through crafted shaders processed by `gfx`.
    *   **Affected Component:** Shader Compilation and Pipeline Creation (within `gfx`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid allowing user-provided shader code if possible.
        *   If user-provided shaders are necessary, implement strict validation and sanitization processes to check for potentially harmful code patterns before passing them to `gfx` for compilation.
        *   Consider running user-provided shaders in a sandboxed environment or using a restricted shader language subset that `gfx` can enforce.
        *   Implement content security policies for loaded shader assets that will be processed by `gfx`.
