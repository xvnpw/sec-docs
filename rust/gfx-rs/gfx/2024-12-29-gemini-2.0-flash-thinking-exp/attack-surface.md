Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces that directly involve `gfx-rs/gfx`, focusing on high and critical severity risks:

*   **Attack Surface:** Unvalidated Resource Dimensions (Textures, Buffers)
    *   **Description:** Providing excessively large or invalid dimensions when creating textures, buffers, or other GPU resources through `gfx` APIs.
    *   **How gfx Contributes:** `gfx` provides the direct interface for creating these resources. If the application doesn't validate input before using `gfx`'s creation functions, it's vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides extremely large width and height values to a `gfx` texture creation function, attempting to exhaust GPU memory.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) by exhausting GPU or system memory, potentially crashing the application or even the system. Integer overflows within `gfx` or the underlying driver during allocation could lead to memory corruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Implement strict validation on all user-provided or external data used to determine resource dimensions *before* passing them to `gfx`'s resource creation functions. Set reasonable limits based on application needs and hardware capabilities.
        *   **Error Handling:** Properly handle errors returned by `gfx` during resource creation, as this might indicate invalid parameters.
