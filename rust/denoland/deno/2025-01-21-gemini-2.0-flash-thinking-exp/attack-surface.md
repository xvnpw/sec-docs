# Attack Surface Analysis for denoland/deno

## Attack Surface: [Permission Bypass Vulnerabilities in Deno Runtime](./attack_surfaces/permission_bypass_vulnerabilities_in_deno_runtime.md)

* **Attack Surface:** Permission Bypass Vulnerabilities in Deno Runtime
    * **Description:**  Security flaws within the Deno runtime itself could potentially allow attackers to bypass the intended permission restrictions.
    * **How Deno Contributes:**  This is a direct vulnerability within the core Deno implementation.
    * **Example:** A bug in the permission checking logic allows a network request to proceed even without the `--allow-net` flag.
    * **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application's security sandbox, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution and system compromise.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep Deno Updated: Regularly update to the latest stable version of Deno to benefit from security patches.
        * Monitor Security Advisories: Stay informed about reported vulnerabilities in Deno.
        * Consider Using Third-Party Security Audits: For critical applications, consider independent security audits of the Deno runtime.

## Attack Surface: [Exploitation of `Deno.dlopen` (FFI)](./attack_surfaces/exploitation_of__deno_dlopen___ffi_.md)

* **Attack Surface:** Exploitation of `Deno.dlopen` (FFI)
    * **Description:** `Deno.dlopen` allows loading and executing native code libraries. This introduces the risk of vulnerabilities within those libraries or malicious libraries being loaded.
    * **How Deno Contributes:** Deno provides the `Deno.dlopen` API, enabling interaction with potentially unsafe native code.
    * **Example:** An application loads a native library with a known buffer overflow vulnerability, which can be triggered by providing crafted input.
    * **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, memory corruption, potential system compromise depending on the privileges of the Deno process.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Carefully Vet Native Libraries: Only load native libraries from trusted sources and with known security records.
        * Minimize Use of `Deno.dlopen`:**  Avoid using native libraries unless absolutely necessary.
        * Implement Robust Input Validation:** Sanitize and validate all data passed to native functions.
        * Consider Sandboxing Native Code (if possible): Explore techniques to further isolate the execution of native code.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via `Deno.run`](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via__deno_run_.md)

* **Attack Surface:** Command Injection via `Deno.run`
    * **Description:** The `Deno.run` API allows executing external commands. If user-controlled input is used to construct these commands without proper sanitization, it can lead to command injection vulnerabilities.
    * **How Deno Contributes:** Deno provides the `Deno.run` API, which, if misused, opens this attack vector.
    * **Example:** An application takes user input for a filename and uses it directly in a `Deno.run` command like `Deno.run(['ls', userInput])`. A malicious user could input `; rm -rf /` to execute arbitrary commands.
    * **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server, potentially leading to data loss, system compromise, or denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid `Deno.run` with User Input:**  Whenever possible, avoid using `Deno.run` with data directly derived from user input.
        * Strict Input Sanitization:** If `Deno.run` with user input is unavoidable, implement rigorous input sanitization and validation to prevent command injection.
        * Use Parameterized Execution (if available): If the external command supports it, use parameterized execution to separate commands from arguments.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via `Deno.connect` or `fetch`](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via__deno_connect__or__fetch_.md)

* **Attack Surface:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via `Deno.connect` or `fetch`
    * **Description:** If an application uses user-controlled input to determine the target of a network request (using `Deno.connect` for raw sockets or the `fetch` API), an attacker can potentially force the application to make requests to internal or unintended external resources.
    * **How Deno Contributes:** Deno's `Deno.connect` and `fetch` APIs are the mechanisms used to make network requests.
    * **Example:** An application takes a URL from user input and uses it in a `fetch` call. A malicious user could provide a URL pointing to an internal service (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/admin`) that is not intended to be publicly accessible.
    * **Impact:** Access to internal resources, potential data exfiltration, denial of service against internal services.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Validate and Sanitize URLs:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize user-provided URLs. Use allow-lists of permitted domains or protocols.
        * Avoid Using User Input Directly in Network Requests:**  Whenever possible, avoid directly using user input to construct URLs or connection parameters.
        * Implement Network Segmentation:**  Isolate internal services from the internet.
        * Use a Proxy or Firewall:**  Route outgoing requests through a proxy or firewall that can enforce restrictions.
