## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Deno's Security Model](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_deno's_security_model.md)

This critical node represents attacks that aim to undermine Deno's core security features, primarily the permission system. Success here can lead to a complete bypass of Deno's security model.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Permission System](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_permission_system.md)

This critical node encompasses techniques attackers use to perform privileged operations without the necessary permissions. This can involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the permission checking logic or taking advantage of misconfigurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Misconfiguration of Permissions](./attack_tree_paths/misconfiguration_of_permissions.md)

This critical node highlights the risk of developers incorrectly configuring Deno's permission system, leading to unintended access and capabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Overly Permissive Flags Set During Startup](./attack_tree_paths/overly_permissive_flags_set_during_startup.md)

This specific attack vector within permission misconfiguration involves developers unintentionally setting command-line flags that grant broad and unnecessary permissions to the Deno application during startup. This effectively weakens or disables Deno's security sandbox.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Deno's Module Resolution and Management](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_deno's_module_resolution_and_management.md)

This critical node focuses on vulnerabilities related to how Deno fetches and manages external modules. Attackers can exploit this process to inject malicious code into the application's dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Dependency Confusion Attack](./attack_tree_paths/dependency_confusion_attack.md)

This attack vector involves an attacker registering a malicious package on a public repository (like `nest.land` or `npmjs.com`) with the same name as a private dependency used by the Deno application. When Deno attempts to resolve the dependency, it might mistakenly download and use the attacker's malicious package instead of the intended private one.

## Attack Tree Path: [Typosquatting Attack](./attack_tree_paths/typosquatting_attack.md)

Similar to dependency confusion, this attack vector relies on developers making typos when specifying module names in their import statements. Attackers register malicious packages with names that are very similar to legitimate, popular Deno modules, hoping that developers will accidentally import the malicious version.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Deno's Native Plugin System (FFI)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_deno's_native_plugin_system__ffi_.md)

This critical node highlights the risks associated with using Deno's Foreign Function Interface (FFI) to load and execute native code. Native plugins operate outside of Deno's security sandbox, making them a potential attack vector if they are malicious or vulnerable.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Chain Attacks through Malicious Native Plugins](./attack_tree_paths/supply_chain_attacks_through_malicious_native_plugins.md)

This critical node encompasses attacks where the attacker compromises the application by using a malicious native plugin. This can happen in several ways:
        *   **[CRITICAL] Using a Plugin with Known Vulnerabilities:** Developers might unknowingly use a native plugin that has publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities. Attackers can then exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the application.
        *   **Using a Plugin Backdoored by an Attacker:** An attacker might compromise the development or distribution process of a native plugin and insert malicious code (a backdoor) into it. Applications using this backdoored plugin would then be compromised.

## Attack Tree Path: [Using a Plugin with Known Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/using_a_plugin_with_known_vulnerabilities.md)

Developers might unknowingly use a native plugin that has publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities. Attackers can then exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the application.
