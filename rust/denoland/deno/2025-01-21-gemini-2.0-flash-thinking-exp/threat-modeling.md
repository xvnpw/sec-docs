# Threat Model Analysis for denoland/deno

## Threat: [Incorrectly Granted Permissions](./threats/incorrectly_granted_permissions.md)

**Description:** An attacker could leverage overly broad permissions granted to the application during startup to perform actions beyond the application's intended scope. For example, if an application unnecessarily has `--allow-read` without specific paths, an attacker could read arbitrary files on the system.

**Impact:** Data breach (reading sensitive files), system compromise (if write permissions are also present), denial of service (reading large files to exhaust resources).

**Affected Deno Component:** Deno's permission system, specifically the flags used during runtime (e.g., `--allow-read`, `--allow-net`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Apply the principle of least privilege. Only grant the necessary permissions required for the application's functionality. Specify paths for file system access (`--allow-read=/path/to/data`). Limit network access to specific domains or ports (`--allow-net=example.com:80`). Regularly review and audit granted permissions.

## Threat: [Dependency Confusion Attack](./threats/dependency_confusion_attack.md)

**Description:** An attacker could publish a malicious package with the same name as a private dependency used by the application on a public registry (like `jsr.io` if the private dependency isn't properly secured). When Deno resolves dependencies, it might prioritize the public, malicious package over the intended private one.

**Impact:** Execution of arbitrary code within the application's context, potentially leading to data theft, system compromise, or denial of service.

**Affected Deno Component:** Deno's module resolution mechanism, specifically when resolving remote modules from URLs.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:** Utilize private modules or registries for internal dependencies. If using public registries, ensure private dependencies have unique and difficult-to-guess names. Implement robust dependency verification mechanisms (e.g., using checksums or subresource integrity if available in future Deno versions). Consider using a dependency proxy or mirroring solution.

## Threat: [Malicious Dependency Injection](./threats/malicious_dependency_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker could compromise a legitimate third-party Deno module hosted on a public URL. Once compromised, the attacker can inject malicious code into the module, which will then be executed by applications that depend on it.

**Impact:** Execution of arbitrary code within the application's context, potentially leading to data theft, system compromise, or denial of service. This can affect many applications relying on the compromised module.

**Affected Deno Component:** Deno's module resolution mechanism, specifically the fetching and execution of code from remote URLs.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:** Carefully vet all external dependencies. Pin specific versions of dependencies in the `--lock` file to prevent unexpected updates. Regularly audit the dependencies used in the application for known vulnerabilities. Stay informed about security advisories for popular Deno modules. Consider using tools that analyze dependencies for security risks.

## Threat: [Vulnerability in Deno Standard Library Module](./threats/vulnerability_in_deno_standard_library_module.md)

**Description:** A security flaw could exist within a module provided by the Deno standard library (e.g., a buffer overflow in a networking utility or a path traversal vulnerability in a file system function). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing crafted input or triggering specific conditions.

**Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to arbitrary code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service.

**Affected Deno Component:** A specific module within the `std` directory of the Deno repository (e.g., `std/http`, `std/fs`).

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:** Stay updated with the latest Deno releases, which include security fixes for the standard library. Be aware of reported vulnerabilities in standard library modules and apply necessary updates or workarounds. Report any potential vulnerabilities found in the standard library to the Deno team.

## Threat: [Deno Runtime Vulnerability](./threats/deno_runtime_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** A security vulnerability could exist within the core Deno runtime itself (written in Rust). This could be a memory safety issue, a logic error in permission handling, or a flaw in the JavaScript execution environment. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain control over the Deno process or the underlying system.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server, complete system compromise, denial of service.

**Affected Deno Component:** The core Deno runtime, including the V8 JavaScript engine integration and the permission management system.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:** Stay updated with the latest Deno releases and security patches. Subscribe to Deno security advisories. Report any potential vulnerabilities found in the Deno runtime to the Deno team. Consider using sandboxing or containerization techniques to limit the impact of a runtime compromise.

## Threat: [Insecure Flags in Production Deployment](./threats/insecure_flags_in_production_deployment.md)

**Description:** Developers might accidentally or intentionally deploy a Deno application with overly permissive flags in a production environment (e.g., `--allow-all`, `--allow-net`). This significantly increases the attack surface and makes it easier for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities.

**Impact:**  Increased risk of all other threats, potentially leading to data breach, system compromise, or denial of service.

**Affected Deno Component:** Deno's command-line flag parsing and permission system.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**  Strictly control the flags used when deploying the application. Use environment variables or configuration files to manage permissions instead of command-line flags. Implement infrastructure-as-code to ensure consistent and secure deployments. Regularly review and audit deployment configurations.
