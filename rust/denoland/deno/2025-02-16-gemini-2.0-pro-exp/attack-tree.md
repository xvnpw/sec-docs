## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Deno Permissions Model (High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_deno_permissions_model__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Overly Permissive Environment Variables:**
    *   **Description:** Sensitive data (API keys, database credentials) are stored in environment variables accessible to the Deno process. An attacker gaining even limited code execution can read these.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High
    *   **Effort:** Very Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy/Hard (depending on monitoring)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Use a secrets manager.
        *   Minimize exposed environment variables.
        *   Sanitize the environment before launching Deno.

*   **Insecure Use of `--allow-all`:**
    *   **Description:** Granting all permissions, providing an attacker with unrestricted access.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (should be avoided in production)
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** Very Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Easy
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Never use `--allow-all` in production.
        *   Use specific permission flags.
        *   Enforce code reviews and automated checks.

*   **`--allow-net` [CRITICAL]:**
    *   **Description:** Allows the Deno process to make arbitrary network connections.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (many applications need network access)
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High (data exfiltration, C2 communication)
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Restrict network access to specific hosts and ports.
        *   Implement network monitoring.

*   **`--allow-run` [CRITICAL]:**
    *   **Description:** Allows the Deno process to execute arbitrary subprocesses.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (should be avoided if possible)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (direct path to RCE)
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Avoid `--allow-run` if possible.
        *   Whitelist specific commands and arguments.
        *   Thoroughly sanitize input.

* **Leak Keys via Env (High Risk):**
    * **Description:**  A specific consequence of overly permissive environment variables, focusing on the high impact of leaking sensitive keys.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** High
    * **Effort:** Very Low
    * **Skill Level:** Novice
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Easy/Hard (depending on monitoring)
    * **Mitigation:** Same as "Overly Permissive Environment Variables".

* **RCE via Shell Cmds (High Risk):**
    * **Description:** A specific consequence of using `--allow-run`, focusing on achieving RCE through shell command execution.
    * **Likelihood:** Low (if `--allow-run` is used)
    * **Impact:** Very High
    * **Effort:** Low
    * **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
    * **Mitigation:** Same as "`--allow-run`".

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Deno Standard Library or Dependencies (High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_deno_standard_library_or_dependencies__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Vulnerability in 3rd Party Dependencies:**
    *   **Description:** A security flaw in a third-party module imported into the Deno application.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Use dependency management tools.
        *   Perform vulnerability scanning.
        *   Regularly update dependencies.
        *   Audit dependencies before adding them.

*   **Supply Chain Attack on Dependencies:**
    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises a dependency's repository or distribution, injecting malicious code.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** High to Very High
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced to Expert
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Use lock files (`deno.lock`).
        *   Utilize integrity checking.
        *   Consider vendoring dependencies.
        *   Use a private module registry.
