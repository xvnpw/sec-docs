# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for denoland/deno

## Mitigation Strategy: [Granular Permission Flags](./mitigation_strategies/granular_permission_flags.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Granular Permission Flags

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Analyze Code:** Carefully examine your Deno code to determine the *precise* resources it needs (files, network, environment, subprocesses, etc.).
        2.  **Zero Permissions Start:** Run your Deno script initially with *no* `--allow-*` flags. This will cause failures, highlighting required permissions.
        3.  **Specific Flags:** Add only the *most specific* Deno permission flags.  Use path restrictions and host/port limitations:
            *   `--allow-read=/specific/path/file.txt` (not `--allow-read`)
            *   `--allow-net=api.example.com:443` (not `--allow-net`)
            *   `--allow-env=API_KEY` (not `--allow-env`)
            *   `--allow-run=specific_command` (not `--allow-run`)
            *   `--allow-ffi=/path/to/specific/library.so` (and be *very* careful with FFI)
            *   `--allow-hrtime` (only if absolutely necessary)
        4.  **Development Prompting:** Use `--prompt` during development. Deno will ask for permission at runtime, helping you refine the flags.
        5.  **Continuous Testing:** Thoroughly test after each permission change.
        6.  **Document and Review:** Document all granted permissions and review them regularly.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Arbitrary File System Access (High Severity):** Deno's permission model, when used correctly, prevents unauthorized file system access.
        *   **Uncontrolled Network Access (High Severity):** Deno's `--allow-net` flag, with specific host/port restrictions, controls network connections.
        *   **Environment Variable Exposure (Medium to High Severity):** Deno's `--allow-env` flag, with specific variable names, limits environment variable access.
        *   **Uncontrolled Subprocess Execution (High Severity):** Deno's `--allow-run` flag, with specific command restrictions, controls subprocess execution.
        *   **Foreign Function Interface Abuse (High Severity):** Deno's `--allow-ffi` flag, with specific library restrictions, limits FFI access.
        *   **Timing Attacks (Low to Medium Severity):** Deno's `--allow-hrtime` flag controls access to high-resolution timers.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   All listed threats: Risk significantly reduced (from High/Medium to Low/Negligible) when permissions are correctly configured.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   `main.ts`: Partially implemented (`--allow-net`, `--allow-read` with some restrictions).
        *   `data_processor.ts`: Fully implemented (specific file paths for read/write).

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   `utils/helper.ts`: Uses `--allow-all` - needs complete refactoring.
        *   Testing scripts: Inconsistent permission usage.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Lock Files (`deno.lock`)](./mitigation_strategies/lock_files___deno_lock__.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Lock Files (`deno.lock`)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Generate:** Run `deno cache --lock=deno.lock --reload` to create/update `deno.lock`. This file pins dependency versions and hashes.
        2.  **Version Control:** Commit `deno.lock` to your repository (e.g., Git).
        3.  **CI/CD Integration:** Ensure your CI/CD pipeline uses the lock file (often automatic, but may need `--lock=deno.lock`).
        4.  **Regular Updates:** Periodically run `deno cache --lock=deno.lock --reload` to update dependencies and review the changes.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Dependency Confusion/Substitution (High Severity):** Deno's lock file, combined with its URL-based import system, prevents this.
        *   **Supply Chain Attacks (via Dependencies) (High Severity):** Deno's lock file reduces the risk of compromised dependencies by pinning versions.
        *   **Inconsistent Behavior (Medium Severity):** Ensures consistent dependency versions across environments.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Dependency Confusion/Substitution: Risk significantly reduced (High to Low).
        *   Supply Chain Attacks: Risk reduced (High to Medium).
        *   Inconsistent Behavior: Risk significantly reduced (Medium to Low).

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   `deno.lock` file exists and is committed.
        *   CI/CD uses the lock file.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** None.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Subresource Integrity (SRI) - Deno's Built-in Verification](./mitigation_strategies/subresource_integrity__sri__-_deno's_built-in_verification.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Subresource Integrity (SRI) - Deno's Built-in Verification

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Identify CDN Resources:** Find any external modules loaded from CDNs.
        2.  **Generate Hash:** Generate an SRI hash (SHA-256, SHA-384, or SHA-512) of the external resource's content.
        3.  **`integrity` Attribute:** Add the `integrity` attribute to the Deno import statement:
            ```typescript
            import { x } from "https://cdn.example.com/lib.js?integrity=sha384-...";
            ```
        4.  **Deno Verification:** Deno *automatically* verifies the integrity hash against the downloaded resource.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks (High Severity):** Deno's SRI verification prevents execution of modified resources.
        *   **Compromised CDN (High Severity):** Deno's SRI check fails if the CDN serves a different file.
        *   **Tampering (High Severity):** Deno ensures the downloaded code matches the expected hash.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   All listed threats: Risk significantly reduced (High to Low/Negligible).

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Used for main application dependencies from `cdn.skypack.dev`.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   `utils/charting.ts`: Loads a library from another CDN without SRI.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Import Maps (Deno's Module Resolution Control)](./mitigation_strategies/import_maps__deno's_module_resolution_control_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Import Maps (Deno's Module Resolution Control)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Create `deno.json` or `import_map.json`:** Create one of these files in your project root.
        2.  **Define Mappings:** Map module specifiers to specific URLs or local paths:
            ```json
            {
              "imports": {
                "std/": "https://deno.land/std@0.200.0/",
                "lodash": "https://cdn.skypack.dev/lodash@4.17.21"
              }
            }
            ```
        3.  **Use Aliases:** Use aliases in your import statements for clarity and control.
        4.  **Deno's Resolution:** Deno uses the import map to resolve module locations.
        5.  **Regular Updates:** Update the import map as dependencies change.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Dependency Confusion/Substitution (High Severity):** Deno's import map, by explicitly defining module sources, prevents this.
        *   **Supply Chain Attacks (via Dependencies) (High Severity):** Provides control over module origins.
        *   **Typosquatting (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of importing similarly named malicious modules.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Dependency Confusion/Substitution: Risk significantly reduced (High to Low).
        *   Supply Chain Attacks: Risk reduced (High to Medium).
        *   Typosquatting: Risk significantly reduced (Medium to Low).

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   `import_map.json` exists and maps `std/` imports.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Not used for all third-party dependencies; needs to be expanded.
