# Threat Model Analysis for denoland/deno

## Threat: [Malicious Third-Party Module (Spoofing/Tampering)](./threats/malicious_third-party_module__spoofingtampering_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker publishes a malicious module to a public registry (e.g., deno.land/x) or compromises a legitimate module's repository. The attacker might mimic a popular module's name (typosquatting) or inject malicious code into an existing module's update. The malicious code, *leveraging Deno's URL-based import system*, could steal data, install backdoors, or perform other harmful actions. This is critical because Deno's core design relies on remote module fetching.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data breaches (credentials, sensitive information).
    *   System compromise (remote code execution).
    *   Denial of service.
    *   Cryptocurrency mining.
    *   Reputational damage.
*   **Affected Component:** Deno's module import system (URLs, `import` statements), Deno's cache. This is a *core* Deno component.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use Lock Files:** Always use `deno.lock` to pin module versions and ensure integrity. Regularly update and audit the lock file. This is crucial for mitigating Deno's URL-based imports.
    *   **Import Maps:** Use import maps to alias module URLs to specific, trusted locations, preventing typosquatting. This directly addresses the URL-based nature of Deno imports.
    *   **Vendoring:** For critical dependencies, consider vendoring (copying the source code into your project) to eliminate reliance on external servers, mitigating the risk of remote code changes.
    *   **`--check` flag:** Use `deno run --check ...` to type-check all code, including remote modules, before execution. This leverages Deno's built-in type checking.

## Threat: [Module Tampering in Cache (Tampering)](./threats/module_tampering_in_cache__tampering_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the system where Deno is running and modifies the cached module files in the `DENO_DIR`. This exploits Deno's caching mechanism, which is a core part of how it manages modules. The attacker could inject malicious code that would be executed the next time the module is loaded.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Execution of arbitrary malicious code.
    *   Data breaches.
    *   System compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** Deno's module cache (`DENO_DIR`) - a fundamental part of Deno's operation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure `DENO_DIR`:** Ensure the Deno cache directory has restrictive permissions (read-only for most users, write access only for the Deno user). This directly protects Deno's caching mechanism.
    *   **Read-Only Filesystem (Production):** If feasible, mount the cache directory as read-only in production environments. This prevents any modification of Deno's cached modules.
    *   **Immutable Deployments:** Use containerization (Docker) or other immutable deployment methods to prevent post-deployment modification of dependencies, including those in Deno's cache.

## Threat: [Unsafe `--allow-run` Usage (Elevation of Privilege)](./threats/unsafe__--allow-run__usage__elevation_of_privilege_.md)

*   **Description:** The `--allow-run` permission, *a Deno-specific feature*, is used without sufficient restrictions, allowing a malicious module to execute arbitrary commands on the host system. This is a direct exploitation of a Deno permission.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Complete system compromise (remote code execution with the privileges of the Deno process).
    *   Data breaches.
    *   Installation of malware.
*   **Affected Component:** Deno's `--allow-run` permission - a core part of Deno's security model.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid `--allow-run` if Possible:** Explore alternative solutions that don't require executing arbitrary subprocesses.
    *   **Strict Whitelisting:** If `--allow-run` is necessary, use a *whitelist* of allowed commands and arguments, rather than a blacklist. Be extremely specific. This directly controls the Deno permission.
    *   **Sandboxing:** Use containers (Docker) or other sandboxing technologies to isolate the subprocesses executed by `--allow-run`, mitigating the impact of a compromised `--allow-run` permission.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Run the Deno process with the lowest possible privileges.

## Threat: [Deno Runtime Vulnerability (Elevation of Privilege/Information Disclosure/Denial of Service)](./threats/deno_runtime_vulnerability__elevation_of_privilegeinformation_disclosuredenial_of_service_.md)

*   **Description:** A security vulnerability is discovered in the Deno runtime itself (the `deno` executable). This is a direct threat to the core of Deno. This could allow an attacker to bypass the permission system, execute arbitrary code, or cause a denial of service.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but could range from information disclosure to complete system compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** The Deno runtime itself (the `deno` executable) - the very foundation of the system.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Deno Updated:** Regularly update to the latest stable version of Deno to receive security patches. This is the primary defense against runtime vulnerabilities.
    *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Subscribe to Deno's security announcements and mailing lists.
    *   **Security Audits:** Consider professional security audits that specifically target the Deno runtime.

## Threat: [Overly Permissive Permissions (Information Disclosure/Elevation of Privilege)](./threats/overly_permissive_permissions__information_disclosureelevation_of_privilege_.md)

*    **Description:** The application is run with unnecessarily broad permissions (e.g., `--allow-all`, `--allow-read`, `--allow-env` without restrictions). A malicious module (or even a bug in your own code) can then access sensitive files, environment variables, or network resources.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data leakage (sensitive files, environment variables).
    *   Potential for privilege escalation if a module can access resources that allow it to execute arbitrary code.
*   **Affected Component:** Deno's permission system (flags like `--allow-read`, `--allow-write`, `--allow-net`, `--allow-env`, `--allow-run`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant *only* the specific permissions required. Use granular permissions (e.g., `--allow-read=/path/to/specific/file` instead of `--allow-read`).
    *   **Permission Auditing:** Regularly review and audit the permissions granted to your application.
    *   **Automated Permission Analysis:** (Future) Tools that can analyze code and suggest minimal required permissions.
    *   **Secrets Management:** Avoid storing sensitive information directly in environment variables; use a dedicated secrets management solution.
