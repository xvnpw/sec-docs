# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for denoland/deno

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege for Permissions](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_for_permissions.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Principle of Least Privilege for Permissions
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Required Deno Permissions:** For each part of your application, meticulously determine the *absolute minimum* Deno permissions needed for it to function. Consider network access (`--allow-net`), file system access (`--allow-read`, `--allow-write`), environment variables (`--allow-env`), etc., as controlled by Deno's permission flags.
    2.  **Declare Explicit Deno Permissions:** When running your Deno application, use specific permission flags instead of broad ones.  For example, instead of `--allow-net`, use `--allow-net=api.example.com:443,localhost:8000`.
    3.  **Granular File System Permissions in Deno:** For file access, use specific paths with Deno's `--allow-read` and `--allow-write`. Instead of `--allow-read`, use `--allow-read=/data/config.json,/tmp/cache`. For write access, use `--allow-write=/app/uploads`.
    4.  **Avoid `--allow-all` in Deno:** Never use `--allow-all` in production or even development unless absolutely necessary for initial prototyping and immediately remove it afterwards.
    5.  **Regular Audits of Deno Permissions:** Periodically review the Deno permissions your application requests and ensure they are still necessary and minimal. As features are added or removed, Deno permissions might need adjustment.
    6.  **Documentation of Deno Permissions:** Document the rationale behind each Deno permission granted to improve understanding and maintainability, specifically in the context of Deno's security model.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized System Access via Deno Permissions (High Severity):**  If Deno permissions are overly broad, attackers exploiting vulnerabilities can leverage these permissions to gain access to sensitive parts of the system (file system, network, environment variables) beyond what is strictly necessary, *because Deno's permission system is bypassed due to over-permissiveness*.
    *   **Data Breaches via Deno Permissions (High Severity):**  Excessive Deno read permissions can allow attackers to read sensitive data files. Excessive Deno write permissions can allow data modification or deletion, *because Deno's file system access control is weakened*.
    *   **Lateral Movement via Deno Network Permissions (Medium Severity):**  Broad Deno network permissions can facilitate lateral movement within a network if the application is compromised, *due to Deno allowing wider network access than needed*.
    *   **Privilege Escalation via Deno Permissions (Medium Severity):**  In combination with other vulnerabilities, overly permissive Deno permissions can contribute to privilege escalation attacks, *as Deno's security boundaries are weakened*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized System Access via Deno Permissions:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Data Breaches via Deno Permissions:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Lateral Movement via Deno Network Permissions:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **Privilege Escalation via Deno Permissions:** Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented in the project. We are using `--allow-net` and `--allow-read` but not with specific domains/paths in all services. Deno permissions are defined in `docker-compose.yml` and deployment scripts.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Granular Deno permissions are not consistently applied across all microservices. Need to refine Deno permission flags in `docker-compose.yml` and deployment scripts for each service to use specific domains, ports, and file paths.  Regular audits of Deno permissions are not yet a scheduled process. Documentation of Deno permission rationale is missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dependency Management and Integrity for Remote Modules](./mitigation_strategies/dependency_management_and_integrity_for_remote_modules.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Dependency Management and Integrity for Remote Modules
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Pin Dependency Versions in Deno Imports:** In all `import` statements, specify exact versions of remote modules, leveraging Deno's URL-based module system. For example, use `https://deno.land/std@0.177.0/http/server.ts` instead of `https://deno.land/std/http/server.ts`.
    2.  **Generate `deno.lock` File:**  Run `deno cache --lock=deno.lock --lock-write your_entrypoint.ts` to create a `deno.lock` file. This Deno-specific file records the exact versions and subresource integrity hashes of all remote dependencies.
    3.  **Commit `deno.lock` to Version Control:**  Commit the Deno `deno.lock` file to your version control system (e.g., Git).
    4.  **Verify `deno.lock` in Deno CI/CD:**  In your CI/CD pipeline, ensure that `deno cache --lock=deno.lock --lock-write your_entrypoint.ts` is run to verify that the dependencies match the locked versions, utilizing Deno's built-in lock file verification. Fail the build if there are discrepancies.
    5.  **Regularly Update Deno Dependencies (with Caution):** Periodically review and update Deno dependencies. When updating, carefully test your application and regenerate the `deno.lock` file using Deno's tooling.
    6.  **Module Audits (Selective for Deno Modules):** For critical remote Deno modules, consider manual code reviews or security audits, especially given the decentralized nature of Deno's module ecosystem.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks via Remote Deno Modules (High Severity):**  Compromised or malicious versions of remote Deno modules can be automatically pulled in if versions are not pinned, leading to code execution and data breaches, *exploiting Deno's remote module loading mechanism*.
    *   **Dependency Confusion in Deno's URL Imports (Medium Severity):**  If relying on module names without full URLs (less common in Deno but conceptually possible), there's a risk of accidentally importing a malicious module with the same name from a different, untrusted source, *due to the flexibility of Deno's URL imports*.
    *   **Unintentional Breaking Changes from Deno Module Updates (Medium Severity):**  Unpinned Deno dependencies can update to versions with breaking changes, causing application instability or unexpected behavior, potentially including security vulnerabilities, *due to the evolving nature of remote Deno modules*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks via Remote Deno Modules:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Dependency Confusion in Deno's URL Imports:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **Unintentional Breaking Changes from Deno Module Updates:** Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. We are using `deno.lock` file and committing it to Git. Version pinning is used for some, but not all, dependencies. CI/CD pipeline does not currently verify `deno.lock` integrity using Deno commands.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Need to enforce version pinning for *all* remote Deno dependencies across all services. Implement `deno cache --lock=deno.lock --lock-write` verification in the CI/CD pipeline to ensure `deno.lock` integrity using Deno's built-in tools.  Regular Deno dependency update and audit process needs to be established.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Handling of Unstable APIs](./mitigation_strategies/secure_handling_of_unstable_apis.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Handling of Unstable APIs
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Unstable Deno API Usage:**  Scan your codebase for usage of Deno APIs marked as unstable (often indicated in Deno documentation or type definitions).
    2.  **Minimize Unstable Deno API Usage:**  Refactor code to use stable Deno APIs whenever possible. Explore alternative approaches that avoid unstable Deno features.
    3.  **Isolate Unstable Deno Code:** If unstable Deno APIs are unavoidable, encapsulate their usage within specific modules or functions. This limits the potential impact if the unstable API changes or introduces vulnerabilities, which is more likely with Deno's unstable features.
    4.  **Thorough Testing of Unstable Deno APIs:**  Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests for code that uses unstable Deno APIs. Test for various scenarios and edge cases, as unstable Deno APIs might have less mature error handling or unexpected behavior.
    5.  **Monitoring and Logging of Unstable Deno API Usage:**  Monitor the behavior of code using unstable Deno APIs in production. Implement logging to track any unexpected errors or changes in behavior specifically related to these Deno features.
    6.  **Stay Updated with Deno Release Notes:**  Regularly check Deno release notes and changelogs for updates and changes to unstable APIs you are using. Be prepared to adapt your code if unstable Deno APIs are modified or deprecated.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unexpected Behavior/Bugs in Unstable Deno APIs (Medium Severity):** Unstable Deno APIs are more likely to have bugs or behave unexpectedly, which could lead to application errors or security vulnerabilities, *due to their experimental nature in Deno*.
    *   **API Changes/Deprecation of Unstable Deno APIs (Low Severity - Security Impact):** While not directly a security threat, changes in unstable Deno APIs can break security assumptions or require rapid code changes, potentially introducing new vulnerabilities during rushed updates, *due to Deno's development lifecycle for unstable features*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unexpected Behavior/Bugs in Unstable Deno APIs:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **API Changes/Deprecation of Unstable Deno APIs:** Low Risk Reduction (indirectly improves security by promoting stability)
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. We are aware of using some unstable Deno APIs (e.g., in certain utility functions). No systematic process for identifying, minimizing, or isolating unstable Deno API usage is in place. Testing for unstable Deno API usage is not specifically prioritized.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Need to conduct a codebase audit to identify all unstable Deno API usages. Create a policy to minimize and isolate unstable Deno API usage. Implement specific tests for code using unstable Deno APIs. Establish a process to monitor Deno release notes for changes to unstable APIs we are using.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Code Review and Security Audits for Third-Party Modules](./mitigation_strategies/code_review_and_security_audits_for_third-party_modules.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Code Review and Security Audits for Third-Party Modules
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Mandatory Code Reviews for Deno Module Integrations:**  Establish a mandatory code review process for *all* new third-party Deno module integrations. This review should specifically focus on security aspects of these remote modules.
    2.  **Security-Focused Review Checklist for Deno Modules:** Create a checklist for security reviews of Deno modules, including:
        *   Module source code analysis for potential vulnerabilities, considering the remote nature of Deno modules.
        *   Reputation and trustworthiness of the Deno module author/maintainer, as Deno's module ecosystem is decentralized.
        *   Frequency of updates and security patches for the Deno module.
        *   Permissions potentially required by the Deno module's functionality (though modules themselves don't request permissions, their usage might necessitate specific Deno permissions for your application).
        *   Known vulnerabilities reported for the Deno module or similar modules in the Deno ecosystem.
    3.  **Regular Dependency Audits for Deno Modules:**  Periodically (e.g., quarterly) conduct security audits of all third-party Deno dependencies. This can involve:
        *   Using vulnerability scanning tools (if available for Deno modules - currently limited in the Deno ecosystem).
        *   Manually checking for known vulnerabilities in Deno module dependencies, given the lack of a central Deno module vulnerability database.
        *   Reviewing Deno module changelogs and security advisories (if available from module authors).
    4.  **Vulnerability Reporting Process for Deno Modules:**  Define a clear process for reporting and addressing vulnerabilities found in third-party Deno modules. This includes:
        *   Documenting the vulnerability in the Deno module.
        *   Assessing the impact on your application using the Deno module.
        *   Developing and implementing a mitigation plan (e.g., updating the Deno module if a fix is available, patching, or removing the module).
        *   Potentially contacting the Deno module maintainer if the vulnerability is in the module itself, considering the community-driven nature of Deno modules.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Code Injection via Deno Modules (High Severity):**  Malicious code in a third-party Deno module can directly compromise your application, leading to data breaches, system takeover, etc., *due to Deno directly executing remote code*.
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Deno Module Dependencies (High/Medium Severity):**  Vulnerabilities in third-party Deno modules can be exploited by attackers to compromise your application, *because Deno applications directly rely on these modules*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Code Injection via Deno Modules:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Deno Module Dependencies:** High Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Code reviews are generally performed, but security-specific review of third-party Deno modules is not consistently enforced or formalized. No regular Deno dependency audit process is in place. Vulnerability reporting process for Deno modules is not defined.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formalize security-focused code reviews for all third-party Deno module integrations with a checklist. Implement a regular (e.g., quarterly) Deno dependency audit process. Define a clear vulnerability reporting and mitigation process for third-party Deno modules.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Usage of `Deno.Unsafe*` APIs](./mitigation_strategies/secure_usage_of__deno_unsafe__apis.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Usage of `Deno.Unsafe*` APIs
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Avoid Deno.Unsafe* APIs:**  The primary strategy is to avoid using `Deno.Unsafe*` APIs altogether unless absolutely necessary. Explore alternative, secure Deno APIs or architectural solutions that do not require bypassing Deno's security sandbox.
    2.  **Justification and Documentation for Deno.Unsafe* Usage:** If `Deno.Unsafe*` APIs are deemed necessary, thoroughly document the *reason* for their use in the context of Deno's limitations, the specific security implications of bypassing Deno's sandbox, and the mitigation measures taken to reduce risks.
    3.  **Rigorous Security Review for Deno.Unsafe* Code:** Code using `Deno.Unsafe*` APIs must undergo extremely rigorous security reviews by experienced security professionals familiar with Deno's internals and memory safety considerations. This review should focus on potential memory corruption issues, native code vulnerabilities, and security sandbox bypasses introduced by using these Deno APIs.
    4.  **Sandboxing/Isolation (If Possible) for Deno.Unsafe* Code:**  If feasible, isolate the code that uses `Deno.Unsafe*` APIs within a separate process or sandbox, *even within the Deno environment itself if possible*. This limits the potential damage if a vulnerability is exploited in the unsafe code, containing the impact within a smaller, isolated part of the Deno application.
    5.  **Minimize Scope of Deno.Unsafe* Usage:**  Keep the usage of `Deno.Unsafe*` APIs as minimal and localized as possible within the Deno application. Avoid spreading unsafe API calls throughout the codebase.
    6.  **Continuous Monitoring of Deno.Unsafe* Code:**  Monitor the behavior of code using `Deno.Unsafe*` APIs closely in production for any unexpected errors or crashes, which could indicate memory safety issues or vulnerabilities introduced by bypassing Deno's safety mechanisms.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Memory Corruption via Deno.Unsafe* APIs (High Severity):**  Incorrect usage of `Deno.Unsafe*` APIs can lead to memory corruption vulnerabilities, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution, *because these APIs bypass Deno's memory safety guarantees*.
    *   **Native Code Exploits via Deno.Unsafe* APIs (High Severity):**  If `Deno.Unsafe*` APIs are used to interact with native code (e.g., FFI), vulnerabilities in that native code can be exploited, *circumventing Deno's security sandbox*.
    *   **Security Sandbox Bypass via Deno.Unsafe* APIs (High Severity):**  Misuse of `Deno.Unsafe*` APIs can potentially bypass Deno's security sandbox, granting attackers unrestricted access to system resources, *effectively negating Deno's core security feature*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Memory Corruption via Deno.Unsafe* APIs:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Native Code Exploits via Deno.Unsafe* APIs:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Security Sandbox Bypass via Deno.Unsafe* APIs:** High Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not currently implemented. We are not actively using `Deno.Unsafe*` APIs in the project at this time. However, there is no formal policy or process to prevent or securely manage their use if they become necessary in the future within the Deno context.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Establish a strict policy against using `Deno.Unsafe*` APIs unless absolutely necessary and with explicit security review and justification within the Deno development context. Define a rigorous security review process for any code that *must* use `Deno.Unsafe*` APIs. Create documentation guidelines for justifying and documenting the use of these Deno APIs.
