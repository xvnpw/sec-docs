# Attack Surface Analysis for denoland/deno

## Attack Surface: [Bypassing Permissions System](./attack_surfaces/bypassing_permissions_system.md)

**Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in Deno's permission checking mechanism to gain unauthorized access to system resources.

**Deno Contribution:** Deno's core security model is built around its permission system. Flaws directly undermine this security.

**Example:** A vulnerability in Deno's file system permission check allows a script with `--allow-read=/tmp` to read files outside of `/tmp`.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, system compromise, privilege escalation.

**Risk Severity:** **Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Deno updated to the latest version for security patches.
*   Thoroughly test permission boundaries during development.
*   Report suspected permission bypass vulnerabilities to the Deno security team.

## Attack Surface: [Permission Escalation](./attack_surfaces/permission_escalation.md)

**Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities within Deno itself to escalate initially granted permissions to a higher level of access.

**Deno Contribution:** Vulnerabilities in Deno's runtime can allow attackers to bypass intended permission restrictions.

**Example:** A bug in Deno's runtime allows a script with `--allow-read` to escalate to full `--allow-all` permissions.

**Impact:** Complete circumvention of Deno's security model, leading to full system access.

**Risk Severity:** **Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Deno updated to the latest version.
*   Implement robust input validation to prevent exploitation of potential Deno vulnerabilities.
*   Run Deno applications in sandboxed environments to limit escalation impact.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Code in Remote Modules](./attack_surfaces/malicious_code_in_remote_modules.md)

**Description:** Importing and executing code from compromised or malicious URLs.

**Deno Contribution:** Deno directly fetches and executes code from URLs, trusting the source.

**Example:** A developer imports a module from a compromised server, unknowingly executing malicious code.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, data theft, backdoors, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly vet and trust sources of imported modules.
*   Regularly audit dependencies and their sources.
*   Consider code review and static analysis of imported modules.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Transports (HTTP for Modules)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_transports__http_for_modules_.md)

**Description:** Fetching modules over unencrypted HTTP, enabling man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Deno Contribution:** Deno allows HTTP module fetching, though HTTPS is recommended.

**Example:** MITM attack injects malicious code when a Deno app fetches a module over HTTP.

**Impact:** Compromising the application by injecting malicious code during dependency resolution.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Always use HTTPS for module imports.**
*   Enforce HTTPS-only module fetching policies.
*   Use secure network environments to minimize MITM risks.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Built-in Modules](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_built-in_modules.md)

**Description:** Bugs or security flaws within Deno's core built-in modules.

**Deno Contribution:** Deno's built-in modules are core functionality; vulnerabilities directly impact applications.

**Example:** Buffer overflow in `Deno.fs.readFile` allows code execution via crafted file path.

**Impact:** Denial of service, information disclosure, remote code execution within Deno runtime.

**Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Deno updated to the latest version.
*   Report suspected vulnerabilities in built-in modules.
*   Implement input validation when using built-in modules.

## Attack Surface: [Unsafe Native Code Execution (FFI)](./attack_surfaces/unsafe_native_code_execution__ffi_.md)

**Description:** Using Deno's FFI to interact with untrusted or vulnerable native libraries.

**Deno Contribution:** Deno's FFI bypasses the security sandbox if misused with untrusted native code.

**Example:** Deno app uses FFI to call a native library with a buffer overflow, enabling arbitrary code execution.

**Impact:** Full system compromise, bypassing Deno's security sandbox.

**Risk Severity:** **Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Avoid FFI unless absolutely necessary.**
*   Thoroughly vet native libraries used with FFI.
*   Apply strict input validation before passing data to native functions.
*   Run FFI-using apps in highly isolated environments.

## Attack Surface: [FFI API Misuse](./attack_surfaces/ffi_api_misuse.md)

**Description:** Incorrectly using the FFI API, leading to memory corruption or unexpected behavior.

**Deno Contribution:** FFI API complexity increases risk of developer errors leading to vulnerabilities.

**Example:** Incorrect data type specification in FFI call leads to memory corruption and exploitable crash.

**Impact:** Denial of service, information disclosure, potentially exploitable memory corruption.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly understand FFI API and native library requirements.
*   Use static analysis and testing to detect FFI usage errors.
*   Implement robust error handling and boundary checks when using FFI.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in V8 Engine](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_v8_engine.md)

**Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the underlying V8 JavaScript engine.

**Deno Contribution:** Deno relies on V8, inheriting its security vulnerabilities.

**Example:** Zero-day in V8 allows code execution via malicious JavaScript in Deno.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, sandbox escapes, critical security issues.

**Risk Severity:** **Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Deno updated to include patched V8 versions.
*   Implement robust input validation to minimize V8 vulnerability attack surface.
*   Run Deno apps with sandboxing or containerization.

## Attack Surface: [Deno Runtime Bugs](./attack_surfaces/deno_runtime_bugs.md)

**Description:** Bugs and security flaws within the Deno runtime itself (written in Rust).

**Deno Contribution:** Vulnerabilities in Deno's core runtime directly impact all applications.

**Example:** Memory safety vulnerability in Deno runtime allows sandbox escape and host system control.

**Impact:** Sandbox escapes, privilege escalation, denial of service for all Deno apps.

**Risk Severity:** **Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Deno updated to the latest version.
*   Report suspected runtime vulnerabilities to the Deno security team.
*   Run Deno apps in isolated environments to limit runtime vulnerability impact.

## Attack Surface: [Supply Chain Attacks on Deno Executable](./attack_surfaces/supply_chain_attacks_on_deno_executable.md)

**Description:** Compromising the Deno executable during build or distribution.

**Deno Contribution:** Compromised Deno runtime puts all applications at risk.

**Example:** Attacker injects malicious code into official Deno executable distribution.

**Impact:** Widespread compromise of Deno applications via malicious runtime.

**Risk Severity:** **Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Download Deno from official, trusted sources.
*   Verify executable integrity using checksums/signatures.
*   Implement secure software supply chain practices.
