# Threat Model Analysis for denoland/deno

## Threat: [Overly Permissive Permissions](./threats/overly_permissive_permissions.md)

**Description:** Attacker exploits a vulnerability in the application. Due to overly broad permissions granted to the Deno process (e.g., `--allow-net`, `--allow-read`), the attacker can leverage these permissions to perform unauthorized actions. For example, if `--allow-net` is too broad, the attacker can access internal networks or external services beyond what is necessary. If `--allow-read` is too broad, they can read sensitive files on the server.

**Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access to internal resources, lateral movement within the network, service disruption.

**Deno Component Affected:** Permissions Model, Deno CLI flags (`--allow-*`)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Apply the principle of least privilege when granting permissions.
* Specify granular permissions (e.g., `--allow-net=api.example.com`, `--allow-read=/app/data`).
* Regularly review and audit granted permissions.
* Use tooling to analyze required permissions.

## Threat: [Permission Bypass](./threats/permission_bypass.md)

**Description:** Attacker discovers and exploits a vulnerability within Deno's permission checking logic itself. This allows them to bypass intended permission restrictions and gain unauthorized access to system resources or functionalities, even if permissions were intended to be restrictive.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of Deno's security model, unauthorized access to any resource Deno can access, potentially leading to full system compromise.

**Deno Component Affected:** Permissions Model, Deno Runtime, V8 Engine

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep Deno runtime updated to the latest stable version.
* Monitor Deno security advisories and apply updates promptly.
* Report suspected permission bypass vulnerabilities to the Deno security team.

## Threat: [Malicious Remote Modules](./threats/malicious_remote_modules.md)

**Description:** Attacker compromises a remote module repository or CDN that the Deno application depends on. They inject malicious code into the module. When the application imports this compromised module, the malicious code is executed within the application's context. This is amplified by Deno's default module loading mechanism from URLs.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, data theft, service disruption, supply chain compromise.

**Deno Component Affected:** Module System, Remote Module Loading, `import` statements

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Pin module versions in `deno.json` or import statements.
* Use dependency lock files (`deno.lock.json`).
* Prefer reputable module sources and CDNs.
* Regularly audit dependencies and their sources.
* Use dependency scanning tools.

## Threat: [`Deno.run` Command Injection](./threats/_deno_run__command_injection.md)

**Description:** Attacker injects malicious commands into input that is used to construct a command string for `Deno.run`. When `Deno.run` executes this command, the attacker's injected commands are executed on the server.

**Impact:** Arbitrary command execution, full system compromise, data theft, service disruption.

**Deno Component Affected:** `Deno.run` API

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid using `Deno.run` if possible.
* Strictly validate and sanitize all input used with `Deno.run`.
* Use parameterized commands or safe command construction libraries.
* Apply the principle of least privilege to the Deno process user.

## Threat: [`Deno.ffi` Misuse and Native Library Vulnerabilities](./threats/_deno_ffi__misuse_and_native_library_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Attacker exploits vulnerabilities in native libraries called via `Deno.ffi` or misuses `Deno.ffi` API in a way that leads to security issues. This could involve calling vulnerable native functions, passing incorrect data types, or causing memory corruption.

**Impact:** Vulnerabilities inherited from native libraries, crashes, memory corruption, security breaches.

**Deno Component Affected:** `Deno.ffi` API, Native Libraries

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully vet and select native libraries.
* Keep native libraries updated.
* Thoroughly understand native library APIs and security implications.
* Implement robust input validation for `Deno.ffi` calls.
* Consider sandboxing native library interactions.

## Threat: [Sandbox Escape (Deno Runtime)](./threats/sandbox_escape__deno_runtime_.md)

**Description:** Attacker discovers and exploits a vulnerability in the Deno runtime's sandbox itself, allowing them to escape the sandbox and gain access to the underlying system.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the Deno runtime environment, potentially full system access.

**Deno Component Affected:** Deno Runtime, V8 Engine, Sandbox Isolation

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep Deno runtime updated.
* Rely on Deno security team's efforts.
* Consider OS-level security measures (containerization, virtualization) in sensitive environments.
