## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Deno Permissions Model [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_deno_permissions_model__critical_node_.md)

*   **Runtime Vulnerability in Permission System [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting a bug in Deno's core runtime code that handles permission checks. This could involve:
        *   Memory corruption vulnerabilities (buffer overflows, use-after-free) in the Rust code responsible for permission enforcement.
        *   Logic flaws in the permission granting or revoking mechanisms, allowing bypass of intended security boundaries.
    *   **Impact:** Complete bypass of Deno's permission sandbox, allowing unrestricted access to system resources and capabilities.

*   **Initial Permission Misconfiguration [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Application Starts with Overly Broad Permissions [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** The application is intentionally or unintentionally configured to run with excessive permissions from the start.
            *   **Developer Error in Permission Configuration [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Developers mistakenly grant unnecessary permissions (e.g., `--allow-net`, `--allow-read`, `--allow-write`, `--allow-env`, `--allow-run`, `--allow-hrtime`, `--allow-ffi`) during development or deployment.
            *   **Default Configuration is Insecure:**  Templates, examples, or initial project setups might inadvertently suggest or use insecure default permission configurations.
    *   **Impact:**  Reduces the effectiveness of Deno's permission-based security, expanding the attack surface and potential damage from other vulnerabilities (e.g., in dependencies or application logic).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Deno Dependency Management (URL-Based Imports) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_deno_dependency_management__url-based_imports___critical_node_.md)

*   **Supply Chain Attack via Dependency Repository [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Compromising the source of a Deno dependency hosted at a URL.
        *   **Compromise Hosting of Dependency URL (e.g., GitHub account, personal server) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Attackers gain control of the server or account hosting the dependency code.
        *   **Inject Malicious Code into Legitimate Dependency at Source [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Attackers modify the legitimate dependency code at its source repository (e.g., by compromising developer accounts, exploiting repository vulnerabilities).
    *   **Impact:**  Injection of malicious code into the application through a trusted dependency, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE), data theft, or other malicious activities.

*   **Malicious Dependency Injection [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Import Malicious Module from Untrusted Source [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Developers are tricked or misled into importing and using a deliberately malicious Deno module.
            *   **Developer Imports from Unverified/Compromised URL [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Developers import modules from untrusted or compromised URLs without proper verification.
            *   **Typosquatting/Similar Domain Name for Dependency URL [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Attackers register domain names similar to legitimate dependency URLs to host malicious modules, hoping developers will make typos or be deceived.
    *   **Impact:** Direct execution of malicious code within the application's context, potentially leading to RCE, data theft, or other malicious activities.

*   **Vulnerable Dependency [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Use Dependency with Known Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** The application uses a Deno dependency that contains publicly known security vulnerabilities.
            *   **Outdated Dependency with Publicly Disclosed Vulnerability [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Developers fail to update dependencies, leaving known vulnerabilities unpatched.
    *   **Impact:** Exploitation of known vulnerabilities in dependencies to compromise the application, potentially leading to RCE, data theft, or other malicious activities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Deno Runtime or Standard Library Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_deno_runtime_or_standard_library_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Deno Runtime Vulnerability [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities directly within the Deno runtime itself. This could include:
        *   Memory corruption bugs (buffer overflows, use-after-free) in the core Rust runtime code.
        *   Logic flaws in the runtime's JavaScript/TypeScript execution engine or security sandboxing mechanisms.
    *   **Impact:**  Potentially critical, leading to sandbox escape, Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server, or denial of service.

*   **Standard Library Vulnerability [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities within Deno's standard library modules (e.g., `std/http`, `std/fs`, `std/encoding`). This could include:
        *   Buffer overflows or injection vulnerabilities in standard library code.
        *   Logic flaws in standard library APIs that can be misused to cause security issues.
    *   **Impact:**  Depends on the vulnerable module, but could range from denial of service to Remote Code Execution (RCE) or data manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Deno Configuration and Deployment [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_deno_configuration_and_deployment__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Insecure Flags/Options [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Running the Deno application with insecure command-line flags or options.
        *   **Running Deno with `--allow-all` or other overly permissive flags in production [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**  Developers mistakenly or intentionally use `--allow-all` or other flags that grant excessive permissions in production environments.
        *   **Disabling Security Features via Command-Line Options [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**  Developers use flags to disable important security features of Deno, such as permission checks or secure TLS settings.
    *   **Impact:**  Completely negates Deno's security model, allowing unrestricted access to system resources and capabilities, similar to running without any sandbox.

*   **Insecure Deployment Environment [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Weak Host OS Security [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** The underlying operating system hosting the Deno application is not properly secured. This includes:
            *   Unpatched OS vulnerabilities.
            *   Weak access controls and user permissions.
            *   Missing security configurations (e.g., firewalls, intrusion detection).
    *   **Impact:**  Compromise of the host OS can lead to compromise of the Deno application and potentially other applications or systems on the same host.

    *   **Network Misconfigurations allowing unauthorized access to Deno process [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Network configurations allow unauthorized access to the Deno application or its internal services. This includes:
            *   Exposing Deno application ports directly to the public internet without proper firewalls or access controls.
            *   Misconfigured network segmentation allowing lateral movement within the network.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to the Deno application, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or further attacks on internal systems.
