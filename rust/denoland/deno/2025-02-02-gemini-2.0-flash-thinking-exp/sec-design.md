  - security control: Permission-based security model, requiring explicit permissions for file system access, network access, and environment variables.
  - security control: Built-in security review process for code contributions (implied by open-source nature and project maturity).
  - security control: Usage of standard cryptographic libraries in Rust ecosystem.
  - security control: Regular updates and security patches (implied by active development).
  - security control: Input validation and sanitization within standard library functions (where applicable).
  - security control: Dependency management and supply chain security through curated and audited dependencies in Rust ecosystem.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on third-party libraries and modules, which may introduce vulnerabilities.
  - accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities in V8 JavaScript engine, which is a dependency.
  - accepted risk: Security misconfigurations by end-users when deploying and configuring Deno applications.

- Recommended Security Controls:

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: Deno runtime itself does not require authentication as it is an execution environment.
    - Requirement: Applications built with Deno should implement appropriate authentication mechanisms based on their specific needs (e.g., OAuth 2.0, JWT, API keys).
    - Requirement: Deno standard library should provide secure and easy-to-use APIs for implementing authentication in applications.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Deno's permission model should enforce fine-grained authorization for system resources (file system, network, environment variables, etc.).
    - Requirement: Applications built with Deno should implement application-level authorization to control access to specific functionalities and data based on user roles and permissions.
    - Requirement: Deno standard library should provide secure and flexible APIs for implementing authorization logic in applications.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Deno runtime and standard library APIs should perform robust input validation to prevent common vulnerabilities like injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection, cross-site scripting).
    - Requirement: Deno should encourage and facilitate developers to implement input validation in their applications.
    - Requirement: Provide clear documentation and examples on how to perform secure input validation in Deno applications.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Deno standard library should provide secure and well-vetted cryptographic APIs for common cryptographic operations (e.g., hashing, encryption, digital signatures).
    - Requirement: Ensure that cryptographic APIs are easy to use correctly and discourage insecure cryptographic practices.
    - Requirement: Keep cryptographic libraries up-to-date with the latest security standards and best practices.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Secure execution of JavaScript and TypeScript code is the core critical business process. Any vulnerability that allows code execution outside of the permission sandbox or bypasses security controls is a critical risk.
  - Availability and integrity of the Deno runtime itself. If the runtime is unavailable or compromised, applications built on Deno will be affected.
  - Secure module loading and dependency management. Compromised modules or supply chain attacks can introduce vulnerabilities into Deno applications.

- Data Sensitivity:
  - Deno runtime itself does not directly handle sensitive user data. However, applications built with Deno can handle various types of data, including sensitive user data, depending on their functionality.
  - Sensitivity of data handled by Deno applications depends entirely on the application's purpose and data processing logic. It can range from publicly available data to highly confidential personal or financial information.
  - The security of Deno runtime is crucial for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data processed by applications built on Deno.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What are the specific SAST/DAST tools currently used in the Deno CI/CD pipeline?
  - Is there a formal vulnerability disclosure program in place for Deno?
  - Are there regular penetration tests or security audits conducted for the Deno runtime?
  - What are the specific security guidelines and best practices recommended for Deno application developers?
  - What is the process for handling security incidents and releasing security patches for Deno?
