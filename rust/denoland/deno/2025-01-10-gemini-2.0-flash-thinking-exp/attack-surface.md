# Attack Surface Analysis for denoland/deno

## Attack Surface: [Permission Bypasses](./attack_surfaces/permission_bypasses.md)

* **Description:** Vulnerabilities in Deno's permission system allow attackers to perform actions that should be restricted based on the granted permissions.
    * **How Deno Contributes:** Deno's core security model relies on its permission system. Flaws in its implementation directly undermine this security.
    * **Example:** A bug in permission checking allows a script with only network access to read arbitrary files using `Deno.readTextFile`.
    * **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of files, execution of arbitrary commands, network access to internal resources.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep Deno runtime updated to benefit from security patches.
        * Carefully review and grant only the necessary permissions to scripts.
        * Utilize static analysis tools to identify potential permission-related vulnerabilities.
        * Employ robust input validation to prevent malicious input from influencing permission checks.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in `Deno.serve`](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in__deno_serve_.md)

* **Description:** Security flaws within Deno's built-in HTTP server (`Deno.serve`) can be exploited by attackers.
    * **How Deno Contributes:** `Deno.serve` is a core feature for building web applications, making it a direct entry point for network-based attacks.
    * **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability in the HTTP request parsing logic of `Deno.serve` allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code by sending a crafted request.
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Stay updated with Deno releases to patch known vulnerabilities in `Deno.serve`.
        * Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all data handled by the server.
        * Consider using a reverse proxy in front of `Deno.serve` for added security features and protection against common web attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Confusion](./attack_surfaces/dependency_confusion.md)

* **Description:** An attacker registers a malicious package with the same name as an internal or private dependency, causing the application to download and execute the attacker's code.
    * **How Deno Contributes:** Deno's reliance on remote modules fetched via URLs makes it susceptible if module resolution isn't carefully managed.
    * **Example:** An application depends on `https://example.com/internal-module.ts`. An attacker registers a public module with the same name, and due to misconfiguration or vulnerability, the application fetches the malicious public module instead.
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution, data theft, supply chain compromise.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Use specific versioning for dependencies to avoid pulling in unexpected changes.
        * Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity and source of fetched modules (e.g., using lock files or checksums).
        * Host internal modules on a private registry or use specific URLs that are difficult to guess.

## Attack Surface: [WebAssembly (Wasm) Escape Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/webassembly__wasm__escape_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Bugs in Deno's Wasm runtime allow malicious Wasm modules to break out of the sandbox and execute arbitrary code on the host.
    * **How Deno Contributes:** Deno's support for Wasm introduces the complexity of sandboxing and managing the execution of potentially untrusted native code.
    * **Example:** A vulnerability in the Wasm memory management within Deno allows a crafted Wasm module to overwrite memory outside of its allocated space, leading to code execution.
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution, system compromise.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep Deno updated to benefit from security patches in the Wasm runtime.
        * Carefully vet and trust the source of Wasm modules.
        * Limit the permissions granted to the Deno process running Wasm modules.

## Attack Surface: [Foreign Function Interface (FFI) / Native Plugins - Loading Malicious Libraries](./attack_surfaces/foreign_function_interface__ffi___native_plugins_-_loading_malicious_libraries.md)

* **Description:** An application using FFI can be tricked into loading and executing malicious native libraries.
    * **How Deno Contributes:** Deno's FFI allows interaction with native code, which, if not handled securely, can introduce significant vulnerabilities.
    * **Example:** An attacker can manipulate the path used in `Deno.dlopen` to point to a malicious shared library, which is then loaded and executed by the Deno process.
    * **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, system compromise.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Load native libraries from trusted and known locations only.
        * Implement strict input validation for any paths or library names used in FFI calls.
        * Consider using code signing to verify the integrity of native libraries.
        * Minimize the use of FFI if possible, opting for safer alternatives.

## Attack Surface: [Embedding Sensitive Data in Compiled Executables](./attack_surfaces/embedding_sensitive_data_in_compiled_executables.md)

* **Description:** Sensitive information like API keys or credentials are inadvertently included in the compiled Deno executable.
    * **How Deno Contributes:** The `deno compile` feature creates standalone executables, and developers might unintentionally embed sensitive data during this process.
    * **Example:** A developer hardcodes an API key in the source code, and this key is present in the compiled executable, which can be extracted by an attacker.
    * **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, unauthorized access to services.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in the source code.
        * Use environment variables or secure configuration management for sensitive data.
        * Consider encrypting sensitive data within the application and decrypting it at runtime.

## Attack Surface: [V8 Engine Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/v8_engine_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Security flaws in the underlying V8 JavaScript engine can be exploited to compromise Deno applications.
    * **How Deno Contributes:** Deno relies directly on the V8 engine for JavaScript execution, inheriting any of its vulnerabilities.
    * **Example:** A vulnerability in V8's garbage collection mechanism is exploited through carefully crafted JavaScript code, leading to remote code execution within the Deno process.
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep Deno updated, as Deno releases typically include updates to the V8 engine with security patches.
        * Be mindful of the complexity of JavaScript code and potential interactions that could trigger V8 vulnerabilities (though this is generally outside direct developer control).

## Attack Surface: [Unvalidated URLs in `fetch` leading to SSRF](./attack_surfaces/unvalidated_urls_in__fetch__leading_to_ssrf.md)

* **Description:** An application uses the `fetch` API with user-controlled input for the URL without proper validation, allowing an attacker to make requests to internal or external resources on behalf of the server.
    * **How Deno Contributes:** Deno's built-in `fetch` API is a powerful tool for making network requests, but it needs careful handling of user-provided URLs.
    * **Example:** A user provides a URL through a form, and the application uses `fetch(userProvidedUrl)` without validating that the URL points to an allowed external resource. An attacker can provide a URL to an internal service (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/admin`) to access restricted resources.
    * **Impact:** Access to internal resources, information disclosure, potential for further attacks on internal systems.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strict validation and sanitization of all user-provided URLs used with `fetch`.
        * Use allowlists of permitted domains or IP ranges for outbound requests.
        * Avoid directly using user input to construct fetch URLs.
        * Consider using a proxy service to control and monitor outbound requests.
