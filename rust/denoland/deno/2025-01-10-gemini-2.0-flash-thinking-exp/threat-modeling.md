# Threat Model Analysis for denoland/deno

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in `Deno` Namespace APIs](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in__deno__namespace_apis.md)

**Description:** Attackers discover and exploit security vulnerabilities within the built-in `Deno` namespace APIs (e.g., `Deno.readTextFile`, `Deno.run`, `Deno.serve`). This could allow them to perform actions that are normally restricted by the permission system or gain unauthorized access to system resources. For instance, a vulnerability in `Deno.run` might allow command injection even with restricted permissions.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, privilege escalation, data breaches, denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Specific functions within the `Deno` namespace (e.g., `Deno.readTextFile`, `Deno.run`, `Deno.serve`).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:** Keep the Deno runtime updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches. Follow secure coding practices when using `Deno` APIs, validating inputs and handling errors appropriately. Subscribe to Deno security advisories and promptly apply updates.

## Threat: [Running with `--allow-all` in Production](./threats/running_with__--allow-all__in_production.md)

**Description:** Developers might mistakenly or intentionally deploy a Deno application to a production environment with the `--allow-all` flag enabled. This completely disables Deno's permission system, allowing the application to perform any operation without restriction.

**Impact:** Complete system compromise, data breaches, unauthorized access to any resource the application's user has access to.

**Affected Component:** Deno's Permission System (specifically the `--allow-all` flag).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**  **Never use `--allow-all` in production environments.** Implement strict configuration management and deployment pipelines that prevent the use of this flag. Enforce the principle of least privilege through explicit permission settings.

## Threat: [Overly Permissive Permissions](./threats/overly_permissive_permissions.md)

**Description:** An attacker, having compromised part of the application or exploiting a vulnerability, can leverage excessively broad permissions granted to the Deno process to access sensitive resources (files, network, environment variables) beyond the intended scope. For example, if `--allow-read` is granted without specifying a directory, the attacker could read any file on the system.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized modifications to the system, exfiltration of sensitive information, potential for further attacks by leveraging access to system resources.

**Affected Component:** Deno's Permission System (specifically the `--allow-*` flags).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Apply the principle of least privilege. Grant only the necessary permissions required for the specific functionality. Specify directory or network restrictions where possible (e.g., `--allow-read=/app/data`, `--allow-net=api.example.com`). Regularly review and restrict permissions.

## Threat: [Abuse of Powerful `Deno` APIs](./threats/abuse_of_powerful__deno__apis.md)

**Description:** Even without explicit vulnerabilities, the powerful nature of certain `Deno` APIs can be abused if not used carefully. For example, `Deno.run` allows executing external commands. If an application uses this with unsanitized user input, it could lead to command injection. Similarly, `Deno.writeFile` with a dynamically generated path could be exploited to write to arbitrary locations.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, file system manipulation, potential for system compromise.

**Affected Component:** Powerful functions within the `Deno` namespace (e.g., `Deno.run`, `Deno.writeFile`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Minimize the use of highly privileged APIs. Sanitize and validate all inputs before passing them to such APIs. Implement the principle of least privilege even within the application's code, limiting the scope of operations. Consider sandboxing or containerizing the Deno application.

## Threat: [Insecure Handling of Environment Variables](./threats/insecure_handling_of_environment_variables.md)

**Description:** Sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, or other secrets might be stored in environment variables. If the Deno process is compromised or if the hosting environment is insecure, these environment variables could be exposed to attackers.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, leading to unauthorized access to external services or data breaches.

**Affected Component:** Deno's access to environment variables (`Deno.env`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Avoid storing highly sensitive information directly in environment variables. Consider using secure secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, cloud provider secret managers). Ensure proper access controls on the hosting environment.
