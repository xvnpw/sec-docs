## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Permission Model [CRITICAL]:](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_permission_model__critical_.md)

*   **High-Risk Path: Bypass Permission Checks:**
    *   **Attack Vector: Exploit Flaws in Permission Request Logic [CRITICAL]:**
        *   Attackers analyze the application's code that requests permissions.
        *   They look for logical errors or oversights in how permissions are requested, checked, or granted.
        *   Exploiting these flaws can allow them to perform actions requiring permissions without actually having them.
    *   **Attack Vector: Exploit Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]:**
        *   Attackers exploit the time gap between when a permission is checked and when the action requiring that permission is performed.
        *   They manipulate the system state during this gap to revoke the permission after the check but before the action, or vice versa, leading to unauthorized operations.
    *   **Attack Vector: Exploit Bugs in Deno Core Permission Implementation [CRITICAL]:**
        *   Attackers discover and exploit vulnerabilities within Deno's core permission handling mechanisms.
        *   This could involve finding bugs in the permission checking code itself, allowing them to bypass the entire system.
*   **High-Risk Path: Abuse Granted Permissions:**
    *   **Attack Vector: Exploit Overly Broad Permissions [CRITICAL]:**
        *   Developers grant more permissions than strictly necessary for the application to function.
        *   Attackers leverage these excessive permissions to perform actions beyond the intended scope, such as accessing sensitive files or making unauthorized network requests.
    *   **Attack Vector: Exploit Insecure Handling of Resource Identifiers (e.g., file paths) [CRITICAL]:**
        *   The application uses granted file system permissions but doesn't properly sanitize or validate user-provided file paths.
        *   Attackers can provide malicious paths (e.g., using ".." for path traversal) to access files outside the intended directories, even with seemingly appropriate file system permissions granted.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Module Loading Mechanism [CRITICAL]:](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_module_loading_mechanism__critical_.md)

*   **High-Risk Path: Dependency Confusion Attack [CRITICAL]:**
    *   Attackers publish a malicious package with the same name as an internal dependency used by the Deno application.
    *   If Deno's module resolution prioritizes the attacker's public package over the intended private one, the malicious code gets downloaded and executed.
*   **Critical Node: Supply Chain Attack on Dependencies [CRITICAL]:**
    *   Attackers compromise a legitimate third-party dependency used by the Deno application.
    *   They inject malicious code into the compromised dependency, which then gets included in the application's build and runtime, affecting all users.
*   **High-Risk Path: Remote Code Inclusion via Unvalidated Imports [CRITICAL]:**
    *   The Deno application imports modules directly from remote URLs without proper validation of the source or content.
    *   Attackers can manipulate the import paths or compromise the remote server hosting the module to inject malicious code that gets executed when the application loads the module.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Deno-Specific APIs [CRITICAL]:](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_deno-specific_apis__critical_.md)

*   **High-Risk Path: File System Access Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Attack Vector: Path Traversal via `Deno.readTextFile`, `Deno.writeFile`, etc. [CRITICAL]:**
        *   The application uses Deno's file system APIs (`Deno.readTextFile`, `Deno.writeFile`, etc.) with file paths derived from user input without proper sanitization.
        *   Attackers can inject special characters (like "..") into the file paths to navigate outside the intended directories and access or modify arbitrary files on the system.
*   **High-Risk Path: Network Access Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Attack Vector: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via `fetch` API [CRITICAL]:**
        *   The application uses Deno's `fetch` API to make requests to URLs that are partially or fully controlled by user input.
        *   Attackers can manipulate these URLs to force the application to make requests to internal network resources or external services that the attacker wouldn't normally have access to, potentially exposing sensitive information or performing unauthorized actions.
*   **High-Risk Path: Process Control Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Attack Vector: Command Injection via `Deno.Command` [CRITICAL]:**
        *   The application uses Deno's `Deno.Command` API to execute external commands, and the arguments to these commands are constructed using user-provided input without proper sanitization.
        *   Attackers can inject malicious commands into the input, which will then be executed by the server with the privileges of the Deno process, potentially leading to complete system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit `deno compile` or `deno run` Processes [CRITICAL]:](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit__deno_compile__or__deno_run__processes__critical_.md)

*   **Critical Node: Exploiting Vulnerabilities in the `deno compile` Process [CRITICAL]:**
    *   **Attack Vector: Code Injection during Compilation [CRITICAL]:**
        *   Attackers compromise the build environment or the compilation process itself.
        *   They inject malicious code that gets embedded into the compiled application binary during the `deno compile` step, ensuring its execution when the application runs.
*   **Critical Node: Exploiting Vulnerabilities in the `deno run` Environment [CRITICAL]:**
    *   **Attack Vector: Exploiting Bugs in the Deno Runtime Environment [CRITICAL]:**
        *   Attackers discover and exploit vulnerabilities within the Deno runtime environment itself.
        *   These vulnerabilities could allow them to bypass security measures, gain unauthorized access, or cause the application to crash or behave unexpectedly.
