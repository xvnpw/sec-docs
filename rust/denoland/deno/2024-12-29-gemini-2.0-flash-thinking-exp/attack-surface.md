*   **Attack Surface: Permission Bypasses**
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in Deno's permission system that allow code to perform actions (e.g., accessing the network, file system, environment variables) without the necessary permissions being granted.
    *   **How Deno Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Deno's core security model relies on its permission system. Flaws in its implementation directly undermine this security, allowing for privilege escalation within the Deno runtime.
    *   **Example:** A logic error in the permission checking code could allow a script to write to a file even if the `--allow-write` flag for that specific path was not provided.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of files, execution of arbitrary commands, network access to internal resources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly audit and test permission-checking logic within Deno's codebase.
        *   Implement robust unit and integration tests specifically targeting permission boundaries.
        *   Encourage users to run Deno programs with the least necessary permissions.
        *   Provide clear documentation and examples on how to correctly use the permission flags.

*   **Attack Surface: Malicious Third-Party Modules via Unverified Imports**
    *   **Description:**  Introducing vulnerabilities or malicious code into the application by importing untrusted or compromised third-party modules directly via URLs.
    *   **How Deno Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Deno's direct URL-based module import system, while convenient, increases the risk of importing code from potentially malicious sources without a central registry or vetting process.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could compromise a server hosting a popular Deno module and inject malicious code. Applications importing this module directly from the compromised URL would then execute the malicious code.
    *   **Impact:**  Remote code execution, data exfiltration, supply chain attacks, compromise of the application and potentially the host system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully vet all third-party modules before importing them.
        *   Use specific versioning in import URLs to avoid unexpected updates with malicious code.
        *   Consider using `deno vendor` to create local copies of dependencies, reducing reliance on external sources at runtime.
        *   Implement code review processes for all imported modules.
        *   Utilize import maps to manage and potentially restrict the sources of modules.

*   **Attack Surface: Command Injection via `Deno.run`**
    *   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities arising from using `Deno.run` to execute external commands with untrusted input, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary commands.
    *   **How Deno Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `Deno.run` provides a powerful mechanism to interact with the underlying operating system. If not used carefully, it can become a direct pathway for command injection attacks.
    *   **Example:** An application takes user input for a filename and uses `Deno.run` to execute a command like `cat <user_input>`. An attacker could input `; rm -rf /` to execute a destructive command.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the host system, data deletion, unauthorized access, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using `Deno.run` with untrusted input whenever possible.
        *   If `Deno.run` is necessary, meticulously sanitize and validate all input parameters.
        *   Use parameterized commands or libraries that offer safer ways to interact with the operating system.
        *   Run Deno processes with minimal privileges to limit the impact of command injection.

*   **Attack Surface: Native Plugin/FFI Vulnerabilities**
    *   **Description:** Security flaws within native plugins (written in languages like Rust) or insecure usage of Deno's Foreign Function Interface (FFI) to interact with native libraries.
    *   **How Deno Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Deno allows extending its functionality with native code for performance or access to system-level features. Vulnerabilities in this native code or its interaction with Deno can bypass the JavaScript sandbox.
    *   **Example:** A native plugin has a buffer overflow vulnerability that can be triggered by providing specially crafted input from the Deno application.
    *   **Impact:** Memory corruption, arbitrary code execution outside the Deno sandbox, system crashes, privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly audit and test all native plugins for security vulnerabilities.
        *   Follow secure coding practices when developing native plugins, including memory safety and input validation.
        *   Minimize the use of FFI if possible, opting for safer alternatives.
        *   Carefully review and understand the security implications of any native libraries used via FFI.

*   **Attack Surface: Import Map Manipulation**
    *   **Description:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in how import maps are managed or updated to redirect module imports to malicious sources.
    *   **How Deno Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Deno's import map feature allows for customizing module resolution. If the import map itself can be manipulated by an attacker, they can control which code is executed.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the server hosting the import map configuration file and modifies it to point a commonly used module to a malicious version.
    *   **Impact:**  Execution of arbitrary code, data theft, supply chain attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the storage and delivery of import map files.
        *   Implement strict access controls for modifying import maps.
        *   Use integrity checks (e.g., hashes) to verify the authenticity of import map files.
        *   Consider embedding import maps directly in the application if the configuration is static.
