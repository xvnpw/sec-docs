## Focused Attack Tree: High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes

**Title:** Focused Attack Tree for Compromising a Deno Application

**Goal:** Compromise Deno Application

**Sub-Tree:**

* Compromise Deno Application *** CRITICAL NODE ***
    * Exploit Deno's Permission Model *** CRITICAL NODE ***
        * Exploit Insufficiently Granular Permissions *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***
            * Application granted a broad permission (e.g., `--allow-net`) *** CRITICAL NODE ***
            * Attacker leverages this broad permission for malicious purposes *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***
                * Abuse allowed network access to exfiltrate data *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***
                * Abuse allowed file system access to read sensitive files *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***
                * Abuse allowed file system access to write malicious files *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***
                * Abuse allowed environment access to retrieve secrets *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***
    * Exploit Vulnerabilities in Deno's Core Runtime *** CRITICAL NODE ***

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors:**

**Critical Nodes:**

* **Compromise Deno Application:**
    * This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. Achieving this means successfully exploiting one or more vulnerabilities within the Deno application or its environment.

* **Exploit Deno's Permission Model:**
    * Attackers target weaknesses in how Deno manages permissions. This could involve finding bugs in the permission checking logic, exploiting race conditions to bypass checks, or finding ways to escalate granted permissions. A successful exploit here allows the attacker to perform actions they shouldn't be authorized to do.

* **Application granted a broad permission (e.g., `--allow-net`):**
    * This isn't an attack itself, but a critical configuration flaw. When the application is granted overly broad permissions during startup (e.g., allowing unrestricted network access with `--allow-net`), it creates a significant vulnerability. This allows attackers, who might otherwise be restricted, to perform actions within the scope of that broad permission.

* **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Deno's Core Runtime:**
    * This involves exploiting security flaws within the core Deno runtime environment. This could be vulnerabilities in the V8 JavaScript engine, the Rust codebase of Deno itself, or the native bindings that Deno uses. Exploiting these vulnerabilities can give the attacker very low-level control over the application and the system it's running on.

**High-Risk Paths:**

* **Exploit Insufficiently Granular Permissions:**
    * This attack path occurs when the application is granted a broad permission (the critical node enabling this path) and the attacker then leverages this permission for malicious purposes. Instead of targeting specific vulnerabilities in Deno's code, the attacker exploits the overly permissive configuration.

* **Attacker leverages this broad permission for malicious purposes:**
    * This is the direct consequence of the application having overly broad permissions. The attacker, now operating within the scope of those permissions, can perform various malicious actions.

    * **Abuse allowed network access to exfiltrate data:**
        * If the application has `--allow-net`, the attacker can make unauthorized network requests to send sensitive data to an external server under their control.

    * **Abuse allowed file system access to read sensitive files:**
        * If the application has `--allow-read`, the attacker can read files on the system that contain sensitive information, such as configuration files, private keys, or user data.

    * **Abuse allowed file system access to write malicious files:**
        * If the application has `--allow-write`, the attacker can write malicious files to the system. This could include overwriting critical system files, deploying backdoors, or planting malware.

    * **Abuse allowed environment access to retrieve secrets:**
        * If the application has `--allow-env`, the attacker can read environment variables. If sensitive information like API keys or database credentials are stored in environment variables, the attacker can retrieve them.
