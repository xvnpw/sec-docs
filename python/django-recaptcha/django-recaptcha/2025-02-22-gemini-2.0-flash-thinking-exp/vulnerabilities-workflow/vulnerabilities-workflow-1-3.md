Based on the provided project files, no high or critical vulnerabilities were identified in the django-recaptcha project that are introduced by the project itself and exploitable by external attackers on a publicly available instance, and that are not already mitigated or excluded by the given criteria.

After careful review based on the instructions provided, specifically focusing on vulnerabilities that:

*   **Are not caused by developers explicitly using insecure code patterns when using project files:** The django-recaptcha library primarily provides a way to integrate Google reCAPTCHA into Django forms. Potential misuse or insecure implementations in user projects are out of scope.
*   **Are not only missing documentation to mitigate:**  Any potential issues are not simply due to lack of documentation but would require code-level changes or are already handled by standard Django security practices.
*   **Are not deny of service vulnerabilities:**  DoS vulnerabilities are explicitly excluded.
*   **Are valid and not already mitigated:** The library is actively maintained, and any identified valid high or critical vulnerabilities would likely be addressed promptly.
*   **Have vulnerability rank at least: high:** The focus is on high or critical severity vulnerabilities that pose a significant risk to applications using django-recaptcha.
*   **Are exploitable by external attacker:** The vulnerabilities must be triggerable by an attacker from the public internet without requiring internal access or specific developer actions beyond using the library in a standard way.

Considering these points, and after analyzing the django-recaptcha library's code and functionality, no vulnerabilities meeting all the inclusion criteria and not falling under the exclusion criteria have been identified.

It's important to reiterate that the security posture of an application using django-recaptcha depends on the overall security practices employed in the Django project.  Django itself provides robust security features, and django-recaptcha is designed to integrate with reCAPTCHA in a secure manner.  However, developers must still ensure they are following Django security best practices and properly configuring their reCAPTCHA integration.

Therefore, based on the given constraints and a focus on vulnerabilities within the django-recaptcha library itself that are exploitable by external attackers and ranked high or critical, the vulnerability list remains empty.
