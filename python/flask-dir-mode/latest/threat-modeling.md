| 1008      | GitHub Actions Runner  | Compromise of GitHub Actions Runner Environment                                | Attackers may compromise the runner environment to intercept secrets or influence the build process.                                                     | Not fully mitigated if self-hosted runners are used without proper security measures; GitHub-hosted runners are generally secure.                     | Use GitHub-hosted runners when possible; if self-hosted, ensure runners are securely configured and patched; limit exposure and access to runner machines.  | Low likelihood for GitHub-hosted runners; higher for self-hosted runners which may not be as securely managed.                                 | High impact as compromised runners can lead to full control over the build environment, exposure of secrets, and compromised build outputs.               | High          |
| 1009      | Test Scripts and Automation | Execution of Malicious Test Scripts during Build Process          | If test scripts contain malicious code or are altered by an attacker, executing them during the build can compromise the build environment.              | Not fully mitigated if test scripts are not reviewed or access-controlled.                                                                              | Secure test script repositories; enforce code reviews; restrict who can modify test scripts; use automated security scanning on test code.                         | Low likelihood if proper controls are in place; risk increases if test scripts are not secured.                                                   | High impact as malicious scripts could lead to compromise of the build environment and insertion of vulnerabilities into the application.             | High          |
| 1010      | Dependency Management  | Insecure Download of Dependencies from Unverified Sources                   | Dependencies are specified in 'requirements/tests-dev.txt' using direct URLs to GitHub repositories, which may be compromised or altered by attackers.    | Not mitigated if dependencies are downloaded from external sources without verification; using URLs to 'main' branches can introduce risks of code changes. | Pin dependencies to specific commit SHAs or tags; verify integrity of dependencies using checksums; avoid using external sources unless necessary; use trusted package registries.  | Medium likelihood due to reliance on external repositories that could be compromised or updated with malicious code; risk increases without verification steps.  | High impact as malicious dependencies can execute code during the build or runtime, leading to compromise of the application or exposure of sensitive data. | High          |

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- **Assumptions**:
  - The application is deployed using a production-grade WSGI server (e.g., Gunicorn, uWSGI, Waitress) as per the deployment documentation.
  - The reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, Apache httpd) is properly configured to forward requests to the WSGI server and to handle TLS termination.
  - TLS/SSL certificates are managed securely and are valid.
  - Deployment configurations are managed appropriately and secured against unauthorized access.
  - Regular updates and patches are applied to the host operating system and all server software.
  - Dependencies are regularly audited and updated to address known vulnerabilities.
  - Secure communication protocols are enforced for all external services.
  - Access to deployment infrastructure and secrets is restricted to authorized personnel.

- **Questions**:
  - How are TLS/SSL certificates stored and managed? Are there procedures for rotation and revocation?
  - What processes are in place to ensure that production deployments use the correct WSGI server and configurations, and not the development server?
  - Are there regular audits of reverse proxy configurations to prevent accidental exposure of internal services?
  - How are deployment configuration files protected from unauthorized access or exposure?
  - Is there a process for regular system updates and patches for the host OS and server software?
  - How are package dependencies managed during deployment? Are they pinned and audited for vulnerabilities?
  - Are external communications validated to ensure they use secure protocols and valid certificates?
  - What measures are in place to prevent the inclusion of malicious dependencies during deployment?
  - Is there monitoring and alerting in place to detect potential compromises or misconfigurations in the deployment environment?
