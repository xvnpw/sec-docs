# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, Hyperledger Fabric, aims to provide a modular and versatile platform for developing and operating enterprise-grade blockchain networks. It is designed to support a wide range of industry use cases requiring high levels of security, scalability, confidentiality, and resilience.

Business priorities and goals for Hyperledger Fabric include:

- Enabling secure and transparent transactions between business partners.
- Streamlining business processes and reducing operational costs through automation and decentralization.
- Enhancing data provenance and auditability for regulatory compliance and trust.
- Providing a flexible and extensible platform that can adapt to evolving business needs and technological advancements.
- Fostering a vibrant ecosystem of developers, solution providers, and users around the platform.

Most important business risks that need to be addressed:

- Security vulnerabilities in the platform or in deployed applications (chaincode) could lead to data breaches, financial losses, and reputational damage.
- Performance and scalability limitations could hinder adoption and limit the platform's ability to handle growing transaction volumes.
- Lack of interoperability with other blockchain platforms or legacy systems could create silos and limit the network effect.
- Governance and regulatory uncertainty surrounding blockchain technology could impact adoption and legal compliance.
- Complexity of development and deployment could increase costs and slow down time-to-market for solutions built on the platform.

    - Requirement: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) should be implemented for managing user and application permissions.

- Input Validation:
    - Requirement: All inputs to chaincode and Fabric APIs must be thoroughly validated to prevent injection attacks and other input-related vulnerabilities.
    - Requirement: Data validation should be performed at multiple layers, including client-side and server-side.
    - Requirement: Input validation rules should be clearly defined and consistently enforced.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes we are trying to protect:

- Transaction processing and validation: Ensuring that transactions are processed accurately, securely, and in a timely manner is critical for the business network's operation.
- Ledger integrity and immutability: Protecting the integrity and immutability of the ledger is paramount to maintain trust and auditability in the network.
- Chaincode execution: Secure and reliable execution of chaincode is essential for automating business logic and ensuring predictable outcomes.
- Network governance and membership management: Maintaining secure and controlled network governance and membership processes is crucial for network integrity and participant trust.
- Data confidentiality and privacy: Protecting sensitive business data shared on the network is vital for maintaining confidentiality and complying with privacy regulations.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:

- Transaction data: Contains details of business transactions, which can be highly sensitive depending on the industry and use case (e.g., financial transactions, supply chain data, healthcare records). Sensitivity: High to Critical.
- Ledger data (blocks and world state): Represents the entire history of transactions and current state of the network. Contains all transaction data and system configurations. Sensitivity: Critical.
- Chaincode (smart contracts): Contains business logic and potentially sensitive algorithms or data processing rules. Sensitivity: Medium to High.
- Private data collections: Used for confidential transactions within channels, containing highly sensitive data restricted to specific organizations. Sensitivity: Critical.
- Identity and membership data (MSP configuration): Contains cryptographic keys and organizational identities, crucial for network security and access control. Sensitivity: Critical.
- Configuration data (network configuration, policies): Defines network behavior and security policies. Misconfiguration can lead to vulnerabilities. Sensitivity: Medium to High.
- Audit logs: Records of network activities and security events, essential for monitoring and compliance. Sensitivity: Medium.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

- What are the specific business use cases and industry for which this Hyperledger Fabric network is being designed? (This will help to refine the risk assessment and security requirements).
- What are the specific regulatory compliance requirements that need to be met? (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
- What is the expected scale and performance requirements for the network? (This will influence deployment architecture and scalability considerations).
- What are the organization's risk appetite and security maturity level? (This will help prioritize security controls and accepted risks).
- Are there any existing security tools or infrastructure that should be integrated with the Hyperledger Fabric network? (e.g., SIEM, KMS, IDP).

Assumptions:

- The Hyperledger Fabric network is intended for a permissioned blockchain use case, involving known and trusted business partners.
- Security is a high priority for this deployment, given the enterprise-grade nature of Hyperledger Fabric and the sensitivity of business data.
- The deployment environment is assumed to be a cloud-based infrastructure using Kubernetes for orchestration.
- A standard secure software development lifecycle (SSDLC) is followed for developing and maintaining Hyperledger Fabric components and chaincode.
- Network participants are expected to implement appropriate security controls within their own organizations and applications interacting with the Fabric network.
