# Threat Model Analysis for fabric/fabric

## Threat: [Ledger Data Tampering (Compromised Peer)](./threats/ledger_data_tampering__compromised_peer_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains control of a peer node and directly modifies the ledger files (state database or blockchain). They might alter transaction data, state values, or even attempt to rewrite blocks.
    *   **Impact:** Data integrity is compromised, leading to inconsistent ledger state across the network. This can cause application failures, incorrect business logic execution, and loss of trust in the data.
    *   **Fabric Component Affected:** Peer Node (Ledger Storage, State Database, Blockchain Files)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong access controls and security hardening on peer node infrastructure.
        *   Regularly perform integrity checks of ledger data using checksums or cryptographic hashes.
        *   Rely on the distributed consensus mechanism across multiple peers to detect and reject tampered data.
        *   Utilize intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) on peer nodes.
        *   Encrypt data at rest on peer storage.

## Threat: [Chaincode Execution Manipulation (Compromised Peer)](./threats/chaincode_execution_manipulation__compromised_peer_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises a peer and manipulates the chaincode execution environment. They could alter chaincode logic during execution, inject malicious code, or bypass security checks within the chaincode execution process.
    *   **Impact:** Data integrity violations due to incorrect state updates, application logic failures, potential for denial of service if chaincode execution is disrupted, and financial losses if transactions are manipulated.
    *   **Fabric Component Affected:** Peer Node (Chaincode Execution Environment, Endorsement Process)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce chaincode endorsement policies requiring multiple peers from different organizations to endorse transactions.
        *   Implement robust peer node monitoring and intrusion detection systems.
        *   Secure the peer node operating system and runtime environment.
        *   Regularly audit peer node security configurations.

This could be through physical access to servers, compromised credentials, or exploiting vulnerabilities in storage systems. They could then extract sensitive ledger data, private keys, or configuration files.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive business data and potentially private keys, leading to identity theft, network compromise, and regulatory violations.
    *   **Fabric Component Affected:** Peer Node (Ledger Storage, Key Material Storage, Configuration Files)

*   **Description:** Storing sensitive or personally identifiable information (PII) directly on the ledger in plain text within chaincode state or transaction data. This violates data privacy principles and regulations as ledger data is typically replicated and potentially accessible to multiple organizations.
    *   **Impact:** Data privacy violations, non-compliance with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), legal and regulatory penalties, reputational damage, and potential harm to individuals whose data is exposed.
    *   **Fabric Component Affected:** Chaincode (Data Handling Logic), Ledger (Data Storage)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Apply data minimization principles and avoid storing sensitive data directly on the ledger whenever possible.
        *   Use data hashing or encryption for sensitive data stored on the ledger.
        *   Implement access control policies to restrict visibility of sensitive data on the ledger.
        *   Consider off-chain storage for highly sensitive data, using ledger anchors (hashes) to maintain data integrity.
        *   Design chaincode and data models to minimize the storage of PII on the blockchain.
