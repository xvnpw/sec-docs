## 5. Data Flow

A common data flow scenario involves a user requesting the provisioning of a specific hardware resource through the Fabric API.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant "API" as API
    participant "Central Orchestrator" as Orchestrator
    participant "Agent on Target Host" as TargetAgent
    participant "Target Hardware Resource" as TargetHW

    User->>API: Request to provision a resource (e.g., a server)
    activate API
    API->>Orchestrator: Forward resource provisioning request
    activate Orchestrator
    Orchestrator->>Orchestrator: Identify suitable hardware (Resource Management & Scheduling)
    Orchestrator->>TargetAgent: Send provisioning commands and configuration
    activate TargetAgent
    TargetAgent->>TargetHW: Interact with hardware to provision (e.g., power on, configure network)
    activate TargetHW
    TargetHW-->>TargetAgent: Report provisioning status
    deactivate TargetHW
    TargetAgent->>Orchestrator: Update resource provisioning status
    deactivate TargetAgent
    Orchestrator->>API: Report provisioning success or failure
    deactivate Orchestrator
    API-->>User: Provide provisioning status and details
    deactivate API
```

**Detailed Steps in the Data Flow:**

1. **User Initiation:** A user interacts with the Fabric API, submitting a request to provision a specific hardware resource, such as a compute server with defined specifications.
2. **API Request Handling:** The API receives the provisioning request, performs authentication and authorization checks, and forwards the validated request to the Central Orchestrator.
3. **Orchestrator Resource Selection:** The Orchestrator analyzes the request and utilizes its Resource Management and Scheduling components to identify a suitable hardware resource that meets the requirements.
4. **Command Dispatch to Agent:** Once a target hardware resource is identified, the Orchestrator formulates specific provisioning commands and configuration details and sends them to the Agent residing on the target host.
5. **Agent Hardware Interaction:** The Agent receives the commands and interacts directly with the Target Hardware Resource to perform the provisioning actions. This interaction is hardware-specific and might involve actions like powering on the device, configuring network interfaces, or allocating storage.
6. **Hardware Status Update:** The Target Hardware Resource executes the provisioning commands and reports its status back to the Agent.
7. **Agent Status Reporting:** The Agent relays the provisioning status received from the hardware back to the Central Orchestrator.
8. **Orchestrator State Update:** The Orchestrator updates its internal state to reflect the current status of the provisioned hardware resource.
9. **API Response to User:** The Orchestrator informs the API about the success or failure of the provisioning request.
10. **User Notification:** The API sends a response back to the user, providing the provisioning status and any relevant details about the newly provisioned resource.

## 6. Security Considerations

A comprehensive threat model will require a deeper analysis, but initial security considerations based on the architecture include:
