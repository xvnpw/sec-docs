# Threat Model Analysis for fabric/fabric

## Threat: [Certificate Authority (CA) Compromise](./threats/certificate_authority__ca__compromise.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains control of the Certificate Authority infrastructure, potentially through exploiting vulnerabilities in the `fabric-ca` software or compromising administrative credentials. This allows them to issue fraudulent certificates for new identities or revoke legitimate ones.
    *   **Impact:** Ability to create unauthorized members, impersonate legitimate members, disrupt network operations by revoking valid certificates, and potentially gain complete control over the identity management system.
    *   **Affected Component:** Certificate Authority (fabric-ca).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong security measures for the CA infrastructure, including physical security, network segmentation, and strict access controls.
        *   Regularly patch and update the `fabric-ca` software.
        *   Implement robust authentication and authorization for CA administrators.
        *   Consider using HSMs to protect the CA's root key.
        *   Implement monitoring and alerting for suspicious CA activity.
        *   Establish a disaster recovery plan for the CA.

## Threat: [Malicious Chaincode Deployment](./threats/malicious_chaincode_deployment.md)

*   **Description:** An authorized (or unauthorized, if access controls are weak within Fabric) user deploys malicious chaincode onto a channel. This chaincode could contain vulnerabilities or intentionally malicious logic designed to steal data, manipulate assets, or disrupt the application by exploiting Fabric's chaincode execution environment.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized transfer of assets managed by the chaincode, denial of service for the application interacting with the chaincode, and potential compromise of the entire channel.
    *   **Affected Component:** Peer Node (chaincode execution environment), Channel configuration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access controls for chaincode deployment and management within Fabric's channel configuration.
        *   Establish a rigorous chaincode development lifecycle with mandatory code reviews and security testing.
        *   Utilize static and dynamic analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in chaincode.
        *   Implement a process for verifying the provenance and integrity of chaincode before deployment.
        *   Consider using formal verification techniques for critical chaincode.

## Threat: [Chaincode Vulnerabilities Exploitation](./threats/chaincode_vulnerabilities_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers identify and exploit vulnerabilities in deployed chaincode (e.g., logic errors, input validation flaws, reentrancy issues) within Fabric's chaincode execution environment. This allows them to bypass intended business logic, manipulate data managed by the chaincode, or cause unexpected behavior.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption within the chaincode's state, unauthorized access to or modification of assets, financial loss, and disruption of application functionality.
    *   **Affected Component:** Peer Node (chaincode execution environment), specific chaincode functions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Employ secure coding practices during chaincode development.
        *   Conduct thorough testing, including unit, integration, and security testing, of chaincode.
        *   Perform regular security audits and penetration testing of deployed chaincode.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks within the chaincode logic.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when designing chaincode functionality.

## Threat: [Orderer Compromise](./threats/orderer_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains control of one or more orderer nodes, potentially by exploiting vulnerabilities in the orderer software within the `fabric` codebase or compromising the underlying infrastructure. Depending on the consensus mechanism, this could allow them to manipulate the order of transactions, censor transactions, or halt the network.
    *   **Impact:** Transaction reordering or censorship leading to unfair outcomes, denial of service for the entire network, and potential manipulation of the ledger state.
    *   **Affected Component:** Orderer Node (ordering service).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the infrastructure hosting the orderer nodes with strong access controls and regular security patching.
        *   Utilize Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus mechanisms to increase resilience against compromised orderers.
        *   Implement monitoring and alerting for suspicious orderer behavior.
        *   Distribute orderer nodes across multiple administrative domains to reduce the risk of a single point of failure.

## Threat: [Transaction Reordering or Censorship](./threats/transaction_reordering_or_censorship.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious orderer (or a coalition of compromised orderers in non-BFT systems) manipulates the order of transactions within a block or refuses to include certain transactions in blocks, exploiting the functionality of the Fabric ordering service.
    *   **Impact:** Ability to influence the outcome of transactions, denial of service for specific transactions, and potential manipulation of the ledger state for malicious gain.
    *   **Affected Component:** Orderer Node (ordering service).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize BFT consensus mechanisms which are more resistant to malicious orderers.
        *   Implement monitoring mechanisms to detect unusual transaction ordering patterns within the Fabric network.
        *   Design applications to be resilient to minor reordering of transactions where possible.
        *   Ensure a sufficient number of independent orderers are participating in the network.

## Threat: [Peer Node Compromise](./threats/peer_node_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains control of a peer node, potentially by exploiting vulnerabilities in the peer software within the `fabric` codebase or compromising the underlying infrastructure. This allows them to potentially access ledger data stored by the peer, endorse malicious transactions (if they control an endorsing peer), or disrupt network operations.
    *   **Impact:** Potential data breaches from the peer's ledger storage, ability to endorse invalid transactions, and disruption of network services.
    *   **Affected Component:** Peer Node (ledger storage, transaction endorsement).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the infrastructure hosting peer nodes with strong access controls and regular security patching.
        *   Implement robust monitoring and intrusion detection systems for peer nodes.
        *   Regularly audit peer node configurations and access logs.
        *   Ensure peers are running the latest stable and patched version of Hyperledger Fabric.

## Threat: [State Database Manipulation (Direct Access)](./threats/state_database_manipulation__direct_access_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains direct access to the underlying state database (e.g., CouchDB, LevelDB) used by a peer node, bypassing Fabric's security mechanisms. This could be achieved through exploiting vulnerabilities in the database software or compromising the host system *and* leveraging knowledge of Fabric's state database interaction.
    *   **Impact:** Direct manipulation of the ledger's world state, potentially leading to unauthorized changes to assets and the application's data.
    *   **Affected Component:** Peer Node (state database interaction logic within Fabric).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the state database with strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.
        *   Keep the state database software up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Restrict network access to the state database.
        *   Consider encrypting the state database at rest.
        *   Implement monitoring for unauthorized access attempts to the state database.

## Threat: [Gossip Protocol Exploits](./threats/gossip_protocol_exploits.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the gossip protocol implementation within the `fabric` codebase, used for peer-to-peer communication and data dissemination. This could allow them to intercept sensitive information exchanged via gossip, inject false information into the network through manipulated gossip messages, or disrupt communication between peers.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, network instability, and potential for consensus manipulation.
    *   **Affected Component:** Peer Node (gossip module).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium *(While generally medium, severe exploits could elevate this to high)*
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Hyperledger Fabric versions up-to-date to benefit from security fixes in the gossip protocol.
        *   Configure gossip parameters securely, limiting unnecessary information sharing.
        *   Implement network segmentation to limit the impact of a compromised peer.
        *   Monitor network traffic for suspicious gossip activity.
