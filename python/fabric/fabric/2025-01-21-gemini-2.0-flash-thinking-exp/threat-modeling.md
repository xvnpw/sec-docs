# Threat Model Analysis for fabric/fabric

## Threat: [Compromised Certificate Authority (CA)](./threats/compromised_certificate_authority__ca_.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Certificate Authority's infrastructure, potentially through exploiting vulnerabilities in the `fabric-ca` codebase itself, compromising administrative credentials used to manage `fabric-ca`, or through social engineering targeting CA operators. The attacker might then issue fraudulent enrollment certificates for new identities, revoke legitimate certificates, or modify existing identity attributes.

**Impact:**  Ability to impersonate any network participant, gain unauthorized access to channels and data, disrupt network operations by revoking legitimate identities, and potentially compromise the entire network's trust model.

**Affected Component:** `fabric-ca` (specifically the server component and its underlying key material management within the `fabric-ca` codebase).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong access controls and multi-factor authentication for CA administrators.
* Secure the CA infrastructure with robust firewalls and intrusion detection systems.
* Use Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) to protect the CA's private key.
* Regularly audit CA logs and activities.
* Implement a robust key management lifecycle, including secure key generation, storage, and rotation.
* Consider using a distributed CA setup for increased resilience.
* Keep `fabric-ca` software updated with the latest security patches.

## Threat: [Compromised Membership Service Provider (MSP) Configuration](./threats/compromised_membership_service_provider__msp__configuration.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the MSP configuration files, potentially through exploiting vulnerabilities in how `fabric/fabric` components handle or store MSP configurations, compromising administrator credentials used to manage the network, or through insider threats. The attacker might modify the MSP definition to grant unauthorized organizations or identities access to the network or specific channels, or elevate privileges of malicious actors.

**Impact:**  Unauthorized entities gaining access to sensitive data and network resources, bypassing intended access control policies, potential for malicious transactions and data manipulation by unauthorized parties.

**Affected Component:** MSP configuration handling within peer and orderer nodes in the `fabric/fabric` codebase.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict access controls for MSP configuration files.
* Store MSP configuration files securely and encrypt them at rest.
* Use version control for MSP configuration files to track changes and enable rollback.
* Implement automated validation of MSP definitions to detect unauthorized modifications.
* Regularly audit MSP configurations and access logs.

## Threat: [Key Material Compromise (Peer, Orderer)](./threats/key_material_compromise__peer__orderer_.md)

**Description:** An attacker obtains the private keys associated with a peer or orderer node. This could happen through various means, including exploiting vulnerabilities in key storage mechanisms within the `fabric/fabric` codebase, compromising the host system, or through insider threats. The attacker can then impersonate the compromised entity.

**Impact:**  Impersonation of legitimate network components, allowing the attacker to submit unauthorized transactions, access sensitive data, and potentially disrupt network operations. A compromised orderer key could be catastrophic, allowing manipulation of the transaction ordering process.

**Affected Component:**  Cryptographic key storage mechanisms within peer and orderer implementations in the `fabric/fabric` codebase.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) for secure key generation and storage for peer and orderer nodes.
* Implement strong access controls for systems storing key material.
* Encrypt key material at rest and in transit.
* Enforce key rotation policies.
* Educate operators on secure key management practices.

## Threat: [Ledger Data Tampering (Internal Threat)](./threats/ledger_data_tampering__internal_threat_.md)

**Description:** A malicious actor with sufficient privileges within the network (e.g., a compromised peer or orderer within a consortium) exploits vulnerabilities within the `fabric/fabric` codebase to directly modify the blockchain ledger, bypassing the normal transaction processing flow.

**Impact:**  Compromised data integrity, loss of trust in the system, potential for significant financial loss or reputational damage. This undermines the fundamental immutability guarantee of the blockchain.

**Affected Component:**  Ledger storage and commit mechanisms within peer and orderer nodes in the `fabric/fabric` codebase.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong governance models and access controls within the consortium to limit the number of entities with the potential to compromise nodes.
* Enforce multi-signature requirements for critical operations and network configuration changes.
* Implement robust monitoring and alerting systems to detect suspicious activity on peer and orderer nodes.
* Regularly audit ledger data and network activity for anomalies.
* Keep `fabric/fabric` software updated with the latest security patches.

## Threat: [Channel Data Leakage](./threats/channel_data_leakage.md)

**Description:**  Unauthorized access to data within a specific channel due to vulnerabilities in the channel access control mechanisms implemented within the `fabric/fabric` codebase, or due to compromised peer nodes belonging to authorized organizations.

**Impact:**  Exposure of confidential information to unauthorized parties, potentially leading to competitive disadvantage, violation of privacy regulations, or other negative consequences.

**Affected Component:**  Channel access control mechanisms within peer nodes and the gossip protocol used for data dissemination within channels, as implemented in the `fabric/fabric` codebase.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully configure channel access policies to ensure only authorized organizations and identities can access the channel.
* Implement strong access controls for peer nodes and the systems hosting them.
* Use private data collections for sensitive data that needs to be restricted to a subset of channel members.
* Encrypt data at rest and in transit within the channel.

## Threat: [Orderer Node Failure/Byzantine Faults](./threats/orderer_node_failurebyzantine_faults.md)

**Description:**  Failure of orderer nodes due to bugs or vulnerabilities within the orderer service implementation in the `fabric/fabric` codebase, or malicious behavior by compromised orderers (Byzantine Faults) attempting to manipulate the transaction ordering process or disrupt consensus.

**Impact:**  Network downtime, inability to process transactions, potential for inconsistent ledger states if Byzantine faults are not handled correctly.

**Affected Component:**  Orderer service and its consensus mechanism (e.g., Raft) implementation within the `fabric/fabric` codebase.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use a fault-tolerant ordering service like Raft, which can tolerate a certain number of faulty nodes.
* Deploy a sufficient number of orderer nodes to ensure redundancy.
* Implement robust monitoring and alerting for orderer node health and performance.
* Secure the orderer infrastructure with strong access controls and security measures.
* Keep `fabric/fabric` software updated with the latest security patches.

## Threat: [Peer Node Failure/Denial of Service](./threats/peer_node_failuredenial_of_service.md)

**Description:**  Failure of peer nodes due to bugs or vulnerabilities within the peer service implementation in the `fabric/fabric` codebase, or targeted denial-of-service (DoS) attacks exploiting weaknesses in the peer's network handling. An attacker might flood a peer with requests, overwhelming its resources and making it unavailable.

**Impact:**  Reduced network capacity, potential data unavailability if the affected peer holds the only copy of certain data, disruption of chaincode execution if the endorsing peers are unavailable.

**Affected Component:**  Peer service and its ability to process transactions and serve ledger data, as implemented in the `fabric/fabric` codebase.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Deploy a sufficient number of peer nodes to ensure redundancy and load balancing.
* Implement standard DDoS mitigation techniques, such as rate limiting and traffic filtering.
* Monitor peer node health and resource utilization.
* Secure the peer infrastructure with firewalls and intrusion detection systems.
* Keep `fabric/fabric` software updated with the latest security patches.
