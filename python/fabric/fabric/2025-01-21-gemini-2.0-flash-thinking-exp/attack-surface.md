# Attack Surface Analysis for fabric/fabric

## Attack Surface: [Chaincode Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/chaincode_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:**  Flaws or weaknesses in the smart contract code (chaincode) deployed on the Fabric network. These can be similar to vulnerabilities in traditional software.

**How Fabric Contributes:** Fabric executes user-defined chaincode, making the security of this code paramount. The permissioned nature of Fabric means compromised chaincode can have significant impact within the organization's network.

**Example:** A chaincode with a logic error allowing unauthorized transfer of assets, or a vulnerability enabling access to private data collections without proper authorization.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized asset transfers, denial of service within the application, potential compromise of peer nodes if the chaincode has excessive permissions.

**Risk Severity:** Critical to High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement secure coding practices during chaincode development.
* Conduct thorough security audits and penetration testing of chaincode.
* Utilize static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities.
* Implement robust input validation and sanitization within chaincode.
* Follow the principle of least privilege when defining chaincode permissions.
* Consider formal verification methods for critical chaincode logic.

## Attack Surface: [Peer Identity Compromise](./attack_surfaces/peer_identity_compromise.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains control of a legitimate peer's cryptographic identity (MSP credentials).

**How Fabric Contributes:** Fabric relies on cryptographic identities for authentication and authorization. Compromising a peer's identity allows an attacker to act as that peer within the network.

**Example:** Theft of a peer's private key from a poorly secured storage location, or exploitation of vulnerabilities in the key management system.

**Impact:** Ability to execute malicious chaincode, endorse fraudulent transactions, disrupt network operations, potentially access sensitive data.

**Risk Severity:** Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Securely store and manage peer private keys, ideally using Hardware Security Modules (HSMs).
* Implement strong access controls for accessing key material.
* Regularly rotate cryptographic keys.
* Monitor peer activity for suspicious behavior.
* Implement multi-factor authentication for accessing key management systems.

## Attack Surface: [Orderer Identity Compromise](./attack_surfaces/orderer_identity_compromise.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains control of a legitimate orderer node's cryptographic identity.

**How Fabric Contributes:** Orderers are responsible for ordering transactions into blocks. Compromising an orderer's identity can severely disrupt the network's consensus mechanism.

**Example:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in the orderer node's operating system or stealing the orderer's private key.

**Impact:** Ability to censor transactions, introduce invalid transactions into blocks, halt the network, potentially fork the ledger.

**Risk Severity:** Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Securely store and manage orderer private keys, ideally using HSMs.
* Implement strong access controls for accessing key material.
* Harden the operating systems of orderer nodes.
* Implement network segmentation to isolate orderer nodes.
* Regularly monitor orderer node activity and logs.

## Attack Surface: [Certificate Authority (CA) Compromise](./attack_surfaces/certificate_authority__ca__compromise.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains control of the Fabric CA, including its root or intermediate signing keys.

**How Fabric Contributes:** The CA is the trust anchor for the entire Fabric network. Compromise of the CA allows an attacker to issue arbitrary certificates, effectively controlling identities within the network.

**Example:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the CA software, social engineering attacks targeting CA administrators, or physical theft of CA key material.

**Impact:** Ability to create rogue identities, impersonate legitimate users or nodes, bypass authentication and authorization, potentially take complete control of the network.

**Risk Severity:** Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement extremely strong security measures for the CA, including HSMs for key storage.
* Restrict access to the CA to a minimal number of highly trusted administrators.
* Implement multi-factor authentication for CA access.
* Regularly audit CA operations and logs.
* Implement offline or air-gapped CA deployments for enhanced security.

## Attack Surface: [Gossip Protocol Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/gossip_protocol_exploitation.md)

**Description:**  Abuse or manipulation of the peer-to-peer gossip protocol used for data dissemination and peer discovery.

**How Fabric Contributes:** Fabric relies on the gossip protocol for efficient and resilient communication between peers.

**Example:** A malicious peer injecting false or misleading information into the gossip network, leading to inconsistencies in the ledger view among peers. Sybil attacks where an attacker controls multiple peer identities to influence gossip.

**Impact:** Network instability, inconsistencies in data across peers, potential for denial of service, manipulation of peer discovery.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust peer identity verification and authentication.
* Monitor gossip traffic for anomalies and suspicious behavior.
* Implement rate limiting or reputation scoring mechanisms within the gossip protocol (if feasible and doesn't impact performance significantly).
* Ensure proper network configuration and firewall rules to limit exposure of the gossip protocol.
