## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict SSH Key Management (Within Fabric)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_ssh_key_management__within_fabric_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Configure Fabric to exclusively use SSH key-based authentication and manage keys securely *within the Fabric context*.

**Description:**
1.  **Key-Based Auth in Fabric:** Ensure your Fabric code (fabfile.py or equivalent) is configured to use SSH keys. This usually involves *not* providing passwords in connection settings. Fabric, by default, will attempt to use SSH keys if available.
2.  **`connect_kwargs`:** Use the `connect_kwargs` parameter in your Fabric connection settings to explicitly specify the path to the private key file:
    ```python
    from fabric import Connection

    c = Connection('user@host', connect_kwargs={'key_filename': '/path/to/private_key'})
    ```
3.  **Environment Variables for Key Path:** Store the path to the private key in an environment variable (e.g., `FABRIC_KEY_PATH`) and use it in your Fabric code:
    ```python
    import os
    from fabric import Connection

    key_path = os.environ.get('FABRIC_KEY_PATH')
    c = Connection('user@host', connect_kwargs={'key_filename': key_path})
    ```
4.  **Avoid Hardcoding Key Paths:** *Never* hardcode the path to the private key directly in your Fabric script.
5.  **Agent Forwarding (with Caution):** If using agent forwarding, do so explicitly and only when necessary.  You can control this within Fabric's connection settings.  Understand the security implications.
6.  **`Config` Object (Fabric 2+):** Use Fabric's `Config` object to manage connection settings centrally, including key paths and agent forwarding settings. This promotes consistency and reduces the risk of errors.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Prevents Fabric from falling back to password authentication if key-based auth fails (which could happen if misconfigured).
*   **Credential Exposure (High Severity):** Avoids hardcoding sensitive key paths within the script.

**Impact:**
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk significantly reduced by enforcing key-based auth within Fabric.
*   **Credential Exposure:** Risk significantly reduced by avoiding hardcoded paths.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Key-based auth explicitly configured in Fabric: [Yes/No]
*   `connect_kwargs` used for key path: [Yes/No]
*   Environment variables for key path: [Yes/No]
*   No hardcoded key paths: [Yes/No]
*   Agent forwarding controlled explicitly: [Yes/No/Limited - Describe usage]
*   `Config` object used for central management: [Yes/No]

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Identify any Fabric scripts that don't explicitly configure key-based authentication.
*   List any instances where key paths are hardcoded.
*   Specify if agent forwarding is used without explicit configuration or understanding of the risks.
*   If `Config` object is not used, describe how connection settings are managed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Careful `sudo` Usage and Command Construction (Within Fabric)](./mitigation_strategies/careful__sudo__usage_and_command_construction__within_fabric_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:**  Control the use of `sudo` within Fabric scripts and ensure commands are constructed securely to prevent command injection.

**Description:**
1.  **Minimize `sudo` Calls:**  Only use Fabric's `sudo()` function when absolutely necessary.
2.  **Explicit Commands:**  When using `sudo()`, provide the *exact* command as a string.  Avoid constructing commands dynamically using string formatting with user-supplied input.
3.  **`pty=True`:**  *Always* use the `pty=True` argument with Fabric's `sudo()` function: `sudo('command', pty=True)`.
4.  **`fabric.contrib.sudo` (or equivalent):** Use Fabric's built-in `sudo` handling (which often defaults to using `pty=True`).  This is generally safer than manually constructing `sudo` commands.
5.  **Avoid Shell Metacharacters (in Fabric commands):** Be extremely cautious when using shell metacharacters within the strings passed to Fabric's `run()` or `sudo()` functions.  If possible, avoid them. If necessary, ensure they are properly escaped by Fabric (and *verify* this).
6.  **No User Input in Command Construction:** *Never* directly incorporate user-provided input into the command string passed to `run()` or `sudo()`. If you need to use user input, pass it as separate arguments to the command being executed on the remote system, *not* as part of the command string itself. This relies on the *remote* command handling the input safely.
7. **Use of `local` command:** If you are using `local` command, make sure that you are not passing any user input to it.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Privilege Escalation (High Severity):** Limits the potential for attackers to gain root access through Fabric.
*   **Unintended Command Execution (High Severity):** Prevents command injection vulnerabilities within the Fabric script itself.
*   **TTY Hijacking (Medium Severity):** `pty=True` mitigates certain TTY-based attacks.

**Impact:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Unintended Command Execution:** Risk significantly reduced (dependent on avoiding user input in command construction).
*   **TTY Hijacking:** Risk reduced.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   `sudo()` usage minimized: [Yes/No/Partial - Describe usage]
*   Explicit commands with `sudo()`: [Yes/No - Provide examples]
*   `pty=True` always used with `sudo()`: [Yes/No]
*   `fabric.contrib.sudo` (or equivalent) used: [Yes/No]
*   Shell metacharacters avoided/escaped in Fabric commands: [Yes/No]
*   No user input directly in command construction: [Yes/No]
*   `local` command usage reviewed: [Yes/No]

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Identify any instances where `sudo()` is used unnecessarily.
*   List any cases where `pty=True` is not used with `sudo()`.
*   Specify if shell metacharacters are used within Fabric commands without proper escaping.
*   Identify any instances where user input is directly incorporated into command strings passed to `run()` or `sudo()`.
*   List any `local` commands that use user input.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Output Handling (Within Fabric)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_output_handling__within_fabric_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Control Fabric's output to prevent sensitive information from being exposed.

**Description:**
1.  **`hide()` and `show()`:** Use Fabric's `hide()` and `show()` functions to control what is printed to the console.  `hide('stdout')` will suppress standard output, `hide('stderr')` will suppress standard error, and `hide('both')` will suppress both.  Use `show()` to re-enable output.
2.  **`warn_only`:** Set `warn_only=True` in your Fabric configuration or connection settings to prevent Fabric from exiting on non-zero exit codes.  This can be useful for commands that might return errors but are not critical failures.  Be careful with this, as it can mask genuine errors.
3.  **Context Managers:** Use Fabric's context managers (e.g., `settings(hide('warnings'), warn_only=True)`) to temporarily change settings within a specific block of code.
4.  **Review Command Output:** Carefully consider what information might be contained in the output of commands executed by Fabric.  If sensitive data (passwords, keys, etc.) might be present, suppress the output or redact it.
5. **Log Levels:** If you are using logging, make sure that you are not logging any sensitive information.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Prevents sensitive information from being displayed on the console or logged.

**Impact:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced (dependent on careful review of command output).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   `hide()` and `show()` used appropriately: [Yes/No - Describe usage]
*   `warn_only` used judiciously: [Yes/No - Describe usage]
*   Context managers used for temporary settings: [Yes/No]
*   Command output reviewed for sensitive data: [Yes/No]
*   Log levels reviewed: [Yes/No]

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Identify any instances where sensitive command output is not suppressed.
*   Specify if `warn_only` is used without careful consideration of potential error masking.
*   List any cases where context managers could be used to improve code clarity and maintainability.
*   Describe any commands where the output has not been reviewed for sensitive data.
*   Identify any sensitive data that is being logged.
