# Threat Model Analysis for fabric/fabric

## Threat: [SSH MITM Attack with Host Key Spoofing](./threats/ssh_mitm_attack_with_host_key_spoofing.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts the SSH connection established by *Fabric*. The attacker presents a fake host key to the Fabric client. If the client (due to Fabric's configuration or application misuse) doesn't properly verify the host key, the attacker can decrypt and modify all traffic, including commands and data sent via Fabric.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the remote server. The attacker can execute arbitrary commands via Fabric, steal data transferred through Fabric, and potentially pivot to other systems.
*   **Affected Fabric Component:** `fabric.Connection`, specifically the underlying SSH connection handling (within Paramiko, a Fabric dependency, but initiated and configured through Fabric). The `connect_kwargs` parameter (especially `disable_known_hosts` and related options) is the critical point of failure *within Fabric's usage*.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Host Key Verification:** *Never* disable host key verification (`disable_known_hosts = True`) in your Fabric code or configuration. This is the single most important mitigation, and it's a direct Fabric configuration issue.
    *   **Pre-populated `known_hosts`:** Distribute a pre-populated `known_hosts` file containing the correct public keys of the target servers. This is managed outside of Fabric, but directly impacts Fabric's security.
    *   **SSH Certificates:** Use SSH certificates instead of raw keys. Certificate management is external to Fabric, but the *use* of certificates is configured within Fabric's connection settings.

## Threat: [Command Injection via `run()`/`sudo()`](./threats/command_injection_via__run____sudo___.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input that is passed to *Fabric's* `run()` or `sudo()` functions without proper sanitization within the application code *using* Fabric. This input is then executed as part of a shell command on the remote server, allowing the attacker to inject arbitrary commands *through Fabric*.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the target server, potentially with elevated privileges (if `sudo()` is misused within the Fabric script). This can lead to data breaches, system compromise, and lateral movement, all initiated through Fabric.
*   **Affected Fabric Component:** `fabric.Connection.run()`, `fabric.Connection.sudo()`. These are the *direct* Fabric functions being misused.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Sanitization:** *Always* sanitize and validate any user-supplied input *before* incorporating it into commands passed to Fabric's `run()` or `sudo()`. Use appropriate escaping techniques (e.g., `shlex.quote()` in Python) to prevent shell injection. This is a coding practice directly related to *how Fabric is used*.
    *   **Parameterized Commands:** If possible, structure commands to use parameters instead of string concatenation within your Fabric scripts. This is a best practice when *using* Fabric.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Ensure the Fabric user (configured within the Fabric connection) has the minimum necessary privileges on the remote server. Avoid using `sudo()` within Fabric scripts unless absolutely required, and then only for specific, well-defined commands.
    *   **Whitelisting:** If possible, implement a whitelist of allowed commands or command patterns that the Fabric script can execute.

## Threat: [Credential Exposure in Logs/Output (Fabric-Related)](./threats/credential_exposure_in_logsoutput__fabric-related_.md)

*   **Description:** *Fabric*, if not configured carefully within the application, might print sensitive information (passwords, SSH keys, API tokens) to the console or log files. This can happen if secrets are passed directly as command-line arguments to Fabric functions or if verbose logging is enabled in Fabric's configuration without proper redaction *within the application's use of Fabric*.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of credentials, allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access to the remote server or other systems, leveraging the access granted to Fabric.
*   **Affected Fabric Component:** `fabric.Connection`, `fabric.Config` (logging settings), `fabric.runners` (output handling). The `hide()` and `warn()` functions are directly relevant to controlling Fabric's output.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Hardcoded Secrets:** Never hardcode secrets directly in Fabric scripts. This is a direct coding practice related to Fabric usage.
    *   **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables to store secrets and pass them to Fabric (e.g., when creating a `Connection` object).
    *   **Secrets Management:** Use a dedicated secrets management system, and retrieve secrets *within* your Fabric code.
    *   **Controlled Logging:** Configure Fabric's logging (using `fabric.Config`) to avoid printing sensitive information. Use Fabric's `hide()` function to suppress specific output from Fabric commands.
    *   **Output Redaction:** Implement output redaction to automatically remove or mask sensitive data from logs and console output *generated by Fabric*.
    *   **Key-Based Authentication:** Prefer SSH key-based authentication over password authentication. The *choice* of authentication method is configured within Fabric.

## Threat: [Unauthorized File Transfer via `put()`/`get()` (Fabric-Initiated)](./threats/unauthorized_file_transfer_via__put____get_____fabric-initiated_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the system running Fabric and uses *Fabric's* `put()` or `get()` functions to upload malicious files to the remote server or download sensitive files from it. This leverages Fabric's capabilities for malicious purposes.
*   **Impact:** Data exfiltration (using Fabric's `get()`) or introduction of malware/backdoors (using Fabric's `put()`).
*   **Affected Fabric Component:** `fabric.transfer.Transfer.put()`, `fabric.transfer.Transfer.get()`. These are the *direct* Fabric functions being misused.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Fabric Host:** Protect the machine running the Fabric code. While not *directly* a Fabric issue, it's the prerequisite for this attack.
    *   **Least Privilege (on Fabric Host):** Limit the permissions of the user running the Fabric code on the *local* machine.
    *   **File Integrity Checks:** Implement manual checksum verification (as described previously) for files transferred using Fabric's `put()` and `get()` functions. This involves adding code *around* the Fabric calls.
    *   **Restricted File Paths:** Limit the file paths that Fabric can access (both local and remote) within your Fabric scripts. Avoid using overly broad or wildcard paths *when calling* `put()` and `get()`.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (Impacting Fabric)](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities__impacting_fabric_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises a dependency of *Fabric* (e.g., Paramiko, Invoke) and injects malicious code. This code is then executed when Fabric is used, impacting any application that uses Fabric.
*   **Impact:** Potentially arbitrary code execution on both the local machine running Fabric and the remote servers accessed by Fabric, depending on the nature of the compromised dependency.
*   **Affected Fabric Component:** The entire Fabric library and its dependencies (especially Paramiko and Invoke). This is a threat *to* Fabric itself.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Pinning:** Use a dependency management system and pin Fabric and all its dependencies to specific, known-good versions. This is a best practice for *any* project, but it's crucial for mitigating supply chain attacks against Fabric.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Regularly update Fabric and its dependencies to address security vulnerabilities. This is a proactive measure to protect against known vulnerabilities in Fabric or its dependencies.
    *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Use an SCA tool to identify vulnerable dependencies of Fabric and track security advisories.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan your project's dependencies (including Fabric) for known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Virtual Environments:** Use virtual environments to isolate project dependencies (including Fabric) and prevent conflicts.
