This is the ultimate goal and encompasses all subsequent attack vectors. Successful exploitation at any lower node can lead to this goal.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in opencv-python Library](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_opencv-python_library.md)

Directly targeting vulnerabilities within the `opencv-python` library itself. This is a broad category covering various types of weaknesses in the library's code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Processing Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_processing_vulnerabilities.md)

Focusing on vulnerabilities that arise when `opencv-python` processes external input, specifically images and videos. Input processing is a common source of security issues in media libraries.

## Attack Tree Path: [Image Format Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/image_format_vulnerabilities.md)

Vulnerabilities specifically related to the handling of different image formats (JPEG, PNG, TIFF, etc.). These often stem from complex decoding logic and format parsing.

## Attack Tree Path: [Video Format Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/video_format_vulnerabilities.md)

Vulnerabilities related to handling video formats (MP4, AVI, MKV, etc.), including container parsing and codec decoding. Video processing is generally more complex than image processing, increasing the potential for vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerabilities in External Libraries Used by OpenCV](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerabilities_in_external_libraries_used_by_opencv.md)

OpenCV relies on external libraries for image and video codec support (e.g., libjpeg, libpng, FFmpeg). Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited through OpenCV.

*   **Mechanism:**  Allows attackers to directly control the input to OpenCV, making it trivial to trigger any underlying OpenCV vulnerabilities by providing malicious files or data.
*   **Impact:** Code execution, Denial of Service (DoS), Information Disclosure - inherits all vulnerabilities of OpenCV input processing.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insufficient Input Validation/Sanitization Before OpenCV Processing](./attack_tree_paths/insufficient_input_validationsanitization_before_opencv_processing.md)
