### Vulnerability List

#### Vulnerability 1: Default Elasticsearch Credentials

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Default Elasticsearch Credentials
*   **Description:**
    The `runtests.py` script, used for running tests in the `django-elasticsearch-dsl` project, hardcodes default credentials for Elasticsearch ("elastic" and "changeme"). If the environment variables `ELASTICSEARCH_USERNAME` and `ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD` are not explicitly set, the test suite will use these default credentials to connect to the Elasticsearch instance. If a user were to copy this testing setup or if these defaults were inadvertently used in a production environment (e.g., by directly using code from `runtests.py` or similar configuration patterns without overriding defaults), it would expose the Elasticsearch instance to unauthorized access using these well-known credentials.
    Step by step trigger:
    1.  An attacker identifies a publicly accessible instance of an application that uses `django-elasticsearch-dsl` and is configured to use default Elasticsearch credentials, either directly or by mimicking the configuration pattern from `runtests.py`.
    2.  The attacker attempts to authenticate to the Elasticsearch instance using the username "elastic" and password "changeme".
    3.  If the Elasticsearch instance is configured to allow basic authentication and the default credentials have not been changed, the attacker successfully authenticates.
*   **Impact:**
    Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an external attacker to gain unauthorized access to the Elasticsearch instance. Depending on the Elasticsearch configuration and the data stored within, this could lead to:
    *   **Data Breach:** Access to sensitive data indexed in Elasticsearch.
    *   **Data Manipulation:** Modification or deletion of indexed data.
    *   **Service Disruption:** Potential to disrupt the Elasticsearch service, affecting application functionality reliant on it.
*   **Vulnerability Rank:** High
*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    No explicit mitigation is implemented in the provided code to prevent the use of default credentials in production. The `runtests.py` script is intended for testing and not for production deployment.
*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   **Removal of Default Credentials:** The default username and password in `runtests.py` should be removed or replaced with a randomly generated, secure value.
    *   **Security Warning in Documentation:** Documentation should explicitly warn against using default credentials in production environments and highlight the importance of configuring strong, unique credentials for Elasticsearch.
    *   **Configuration Best Practices in Examples:** Example configurations should demonstrate secure credential management, such as using environment variables and avoiding default values.
*   **Preconditions:**
    *   A publicly accessible instance of an application using `django-elasticsearch-dsl` is configured to connect to an Elasticsearch instance.
    *   The Elasticsearch connection configuration, either directly or indirectly (e.g., through copied configurations from testing), relies on the default credentials ("elastic", "changeme") for authentication.
    *   Basic authentication is enabled on the Elasticsearch instance.
*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    1.  **File: `/code/runtests.py`**
    2.  **Function: `make_parser()`**: Defines command-line arguments, including `--elasticsearch-username` and `--elasticsearch-password`.
    3.  **Function: `run_tests(*test_args)`**: Parses command-line arguments.
    4.  **Lines 112-119**:
        ```python
        username = args.elasticsearch_username or "elastic"
        password = args.elasticsearch_password or "changeme"
        os.environ.setdefault(
            'ELASTICSEARCH_USERNAME', username
        )
        os.environ.setdefault(
            'ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD', password
        )
        ```
        These lines demonstrate the assignment of default values "elastic" and "changeme" to `username` and `password` if the corresponding command-line arguments are not provided. These values are then set as environment variables.
    5.  **Function: `get_settings(signal_processor)`**: Retrieves Elasticsearch connection settings.
    6.  **Lines 16-23**:
        ```python
        elasticsearch_dsl_default_settings = {
            'hosts': os.environ.get(
                'ELASTICSEARCH_URL',
                'https://127.0.0.1:9200'
            ),
            'basic_auth': (
                os.environ.get('ELASTICSEARCH_USERNAME'),
                os.environ.get('ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD')
            )
        }
        ```
        These lines show how the `basic_auth` setting in `elasticsearch_dsl_default_settings` is populated directly from the environment variables `ELASTICSEARCH_USERNAME` and `ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD`, which can default to "elastic" and "changeme".

*   **Security Test Case:**
    1.  **Setup Elasticsearch:** Set up an Elasticsearch instance with basic authentication enabled. Do not configure any specific users or roles, relying on default Elasticsearch setup which often includes a default `elastic` user.
    2.  **Run Test Application (Simulated):** Simulate a Django application using `django-elasticsearch-dsl` that is configured to use Elasticsearch and whose configuration for Elasticsearch credentials is unintentionally or carelessly derived from or similar to the `runtests.py` script, thus relying on default credentials if environment variables are not set. For example, configure `ELASTICSEARCH_DSL` in Django settings as follows, mirroring the logic in `runtests.py`:
        ```python
        import os
        ELASTICSEARCH_DSL = {
            'default': {
                'hosts': os.environ.get('ELASTICSEARCH_URL', 'https://127.0.0.1:9200'),
                'http_auth': (
                    os.environ.get('ELASTICSEARCH_USERNAME', 'elastic'), # defaults to 'elastic'
                    os.environ.get('ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD', 'changeme')  # defaults to 'changeme'
                )
            }
        }
        ```
    3.  **Attempt Authentication:** Using `curl` or a similar tool, attempt to access the Elasticsearch API endpoint (e.g., `/`) by providing basic authentication credentials. Use username "elastic" and password "changeme".
        ```bash
        curl -u elastic:changeme http://<elasticsearch-host>:<elasticsearch-port>/
        ```
    4.  **Verify Successful Authentication:** If the request returns a `200 OK` status code and a JSON response from Elasticsearch, it indicates successful authentication using the default credentials, confirming the vulnerability. If authentication fails (e.g., `401 Unauthorized`), ensure that basic authentication is indeed enabled on the Elasticsearch instance and re-verify the configuration.
