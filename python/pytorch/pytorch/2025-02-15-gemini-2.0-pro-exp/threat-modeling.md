# Threat Model Analysis for pytorch/pytorch

## Threat: [Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Model](./threats/arbitrary_code_execution_via_malicious_model.md)

*   **Threat:** Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Model
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious PyTorch model file. When loaded using `torch.load()`, the file contains embedded code (often leveraging Python's `pickle` vulnerabilities) that executes arbitrary commands on the system. The attacker might upload this file through a web form, a file sharing service, or any other means that allows them to get the target system to load the file.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise. The attacker gains full control over the server, allowing data theft, data modification, installation of malware, denial of service, and lateral movement within the network.
    *   **Affected Component:** `torch.load()`, `torch.save()` (indirectly, as it creates the files that can be exploited), and any custom code that uses Python's `pickle` module for serialization/deserialization of PyTorch objects.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **1. Never Load Untrusted Models:** Only load models from sources you completely trust and control.
        *   **2. Safer Serialization:** Explore alternatives like ONNX, but still validate the source and integrity.
        *   **3. Hash Verification:** Before loading, verify the model file's hash against a known-good hash.
        *   **4. Sandboxing:** Load models in isolated environments (containers, VMs) with restricted privileges.
        *   **5. Input Validation:** If user input influences the model loading path, rigorously validate and sanitize it.
        *   **6. Limit `pickle` Usage:** Avoid using `pickle` directly for any untrusted data.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion (Model Loading)](./threats/denial_of_service_via_resource_exhaustion__model_loading_.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion (Model Loading)
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides an extremely large or complex model file.  When the application attempts to load this model (using `torch.load()`), it consumes excessive memory or CPU, causing the application or even the entire system to become unresponsive.
    *   **Impact:** Application unavailability. Users cannot access the service.
    *   **Affected Component:** `torch.load()`, memory management components of PyTorch and the underlying operating system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **1. File Size Limits:** Enforce strict limits on the size of uploaded model files.
        *   **2. Resource Limits:** Set CPU and memory limits on the process that loads the model.
        *   **3. Timeouts:** Implement timeouts for the model loading operation.  Terminate if it takes too long.
        *   **4. Asynchronous Loading:** Load models asynchronously to avoid blocking the main application thread.

## Threat: [Adversarial Example Attack](./threats/adversarial_example_attack.md)

*   **Threat:** Adversarial Example Attack
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a specially designed input (e.g., an image, text, or other data) that is subtly modified.  This modification is imperceptible to humans but causes the PyTorch model to make an incorrect prediction.  For example, a slightly altered image of a stop sign might be classified as a speed limit sign.
    *   **Impact:** Incorrect model predictions. The consequences depend on the application.  It could lead to misclassification, incorrect recommendations, bypassing security systems, or other undesirable outcomes.
    *   **Affected Component:** The trained PyTorch model itself (any model, regardless of architecture), the inference process (`model(input)` or equivalent).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical in security-sensitive applications)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **1. Adversarial Training:** Train the model with both normal and adversarial examples.
        *   **2. Input Preprocessing:** Normalize, sanitize, and apply outlier detection to inputs.
        *   **3. Defensive Distillation:** Train a second model to mimic the first, increasing robustness.
        *   **4. Ensemble Methods:** Use multiple models and combine their predictions.
        *   **5. Anomaly Detection:** Monitor model outputs and confidence scores for unusual patterns.

## Threat: [Compromised Worker in Distributed Training](./threats/compromised_worker_in_distributed_training.md)

*   **Threat:** Compromised Worker in Distributed Training
    *   **Description:** In a distributed training setup, an attacker gains control of one or more worker nodes.  The compromised worker sends malicious model updates (gradients) to the parameter server, poisoning the global model.
    *   **Impact:** Degraded model accuracy, biased predictions, or complete model failure. The attacker can subtly manipulate the model's behavior.
    *   **Affected Component:** `torch.distributed`, the parameter server, and the communication mechanisms between workers and the server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **1. Secure Communication:** Use TLS/SSL for all communication between workers and the parameter server.
        *   **2. Authentication:** Implement strong authentication for all worker nodes.
        *   **3. Byzantine Fault Tolerance:** Use training algorithms that are robust to malicious workers.
        *   **4. Update Validation:** Validate updates from workers before applying them to the global model.

## Threat: [Data Poisoning in Distributed Training](./threats/data_poisoning_in_distributed_training.md)

*   **Threat:** Data Poisoning in Distributed Training
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to a portion of the training data used in a distributed training setup. The attacker modifies or injects malicious data points into this subset.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to a compromised worker: degraded model accuracy, biased predictions, or model failure.
    *   **Affected Component:** The training data itself, `torch.utils.data.DataLoader`, and any data preprocessing steps.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **1. Data Sanitization:** Carefully inspect and clean the training data before use.
        *   **2. Outlier Detection:** Use statistical methods to identify and remove anomalous data points.
        *   **3. Robust Training Algorithms:** Explore algorithms less susceptible to poisoned data.
        *   **4. Data Provenance:** Track the origin and history of all training data.
