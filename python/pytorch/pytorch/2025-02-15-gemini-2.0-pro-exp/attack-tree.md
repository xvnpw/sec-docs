## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.1 Craft Malicious Input Tensor (Oversized/Specially Shaped)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_1_craft_malicious_input_tensor__oversizedspecially_shaped_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker sends a specially crafted input tensor (e.g., extremely large dimensions, unusual data types, or specific shapes known to cause issues) to the application.
    *   **Mechanism:** The application passes this tensor to PyTorch, which attempts to allocate memory for it. Due to the malicious nature of the tensor, PyTorch (or underlying libraries like CUDA) fails to handle the allocation gracefully, leading to an Out-of-Memory (OOM) error.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, service unavailability.
    *   **Mitigation:** Strict input validation (size, type, shape checks), resource limits, sandboxing.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.2 Trigger Excessive Memory Allocation via API Misuse](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_2_trigger_excessive_memory_allocation_via_api_misuse.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker exploits the application's logic to repeatedly call PyTorch memory allocation functions (e.g., `torch.randn`, `torch.zeros`, `torch.tensor`) with large dimensions or in a tight loop, without proper deallocation.
    *   **Mechanism:**  The attacker abuses legitimate API calls, but in a way that leads to uncontrolled memory consumption.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, service unavailability.
    *   **Mitigation:** Input validation, rate limiting, resource limits, careful memory management in application code.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2.1 Craft Malicious Input for Computationally Expensive Operations](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_1_craft_malicious_input_for_computationally_expensive_operations.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker provides input that is designed to trigger the worst-case performance for specific PyTorch operations (e.g., convolutions with specific filter sizes and strides, large matrix multiplications with particular dimensions).
    *   **Mechanism:** The attacker leverages knowledge of PyTorch's internal algorithms to force computationally intensive operations, consuming excessive CPU resources.
    *   **Impact:** Application slowdown or crash, service degradation.
    *   **Mitigation:** Input validation (complexity analysis), timeouts for PyTorch operations, resource limits.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.3.1 (GPU) Craft Malicious Input Tensor (Oversized/Specially Shaped)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_3_1__gpu__craft_malicious_input_tensor__oversizedspecially_shaped_.md)

*   **Description:**  Same as 1.1.1.1, but specifically targeting GPU memory.
    *   **Mechanism:** The attacker sends a tensor that exceeds the available GPU memory, causing a GPU OOM error.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, GPU-related processes crash.
    *   **Mitigation:** Strict input validation (size, type, shape checks), GPU resource limits, sandboxing.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1 `torch.load` with Untrusted Data (Pickle/Unpickle)](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1__torch_load__with_untrusted_data__pickleunpickle_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker provides a malicious PyTorch model file to the application, which is then loaded using `torch.load`. This file contains a crafted pickled object.
    *   **Mechanism:** Python's pickle deserialization is inherently unsafe.  The malicious file contains a pickled object with a custom `__reduce__` method. When `torch.load` deserializes the object, the `__reduce__` method is executed, allowing the attacker to run arbitrary Python code.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise. The attacker gains full control over the application server.
    *   **Mitigation:** *Never* load models from untrusted sources. Use safer serialization formats (if possible), strict whitelisting of allowed classes during deserialization (though still risky), input validation, sandboxing.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.1 Exploit Bugs in Tensor Operations](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_1_exploit_bugs_in_tensor_operations.md)

* **Description:** Attacker crafts specific input tensors that, when processed by PyTorch's core tensor operations, trigger a buffer overflow or underflow due to a bug in the underlying C++/CUDA code.
    * **Mechanism:** Exploits a memory safety vulnerability in PyTorch's low-level implementation.
    * **Impact:** Complete system compromise.
    * **Mitigation:** Keep PyTorch updated, rigorous input validation, fuzz testing of PyTorch itself (responsibility of PyTorch developers, but application developers should be aware).

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.2 Exploit Bugs in Custom C++/CUDA Extensions](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_2_exploit_bugs_in_custom_c++cuda_extensions.md)

*   **Description:** If the application uses custom C++/CUDA extensions, the attacker exploits a buffer overflow/underflow vulnerability within that custom code.
    *   **Mechanism:** Exploits a memory safety vulnerability in the *application's* custom code, not PyTorch itself.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise.
    *   **Mitigation:** Secure coding practices for C++/CUDA, memory safety tools (AddressSanitizer, Valgrind), thorough code review and auditing.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.3.1 Exploit Bugs in the JIT Compiler](./attack_tree_paths/2_3_1_exploit_bugs_in_the_jit_compiler.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker provides malicious TorchScript code that, when compiled by the JIT compiler, triggers a bug that leads to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Mechanism:** Exploits a vulnerability in the TorchScript JIT compiler itself.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise.
    *   **Mitigation:** Keep PyTorch updated, be cautious with untrusted TorchScript code, sandboxing.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.3.2 Bypass JIT Security Checks](./attack_tree_paths/2_3_2_bypass_jit_security_checks.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker finds a way to circumvent the security checks designed to prevent malicious code from being JIT-compiled.
    *   **Mechanism:** Exploits a flaw in the JIT compiler's security mechanisms.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise.
    *   **Mitigation:** Keep PyTorch updated, be cautious with untrusted TorchScript code, sandboxing.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.4.1 Exploit vulnerabilities in libraries PyTorch depends on (e.g., NumPy, CUDA, cuDNN, etc.)](./attack_tree_paths/2_4_1_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_libraries_pytorch_depends_on__e_g___numpy__cuda__cudnn__etc__.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker exploits a known vulnerability in one of PyTorch's dependencies (e.g., a buffer overflow in NumPy, a privilege escalation in CUDA).
    *   **Mechanism:** Leverages a vulnerability in a library that PyTorch uses.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise (depending on the specific vulnerability and dependency).
    *   **Mitigation:** Keep all dependencies up to date, use a dependency vulnerability scanner.
