│   └───[AND]─ Model Backdoor Exploitation (Note: While Model Backdoor Exploitation is a serious threat, the path to *injection* of a backdoored model falls under "Malicious Model Injection" which is already highlighted as high-risk.  Exploitation *after* injection is assumed to be a consequence if injection is successful. For brevity in this *high-risk focused* sub-tree, we are primarily focusing on the *injection* paths.)

├───[OR]─ Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]
│   ├───[AND]─ Vulnerable Python Dependencies [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]
│   │   ├───[OR]─ Outdated Python Packages (NumPy, SciPy, etc.) [HIGH-RISK PATH]
│   │   │   └─── Lack of Dependency Management and Security Scanning [HIGH-RISK PATH]
│   │   └───[OR]─ Known Vulnerabilities in Dependencies [HIGH-RISK PATH]
│   │       └─── Publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in PyTorch's Python dependencies [HIGH-RISK PATH]
│   └───[AND]─ Vulnerable Native Libraries [CRITICAL NODE] (Note: While Vulnerable Native Libraries is a CRITICAL NODE, the path itself is not marked as HIGH-RISK PATH in the same way as Python Dependencies because exploitation often requires more system-level access and is slightly less direct for application compromise compared to Python dependencies. However, it remains a critical area for security.)

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Model Loading Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_model_loading_vulnerabilities__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target the process of loading PyTorch models into the application. If this process is not secure, it can be exploited to introduce malicious code or manipulate the application's behavior.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   **Malicious Model Injection [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Injecting a malicious PyTorch model into the application's model loading pipeline. This malicious model, when loaded and used by the application, can execute arbitrary code, exfiltrate data, or disrupt operations.
        *   **Untrusted Model Source [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Loading models from sources that are not verified or controlled by the application owner. This opens the door to attackers providing malicious models.
                *   **Compromise Model Repository/Storage:**
                    *   **Attack Vector:** If the repository or storage where models are kept has weak access controls, attackers can compromise it, replacing legitimate models with malicious ones.
                    *   **Weak Access Controls on Model Storage:**  Lack of proper authentication, authorization, or access logging on model storage.
                *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attack on Model Download:**
                    *   **Attack Vector:** Intercepting the download of a model in transit and replacing it with a malicious version.
                    *   **Lack of HTTPS/Integrity Checks during Model Download:**  Downloading models over insecure HTTP without verifying their integrity (e.g., using checksums or digital signatures) makes MITM attacks feasible.
                *   **Social Engineering to Load Malicious Model [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
                    *   **Attack Vector:** Tricking users or administrators into manually loading a malicious model provided by the attacker.
                    *   **Phishing/Deception to trick users into loading attacker-provided model [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**  Using phishing emails, deceptive websites, or social manipulation to convince users to download and load a malicious model.
        *   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Model Loading [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the deserialization process used by PyTorch to load models (e.g., using `pickle` or `torch.load`). These vulnerabilities can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code when a malicious model file is loaded.
            *   **Exploit Pickle/Torch.load Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:**  Leveraging known vulnerabilities in Python's `pickle` module or PyTorch's `torch.load` function, especially in older PyTorch versions.
                *   **Outdated PyTorch Version with known Pickle vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Using an outdated PyTorch version that has known and publicly documented deserialization vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Python packages and native libraries that PyTorch depends on. If these dependencies are outdated or have known vulnerabilities, attackers can leverage them to compromise the application.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   **Vulnerable Python Dependencies [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in Python packages like NumPy, SciPy, or other libraries used by PyTorch or the application.
        *   **Outdated Python Packages (NumPy, SciPy, etc.) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Using outdated versions of Python packages that contain known vulnerabilities.
            *   **Lack of Dependency Management and Security Scanning [HIGH-RISK PATH]::**  Failure to properly manage dependencies and regularly scan them for known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Known Vulnerabilities in Dependencies [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Directly exploiting publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in PyTorch's Python dependencies.
            *   **Publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in PyTorch's Python dependencies [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**  Taking advantage of known vulnerabilities that have been publicly documented and for which exploits may be readily available.
    *   **Vulnerable Native Libraries [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in native libraries like BLAS, LAPACK, or system-level libraries that PyTorch depends on at the operating system level.
        *   **Outdated Native Libraries (BLAS, LAPACK, etc.):**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Using outdated versions of native libraries that contain known vulnerabilities.
            *   **Lack of System Updates and Library Management:**  Failure to keep the operating system and its libraries updated with security patches.
        *   **Known Vulnerabilities in Native Libraries:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Directly exploiting publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in native libraries that PyTorch relies on.
            *   **Publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in libraries PyTorch depends on at the OS level:** Taking advantage of known vulnerabilities in system libraries that have been publicly documented and for which exploits may be available.
