# Threat Model Analysis for pytorch/pytorch

## Threat: [Malicious Model Injection](./threats/malicious_model_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious PyTorch model file (e.g., `.pth`, `.pt`) and tricks the application into loading it using `torch.load`. This model contains embedded code that executes during deserialization, allowing the attacker to gain control of the server or client.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), data exfiltration, denial of service, full system compromise.
*   **Affected PyTorch Component:** `torch.load` function, model serialization/deserialization mechanism.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strictly** load models only from trusted and verified sources.
    *   Implement robust input validation on model file paths and origins, rejecting any untrusted sources.
    *   Prefer `torch.jit.load` with scripting enabled when possible, as it offers a safer loading mechanism.
    *   Enforce sandboxing or containerization to isolate model loading processes and limit potential damage from malicious models.
    *   Consider code review of model loading logic and ensure no dynamic path manipulation is used.

## Threat: [Model Poisoning via Backdoor Injection](./threats/model_poisoning_via_backdoor_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects a backdoor into a PyTorch model, either during training or by modifying a pre-trained model. This backdoor is designed to be triggered by specific, attacker-chosen inputs, causing the model to misbehave in a way that benefits the attacker (e.g., misclassify critical data, leak information). While the model *loading* itself might be safe, the *model content* is malicious and exploitable during inference.
*   **Impact:** Data integrity compromise, model misclassification leading to critical application errors, potential data leakage based on backdoored outputs, subtle manipulation of application functionality that might go unnoticed for extended periods.
*   **Affected PyTorch Component:** Model architecture, model weights, training process (if models are trained in-house and attacker can influence training data or process).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rigorous verification** of the provenance and integrity of pre-trained models, even from seemingly reputable sources. Consider cryptographic signatures or checksums if available.
    *   Implement model robustness techniques and anomaly detection during inference to identify suspicious model behavior that might indicate a backdoor is being triggered.
    *   If training models in-house, secure the training data, training environment, and training pipeline to prevent unauthorized modifications or data poisoning.
    *   Employ techniques like input sanitization and monitoring of model outputs for unexpected patterns.
    *   Regularly retrain and re-evaluate models, especially if using external or user-provided data for fine-tuning.

## Threat: [Malicious PyTorch Distribution or Installation](./threats/malicious_pytorch_distribution_or_installation.md)

*   **Description:** If PyTorch is installed from unofficial or compromised sources (e.g., malicious PyPI mirrors, compromised package repositories, phishing attacks), the installed PyTorch library itself could be backdoored or contain malicious code. This means the core PyTorch library itself is compromised from the moment of installation.
*   **Impact:** Full system compromise, data theft, remote control of the application server or client, complete application takeover as the core library is compromised, making all PyTorch operations potentially malicious.
*   **Affected PyTorch Component:** PyTorch installation process, core library, all PyTorch functionalities become untrusted.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always** install PyTorch **only** from official and highly trusted sources like `pytorch.org` or the official PyPI repository using `pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118`.
    *   Utilize package integrity verification mechanisms provided by package managers (e.g., `pip`'s hash checking, package signing) to ensure the integrity of downloaded packages.
    *   Implement secure software supply chain practices, including verifying package sources and using trusted infrastructure for development and deployment.
    *   Consider using dependency scanning tools to detect any anomalies in installed packages.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Custom C++/CUDA Operators](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_custom_c++cuda_operators.md)

*   **Description:** If the application utilizes custom C++ or CUDA operators built as PyTorch extensions, vulnerabilities within this custom code can be introduced. These vulnerabilities could stem from memory safety issues (buffer overflows, use-after-free), logic errors, or insecure interactions with PyTorch internals. Exploiting these vulnerabilities in custom operators can lead to severe consequences as they run with the privileges of the PyTorch process.
*   **Impact:** Memory corruption, crashes, remote code execution, privilege escalation (within the PyTorch process context), application instability, potential for bypassing security boundaries if custom operators handle sensitive data or operations.
*   **Affected PyTorch Component:** Custom C++/CUDA operators, PyTorch C++ API, extension mechanisms, interaction between Python frontend and C++ backend.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory** application of secure coding practices during the development of custom operators, with a strong focus on memory safety and input validation in C/C++ and CUDA code.
    *   **Rigorous code reviews** and security testing specifically targeting custom operators. This should include static analysis, dynamic analysis (fuzzing), and penetration testing focused on operator inputs and outputs.
    *   Utilize memory safety tools and techniques like address sanitizers (AddressSanitizer, MemorySanitizer) during development and testing to detect memory errors early.
    *   Minimize the use of custom operators whenever feasible, relying on well-vetted and officially maintained PyTorch built-in operators and functionalities.
    *   If custom operators are necessary, ensure they are developed by experienced security-conscious developers and undergo thorough security audits before deployment.
