# Attack Tree Analysis for pytorch/pytorch

Objective: Attacker's Goal: To execute arbitrary code within the application or gain unauthorized access to sensitive data by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the PyTorch library or its usage (focusing on high-risk areas).

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Application loads untrusted model files](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_application_loads_untrusted_model_files.md)

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts a malicious PyTorch model and manages to get the application to load it. This could be through various means, such as tricking an administrator, exploiting a file upload vulnerability, or compromising a model repository.
    * **Critical Node: Supply Malicious Model:** This node represents the point where the attacker successfully provides the malicious model to the application. It's critical because it's the direct trigger for this high-risk path.
    * **Critical Node: Exploit Model Vulnerabilities:** This higher-level node is critical because it encompasses all attacks related to manipulating or exploiting the models used by the application, with supplying a malicious model being a primary concern.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Identify and leverage publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in the specific PyTorch version used by the application](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_identify_and_leverage_publicly_disclosed_vulnerabilities_in_the_specific_pytorch_vers_4c72b372.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The application uses an outdated version of PyTorch with known security vulnerabilities. Attackers can find and exploit these publicly documented flaws to gain unauthorized access or execute code.
    * **Critical Node: Identify and leverage publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in the specific PyTorch version used by the application:** This node represents the successful identification and exploitation of a known vulnerability. It's critical because it directly leads to compromising the application through a known weakness.
    * **Critical Node: Exploit PyTorch Framework Vulnerabilities:** This higher-level node is critical because it encompasses all attacks that target weaknesses within the PyTorch framework itself, with known vulnerabilities being a significant and often easily exploitable category.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Target vulnerabilities in libraries that PyTorch depends on](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_target_vulnerabilities_in_libraries_that_pytorch_depends_on.md)

* **Attack Vector:** PyTorch relies on various other libraries (e.g., NumPy, SciPy). If these dependencies have vulnerabilities, attackers can exploit them to compromise the application, even if PyTorch itself is secure.
    * **Critical Node: Target vulnerabilities in libraries that PyTorch depends on:** This node represents the successful exploitation of a vulnerability in a PyTorch dependency. It's critical because it highlights the risk of the application's security being undermined by external components.
    * **Critical Node: Exploit PyTorch Framework Vulnerabilities:** As above, this higher-level node is critical because it includes attacks targeting the broader ecosystem of PyTorch, including its dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Application deserializes arbitrary data using PyTorch's serialization mechanisms](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_application_deserializes_arbitrary_data_using_pytorch's_serialization_mechanisms.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The application uses `torch.load` or similar functions to deserialize data from untrusted sources without proper validation. Attackers can craft malicious serialized data that, when deserialized, executes arbitrary code.
    * **Critical Node: Application deserializes arbitrary data using PyTorch's serialization mechanisms:** This node represents the dangerous action of deserializing untrusted data. It's critical because it directly opens the door to remote code execution.
    * **Critical Node: Leverage Unsafe Deserialization:** This node highlights the risky practice of using deserialization without proper security measures.
    * **Critical Node: Exploit Insecure Usage of PyTorch Features:** This higher-level node is critical because it encompasses vulnerabilities arising from how the application *uses* PyTorch features, rather than flaws within PyTorch itself. Unsafe deserialization is a prime example of such misuse.
