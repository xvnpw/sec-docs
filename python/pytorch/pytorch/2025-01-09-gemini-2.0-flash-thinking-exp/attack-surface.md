# Attack Surface Analysis for pytorch/pytorch

## Attack Surface: [Pickle Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/pickle_deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Loading serialized Python objects (often PyTorch models saved with `torch.save`) from untrusted sources can lead to arbitrary code execution. The `pickle` module is inherently insecure when used with untrusted data.
*   **How PyTorch Contributes:** PyTorch's default mechanism for saving and loading models (`torch.save` and `torch.load`) uses the `pickle` module. This makes it a common and convenient, but potentially dangerous, practice.
*   **Example:** An attacker provides a seemingly legitimate PyTorch model file that, upon loading with `torch.load`, executes malicious code embedded within the pickled data.
*   **Impact:** Critical - Full system compromise, data exfiltration, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid using `torch.load` on untrusted data.
    *   Prefer safer alternatives like TorchScript for model serialization when dealing with external sources.
    *   If `pickle` is unavoidable, carefully vet the source of the model and consider sandboxing the loading process.
    *   Implement integrity checks (e.g., cryptographic signatures) for model files.

## Attack Surface: [Loading Untrusted TorchScript Models](./attack_surfaces/loading_untrusted_torchscript_models.md)

*   **Description:** While safer than `pickle`, loading TorchScript models from untrusted sources using `torch.jit.load` can still present risks if the TorchScript code is crafted maliciously to exploit potential vulnerabilities in the TorchScript interpreter or runtime.
*   **How PyTorch Contributes:** PyTorch provides `torch.jit.load` as a way to load pre-compiled models, which can be more efficient but introduces a new potential attack vector if the source is untrusted.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious TorchScript model that, when loaded, triggers a bug in the JIT compiler or runtime, leading to unexpected behavior or potential code execution.
*   **Impact:** High - Potential for code execution within the PyTorch environment, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Only load TorchScript models from trusted sources.
    *   Implement checks or sandboxing when loading TorchScript from external sources.
    *   Keep PyTorch updated to benefit from security patches in the TorchScript compiler and runtime.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Data Handling Libraries](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_data_handling_libraries.md)

*   **Description:** PyTorch often integrates with libraries like `torchvision` or `torchaudio` for data loading and preprocessing. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited through the PyTorch application.
*   **How PyTorch Contributes:** By relying on these external libraries, PyTorch indirectly inherits their potential security vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability in the image decoding library used by `torchvision` could be exploited by providing a specially crafted image file.
*   **Impact:** High - Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to denial of service, information disclosure, or even code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep PyTorch and all its dependencies updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using security scanning tools.
    *   Consider using dependency management tools that provide vulnerability alerts.
