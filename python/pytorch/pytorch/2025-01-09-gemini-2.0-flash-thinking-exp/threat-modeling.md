# Threat Model Analysis for pytorch/pytorch

## Threat: [Malicious Model Injection](./threats/malicious_model_injection.md)

**Threat:** Malicious Model Injection

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads or replaces a legitimate PyTorch model file with a malicious one. When the application loads and uses this model, the attacker's code within the model is executed. This could involve arbitrary code execution on the server, data exfiltration, or denial of service. The attacker might exploit vulnerabilities in the model loading process or gain unauthorized access to model storage.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the server hosting the application, including data breaches, service disruption, and potential reputational damage.
*   **Affected PyTorch Component:** `torch.load` function, potentially custom model loading logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict access controls on model storage locations.
    *   Verify the integrity and source of model files using cryptographic signatures or checksums before loading.
    *   Sanitize or isolate the environment where `torch.load` is executed.
    *   Consider using a dedicated model serving infrastructure with security hardening.
    *   Regularly scan model files for known malicious patterns.

## Threat: [Deserialization Vulnerability in Model Loading](./threats/deserialization_vulnerability_in_model_loading.md)

**Threat:** Deserialization Vulnerability in Model Loading

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious serialized PyTorch model file that exploits vulnerabilities in the `torch.load` function's deserialization process. Upon loading this file, the attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the server. This is similar to pickle vulnerabilities in Python.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the server hosting the application, including data breaches, service disruption, and potential reputational damage.
*   **Affected PyTorch Component:** `torch.load` function, underlying serialization libraries.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid loading models from untrusted sources.
    *   If loading from external sources is necessary, implement rigorous validation and sanitization of the model files before loading.
    *   Keep PyTorch updated to the latest version, as newer versions may contain fixes for deserialization vulnerabilities.
    *   Consider alternative, safer serialization methods if applicable.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Native Extensions](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_native_extensions.md)

**Threat:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Native Extensions

*   **Description:** PyTorch utilizes native extensions (often written in C++) for performance. Bugs or vulnerabilities within these extensions could be exploited by an attacker to gain control of the application or the underlying system. This could involve providing specific inputs that trigger memory corruption or other exploitable conditions in the native code.
*   **Impact:** Potential for arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or other forms of system compromise.
*   **Affected PyTorch Component:** Native extensions and C++ backend.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep PyTorch updated to benefit from bug fixes and security patches in native extensions.
    *   Be cautious when using custom or third-party PyTorch extensions.
    *   Consider the security implications when building PyTorch from source or using nightly builds.
