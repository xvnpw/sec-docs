# Threat Model Analysis for pytorch/pytorch

## Threat: [Malicious Model Loading](./threats/malicious_model_loading.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious PyTorch model file (e.g., `.pth`, `.pt`) containing embedded code or exploits within the serialization format. When the application loads this model using `torch.load`, the embedded code is executed, or the exploit is triggered, potentially compromising the application or the underlying system. The attacker might achieve this by compromising a model repository, intercepting model downloads, or tricking a user into loading a malicious model. This directly leverages PyTorch's model loading functionality.
* **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server or client machine running the application. This could lead to data breaches, system compromise, installation of malware, or denial of service.
* **Affected Component:** `torch.load` function within the `torch` module, the serialization/deserialization mechanism.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Only load models from trusted and verified sources.
    * Implement strict validation of model files before loading (e.g., checking file signatures or checksums).
    * Consider using a sandboxed environment for model loading and inference.
    * Regularly update PyTorch to benefit from security patches.
    * Implement access controls to protect model storage locations.

## Threat: [Exploiting Serialization/Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploiting_serializationdeserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:**  PyTorch's serialization and deserialization mechanisms (`torch.save`, `torch.load`) can be vulnerable if not handled carefully. An attacker could craft malicious serialized data that, when loaded by the application, exploits underlying vulnerabilities in the serialization process, leading to arbitrary code execution or other security issues. This directly targets PyTorch's built-in serialization features.
* **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, data corruption, denial of service.
* **Affected Component:** `torch.save` and `torch.load` functions within the `torch` module, the underlying `pickle` library (if used by older PyTorch versions or directly).
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Only load serialized data from trusted sources.
    * Be extremely cautious when loading user-provided serialized data.
    * Consider alternative serialization methods or security wrappers if necessary.
    * Keep PyTorch updated to benefit from security patches in the serialization logic.

## Threat: [Exploiting Bugs in PyTorch Itself](./threats/exploiting_bugs_in_pytorch_itself.md)

**Description:**  Vulnerabilities or bugs within the core PyTorch library itself could be exploited by an attacker. This could lead to various security issues, including arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure. The attacker would need to identify and exploit these specific bugs within the PyTorch codebase.
* **Impact:**  Wide range of potential impacts, from application crashes to complete system compromise.
* **Affected Component:** Any part of the PyTorch codebase.
* **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific bug (can be Critical)
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Stay updated with the latest PyTorch releases and security patches.
    * Monitor for reported vulnerabilities and apply necessary updates promptly.
    * Consider using stable, well-tested versions of PyTorch.
