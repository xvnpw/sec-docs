# Attack Surface Analysis for pytorch/pytorch

## Attack Surface: [Unsafe Deserialization of Model Files](./attack_surfaces/unsafe_deserialization_of_model_files.md)

*   **Description:** Loading serialized PyTorch model files (`.pt` or `.pth`) from untrusted sources can lead to arbitrary code execution. The `torch.load()` function uses Python's `pickle` module, which is known to be vulnerable to deserialization attacks.
    *   **How PyTorch Contributes to the Attack Surface:** PyTorch's design relies on serialization for saving and loading models. The `torch.load()` function directly utilizes `pickle`, inheriting its inherent security risks.
    *   **Example:** A malicious actor crafts a `.pt` file containing embedded malicious Python code. When an application uses `torch.load()` on this file, the code is executed during the deserialization process. This could install malware, steal data, or compromise the system.
    *   **Impact:** **Critical**. Remote Code Execution (RCE) allowing full control over the system running the application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Load Models Only from Trusted Sources:**  Strictly control the origin of model files. Only load models from sources you fully trust and have verified.
        *   **Prefer `torch.jit.load()` for Deployment:** For deployment scenarios, convert models to TorchScript and use `torch.jit.load()`. TorchScript has a more restricted execution environment and is less susceptible to arbitrary code execution during loading.
        *   **Implement Integrity Checks:**  Use cryptographic hashes (e.g., SHA256) to verify the integrity of model files before loading them.
        *   **Sandboxing/Isolation:** Run the model loading process in a sandboxed or isolated environment to limit the impact of potential exploits.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom C++ Operators/Extensions](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_c++_operatorsextensions.md)

*   **Description:** When developers create custom C++ operators or extensions for PyTorch using its C++ API (LibTorch), vulnerabilities in this custom code can introduce security risks. These can include memory corruption issues, buffer overflows, or insecure interactions with external libraries.
    *   **How PyTorch Contributes to the Attack Surface:** PyTorch provides the infrastructure for integrating custom C++ code. The security responsibility for this custom code lies with the developer, but vulnerabilities can directly impact the PyTorch application.
    *   **Example:** A custom C++ operator has a buffer overflow vulnerability. When processing a specially crafted input tensor, this vulnerability is triggered, potentially leading to a crash or allowing an attacker to overwrite memory and gain control.
    *   **Impact:** **High**. Potential for crashes, denial of service, memory corruption, and potentially code execution depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding practices when developing custom C++ operators, including careful memory management, bounds checking, and input validation.
        *   **Thorough Testing and Auditing:**  Rigorous testing, including fuzzing, and security audits of custom C++ code are crucial.
        *   **Minimize External Dependencies:** Reduce the number of external libraries used in custom operators and carefully vet those that are necessary.
        *   **Use Safe Language Features:** Where possible, leverage safer C++ features and avoid potentially dangerous constructs.
