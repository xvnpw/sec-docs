## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Model Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_model_vulnerabilities.md)

* Attack Vector: Inject Backdoor into Training Data
    * Description: An attacker manipulates the training dataset to introduce specific patterns or triggers that will cause the trained model to exhibit malicious behavior when those patterns are encountered in real-world use. This could involve subtle alterations to data points that are difficult to detect during normal inspection.
    * Critical Node: Inject Malicious Logic During Model Training
        * Description: This node represents the broader goal of injecting malicious logic into the model during its training phase. Achieving this allows for various types of model poisoning attacks, including backdoors.
    * Critical Node: Compromise Training Environment and Modify Training Scripts
        * Description: Gaining access to the training environment allows an attacker to directly modify the training scripts or infrastructure. This enables the injection of malicious code that becomes part of the model during the training process, a highly effective way to create backdoors or introduce vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities in PyTorch](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_input_handling_vulnerabilities_in_pytorch.md)

* Attack Vector: Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities (if applicable)
    * Description: If the application deserializes PyTorch objects (like models or tensors) from untrusted sources, an attacker can craft malicious serialized data containing executable code. When this data is deserialized, the embedded code is executed, potentially granting the attacker full control over the application.
    * Critical Node: Achieve Remote Code Execution upon Deserialization
        * Description: This node represents the successful exploitation of a deserialization vulnerability, leading to the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server or within the application's environment. This is a critical point of compromise with severe consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Vulnerabilities in PyTorch Libraries or Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_pytorch_libraries_or_dependencies.md)

* Attack Vector: Exploit Known CVEs in PyTorch
    * Description: Attackers can leverage publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) in specific versions of PyTorch. If the application uses a vulnerable version, attackers can use readily available exploits or develop their own to compromise the application.
    * Critical Node: Exploit Known CVEs in PyTorch
        * Description: This node highlights the risk associated with using outdated or vulnerable versions of the PyTorch library. Successful exploitation can lead to various forms of compromise, including remote code execution or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Application's Integration with PyTorch](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_application's_integration_with_pytorch.md)

* Attack Vector: Exploit Unsafe Model Loading Practices
    * Description: If the application loads PyTorch models from untrusted sources without proper verification or sanitization, an attacker can embed malicious code within the model file. When the application loads this malicious model, the embedded code is executed, potentially compromising the application.
    * Critical Node: Execute Malicious Code Embedded in the Model File
        * Description: This node represents the successful execution of malicious code that was embedded within a seemingly legitimate PyTorch model file. This can lead to a wide range of attacks, including gaining unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or further system compromise.
