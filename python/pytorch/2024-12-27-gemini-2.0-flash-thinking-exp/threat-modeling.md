## High and Critical PyTorch Specific Threats

| Threat | Description (Attacker Action & Method) | Impact | Affected PyTorch Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Malicious Model Loading** | An attacker provides a crafted PyTorch model file (e.g., `.pth`, `.pt`) containing malicious code or exploits deserialization vulnerabilities. When the application loads this model using `torch.load()`, the malicious code is executed, or the vulnerability is triggered. | Remote code execution on the server, data exfiltration, system compromise, denial of service. | `torch.load()` function, serialization/deserialization mechanisms (e.g., `pickle`). | **Critical** | - **Verify Model Provenance:** Only load models from trusted sources. Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity and authenticity of models (e.g., digital signatures, checksums). <br> - **Sandboxing/Isolation:** Load and execute models in a sandboxed environment with limited permissions to restrict potential damage. <br> - **Input Validation (Limited):** While difficult for complex models, consider basic checks on the model file structure before loading. <br> - **Regularly Update PyTorch:** Keep PyTorch updated to patch known deserialization vulnerabilities. <br> - **Static Analysis of Models (Research):** Explore and utilize tools that can perform static analysis on PyTorch model files to detect potentially malicious code (this is an evolving area). |
| **Model Poisoning** | An attacker manipulates the training data or process to subtly alter the behavior of a PyTorch model. This can be done by injecting malicious data points, manipulating labels, or compromising the training infrastructure. The resulting model will behave in a way that benefits the attacker (e.g., misclassifying specific inputs, leaking information). | Compromised decision-making, inaccurate results, potential data breaches if the model handles sensitive information, denial of service by causing incorrect actions. | Training loops, data loaders (`torch.utils.data.DataLoader`), loss functions, optimizers. | **High** | - **Data Validation and Sanitization:** Rigorously validate and sanitize training data before use. Implement checks for anomalies and inconsistencies. <br> - **Secure Training Pipelines:** Implement secure and auditable training pipelines with access controls and monitoring. <br> - **Anomaly Detection during Training:** Monitor training metrics (e.g., loss, accuracy) for unexpected deviations that might indicate poisoning. <br> - **Differential Privacy:** Explore and apply differential privacy techniques during training to make the model less susceptible to individual data point influence. <br> - **Robust Aggregation Techniques (for Federated Learning):** If using federated learning, employ robust aggregation methods that are resilient to malicious updates from participants. <br> - **Model Auditing:** Regularly evaluate the model's performance and behavior on a held-out, clean dataset to detect potential poisoning. |
| **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in PyTorch C++ Backend** | An attacker discovers and exploits vulnerabilities in the underlying C++ backend of PyTorch. This could be achieved through crafted inputs or by triggering specific sequences of operations. | Elevation of privilege, remote code execution, denial of service. | Core PyTorch C++ libraries (e.g., ATen, LibTorch). | **High** (though less likely due to active development) | - **Regularly Update PyTorch:** Keeping PyTorch updated is crucial to patch any discovered vulnerabilities in the C++ backend. <br> - **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about security advisories related to PyTorch. |
