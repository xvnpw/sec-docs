## Vulnerability List for Django Hijack Project

Based on the provided project files, no high or critical vulnerabilities introduced by the project itself were found that meet the specified criteria.

After thorough analysis of the code, documentation, and security considerations, the project appears to be well-designed with security in mind. It incorporates CSRF protection, customizable permission checks, and proper session management to prevent common authentication-related vulnerabilities.

The provided security documentation (`SECURITY.md` and `docs/security.md`) explicitly addresses known risks like CSRF, session injection/poisoning, permission escalation, and session leaking, indicating a proactive approach to security.

The project also includes CI configurations with linters, tests, and CodeQL analysis, further enhancing the security posture by automatically identifying potential issues.

Therefore, based on the provided files and constraints, there are no high or critical rank vulnerabilities to report for the Django Hijack project itself.

It's important to note that while no vulnerabilities were identified in the project's code, secure usage of the library still depends on the implementer's configuration and custom permission function if they choose to deviate from the default settings. The documentation correctly highlights the risks associated with custom permission functions and hiding the hijack notification. However, these are considered misconfigurations or insecure usage patterns, which are explicitly excluded from the scope of this vulnerability assessment based on the prompt's instructions.
