# Threat Model Analysis for pandas-dev/pandas

## Threat: [Data Type Confusion Leading to Logic Errors](./threats/data_type_confusion_leading_to_logic_errors.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts input data (e.g., a CSV) where a column appears to be one data type (e.g., numeric) but contains subtly invalid values that Pandas initially misinterprets.  Later operations relying on the assumed data type fail or produce incorrect results.  For example, a column intended for integers might contain strings that look like numbers but include hidden characters or Unicode variations. This exploits Pandas' type inference.
    *   **Impact:** Incorrect calculations, flawed business logic, data corruption, potentially leading to incorrect decisions or financial losses.  Could also lead to application crashes if downstream code doesn't handle the unexpected data type.
    *   **Affected Component:** `pandas.read_csv()`, `pandas.read_excel()`, `pandas.read_json()`, and other data ingestion functions; type inference mechanisms; potentially any function relying on correct data types (e.g., `.sum()`, `.mean()`, `.groupby()`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Pre-Pandas Validation:** Implement strict schema validation *before* data reaches Pandas, using libraries like `cerberus`, `jsonschema`, or `pydantic`.
        *   **Explicit Type Casting:** After loading with Pandas, explicitly cast columns to expected types using `.astype()`, with robust error handling (`errors='raise'` or `'coerce'`).
        *   **Input Sanitization:** Remove or replace unexpected characters before Pandas processing.
        *   **Data Integrity Checks:** After critical operations, verify data types and ranges.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Large File Upload](./threats/denial_of_service_via_large_file_upload.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads an extremely large CSV, Excel, or JSON file designed to overwhelm Pandas' memory allocation, causing the application to crash or become unresponsive. This directly exploits Pandas' file reading capabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Application downtime, denial of service to legitimate users.
    *   **Affected Component:** `pandas.read_csv()`, `pandas.read_excel()`, `pandas.read_json()`, and other data ingestion functions; memory management within Pandas and its dependencies (e.g., NumPy).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict File Size Limits:** Enforce maximum file upload sizes at the application and server levels.
        *   **Chunked Processing:** Use the `chunksize` parameter in `read_csv`, `read_excel`, etc., to process data in manageable blocks.
        *   **Resource Limits:** Configure operating system or container resource limits (CPU, memory) for the application.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Limit the number and frequency of file uploads from a single user or IP address.
        *   **Timeout:** Set timeout for pandas operations.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Complex Operations](./threats/denial_of_service_via_complex_operations.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides input data that, while not necessarily large, triggers computationally expensive Pandas operations (e.g., complex joins, group-bys with many unique values, pivot tables with high cardinality). This consumes excessive CPU and memory, leading to a denial of service. This directly exploits the computational complexity of certain Pandas functions.
    *   **Impact:** Application slowdown or crash, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** `pandas.merge()`, `pandas.groupby()`, `pandas.pivot_table()`, `pandas.DataFrame.apply()`, and other potentially computationally intensive functions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Limit the complexity of allowed operations. For example, restrict the number of unique values in columns used for grouping.
        *   **Resource Limits:** As above, use OS or container resource limits.
        *   **Profiling:** Identify and optimize performance bottlenecks in Pandas code.
        *   **Alternative Libraries:** Consider using Dask or Vaex for very large or complex datasets.
        *   **Timeout Mechanisms:** Implement timeouts for Pandas operations.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (e.g., NumPy) - *Potentially Critical, depending on the vulnerability*](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities__e_g___numpy__-_potentially_critical__depending_on_the_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability exists in a *direct* dependency of Pandas, such as NumPy, that can be triggered by a maliciously crafted input *specifically designed to exploit that dependency through Pandas*. This is distinct from a general dependency vulnerability; it requires the attacker to understand how Pandas uses the dependency.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, but could range from denial of service to *arbitrary code execution* (if the underlying vulnerability allows it).
    *   **Affected Component:** Indirectly, any Pandas function that relies on the vulnerable dependency. Directly, the vulnerability is in the dependency (e.g., NumPy, SciPy). The key here is that the *attack vector is through Pandas*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Variable (High to *Critical*, depending on the specific vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Dependency Management:** Use a dependency management tool (pip, conda) and keep all dependencies, *especially NumPy and other numerical libraries*, up-to-date. This is the *primary* mitigation.
        *   **Security Advisories:** Regularly check for security advisories related to Pandas and its *direct* dependencies.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use vulnerability scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
