# Threat Model Analysis for pandas-dev/pandas

## Threat: [Pickle Deserialization Vulnerability](./threats/pickle_deserialization_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a malicious pickle file that, when loaded using `pd.read_pickle()`, executes arbitrary code on the server or the user's machine (depending on where the code is executed). Pickle files can contain arbitrary Python objects, including malicious code. This vulnerability is inherent in Python's `pickle` module and directly exploitable through Pandas' interface.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, potentially leading to full system compromise, data breaches, or denial of service.
*   **Affected Pandas Component:** `pd.read_pickle()`, `DataFrame.to_pickle()`, `Series.to_pickle()`
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never load pickle files from untrusted or unverified sources.**
    *   If using pickle, implement strong integrity checks (e.g., digital signatures) to verify the source and integrity of the pickled data *before* deserialization with Pandas.
    *   Consider using safer serialization formats like JSON or MessagePack when possible, and avoid using Pandas' pickle functionality for data from external sources.

## Threat: [Memory Exhaustion via Large Data](./threats/memory_exhaustion_via_large_data.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides an extremely large data file (CSV, Excel, etc.) that, when processed by Pandas' reading functions, consumes excessive memory, potentially crashing the application or the server. This is a direct consequence of how Pandas loads and processes data into memory.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, application instability, potential for other vulnerabilities to be exploited due to resource exhaustion.
*   **Affected Pandas Component:** `pd.read_csv()`, `pd.read_excel()`, `pd.DataFrame()` (when initialized with large data), various data manipulation functions that operate on large in-memory DataFrames.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement limits on the size of uploaded files *before* they are processed by Pandas.
    *   Process large datasets in chunks or use techniques like `chunksize` in `pd.read_csv()` to avoid loading the entire dataset into memory at once.
    *   Monitor memory usage of processes using Pandas and implement alerts for excessive consumption.
    *   Consider using more memory-efficient data structures or libraries for extremely large datasets if Pandas' in-memory processing becomes a bottleneck and security risk.
