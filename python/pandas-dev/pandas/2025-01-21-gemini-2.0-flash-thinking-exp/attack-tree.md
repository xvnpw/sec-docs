**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**High-Risk Path 1: Exploit Data Ingestion for Code Execution**

*   **Attack Vector:** This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities during the process of reading data into a Pandas DataFrame from external files. The attacker's goal is to inject and execute malicious code by crafting specially crafted files.

    *   **Critical Node: Malicious File Injection:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker uploads or provides a malicious file (CSV, Excel, etc.) to the application, intending for Pandas to process it. The application might not properly validate the file content or source.

        *   **Critical Node: Exploit CSV Parsing Vulnerabilities:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** When reading CSV files, especially using the Python engine (`engine='python'`), Pandas can interpret certain cell values as formulas. An attacker can inject malicious code within these formulas (e.g., using `=SYSTEM("malicious_command")` in some spreadsheet software contexts, which can be triggered during parsing).
                *   **Critical Node: Inject Malicious Code via Formula Injection:**
                    *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker crafts a CSV file where specific cells contain formulas that, when parsed by Pandas (with the Python engine), lead to the execution of arbitrary commands on the server.

        *   **Critical Node: Exploit Excel Parsing Vulnerabilities:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Excel files offer multiple avenues for code injection.
                *   **Critical Node: Inject Malicious Macros:**
                    *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker creates an Excel file containing malicious VBA macros. If the application reads this file using Pandas without disabling macro execution, the macros can automatically run when the file is opened or processed by the underlying library.
                *   **Critical Node: Exploit Formula Injection:**
                    *   **Attack Vector:** Similar to CSV, attackers can inject malicious formulas into Excel cells. When Pandas processes the Excel file, the underlying library might evaluate these formulas, leading to code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Direct Code Execution via Pandas Functions](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_direct_code_execution_via_pandas_functions.md)

**Objective:** Compromise Application via Pandas Exploitation

**Sub-Tree:**

*   ***OR*** **High-Risk Path: Direct Code Execution via Pandas Functions**
    *   ***AND*** **Critical Node: Code Execution via `eval()` or `query()`**
        *   ***Critical Node*** Inject Malicious Code in String Passed to `df.eval()`
        *   ***Critical Node*** Inject Malicious Code in String Passed to `df.query()`

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**High-Risk Path 2: Direct Code Execution via Pandas Functions**

*   **Attack Vector:** This path directly targets the `eval()` and `query()` functions provided by Pandas. These functions allow for the execution of arbitrary Python code based on string inputs. If an attacker can control the string passed to these functions, they can execute any code they desire on the server.

    *   **Critical Node: Code Execution via `eval()` or `query()`:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** The application uses `df.eval()` or `df.query()` to perform operations on a DataFrame. If the string argument passed to these functions is derived from untrusted user input or external data without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious Python code into this string.
            *   **Critical Node: Inject Malicious Code in String Passed to `df.eval()`:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker manipulates the input that forms the string argument for `df.eval()`. This string, now containing malicious Python code, is then executed by the `eval()` function.
            *   **Critical Node: Inject Malicious Code in String Passed to `df.query()`:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Similar to `eval()`, the attacker manipulates the input that forms the string argument for `df.query()`. While `query()` has a more limited syntax than `eval()`, it can still be exploited to execute arbitrary code, especially when combined with Pandas functionalities or if the underlying parsing logic has vulnerabilities.
