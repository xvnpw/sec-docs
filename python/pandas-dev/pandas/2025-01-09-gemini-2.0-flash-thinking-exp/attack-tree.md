## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Deserialization Vulnerabilities (Pickle)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_deserialization_vulnerabilities__pickle_.md)

* Attack Vector: Malicious Pickle File Injection leading to Remote Code Execution.
* Steps:
    1. Attacker supplies a crafted pickle file. This file contains serialized Python objects designed to execute arbitrary code when deserialized.
    2. The application uses `pd.read_pickle` to load data from this untrusted pickle file.
    3. Pandas deserializes the malicious objects, causing the embedded code to execute within the application's context.
* Impact: Full compromise of the application server, data breach, and potential lateral movement within the network.
* Why High-Risk: High impact (RCE), relatively easy to exploit if `pd.read_pickle` is used on untrusted data, and difficult to detect.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Resource Exhaustion via Data Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_resource_exhaustion_via_data_manipulation.md)

* Attack Vector: Denial of Service through resource exhaustion.
* Steps:
    1. Attacker supplies a large or complex dataset, or data designed to trigger computationally expensive Pandas operations.
    2. The application uses Pandas to perform operations on this attacker-controlled data.
    3. Pandas consumes excessive CPU, memory, or other resources, leading to a denial of service. The application becomes unresponsive or crashes.
* Impact: Application downtime, impacting availability for legitimate users.
* Why High-Risk: Relatively easy to execute, requires minimal skill, and can be automated.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node 1: Exploit Data Input Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_1_exploit_data_input_vulnerabilities.md)

* Attack Vector: This is a general entry point for various attacks involving malicious data.
* Why Critical: Successful exploitation here allows attackers to introduce malicious data into the application's processing pipeline, enabling subsequent attacks. Mitigating vulnerabilities at this stage prevents a wide range of threats.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node 2: Pandas Processes Malicious File](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_2_pandas_processes_malicious_file.md)

* Attack Vector: Code execution or other malicious actions triggered by processing a crafted file.
* Why Critical: This is the point where the payload of a malicious file (e.g., a CSV with formula injection or an Excel file with macros - though Excel is less Pandas-specific) is executed by Pandas or its underlying libraries.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node 3: Pandas Deserializes Malicious Pickle](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_3_pandas_deserializes_malicious_pickle.md)

* Attack Vector: Remote Code Execution through pickle deserialization.
* Why Critical: This single action directly leads to the execution of arbitrary code on the server, representing a complete compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node 4: Pandas Performs Resource-Intensive Operations](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_4_pandas_performs_resource-intensive_operations.md)

* Attack Vector: Denial of Service.
* Why Critical: This is the point where the application's resources are consumed excessively, leading to a denial of service. Preventing this operation with attacker-controlled data is crucial for maintaining availability.
