# Threat Model Analysis for pandas-dev/pandas

## Threat: [CSV Injection (Formula Injection)](./threats/csv_injection__formula_injection_.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious CSV file where certain fields contain formulas (e.g., starting with `=`, `@`, `+`, `-`). When this CSV is read by Pandas and subsequently opened in spreadsheet software by a user, these formulas can be executed, potentially running arbitrary commands or accessing sensitive data on the user's machine. This directly involves how `pandas.read_csv()` parses and handles data.

**Impact:**  Local code execution on the user's machine, data exfiltration from the user's machine, or other malicious actions depending on the executed commands.

**Affected Component:** `pandas.read_csv()` function.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Sanitize data read from untrusted CSV sources before any further processing or output. This can involve escaping or removing characters that could be interpreted as formulas by spreadsheet software.
*   Educate users about the risks of opening CSV files from untrusted sources directly in spreadsheet software.
*   Consider alternative data formats or methods for data exchange if CSV injection is a significant concern.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in File Format Parsers](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_file_format_parsers.md)

**Description:** Pandas relies on other libraries (e.g., `openpyxl` for Excel, `lxml` for XML, `fastparquet` for Parquet) to parse various file formats. An attacker could provide a maliciously crafted file in one of these formats that exploits a known vulnerability in the underlying parsing library, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or denial of service *through Pandas' interface*.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server or client processing the file, denial of service due to resource exhaustion or crashes.

**Affected Component:**  Pandas I/O functions that handle specific file formats (e.g., `pandas.read_excel()`, `pandas.read_xml()`, `pandas.read_parquet()`).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Pandas and its dependencies up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities. Regularly update your project's dependencies.
*   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for file uploads or data received from external sources *before passing them to Pandas*.
*   Consider using sandboxing or containerization to isolate the file parsing process and limit the impact of potential exploits.

## Threat: [Path Traversal via Filenames](./threats/path_traversal_via_filenames.md)

**Description:** If the application allows users to specify filenames that Pandas should read without proper sanitization, an attacker could provide a malicious filename containing path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../sensitive_data.txt`) to access files outside of the intended directory *through Pandas' file reading capabilities*.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files on the server's filesystem.

**Affected Component:** Pandas I/O functions where the filename is derived from user input (e.g., when a user provides a file path to `pandas.read_csv()`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Never directly use user-provided input as file paths without thorough validation and sanitization.
*   Use allowlists of permitted directories or filenames.
*   Employ secure file handling practices and ensure the application operates with the least privileges necessary.

## Threat: [Unsafe Deserialization (Pickle)](./threats/unsafe_deserialization__pickle_.md)

**Description:** Pandas supports reading and writing data using the `pickle` format. Deserializing data from an untrusted source using `pd.read_pickle()` is inherently dangerous, as it can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server. The attacker crafts a malicious pickle file containing code that will be executed upon deserialization *by Pandas*.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise.

**Affected Component:** `pandas.read_pickle()` function.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Absolutely avoid using `pd.read_pickle()` to load data from untrusted or external sources.**
*   If you must use pickle, ensure that the data source is completely trusted and controlled.
*   Consider using safer serialization formats like JSON or CSV for data exchange.

## Threat: [Injection Vulnerabilities when Writing to Databases](./threats/injection_vulnerabilities_when_writing_to_databases.md)

**Description:** When using Pandas to write data to databases, if the data being written contains malicious code (e.g., SQL injection payloads) and is not properly sanitized before being passed to the database connector *through Pandas' `to_sql()` function*, it could lead to database compromise.

**Impact:** Database compromise, unauthorized data access, data modification, data deletion.

**Affected Component:** `pandas.DataFrame.to_sql()` function.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases through Pandas.** This prevents malicious code from being directly interpreted as SQL commands.
*   Sanitize and validate data before writing it to the database.
*   Follow the principle of least privilege for database user accounts used by the application.
