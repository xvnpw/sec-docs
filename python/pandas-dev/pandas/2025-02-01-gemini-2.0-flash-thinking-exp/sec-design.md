# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
 - Pandas is a foundational library for data analysis and manipulation in Python.
 - The primary goal is to provide efficient and flexible data structures and tools for working with structured data.
 - Business priorities for organizations using pandas include:
  - Enabling data-driven decision making.
  - Improving efficiency in data processing and analysis workflows.
  - Facilitating data exploration and understanding.
  - Supporting development of data science and machine learning applications.
 - For the pandas project itself, priorities include:
  - Maintaining a stable and reliable library.
  - Continuously improving performance and features.
  - Growing and supporting the user community.

- Business Risks:
 - Data integrity risks: Errors in pandas could lead to incorrect data analysis and flawed business decisions.
 - Operational disruption risks: Bugs or vulnerabilities in pandas could cause application failures or performance degradation, impacting business operations that rely on it.
 - Security risks (indirect): While pandas itself is not directly exposed to external threats as a library, vulnerabilities in pandas or its dependencies could be exploited in applications that use it, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized access if those applications are not properly secured.
 - Supply chain risks: Compromise of the pandas project infrastructure or dependencies could lead to distribution of malicious versions of the library, affecting a wide range of users.
 - Reputational risks: Security incidents or data integrity issues related to pandas usage could damage the reputation of organizations relying on it.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
 - security control: Code reviews are conducted by maintainers as part of the pull request process. (Implemented in: GitHub pull request workflow)
 - security control: Automated testing framework to ensure code quality and prevent regressions. (Implemented in: GitHub Actions CI)
 - security control: Dependency management using standard Python packaging tools (pip, setuptools). (Implemented in: setup.py, requirements.txt)
 - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for identifying and reporting security vulnerabilities.
 - accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
 - accepted risk: Open-source nature means vulnerability information is publicly available, potentially increasing the risk of exploitation if patches are not applied promptly.

- Recommended Security Controls:
 - recommended security control: Implement automated security scanning tools (SAST, DAST, dependency scanning) in the CI/CD pipeline to proactively identify vulnerabilities.
 - recommended security control: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure and response policy to handle security issues effectively.
 - recommended security control: Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
 - recommended security control: Consider signing releases to ensure integrity and prevent tampering.
 - recommended security control: Promote security awareness training for contributors and maintainers.

- Security Requirements:
 - Authentication: Not directly applicable to pandas library itself, as it does not handle user authentication. Authentication is the responsibility of applications using pandas.
 - Authorization: Not directly applicable to pandas library itself. Authorization is the responsibility of applications using pandas to control access to data and pandas functionalities based on user roles and permissions.
 - Input Validation:
  - security requirement: Pandas should robustly handle various input data formats and types to prevent unexpected behavior or crashes.
  - security requirement: When reading data from external sources (files, databases, network), pandas should perform input validation to prevent injection attacks (e.g., CSV injection) and handle malformed data gracefully.
 - Cryptography:
  - security requirement: If pandas is used to process or store sensitive data that requires encryption, the applications using pandas are responsible for implementing encryption mechanisms. Pandas itself does not provide built-in cryptographic functionalities, but should be compatible with encrypted data formats and libraries.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes to Protect:
 - For the pandas project itself: Maintaining the integrity and availability of the pandas library to support the global data science community.
 - For organizations using pandas: Data analysis, reporting, data-driven decision making, and applications built on pandas. Disruption or compromise of pandas could impact these processes.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
 - Pandas itself does not store data persistently. It processes data provided to it.
 - The data processed by pandas can vary widely in sensitivity, from public datasets to highly confidential business data, personal data, financial data, or health records, depending on the application context.
 - Sensitivity is determined by the applications and organizations using pandas, not by pandas itself.
 - Risks related to data processed by pandas are primarily associated with the applications and systems that use pandas, and how they handle data security and privacy.
