Based on your instructions, the vulnerability you described, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Messages Rendering, should be **excluded** from the list.

Here's why:

* **Exclusion Criterion 1: "Exclude vulnerabilities that are caused by developers explicitly using insecure code patterns when using project from PROJECT FILES."**

   Your analysis clearly points out that the XSS vulnerability only occurs if a developer using `django-bootstrap4` *explicitly* uses `mark_safe` on user-provided input before adding it to Django's messages framework.  `django-bootstrap4` itself, when rendering messages with `{% bootstrap_messages messages %}`, correctly uses Django's default auto-escaping. The vulnerability is not inherent in the `django-bootstrap4` code but arises from insecure coding practices by the developer using the library.  Specifically, the developer's misuse of `mark_safe` is the root cause. This falls directly under the category of developers "explicitly using insecure code patterns when using project from PROJECT FILES".

* **Other Exclusion/Inclusion Criteria:**
    * It's not a missing documentation issue.
    * It's not a DoS vulnerability.
    * The vulnerability is valid *under specific misuse conditions*, and ranked high, but the core issue is the developer's insecure usage, making it excluded based on the first criterion.

**Therefore, the updated vulnerability list, after applying your exclusion criteria, is empty.**
