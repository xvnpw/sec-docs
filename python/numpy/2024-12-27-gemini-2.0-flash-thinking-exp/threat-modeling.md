## High and Critical NumPy Threats

| Threat | Description | Impact | Affected NumPy Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Integer Overflow/Underflow in Array Operations** | An attacker provides extremely large or negative integers as array indices or shape parameters. This can lead to unexpected behavior, memory corruption, or crashes due to integer overflow/underflow in NumPy's underlying C code. | Denial of service, potential memory corruption leading to arbitrary code execution. | `numpy.ndarray` (indexing, shape manipulation), `numpy.reshape`, `numpy.resize`, array creation functions (e.g., `numpy.zeros`, `numpy.ones`). | High | Sanitize and validate all user-provided input that influences array creation, indexing, and shape manipulation. Use appropriate data types for array sizes and indices. Consider using NumPy's bounds checking (though it's not always enabled by default). |
| **Maliciously Crafted `.npy` or `.npz` Files** | An attacker provides a maliciously crafted `.npy` or `.npz` file to be loaded by the application. These files can contain unexpected data types, shapes, or even embedded code (if `allow_pickle=True` is used) that could be executed when the file is loaded. | Denial of service (memory exhaustion), potential arbitrary code execution if object arrays with pickle payloads are involved. | `numpy.load`, `numpy.lib.format.read_array`, `numpy.lib.format.read_magic`. | High (if `allow_pickle=True`), Medium (otherwise) | Only load NumPy files from trusted sources. Implement checks on the size and shape of loaded arrays before processing them. **Avoid using `allow_pickle=True` when loading `.npy` or `.npz` files from untrusted sources.** If necessary, carefully sanitize the loaded objects after loading. |
| **Memory Exhaustion through Large Array Allocation** | An attacker provides input that leads to the allocation of extremely large NumPy arrays, potentially exhausting the application's memory and causing a denial of service. | Denial of service. | Array creation functions (e.g., `numpy.zeros`, `numpy.ones`, `numpy.empty`), functions that modify array size (e.g., `numpy.resize`). | High | Implement limits on the maximum size and dimensions of arrays that can be created based on user input. Monitor memory usage and implement safeguards to prevent excessive memory allocation. |
| **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Specific NumPy Functions (Bugs)** | An attacker targets known or zero-day vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, use-after-free) in specific NumPy functions to cause crashes, unexpected behavior, or potentially execute arbitrary code. | Denial of service, potential arbitrary code execution. | Any NumPy function with a security vulnerability. | Critical (if code execution is possible), High (for crashes/unexpected behavior) | Stay up-to-date with the latest NumPy releases and security patches. Monitor security advisories related to NumPy. |
| **Compromised NumPy Package (Supply Chain Attack)** | The official NumPy package on PyPI or other distribution channels is compromised, and an attacker injects malicious code into the library. This malicious code is then executed by the application using the compromised NumPy version. | Arbitrary code execution, data breaches, complete compromise of the application. | The entire NumPy library. | Critical | Use trusted package sources and verify package integrity using checksums or signatures. Employ dependency scanning tools to detect known vulnerabilities in NumPy and its dependencies. Consider using a private PyPI repository or vendoring dependencies. |
