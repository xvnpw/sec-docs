# Threat Model Analysis for odoo/odoo

## Threat: [Unauthorized Data Access via Misconfigured Access Rights](./threats/unauthorized_data_access_via_misconfigured_access_rights.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Data Access via Misconfigured Access Rights

    *   **Description:** An attacker, potentially an authenticated user with limited privileges or an unauthenticated user, exploits improperly configured record rules, `ir.model.access` entries, or security group assignments to gain access to data they should not be able to see, modify, or delete. The attacker might use the Odoo web interface, craft specific RPC calls, or exploit a custom module that doesn't properly enforce access controls.  This is *Odoo-specific* because it leverages Odoo's internal access control system.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach (confidentiality violation), data modification (integrity violation), data deletion (availability violation), potential for privilege escalation.
    *   **Affected Odoo Component:** `ir.model.access` (ACLs), `ir.rule` (record rules), Security Groups, custom module code (if it bypasses or incorrectly implements Odoo's security mechanisms).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant users only the minimum necessary access rights.
        *   **Regular Audits:** Conduct regular audits of access rights and group memberships.
        *   **Thorough Testing:** Rigorously test all access control configurations, including edge cases and boundary conditions. Include negative testing.
        *   **Code Reviews:** Carefully review custom module code for proper use of Odoo's security APIs.
        *   **Security Training:** Train developers on Odoo's security model and best practices.
        *   **Use Odoo's Security Features:** Leverage any built-in security testing tools or features Odoo provides.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation via Raw SQL Injection in Custom Modules](./threats/privilege_escalation_via_raw_sql_injection_in_custom_modules.md)

*   **Threat:** Privilege Escalation via Raw SQL Injection in Custom Modules

    *   **Description:** A developer bypasses Odoo's ORM and uses raw SQL queries in a custom module. An attacker exploits a vulnerability in this raw SQL (e.g., lack of parameterization or improper input validation *within the SQL itself*) to execute arbitrary SQL commands. This allows them to bypass Odoo's security checks and potentially gain administrative privileges. This is *Odoo-specific* because it involves bypassing the Odoo ORM.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise, data breach, data modification, data deletion, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Odoo Component:** Custom modules that use `self.env.cr.execute()` or similar methods to execute raw SQL queries.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid Raw SQL:** Prioritize using Odoo's ORM whenever possible.
        *   **Parameterized Queries:** If raw SQL is *absolutely* necessary, use parameterized queries (prepared statements) *within the SQL query itself*. This is *in addition* to any web application input validation.
        *   **Input Validation (SQL-Specific):** Even with parameterized queries, implement strict input validation *specifically tailored to the expected data type and format for the SQL query*.
        *   **Code Reviews:** Mandatory code reviews for *any* use of raw SQL.
        *   **Limited Database User:** Use a database user with restricted privileges for Odoo's connection.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Method Execution via Exposed RPC Endpoints](./threats/unauthorized_method_execution_via_exposed_rpc_endpoints.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Method Execution via Exposed RPC Endpoints

    *   **Description:** A custom module exposes a method via XML-RPC or JSON-RPC without proper authentication or authorization checks. An attacker discovers this exposed method and calls it with malicious parameters, potentially gaining unauthorized access to data or functionality. The attacker might use tools to scan for exposed endpoints or analyze the module's code. This is *Odoo-specific* because it targets Odoo's RPC mechanism.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data modification, data deletion, execution of arbitrary code (depending on the exposed method's functionality).
    *   **Affected Odoo Component:** Custom modules with methods decorated with `@api.model` or `@api.multi` (or lacking these decorators when they should have them), XML-RPC and JSON-RPC interfaces.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Explicit Exposure:** Carefully consider which methods need to be exposed externally.
        *   **Authentication Checks:** Implement authentication checks *within* the exposed methods.
        *   **Authorization Checks:** Verify that the authenticated caller has the necessary permissions. Use Odoo's access control mechanisms.
        *   **Input Validation (RPC-Specific):** Rigorously validate all input parameters received via RPC calls.
        *   **API Keys/Tokens:** Consider using API keys or other authentication tokens for external access.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Modules](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_in_third-party_modules.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Modules

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known or unknown vulnerability in a third-party Odoo module. The vulnerability could be anything from a cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw to a SQL injection vulnerability to a logic error that allows unauthorized access. This is *Odoo-specific* because it targets the Odoo module ecosystem.
    *   **Impact:** Varies widely, but could include complete system compromise.
    *   **Affected Odoo Component:** Any installed third-party Odoo module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical, depending on the module)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Module Vetting:** Thoroughly vet third-party modules before installation.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep all modules updated.
        *   **Security Advisories:** Monitor for security advisories.
        *   **Security Audits:** Consider audits of critical third-party modules.
        *   **Least Privilege (Module Level):** If possible, isolate modules.

## Threat: [Running Odoo with Excessive Privileges](./threats/running_odoo_with_excessive_privileges.md)

*   **Threat:** Running Odoo with Excessive Privileges

    *   **Description:** The Odoo server process is running as the root user (or a user with administrator privileges). If an attacker compromises Odoo, they gain the same level of access. This is *Odoo-specific* in that it relates to how the Odoo server process is run.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise.
    *   **Affected Odoo Component:** Odoo server process.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Dedicated User:** Create a dedicated, non-privileged user account for running Odoo.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Grant this user only the minimum necessary permissions.
        *   **Avoid Root:** Never run Odoo as the root user.

## Threat: [Security Misconfiguration of ORM Methods](./threats/security_misconfiguration_of_orm_methods.md)

* **Threat:** Security Misconfiguration of ORM Methods
    * **Description:** Developers incorrectly use or override ORM methods like `create`, `write`, `unlink`, `search`, `browse` without proper security considerations, leading to bypass of access controls. For example, using `sudo()` excessively or incorrectly implementing `check_access_rights`. This is *Odoo-specific* because it involves misusing Odoo's ORM.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized data creation, modification, deletion, or access, potentially leading to privilege escalation.
    * **Affected Odoo Component:** ORM methods in custom modules, overridden methods in core modules.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Understand `sudo()`:** Use `sudo()` only when absolutely necessary and with a clear understanding of its implications. Document the reason.
        * **Proper `check_access_rights`:** Implement `check_access_rights` correctly.
        * **Contextual Security:** Use the context (`self.env.context`) to enforce access controls.
        * **Code Reviews:** Thoroughly review code that overrides or uses ORM methods.
        * **Testing:** Include security-focused test cases.
