# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for odoo/odoo

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rigorous Module Vetting and Management (Odoo-Focused)](./mitigation_strategies/rigorous_module_vetting_and_management__odoo-focused_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Formal Process:**  Document a procedure for evaluating Odoo modules.
    2.  **Source Code Review (Odoo API Focus):**
        *   Before installation, review the module's Python code, paying *specific* attention to how it uses Odoo's API. Look for:
            *   **`search()` and `browse()` calls:**  Ensure they include appropriate domain filters to prevent unauthorized data access (IDOR).  Check for hardcoded IDs or assumptions about user permissions.
            *   **`create()`, `write()`, and `unlink()` calls:**  Verify that access control checks (using `check_access_rights()`) are performed *before* modifying data.
            *   **`@api.constrains` and `@api.depends`:**  Examine these decorators for potential security implications.  Ensure they don't inadvertently expose sensitive data or create performance bottlenecks.
            *   **`_sql_constraints`:**  Check for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities in custom SQL constraints.
            *   **Use of `sudo()`:**  Minimize the use of `sudo()`.  It bypasses Odoo's security model and should only be used when absolutely necessary, with careful justification and auditing.  Ensure it's not used to grant excessive privileges.
            *   **Direct SQL Queries:**  Scrutinize any raw SQL queries (using `self.env.cr.execute()`).  Ensure they use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.  Prefer Odoo's ORM methods whenever possible.
            *   **QWeb Template Rendering:**  Examine how data is passed to QWeb templates.  Ensure that user-provided data is properly escaped to prevent XSS.  Look for uses of `t-raw` (which disables escaping) and ensure they are justified and secure.
            *   **Access Control Rules (XML):**  Review the module's `security/ir.model.access.csv` file.  Ensure that access rights are defined correctly and follow the principle of least privilege.
            *   **Record Rules (XML):**  Review the module's `security/ir.rule.xml` file.  Ensure that record rules are defined to restrict access to specific records based on appropriate criteria.
    3.  **Dependency Analysis (Odoo Modules):**
        *   Identify all Odoo module dependencies.
        *   Repeat the Odoo-focused source code review for each dependency.
    4.  **Staging Environment (Odoo Instance):**
        *   Install the module in a separate Odoo instance (staging environment) that mirrors the production setup.
    5.  **Odoo-Specific Security Testing:**
        *   Use Odoo's built-in testing framework to write security-focused tests.  These tests should:
            *   Attempt to access data or functionality without proper permissions.
            *   Try to inject malicious data (SQL, XSS payloads).
            *   Verify that access control rules and record rules are enforced correctly.
    6.  **Approval and Documentation (Odoo Context):**
        *   Document the review process, focusing on Odoo-specific security findings.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   SQL Injection (Critical) - via Odoo ORM misuse or raw SQL.
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High) - via QWeb template vulnerabilities.
    *   Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) (High) - via improper `search()`/`browse()` usage.
    *   Privilege Escalation (High) - via incorrect access control or misuse of `sudo()`.
    *   Data Breaches (Critical) - resulting from any of the above.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium) - via poorly written ORM queries or constraints.

*   **Impact:** (Focus on Odoo-specific vulnerabilities)
    *   SQL Injection: Risk reduced significantly (80-90%)
    *   XSS: Risk reduced significantly (70-80%)
    *   IDOR: Risk reduced significantly (70-80%)
    *   Privilege Escalation: Risk reduced significantly (70-80%)
    *   Data Breaches: Risk reduced significantly (60-70%)
    *   DoS: Risk reduced moderately (40-50%)

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic source code review of some Odoo API calls.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal, documented process focused on Odoo's security mechanisms.
    *   Comprehensive review of all relevant Odoo API calls (as listed above).
    *   Odoo-specific security testing using the built-in framework.
    *   Thorough documentation of Odoo-related security findings.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Custom Module Development (Odoo-Focused)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_custom_module_development__odoo-focused_.md)

*   **Description:** (All steps are inherently Odoo-centric)
    1.  **Odoo Secure Coding Training:**  Training must cover:
        *   Odoo's security model (access control, record rules, groups, `ir.model.access.csv`, `ir.rule.xml`).
        *   Secure use of Odoo's ORM (avoiding raw SQL, proper use of `search()`, `browse()`, `create()`, `write()`, `unlink()`).
        *   Secure use of QWeb templates (auto-escaping, avoiding `t-raw` misuse).
        *   Proper use of `sudo()` (minimizing its use, understanding its implications).
        *   Odoo's API for input validation and sanitization.
        *   Writing secure constraints (`@api.constrains`, `_sql_constraints`).
    2.  **Code Reviews (Odoo Security Checklist):**  Reviews must use a checklist that includes all the Odoo-specific security considerations listed in the "Rigorous Module Vetting" description (Odoo API Focus section).
    3.  **Input Validation (Odoo Mechanisms):**  Use Odoo's field types and constraints (`fields.Char(required=True)`, `fields.Integer()`, `@api.constrains`) for validation.
    4.  **Output Encoding (QWeb):**  Rely on QWeb's auto-escaping.  Avoid `t-raw` unless absolutely necessary and carefully justified.
    5.  **Secure Database Interactions (Odoo ORM):**  Use Odoo's ORM exclusively.  Avoid raw SQL. If unavoidable, use parameterized queries.
    6.  **Access Control (Odoo Security Model):**  Use Odoo's groups, security rules, and record rules to enforce access control.
    7.  **Avoid Hardcoding (Odoo Configuration):**  Use Odoo's configuration system for sensitive data.
    8.  **Odoo-Specific Security Testing:**  Use Odoo's testing framework to write tests that specifically target Odoo's security mechanisms.

*   **Threats Mitigated:** (Same as Rigorous Module Vetting - Odoo Focused)

*   **Impact:** (Same as Rigorous Module Vetting - Odoo Focused)

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Some use of Odoo's ORM and field types.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Odoo-specific secure coding training.
    *   Code reviews with a dedicated Odoo security checklist.
    *   Consistent use of Odoo's validation mechanisms.
    *   Strict adherence to avoiding raw SQL.
    *   Odoo-specific security testing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Odoo Configuration (Odoo-Centric)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_odoo_configuration__odoo-centric_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Change Default Admin Password:**  Immediately change the default Odoo administrator password.
    2.  **Disable Demo Data (odoo.conf):**  Set `demo=False` in the Odoo configuration file (`odoo.conf`).
    3.  **Disable Unnecessary XML-RPC Endpoints (odoo.conf):**
        *   If not using XML-RPC, set `xmlrpc = False` and `xmlrpcs = False` in `odoo.conf`.
        *   If using XML-RPC, ensure strong authentication is enforced.
    4. **Disable unused features:**
        * Review Odoo configuration and disable all unused features.
    5. **Enable Odoo Audit Logs:**
        * Configure Odoo to log security-relevant events. This is often done within Odoo's settings or through configuration files.  Ensure logs capture user logins, data modifications (create, write, unlink), and security-related errors.
    6. **Regularly review Odoo logs:**
        * Regularly review Odoo logs for suspicious activity.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Brute-Force Attacks (Medium) - against the admin account.
    *   Unauthorized Access (High) - via default credentials or demo data.
    *   XML-RPC Attacks (High) - if XML-RPC is enabled and not secured.
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (Critical) - in unused features.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Brute-Force Attacks: Risk reduced significantly (80-90%)
    *   Unauthorized Access: Risk reduced significantly (70-80%)
    *   XML-RPC Attacks: Risk reduced significantly (80-90%)
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities: Risk reduced significantly.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Admin password was changed.
    *   Odoo is updated regularly.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `demo=False` is not explicitly set in `odoo.conf`.
    *   XML-RPC is not disabled (and its security is not verified).
    * Unused features are not disabled.
    * Odoo Audit Logs are not enabled.
    * Odoo logs are not reviewed.
