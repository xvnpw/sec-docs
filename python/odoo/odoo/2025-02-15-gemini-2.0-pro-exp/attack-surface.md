# Attack Surface Analysis for odoo/odoo

## Attack Surface: [Unvetted Third-Party Modules](./attack_surfaces/unvetted_third-party_modules.md)

*   **Description:** Installation of modules from the Odoo app store or other external sources that contain vulnerabilities or malicious code.
*   **How Odoo Contributes:** Odoo's modular architecture and open app store *directly* facilitate the use of third-party code, which may not be rigorously reviewed for security.  This is a core feature of Odoo.
*   **Example:** A third-party module for handling payments has a SQL injection vulnerability that allows attackers to steal customer credit card data.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, system compromise, financial loss, reputational damage.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the module's functionality and the vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Thoroughly vet modules before installation.  Review source code (if available).  Prioritize modules from reputable developers with a history of security updates.  Perform security testing on integrated modules.
    *   **User:** Limit the number of third-party modules installed.  Keep all modules updated to the latest versions.  Monitor for security advisories related to installed modules.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfigured Access Control Lists (ACLs)](./attack_surfaces/misconfigured_access_control_lists__acls_.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrectly configured record rules, groups, or user permissions that grant unauthorized access to data or functionality.
*   **How Odoo Contributes:** Odoo's *own* complex ACL system, a *core component* of its security model, is inherently prone to misconfiguration, especially in large or complex deployments. This is not a general web application issue; it's specific to Odoo's design.
*   **Example:** A sales user is accidentally granted access to view or modify financial records due to an overly permissive record rule.
*   **Impact:** Data leakage, unauthorized data modification, privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the sensitivity of the data exposed).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Follow the principle of least privilege.  Regularly audit and review ACL configurations.  Use automated tools to check for common misconfigurations.  Thoroughly test access control rules during development.
    *   **User:** Regularly review user roles and permissions.  Ensure that users only have access to the data and functionality they need.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated RPC Calls](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_rpc_calls.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of Odoo's XML-RPC or JSON-RPC endpoints that do not require authentication, allowing attackers to access data or execute actions.
*   **How Odoo Contributes:** Odoo *itself* uses RPC for internal communication and external integrations. The *potential* for some methods to be inadvertently exposed without authentication is a direct consequence of Odoo's architecture.
*   **Example:** An attacker discovers an unauthenticated RPC method that allows them to list all users in the system, including their email addresses.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, unauthorized actions, potential for further attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the exposed method).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Ensure that *all* RPC endpoints require authentication.  Review the access control rules for all RPC methods.  Disable XML-RPC if not needed.
    *   **User:** Monitor network traffic for suspicious RPC calls.  Implement firewall rules to restrict access to RPC endpoints.

## Attack Surface: [Weak Authentication on `/web/login`](./attack_surfaces/weak_authentication_on__weblogin_.md)

*   **Description:** Brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploitation of weak passwords on Odoo's *default* login page.
*   **How Odoo Contributes:** Odoo *provides* a standard login page (`/web/login`) that is a well-known target. While login pages are common, Odoo's *default* configuration and the potential for weak default passwords contribute to the risk.
*   **Example:** An attacker uses a list of common passwords to successfully gain access to an administrator account.
*   **Impact:** System compromise, data breaches, unauthorized access.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Enforce strong password policies (length, complexity, history).  Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA).  Consider rate limiting or CAPTCHA on the login page.
    *   **User:** Use strong, unique passwords for all Odoo accounts.  Enable MFA if available. Change default admin password.

## Attack Surface: [Custom Module Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/custom_module_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws introduced in custom-developed Odoo modules, such as SQL injection, XSS, or insecure direct object references.
*   **How Odoo Contributes:** Odoo's *extensibility*, a core feature, allows developers to create custom modules, but these modules may not adhere to secure coding practices. The framework *allows* this, even if it doesn't encourage it.
*   **Example:** A custom module for handling customer inquiries has an XSS vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the Odoo interface.
*   **Impact:** Varies widely depending on the vulnerability (data breaches, system compromise, client-side attacks).
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Follow secure coding guidelines.  Perform rigorous code reviews and security testing (SAST, DAST).  Use Odoo's built-in security features and avoid reinventing the wheel.  Train developers in secure coding practices.
    *   **User:** If commissioning custom modules, ensure the development team has a strong security focus.

## Attack Surface: [File Upload Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/file_upload_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers upload malicious files (e.g., web shells) through Odoo's file upload functionality, leading to remote code execution.
*   **How Odoo Contributes:** Odoo *includes* file upload functionality in various contexts (attachments, product images, etc.) as a *built-in feature*. This is not a general web application issue; it's a specific feature of Odoo.
*   **Example:** An attacker uploads a PHP web shell disguised as a JPEG image, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Impact:** System compromise, data breaches, remote code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Strictly validate file types and sizes.  Store uploaded files outside the web root.  Scan uploaded files for malware.  Use a dedicated file storage service if possible.  Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of uploaded scripts.
    *   **User:** Be cautious about uploading files from untrusted sources.
