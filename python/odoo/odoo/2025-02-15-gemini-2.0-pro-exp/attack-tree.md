## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Administrative Access to Odoo [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_administrative_access_to_odoo__cn_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the ultimate objective of the attacker. Achieving this allows for complete control over the Odoo instance, including data access, modification, and potential lateral movement within the network.
*   **Likelihood:**  (Dependent on the success of lower-level attack steps)
*   **Impact:** Very High (Complete system compromise, data breach, potential business disruption)
*   **Effort:** (Dependent on the success of lower-level attack steps)
*   **Skill Level:** (Dependent on the chosen attack path)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** (Dependent on the chosen attack path and security controls in place)

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Odoo User Accounts [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_odoo_user_accounts__cn_.md)

*    **Description:** Gaining access to even a single user account, regardless of privilege level, is a critical step for an attacker. This provides a foothold within the system and can be used for further attacks, such as privilege escalation or lateral movement.
*    **Likelihood:** (Dependent on the success of lower-level attack steps)
*    **Impact:** High (Access to user data, potential for privilege escalation)
*    **Effort:** (Dependent on the chosen attack path)
*    **Skill Level:** (Dependent on the chosen attack path)
*    **Detection Difficulty:** (Dependent on the chosen attack path and security controls in place)

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Odoo Vulnerabilities -> Known CVEs (e.g., XML-RPC) [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_odoo_vulnerabilities_-_known_cves__e_g___xml-rpc___hr_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers leverage publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) in Odoo, particularly those affecting exposed services like the XML-RPC interface. Exploit kits are often readily available, making this a relatively easy attack to execute against unpatched systems.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (if unpatched) / Low (if patched promptly)
*   **Impact:** Very High (RCE, data exfiltration, complete system compromise)
*   **Effort:** Low (exploit kits readily available)
*   **Skill Level:** Novice (for known exploits) / Advanced (for developing 0-days)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (IDS/IPS, WAF can detect known exploit patterns) / Hard (for 0-days)

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Odoo User Accounts -> Weak Passwords / Brute-Force [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_odoo_user_accounts_-_weak_passwords__brute-force__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers attempt to guess or brute-force user passwords. This is particularly effective if weak or default passwords are used and if multi-factor authentication (MFA) is not enforced. Automated tools can rapidly try many password combinations.
*   **Likelihood:** High (if weak passwords are allowed and MFA is not enforced)
*   **Impact:** High (access to user data and potentially privilege escalation)
*   **Effort:** Low (automated tools available)
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (failed login attempts can be logged and monitored)

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Odoo User Accounts -> Phishing/Social Engineering (Odoo-Specific) [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_odoo_user_accounts_-_phishingsocial_engineering__odoo-specific___hr_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers use deceptive emails or social engineering tactics to trick Odoo users into revealing their credentials or performing actions that compromise their accounts. These attacks often mimic legitimate Odoo communications, such as password reset requests or system notifications.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (depends on user awareness and email security)
*   **Impact:** High (can lead to credential theft and account compromise)
*   **Effort:** Low (crafting a convincing phishing email)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (requires understanding of social engineering techniques)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (email security tools and user awareness training can help)
