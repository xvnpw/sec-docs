# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for odoo/odoo

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rigorous Module Vetting and Selection Process](./mitigation_strategies/rigorous_module_vetting_and_selection_process.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish a trusted source policy for Odoo modules:** Define explicitly which sources are considered trusted for Odoo module installation (e.g., official Odoo App Store, specific Odoo partners). Document this policy and communicate it to all relevant personnel involved in Odoo module management.
    2.  **Implement an Odoo module request process:**  Require users to formally request new Odoo module installations, providing justification and source information. This request should be specific to Odoo modules and their intended use within the Odoo application.
    3.  **Evaluate Odoo module source reputation:** Before installation, verify the source of the Odoo module. Check the Odoo App Store rating, reviews, and developer reputation. For external sources, research the vendor's security track record specifically within the Odoo ecosystem.
    4.  **Analyze Odoo module permissions and dependencies:**  Carefully review the Odoo module's manifest file (`__manifest__.py`) to understand the permissions it requests and its dependencies within the Odoo environment.  Assess if these permissions are justified for the module's functionality within Odoo.
    5.  **Conduct security code review for Odoo modules (for non-trusted sources and critical modules):** For Odoo modules from less trusted sources or modules handling sensitive data within Odoo, perform a security code review. Focus on identifying common web application vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, etc.) and Odoo-specific security issues related to Odoo's ORM and framework. Use static analysis tools tailored for Python and web applications to aid in this process.
    6.  **Test Odoo modules in an Odoo staging environment:**  Install and thoroughly test new Odoo modules in a dedicated Odoo staging environment before deploying them to production. This includes functional testing within the Odoo context and basic security testing relevant to Odoo functionalities.
    7.  **Document Odoo module vetting decisions:**  Keep a record of Odoo module vetting decisions, including the source, permissions, review findings, and approval status, specifically for Odoo modules.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Odoo Configuration (Database Credentials & `odoo.conf`)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_odoo_configuration__database_credentials_&__odoo_conf__.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Change default Odoo database credentials immediately:** During initial Odoo setup, or if default credentials are still in use, change the default PostgreSQL database user (`odoo`) and password to strong, unique values specifically for the Odoo database.
    2.  **Secure `odoo.conf` file permissions:** Restrict file system permissions on the `odoo.conf` file to only be readable and writable by the Odoo server process user and authorized administrators (e.g., using `chmod 600 odoo.conf`). This is specific to the Odoo configuration file.
    3.  **Externalize sensitive Odoo configuration (Environment Variables):**  Instead of hardcoding sensitive information like database credentials directly in `odoo.conf`, use environment variables. Odoo supports reading configuration from environment variables. This prevents Odoo credentials from being directly exposed in the Odoo configuration file.
    4.  **Regularly review `odoo.conf`:** Periodically review the `odoo.conf` file to ensure no unnecessary or insecure configurations are present within the Odoo configuration.
    5.  **Implement configuration management for Odoo:** Use a configuration management tool (e.g., Ansible, Chef, Puppet) to manage and deploy Odoo configurations consistently and securely across environments, ensuring secure Odoo configuration practices.
