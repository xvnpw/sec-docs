### 4. Deep Analysis of QWeb Template Injection (SSTI/XSS)

#### 4.1. Introduction to Odoo QWeb Templating Engine

Odoo utilizes the QWeb templating engine for generating dynamic web pages and reports. QWeb templates are XML-based files that can contain static HTML, dynamic expressions, and control structures. They are processed on the server-side to render the final output that is sent to the user's browser.

Key features of QWeb relevant to security include:

* **Dynamic Expressions:** QWeb allows embedding Python expressions within templates using `<t-esc>` and `<t-raw>` tags. These expressions are evaluated on the server and their results are inserted into the output.
* **Contextual Data:** Templates are rendered within a context, which provides access to data from the Odoo application, including models, records, and user input.
* **Control Structures:** QWeb provides tags like `<t-if>`, `<t-foreach>`, and `<t-set>` for conditional rendering, looping, and variable assignment within templates.

#### 4.2. Understanding the Vulnerability: SSTI and XSS in QWeb

**4.2.1. Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)**

SSTI occurs when an attacker can inject malicious code into a template that is then executed on the server. In the context of QWeb, this typically happens when user-supplied data is directly embedded into a QWeb template and processed by the `<t-esc>` or `<t-raw>` tags without proper sanitization.

**How SSTI can occur in QWeb:**

If a developer mistakenly uses user input directly within a QWeb expression without proper escaping or validation, an attacker can inject malicious Python code.  Because QWeb expressions are evaluated on the server, this injected code will be executed with the privileges of the Odoo server process.

**Example of a Vulnerable QWeb Template (Illustrative - Simplified):**

```xml
<template id="vulnerable_template">
    <t t-set="user_input" t-value="request.params['name']"/>
    <div>
        Hello, <t t-esc="user_input"/>!
    </div>
</template>
```

In this simplified example, if the `name` parameter in the request is controlled by the user and not sanitized, an attacker could inject malicious Python code instead of a name. While direct code execution via `<t-esc>` is often mitigated by default escaping, vulnerabilities can arise in more complex scenarios or when developers attempt to bypass escaping mechanisms.  More critically, vulnerabilities can arise if developers use `<t-raw>` incorrectly or in conjunction with unsanitized user input.

**4.2.2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

XSS occurs when an attacker injects malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. In QWeb, XSS vulnerabilities arise when user-supplied data is included in the rendered HTML output without proper escaping, allowing malicious JavaScript code to be executed in the user's browser.

**How XSS can occur in QWeb:**

If user input is directly rendered within a QWeb template using `<t-esc>` or especially `<t-raw>` without proper escaping, and this input is later displayed to other users, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript.

**Example of a Vulnerable QWeb Template (Illustrative - Simplified):**

```xml
<template id="vulnerable_template_xss">
    <t t-set="user_comment" t-value="record.comment"/>
    <div>
        Comment: <t t-raw="user_comment"/>
    </div>
</template>
```

If the `record.comment` field contains user-supplied data that is not sanitized and is rendered using `<t-raw>`, an attacker could inject JavaScript code within the comment. When another user views this template, the malicious JavaScript will be executed in their browser.

**Key Difference between SSTI and XSS in QWeb:**

* **SSTI:**  Code execution on the *server*.  Impacts the Odoo server and potentially the entire system.
* **XSS:** Code execution in the *user's browser*. Impacts users interacting with the Odoo application.

#### 4.3. Attack Vectors and Exploitation Scenarios

**4.3.1. Attack Vectors for SSTI:**

* **Direct Parameter Injection:**  Exploiting URL parameters or form fields that are directly used in QWeb templates without sanitization.
* **Database Injection:**  Injecting malicious code into database fields that are subsequently rendered by QWeb templates. This is particularly dangerous if user-controlled data is stored in fields used in templates.
* **Configuration Injection:**  Exploiting configuration settings or external data sources that are used in QWeb templates and can be manipulated by an attacker.

**Exploitation Scenarios for SSTI:**

* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  Gaining complete control of the Odoo server by executing arbitrary Python code. This can lead to data breaches, system compromise, and denial of service.
* **Data Exfiltration:** Accessing sensitive data stored on the server, including database credentials, configuration files, and user data.
* **Privilege Escalation:**  Escalating privileges within the Odoo application or the underlying operating system.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Crashing the Odoo server or making it unavailable by injecting resource-intensive or malicious code.

**4.3.2. Attack Vectors for XSS:**

* **Stored XSS (Persistent XSS):** Injecting malicious scripts into database fields (e.g., user profiles, comments, product descriptions) that are then persistently stored and rendered by QWeb templates to other users. This is the most dangerous type of XSS.
* **Reflected XSS (Non-Persistent XSS):** Injecting malicious scripts into URL parameters or form fields that are immediately reflected back to the user in the response without proper escaping.
* **DOM-based XSS:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in client-side JavaScript code that processes user input and dynamically updates the DOM, potentially leading to script injection even if the server-side template is secure. (Less directly related to QWeb template injection, but relevant in the broader context of web application security).

**Exploitation Scenarios for XSS:**

* **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies to impersonate legitimate users and gain unauthorized access to their accounts.
* **Data Theft:**  Stealing sensitive information displayed on the page or submitted by the user.
* **Account Takeover:**  Modifying user account details or performing actions on behalf of the user.
* **Website Defacement:**  Altering the appearance of the Odoo interface to display malicious content or propaganda.
* **Redirection to Malicious Sites:**  Redirecting users to phishing websites or sites hosting malware.
* **Keylogging:**  Capturing user keystrokes to steal login credentials or other sensitive information.

#### 4.4. Impact Breakdown

**4.4.1. Impact of SSTI:**

* **Confidentiality:** **Critical**.  Full access to server-side data, including sensitive information, database credentials, and application secrets.
* **Integrity:** **Critical**.  Ability to modify server-side code, data, and configuration, leading to data corruption and system instability.
* **Availability:** **Critical**.  Potential for denial of service, system crashes, and complete system compromise, rendering the Odoo application unavailable.

**4.4.2. Impact of XSS:**

* **Confidentiality:** **High**.  Access to user session data, potentially sensitive information displayed on the page, and user input.
* **Integrity:** **High**.  Ability to modify the content of the web page as seen by the user, potentially leading to defacement or misleading information.
* **Availability:** **Medium**.  Can disrupt user experience, potentially leading to denial of service for individual users or specific functionalities.

#### 4.5. Detailed Mitigation Strategies

**4.5.1. Enforce Secure Coding Practices and Mandatory Security Reviews:**

* **Developer Training:**  Provide comprehensive training to developers on secure coding principles, specifically focusing on template injection vulnerabilities and secure QWeb development.
* **Code Reviews:** Implement mandatory security code reviews for all QWeb template changes and new module development. Reviews should specifically look for potential injection points and ensure proper input handling and output encoding.
* **Security Champions:** Designate security champions within the development team to promote secure coding practices and act as a point of contact for security-related questions.
* **Secure Design Principles:**  Incorporate security considerations into the design phase of new features and modules, considering potential injection points and data flow from the outset.

**4.5.2. Utilize QWeb's Built-in Escaping Mechanisms Correctly and Consistently:**

* **Understand QWeb Escaping:**  Developers must thoroughly understand the different QWeb tags and their escaping behavior:
    * **`<t-esc="expression"/>`:**  **Default escaping.**  Escapes HTML special characters (e.g., `<`, `>`, `&`, `"`, `'`) to prevent XSS. **Use this by default for displaying user-supplied data.**
    * **`<t-raw="expression"/>`:** **No escaping.** Renders the expression's result as raw HTML. **Use with extreme caution and *only* when you are absolutely certain the data is safe and does not originate from user input or untrusted sources.**
    * **`@` (Attribute Escaping):**  Use `@` within HTML attributes to escape attribute values. Example: `<a t-att-href="'/page/' + @record.id">`. This is crucial for preventing XSS in attributes.
* **Consistent Application:**  Ensure that escaping is applied consistently across all QWeb templates, especially when dealing with data that could potentially originate from user input or external sources.
* **Avoid Unnecessary `<t-raw>`:**  Minimize the use of `<t-raw>`.  If you find yourself using `<t-raw>`, carefully review the data source and ensure it is absolutely safe to render as raw HTML. Consider if escaping with `<t-esc>` and allowing safe HTML tags (if needed) is a better approach.

**4.5.3. Thoroughly Sanitize and Validate All User Input *Before* it is Used within QWeb Templates:**

* **Input Validation:**  Validate all user input at the point of entry (e.g., form submissions, API requests) to ensure it conforms to expected formats and data types. Reject invalid input.
* **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize user input to remove or encode potentially harmful characters or code before it is stored or used in QWeb templates.  This can involve:
    * **HTML Sanitization:**  Using a robust HTML sanitization library (if allowing limited HTML input) to remove or neutralize potentially malicious HTML tags and attributes. Be very cautious with allowing HTML input.
    * **Encoding:**  Encoding special characters to prevent them from being interpreted as code.  QWeb's `<t-esc>` handles HTML encoding, but consider other encoding types if needed (e.g., URL encoding).
    * **Data Type Enforcement:**  Ensure data is of the expected type (e.g., integer, string, email) and reject input that does not conform.
* **Server-Side Validation:**  Perform validation and sanitization on the server-side, even if client-side validation is also implemented. Client-side validation can be bypassed.
* **Context-Specific Sanitization:**  Apply sanitization techniques appropriate to the context where the data will be used. For example, sanitization for HTML output might differ from sanitization for database queries.

**4.5.4. Regularly Audit and Pen-Test QWeb Templates for Potential Injection Vulnerabilities:**

* **Static Code Analysis:**  Utilize static code analysis tools to automatically scan QWeb templates for potential injection vulnerabilities. Configure these tools to specifically look for patterns indicative of insecure template usage.
* **Manual Code Audits:**  Conduct regular manual code audits of QWeb templates, especially after significant changes or new module deployments. Focus on templates that handle user input or display dynamic data.
* **Penetration Testing:**  Engage security professionals to perform penetration testing specifically targeting QWeb template injection vulnerabilities. This should include both automated and manual testing techniques.
* **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Use web application vulnerability scanners to identify potential XSS vulnerabilities in the rendered Odoo application.

**4.5.5. Implement a Strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to Mitigate XSS:**

* **Define a Strict CSP:**  Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) header to control the resources that the browser is allowed to load for the Odoo application. This can significantly reduce the impact of XSS vulnerabilities by limiting the attacker's ability to inject and execute malicious scripts.
* **CSP Directives:**  Configure CSP directives such as:
    * `default-src 'self'`:  Restrict resource loading to the application's origin by default.
    * `script-src 'self'`:  Only allow scripts from the application's origin. Consider using `'nonce'` or `'sha256'` for inline scripts for stricter control.
    * `style-src 'self'`:  Only allow stylesheets from the application's origin.
    * `img-src 'self'`:  Only allow images from the application's origin.
    * `object-src 'none'`:  Disable loading of plugins like Flash.
    * `frame-ancestors 'none'`:  Prevent the application from being embedded in frames on other domains.
* **CSP Reporting:**  Configure CSP reporting to receive notifications when the CSP is violated. This can help identify potential XSS attempts and misconfigurations.
* **Regular CSP Review:**  Regularly review and update the CSP to ensure it remains effective and aligned with the application's security requirements.
