                * **Insecure Web Server Configurations:**  Allowing directory listing, using weak TLS/SSL configurations, or enabling insecure HTTP methods.
            * **Weak Access Controls:** Bypassing or exploiting weak access controls to gain unauthorized access. Examples include:
                * **Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Relying solely on passwords for server access.
                * **Overly Permissive Firewall Rules:** Allowing unnecessary inbound traffic to the server.
                * **Insufficient Network Segmentation:**  Lack of isolation between the Odoo server and other less secure networks.
            * **Network-Based Attacks:** Exploiting network vulnerabilities to gain access to the server. Examples include:
                * **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** Intercepting network traffic to steal credentials or sensitive data.
                * **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**  If the server itself can be tricked into making requests to internal resources. (Less direct, but possible if the infrastructure allows it).
                * **Exploiting vulnerabilities in network services:** (e.g., SSH, RDP if exposed to the internet with vulnerabilities).

    * **How it Works:** Attackers target vulnerabilities in the server operating system, web server, or other infrastructure components. Once the server is compromised, they can gain access to the Odoo application and its data.

        * **Detailed Attack Flow:**
            1. **Reconnaissance:** Attackers scan the target infrastructure to identify open ports, running services, and potentially vulnerable software versions.
