# Threat Model Analysis for odoo/odoo

## Threat: [Malicious Module Installation](./threats/malicious_module_installation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker convinces an administrator to install a compromised or malicious third-party Odoo module. This could be achieved through social engineering or by compromising a module repository. Once installed, the module's code executes within Odoo, potentially granting the attacker full control over the Odoo instance and its data.
*   **Impact:** **Critical**. Complete system compromise, full data breach, data manipulation, denial of service, financial loss, and severe reputational damage.
*   **Affected Odoo Component:** Odoo module installation process, Odoo core (once the malicious module is active and loaded).
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement a mandatory and rigorous module vetting process.
    *   Strictly limit module installations to modules from highly trusted and reputable sources only.
    *   Mandatory code reviews and security audits of *all* third-party modules before installation.
    *   Utilize automated code scanning tools as part of the vetting process.
    *   Implement strong access control for module installation permissions, limiting it to only essential personnel.
    *   Always test modules in a dedicated staging environment that mirrors production before deploying to the live system.

## Threat: [QWeb Template Injection (SSTI/XSS)](./threats/qweb_template_injection__sstixss_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities within Odoo's QWeb templating engine, particularly when templates process or display user-supplied data without proper sanitization. This can lead to Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI), allowing arbitrary code execution on the Odoo server, or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), enabling malicious script execution within users' browsers interacting with the Odoo application.
*   **Impact:** **High** to **Critical**.  SSTI can lead to full code execution and system compromise. XSS can result in data breaches, session hijacking, defacement of the Odoo interface, and further attacks against users.
*   **Affected Odoo Component:** Odoo QWeb templating engine, QWeb templates within modules and core, web interface rendering.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce secure coding practices for all QWeb template development, with mandatory security reviews.
    *   Utilize QWeb's built-in escaping mechanisms correctly and consistently to prevent XSS.
    *   Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user input *before* it is used within QWeb templates.
    *   Regularly audit and pen-test QWeb templates for potential injection vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of potential XSS vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [API Authentication Bypass](./threats/api_authentication_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker bypasses the authentication mechanisms protecting Odoo's APIs (XML-RPC or REST). This could be due to flaws in custom API authentication implementations, vulnerabilities in Odoo's core API handling, or misconfigurations. Successful bypass grants unauthorized access to sensitive Odoo functionalities and data accessible through the APIs.
*   **Impact:** **High**. Unauthorized access to critical Odoo data and functionalities via APIs, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, and system compromise depending on the exposed API endpoints.
*   **Affected Odoo Component:** Odoo API endpoints (XML-RPC, REST), authentication mechanisms within Odoo core and modules, API security configuration.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust and industry-standard authentication for all Odoo APIs (e.g., OAuth 2.0, strong API keys with proper lifecycle management).
    *   Mandatory enforcement of HTTPS for *all* API communication to protect credentials in transit.
    *   Regularly and rigorously audit API security configurations and authentication implementations.
    *   Implement strict role-based access control (RBAC) for API access, ensuring only authorized users and applications can access specific API endpoints.
    *   Disable or securely restrict access to any unused or unnecessary API endpoints.

## Threat: [Default Password Exploitation](./threats/default_password_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker attempts to gain access to Odoo by exploiting unchanged default administrator credentials. If default passwords are not immediately changed after Odoo installation, attackers can easily gain initial access, especially if the Odoo instance is exposed to the internet.
*   **Impact:** **Critical**. Complete system compromise, full data breach, data manipulation, denial of service, and immediate and severe reputational damage.
*   **Affected Odoo Component:** Odoo user authentication system, default administrator accounts created during initial setup.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory and immediate** changing of default passwords for *all* administrative accounts during the initial Odoo setup process.
    *   Enforce strong password policies for all users, including administrators, requiring complex passwords and regular password changes.
    *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for *all* administrator accounts to add an extra layer of security beyond passwords.
    *   Regularly audit user accounts and password strength to ensure ongoing security.

## Threat: [Malicious File Upload](./threats/malicious_file_upload.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads a malicious file (e.g., web shell, malware, scripts) through an Odoo file upload functionality, often found within modules or core features. If Odoo's file upload validation and handling are insufficient, the attacker can execute the malicious file on the Odoo server, potentially gaining complete control of the system and its underlying infrastructure.
*   **Impact:** **Critical**. Code execution on the Odoo server, full system compromise, malware distribution through Odoo, data breaches, and significant operational disruption.
*   **Affected Odoo Component:** File upload functionalities within Odoo core and modules, web server handling uploaded files, file system storage.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement extremely strict file type validation and sanitization for *all* file uploads, allowing only explicitly permitted and safe file types.
    *   Store all uploaded files *outside* the web root directory to prevent direct execution via web requests.
    *   Serve uploaded files through a secure mechanism that prevents direct execution and enforces access controls.
    *   Integrate and utilize robust antivirus and malware scanning software to automatically scan *all* uploaded files for malicious content before storage.
    *   Implement strict limits on file upload sizes and restrict access to file upload functionalities based on the principle of least privilege and user roles.

## Threat: [Unpatched Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/unpatched_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits publicly known and patched vulnerabilities in Odoo core or installed modules. This occurs when administrators fail to apply security updates and patches released by Odoo in a timely manner, leaving the Odoo instance vulnerable to known exploits that are actively being targeted.
*   **Impact:** **High** to **Critical**. System compromise, data breaches, denial of service, and potential for widespread impact depending on the nature and severity of the unpatched vulnerability being exploited.
*   **Affected Odoo Component:** Odoo core, installed modules, and potentially any component with an unpatched vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Establish a **mandatory and immediate** process for regularly monitoring and applying *all* Odoo security updates and patches as soon as they are released.
    *   Subscribe to official Odoo security advisories, mailing lists, and security channels to stay proactively informed about new vulnerabilities and available patches.
    *   Thoroughly test all patches in a dedicated staging environment that mirrors production *before* deploying them to the live production system.
    *   Implement automated patch management tools and processes where possible to streamline and expedite the patching process.
    *   Conduct regular vulnerability scanning to proactively identify any unpatched vulnerabilities in the Odoo environment.
