Accepted Risks:
- accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in community-contributed modules due to varying security practices.
- accepted risk: Reliance on timely community contributions for security vulnerability discovery and patching.
- accepted risk: Complexity of securing a large and modular application suite.

Recommended Security Controls:

- security control: Implement security information and event management (SIEM) for security monitoring and incident response.
- security control: Conduct regular penetration testing and vulnerability assessments.
- security control: Implement static and dynamic application security testing (SAST/DAST) in the development pipeline.
- security control: Enhance input validation and output encoding across all application modules.
- security control: Implement robust logging and auditing mechanisms for security events.
- security control: Secure software supply chain management practices for dependencies and third-party libraries.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication:
    - requirement: Secure authentication mechanisms to verify user identity (e.g., username/password, multi-factor authentication).
    - requirement: Protection against brute-force attacks and credential stuffing.
    - requirement: Session management to securely maintain user sessions.
- Authorization:
    - requirement: Role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions and access to features and data.
    - requirement: Principle of least privilege to grant users only necessary permissions.
    - requirement: Secure API authorization for external integrations.
- Input Validation:
    - requirement: Comprehensive input validation on all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).
    - requirement: Input sanitization and encoding to mitigate injection risks.
    - requirement: Validation of file uploads to prevent malicious file uploads.
- Cryptography:
    - requirement: Use of strong encryption algorithms for sensitive data at rest and in transit.
    - requirement: Secure storage and management of cryptographic keys.
    - requirement: Proper implementation of cryptographic protocols (e.g., TLS, HTTPS).
    - requirement: Data masking or pseudonymization for sensitive data in non-production environments.

Build Process Description:

The build process for Odoo, like many modern software projects, is automated using a CI/CD pipeline. GitHub Actions is a likely candidate for Odoo given it's hosted on GitHub.

Build Process Steps:

1. Developer commits code changes to the Git repository (GitHub).
2. GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline is triggered automatically on code commits (e.g., push, pull request).
3. Source Code Checkout: The pipeline starts by checking out the latest source code from the Git repository.
4. Build Application: The pipeline builds the Odoo application. This may involve compiling code, packaging modules, and preparing the application for deployment.
5. Run Automated Tests: Automated tests (unit tests, integration tests) are executed to ensure code quality and functionality.
6. Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST): SAST tools are used to scan the source code for potential security vulnerabilities (e.g., code flaws, common weaknesses).
7. Container Image Build: Docker container images are built for the Odoo components (Web Server, Application Server, Background Worker).
8. Container Image Security Scan: Container images are scanned for vulnerabilities using container image scanning tools. This helps identify vulnerabilities in base images and dependencies.
9. Publish Build Artifacts: The built container images are published to a Container Registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR). These images are then ready for deployment to the target environment.
10. Deployment Environment: The deployment environment (Kubernetes Cluster) pulls the latest container images from the Container Registry to deploy or update the Odoo application.
