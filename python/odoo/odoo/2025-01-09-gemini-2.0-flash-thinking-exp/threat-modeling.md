# Threat Model Analysis for odoo/odoo

## Threat: [Installation of Untrusted or Malicious Modules](./threats/installation_of_untrusted_or_malicious_modules.md)

- **Description:** An attacker with administrative privileges (or through exploiting a privilege escalation vulnerability *within Odoo*) installs a third-party or community module from an untrusted source. This module contains malicious code designed to compromise the Odoo instance. The attacker might aim to exfiltrate sensitive data, create backdoors for persistent access, or disrupt the system's operation.
- **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Odoo instance, including data breaches, unauthorized access to sensitive information, potential financial loss, and reputational damage.
- **Affected Odoo Component:** Odoo Module System.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Only install modules from trusted sources like the official Odoo Apps store or reputable developers with a proven track record.
    - Thoroughly review the code of any third-party module before installation, especially if obtained from unofficial sources.
    - Implement strict access controls within Odoo to limit who can install and manage modules.
    - Use code scanning tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in module code.
    - Regularly update installed modules to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [ORM Injection (Python Injection)](./threats/orm_injection__python_injection_.md)

- **Description:** An attacker exploits insufficient input sanitization *within Odoo's code* when building ORM queries. By injecting malicious Python code into user-supplied data that is used directly within ORM methods (e.g., `search`, `read`, `write`), the attacker can execute arbitrary Python code on the Odoo server.
- **Impact:** Remote code execution, allowing the attacker to gain complete control over the Odoo instance, access sensitive data, or manipulate the system.
- **Affected Odoo Component:** Odoo ORM (Object-Relational Mapper), particularly core ORM methods.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Always use parameterized queries with the ORM *in Odoo's core and custom modules*. Avoid string concatenation for building queries.
    - Implement strict input validation on all user-provided data used in ORM queries *within Odoo's codebase*.
    - Follow secure coding practices when interacting with the ORM.
    - Regularly review Odoo's core and custom module code for potential ORM injection vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Insecure Use of `execute_kw` or Raw SQL](./threats/insecure_use_of__execute_kw__or_raw_sql.md)

- **Description:** Developers *extending Odoo or within Odoo's core* might use `execute_kw` or raw SQL queries for custom logic. If user input is directly incorporated into these queries without proper sanitization and parameterization, it can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. An attacker can inject malicious SQL code to bypass security checks, access unauthorized data, modify data, or even execute operating system commands on the database server.
- **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, unauthorized access to sensitive information, potential compromise of the database server.
- **Affected Odoo Component:** Odoo ORM (`execute_kw`), potentially within core modules or custom modules.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Avoid using raw SQL queries whenever possible. Rely on the Odoo ORM for data manipulation.
    - If raw SQL is necessary, always use parameterized queries (placeholders) to prevent SQL injection.
    - Implement strict input validation on all user-provided data used in `execute_kw` or raw SQL queries *within Odoo's codebase*.
    - Regularly review Odoo's core and custom module code for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in QWeb](./threats/server-side_template_injection__ssti__in_qweb.md)

- **Description:** An attacker exploits insufficient sanitization of user-controlled data that is rendered within QWeb templates *within Odoo's core or standard modules*. By injecting malicious template code, the attacker can execute arbitrary Python code on the Odoo server when the template is rendered.
- **Impact:** Remote code execution, allowing the attacker to gain control over the Odoo instance and potentially the underlying server.
- **Affected Odoo Component:** QWeb templating engine.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Avoid directly embedding user-provided data within QWeb templates without proper escaping or sanitization *in Odoo's core and standard modules*.
    - Use the built-in QWeb filters and directives for safe rendering of user input.
    - Implement strict input validation on all user-provided data that might be used in templates *within Odoo's codebase*.
    - Regularly review Odoo's core and standard module templates for potential SSTI vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization (Pickle)](./threats/insecure_deserialization__pickle_.md)

- **Description:** If Odoo *core functionalities or standard modules* process serialized Python objects (using the `pickle` library) from untrusted sources (e.g., through file uploads or RPC calls) without proper validation, an attacker can craft malicious serialized data that, when deserialized, executes arbitrary code on the Odoo server.
- **Impact:** Remote code execution, leading to complete compromise of the Odoo instance.
- **Affected Odoo Component:** Any part of Odoo's core or standard modules that uses the `pickle` library to deserialize data from external sources.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources using `pickle` *within Odoo's core and standard modules*.
    - If deserialization is necessary, implement strong validation and sanitization of the data before deserialization.
    - Consider using safer serialization formats like JSON when possible.

## Threat: [Bypassing Access Rights and Rules](./threats/bypassing_access_rights_and_rules.md)

- **Description:** Vulnerabilities in Odoo's *core* access control mechanisms (access rights, record rules) can allow users to bypass intended restrictions and access data or functionalities they should not have access to. This could be due to misconfigurations, logical flaws in the rules, or bugs in the access control implementation *within Odoo's core*.
- **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, ability to perform unauthorized actions, privilege escalation.
- **Affected Odoo Component:** Odoo's access control system (access rights, record rules, security models).
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Carefully design and implement access rights and record rules based on the principle of least privilege.
    - Regularly review and audit access control configurations.
    - Thoroughly test access control rules to ensure they function as intended.
    - Stay updated with Odoo security advisories regarding potential access control bypasses.

## Threat: [Insecure File Handling and Attachment Processing](./threats/insecure_file_handling_and_attachment_processing.md)

- **Description:** Vulnerabilities in how Odoo *core functionalities or standard modules* handle file uploads and attachments can allow attackers to upload malicious files (e.g., web shells, malware) that can be executed on the server or used to compromise user accounts. This could be due to insufficient validation of file types, sizes, or content.
- **Impact:** Remote code execution, data breaches, compromise of user accounts.
- **Affected Odoo Component:** Core Odoo modules handling file uploads and attachments (e.g., `base`, specific application modules like `documents`).
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Implement strict validation of file types, sizes, and content upon upload.
    - Store uploaded files outside the web server's document root to prevent direct execution.
    - Use antivirus scanning on uploaded files.
    - Avoid allowing execution of uploaded files directly by the web server.
