## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Odoo Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_odoo_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

* **Compromise Application via Odoo Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * This is the root goal and inherently a critical node as its compromise signifies a successful attack.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Odoo Web Interface Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_odoo_web_interface_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

* **Exploit Odoo Web Interface Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * The primary interface for users and attackers alike, making it a critical point of entry. Successful exploitation here can lead to various levels of compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Authentication and Authorization Bypass [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/authentication_and_authorization_bypass__critical_node_.md)

* **Authentication and Authorization Bypass [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * Bypassing authentication grants unauthorized access to the application, a critical failure in security controls.
        * **Exploit Default Credentials [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to log in using well-known default credentials (e.g., admin/admin, admin/demo).
            * **Impact:**  Gains immediate administrative access to the Odoo instance, allowing full control over data and functionality.
            * **Mitigation:** Enforce strong password policies and mandatory password changes upon initial setup. Disable or remove default accounts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Default Credentials [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_default_credentials__critical_node_.md)

* **Exploit Default Credentials [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to log in using well-known default credentials (e.g., admin/admin, admin/demo).
            * **Impact:**  Gains immediate administrative access to the Odoo instance, allowing full control over data and functionality.
            * **Mitigation:** Enforce strong password policies and mandatory password changes upon initial setup. Disable or remove default accounts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Injection Attacks [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/injection_attacks__critical_node_.md)

* **Injection Attacks [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * A class of vulnerabilities where malicious code is injected into data streams or execution contexts.
        * **SQL Injection [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code through vulnerable input fields or URL parameters.
            * **Impact:** Can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion within the database. In some cases, can even allow for operating system command execution.
            * **Mitigation:** Use parameterized queries or prepared statements. Implement proper input validation and sanitization for all user-supplied data. Employ a Web Application Firewall (WAF).
        * **Template Injection (QWeb) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious code into QWeb templates, which are then executed server-side.
            * **Impact:** Can lead to remote code execution on the Odoo server, granting full control.
            * **Mitigation:** Sanitize data used within QWeb templates. Avoid dynamic template generation with user-supplied input. Implement secure coding practices for template development.

## Attack Tree Path: [SQL Injection [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/sql_injection__critical_node_.md)

* **SQL Injection [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code through vulnerable input fields or URL parameters.
            * **Impact:** Can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion within the database. In some cases, can even allow for operating system command execution.
            * **Mitigation:** Use parameterized queries or prepared statements. Implement proper input validation and sanitization for all user-supplied data. Employ a Web Application Firewall (WAF).

## Attack Tree Path: [Template Injection (QWeb) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/template_injection__qweb___critical_node_.md)

* **Template Injection (QWeb) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious code into QWeb templates, which are then executed server-side.
            * **Impact:** Can lead to remote code execution on the Odoo server, granting full control.
            * **Mitigation:** Sanitize data used within QWeb templates. Avoid dynamic template generation with user-supplied input. Implement secure coding practices for template development.

## Attack Tree Path: [File Upload Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/file_upload_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

* **File Upload Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * Occur when the application allows users to upload files without sufficient security checks.
        * **Unrestricted File Upload [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Attackers upload malicious files, such as webshells, which can then be executed on the server.
            * **Impact:** Leads to remote code execution, allowing the attacker to control the server.
            * **Mitigation:** Validate file types and extensions. Store uploaded files outside the webroot. Implement strong access controls on uploaded files. Scan uploaded files for malware.

## Attack Tree Path: [Unrestricted File Upload [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/unrestricted_file_upload__critical_node_.md)

* **Unrestricted File Upload [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Attackers upload malicious files, such as webshells, which can then be executed on the server.
            * **Impact:** Leads to remote code execution, allowing the attacker to control the server.
            * **Mitigation:** Validate file types and extensions. Store uploaded files outside the webroot. Implement strong access controls on uploaded files. Scan uploaded files for malware.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Known Odoo Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_known_odoo_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

* **Exploiting Known Odoo Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * Attackers leverage publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in specific versions of Odoo.
        * **Attack Vector:** Attackers use readily available exploit code to target known weaknesses in the Odoo platform.
        * **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but can range from information disclosure to remote code execution.
        * **Mitigation:** Regularly update Odoo to the latest stable version. Subscribe to security advisories and promptly apply patches. Implement a vulnerability management program.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Community Modules [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_community_modules__critical_node_.md)

* **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Community Modules [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * Attackers target vulnerabilities within third-party modules installed in Odoo.
        * **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit weaknesses in community modules, which may have less rigorous security testing than the core Odoo platform.
        * **Impact:** Can range from data breaches related to the module's functionality to remote code execution if the module has significant privileges or vulnerabilities.
        * **Mitigation:** Carefully vet and audit community modules before installation. Keep community modules updated. Isolate the permissions of community modules where possible.
