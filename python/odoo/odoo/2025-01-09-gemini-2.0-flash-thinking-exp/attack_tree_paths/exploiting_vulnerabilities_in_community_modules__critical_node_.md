            * **Manipulation of Data:** Attackers could modify or delete critical data, leading to business disruption and financial losses.
        * **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**
            * **Server Compromise:** If a module allows the execution of arbitrary code, attackers can gain complete control over the Odoo server, potentially leading to data breaches, system downtime, and further attacks on the network.
            * **Malware Deployment:** Attackers can use RCE to install malware, backdoors, or other malicious software on the server.
        * **Privilege Escalation:**
            * **Gaining Administrative Access:** Exploiting vulnerabilities can allow attackers to escalate their privileges within the Odoo system, granting them access to administrative functions and sensitive data.
        * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
            * **Client-Side Attacks:** Vulnerable modules rendering user-supplied data without proper sanitization can allow attackers to inject malicious scripts that execute in the browsers of other users, potentially stealing credentials or performing actions on their behalf.
        * **SQL Injection:**
            * **Database Manipulation:** If a module uses unsanitized user input in SQL queries, attackers can inject malicious SQL code to access, modify, or delete data within the Odoo database.
        * **Denial of Service (DoS):**
            * **Resource Exhaustion:** Vulnerabilities could be exploited to overload the server with requests, causing it to become unresponsive and disrupting business operations.
        * **Supply Chain Attacks:**
            * **Compromised Updates:** Attackers could compromise the update mechanism of a community module to distribute malicious updates to unsuspecting users.
        * **Business Logic Flaws:**
            * **Manipulating Workflows:** Vulnerabilities in modules handling critical business processes (e.g., sales, inventory) could allow attackers to manipulate these workflows for financial gain or to cause disruption.
