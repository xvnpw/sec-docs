# Attack Surface Analysis for odoo/odoo

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) via QWeb](./attack_surfaces/server-side_template_injection__ssti__via_qweb.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious code into QWeb templates, leading to server-side code execution.

**How Odoo Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Odoo's QWeb templating engine renders dynamic content. If user input is directly embedded into QWeb templates without proper sanitization, it can be interpreted as code. Customizations and poorly written modules are common entry points.

**Example:** A custom report allows users to input a title. If the title is directly rendered in QWeb as `<h1>{{ user_input }}</h1>`, an attacker could input `<h1>{{ system.os.execute('rm -rf /') }}</h1>` (in a vulnerable setup) to execute arbitrary commands on the server.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, full server compromise, data breach, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always sanitize user input before embedding it in QWeb templates.
*   Use parameterized queries or safe rendering functions provided by Odoo.
*   Implement strict input validation on all user-provided data.
*   Regularly update Odoo to benefit from security patches.
*   Review custom modules and customizations for potential SSTI vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via QWeb](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_qweb.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages rendered by Odoo, which are then executed in the context of other users' browsers.

**How Odoo Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Odoo's QWeb templates are used to generate dynamic HTML. If user-provided data is not properly escaped before being included in the HTML, it can lead to XSS vulnerabilities.

**Example:** A user comment field in a forum is rendered directly in a QWeb template. An attacker inputs `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`. When other users view the comment, the script executes in their browser.

**Impact:** Session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, redirection to malicious sites, information disclosure.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always escape user input when rendering it in QWeb templates. Use Odoo's built-in escaping mechanisms.
*   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.
*   Use a framework like Odoo's form validation to sanitize input on the server-side.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication and Authorization Bypass in API Endpoints](./attack_surfaces/authentication_and_authorization_bypass_in_api_endpoints.md)

**Description:** Attackers bypass authentication or authorization checks to access API endpoints they are not supposed to access.

**How Odoo Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Odoo's API endpoints (JSON-RPC) rely on proper authentication and authorization mechanisms. Vulnerabilities in these mechanisms, especially in custom modules or poorly configured access rights within Odoo, can lead to bypasses.

**Example:** A custom API endpoint for retrieving customer data lacks proper authentication checks within the Odoo framework's access control. An attacker can directly access the endpoint without logging in and retrieve sensitive customer information.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, data manipulation, privilege escalation.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enforce strong authentication for all API endpoints using Odoo's built-in authentication methods or secure custom authentication integrated with Odoo.
*   Implement robust authorization checks using Odoo's access control lists (ACLs) and record rules effectively.
*   Regularly review and audit API endpoint security configurations within Odoo.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious or Vulnerable Community Modules](./attack_surfaces/malicious_or_vulnerable_community_modules.md)

**Description:** Installing third-party modules from the Odoo Apps Store or other sources introduces vulnerabilities or malicious code into the application.

**How Odoo Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Odoo's modular architecture encourages the use of community modules to extend functionality. However, the security of these modules is not guaranteed by Odoo and can vary significantly.

**Example:** A seemingly useful module contains a hidden backdoor that allows the developer to remotely access the Odoo instance. Another module has an SQL injection vulnerability that can be exploited through Odoo's ORM or direct database access within the module.

**Impact:** Data breach, remote code execution, denial of service, compromise of the entire Odoo instance.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly vet and review the code of any third-party module before installation.
*   Only install modules from trusted sources with a good reputation and positive reviews within the Odoo community.
*   Keep installed modules up-to-date to benefit from security patches provided by the module developers.
*   Consider using static analysis tools to scan module code for potential vulnerabilities.
*   Implement a process for testing modules in a non-production Odoo environment before deploying them to production.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection (Less Common but Possible)](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection__less_common_but_possible_.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into database queries, allowing them to manipulate the database.

**How Odoo Contributes to the Attack Surface:** While Odoo's ORM provides some protection against SQL injection, vulnerabilities can still arise in custom SQL queries within modules or through ORM bypasses, especially when using `execute()` methods directly in Odoo code.

**Example:** A custom module constructs a SQL query using unsanitized user input: `SELECT * FROM customers WHERE name = '%s'` % user_input`. An attacker could input `' OR 1=1 --` to bypass the intended query and retrieve all customer data from the Odoo database.

**Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, unauthorized access to sensitive information stored within Odoo.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid constructing SQL queries directly. Use Odoo's ORM methods whenever possible.
*   If custom SQL queries are necessary within Odoo modules, always use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
*   Implement strict input validation on all user-provided data that is used in database queries within Odoo.
*   Regularly review custom Odoo module code for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Unrestricted File Upload](./attack_surfaces/unrestricted_file_upload.md)

**Description:** Allowing users to upload arbitrary files without proper validation can lead to various attacks.

**How Odoo Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Odoo allows file uploads for attachments, documents, and other purposes. If these upload mechanisms within Odoo lack proper validation, attackers can upload malicious files.

**Example:** An attacker uploads a PHP web shell disguised as an image through an Odoo file upload form. If the web server allows execution of PHP files in the Odoo upload directory, the attacker can gain remote control of the server.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, malware distribution, denial of service, defacement of the Odoo instance.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Validate file types and sizes on the server-side within the Odoo application logic.
*   Sanitize file names to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities within the Odoo file storage mechanisms.
*   Store uploaded files outside of the web server's document root or in a dedicated storage service configured for Odoo.
*   Implement virus scanning on uploaded files within the Odoo environment.
*   Restrict access to uploaded files based on user roles and permissions defined within Odoo.
