# Threat Model Analysis for odoo/odoo

## Threat: [Malicious Third-Party Module Installation](./threats/malicious_third-party_module_installation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker convinces an administrator to install a seemingly legitimate but malicious third-party module. This module, while external, leverages Odoo's module loading and execution mechanisms to introduce backdoors, spyware, or code designed to exfiltrate data or compromise the Odoo instance. The attacker exploits the trust placed in Odoo's extensibility.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the Odoo instance, including access to all data, potential for data breaches, financial losses, and reputational damage. The attacker could also use the compromised instance as a stepping stone to attack other systems on the network.
*   **Affected Component:** Odoo's module installation functionality, specifically the `__manifest__.py` file and the module loading process within the Odoo framework.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly vet all third-party modules before installation, checking the developer's reputation and the module's code.
    *   Implement a code review process for all custom and third-party modules.
    *   Restrict module installation permissions to a limited number of trusted administrators.
    *   Utilize security scanning tools to analyze module code for potential vulnerabilities.
    *   Monitor system logs for suspicious activity after installing new modules.

## Threat: [ORM Injection](./threats/orm_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input that is not properly sanitized and is used in Odoo's Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) queries. This can allow the attacker to manipulate database queries, potentially bypassing security checks, accessing sensitive data, modifying data, or even executing arbitrary SQL commands on the underlying database. The vulnerability lies in how Odoo's ORM handles and processes user input.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized data modification, potential for privilege escalation, and in some cases, remote code execution if database functions allow it.
*   **Affected Component:** Odoo's ORM (`odoo.models`, `odoo.api`), specifically methods that construct and execute database queries based on user input.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always use parameterized queries provided by the Odoo ORM.
    *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all user-provided data before using it in ORM queries.
    *   Avoid constructing raw SQL queries directly whenever possible.
    *   Regularly review code that interacts with the ORM for potential injection vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in QWeb](./threats/server-side_template_injection__ssti__in_qweb.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious code into QWeb templates through user-controlled input that is not properly sanitized. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the Odoo server, potentially gaining full control of the system. The vulnerability resides within Odoo's QWeb templating engine.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, full server compromise, data breaches, and denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** Odoo's QWeb templating engine (`odoo.addons.base.models.ir_qweb`), specifically when rendering templates with unsanitized user input.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid embedding user input directly into QWeb templates.
    *   Use secure templating practices and escape user input appropriately.
    *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization before passing data to the templating engine.
    *   Regularly review QWeb templates for potential injection vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [API Vulnerabilities (XML-RPC/JSON-RPC)](./threats/api_vulnerabilities__xml-rpcjson-rpc_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in Odoo's API endpoints (XML-RPC or JSON-RPC). This could involve bypassing authentication mechanisms implemented within Odoo, exploiting insecure data handling within the API framework, or leveraging a lack of rate limiting in Odoo's API handling to perform brute-force attacks or denial-of-service attacks.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data, data breaches, data manipulation, denial of service, and potential for privilege escalation.
*   **Affected Component:** Odoo's API framework (`odoo.http`), specifically the XML-RPC and JSON-RPC handlers and related authentication mechanisms within the Odoo core.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for API access.
    *   Enforce rate limiting within the Odoo API framework to prevent brute-force and denial-of-service attacks.
    *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all data received through the API.
    *   Regularly review and update API endpoints to address potential vulnerabilities in the Odoo codebase.
    *   Consider using more modern and secure API protocols if possible.
