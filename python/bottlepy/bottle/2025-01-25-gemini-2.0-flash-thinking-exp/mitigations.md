# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for bottlepy/bottle

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Debug Mode in Production](./mitigation_strategies/disable_debug_mode_in_production.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  When deploying your Bottle application to a production environment, ensure you explicitly disable Bottle's debug mode.
    2.  This is done by *not* passing `debug=True` to the `bottle.run()` method or by setting `bottle.DEBUG = False` in your application configuration.
    3.  Verify that your deployment scripts or environment configurations are set up to run the application without debug mode enabled.
    4.  In production, if errors occur, Bottle will display generic error pages instead of detailed debug information.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Information Disclosure - Severity: High (due to exposure of application internals via Bottle's debug mode)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information Disclosure: Significantly reduces the risk by preventing Bottle from exposing sensitive debugging information in production error responses.
*   **Currently Implemented:** [Specify Yes/No/Partially and where it's implemented in your project. Example: Yes - in production deployment scripts]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Specify where it's missing if not fully implemented. Example: N/A - Fully Implemented / Missing in staging environment configuration]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Customize Error Pages using Bottle's `@error` decorator](./mitigation_strategies/customize_error_pages_using_bottle's__@error__decorator.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Utilize Bottle's `@error(error_code)` decorator to define custom error handlers for different HTTP error codes (e.g., 404, 500).
    2.  Within these error handler functions, construct and return custom HTML responses.
    3.  Ensure these custom responses are user-friendly and avoid revealing any sensitive technical details about your Bottle application's internal workings or paths.
    4.  By using `@error`, you override Bottle's default error handling, which might expose more information, especially if debug mode is accidentally left on.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Information Disclosure - Severity: Medium (by controlling information exposed in Bottle's error responses)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information Disclosure: Reduces the risk by ensuring Bottle serves generic, safe error pages instead of potentially revealing internal details through default error pages.
*   **Currently Implemented:** [Specify Yes/No/Partially and where it's implemented in your project. Example: Partially - Custom 404 page implemented using `@error`, but not for 500 errors]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Specify where it's missing if not fully implemented. Example: Custom error pages for 500, 503 errors using `@error` are missing]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Static File Serving with `bottle.static_file()`](./mitigation_strategies/secure_static_file_serving_with__bottle_static_file___.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  When using `bottle.static_file()` to serve static content, carefully manage the `root` parameter.
    2.  Ensure the `root` parameter in `static_file()` points precisely to the intended directory for static files and does not inadvertently grant access to parent directories or sensitive parts of the filesystem.
    3.  If serving sensitive static files via `bottle.static_file()`, implement access control logic *within your Bottle route handler* before calling `static_file()`. Bottle itself does not provide built-in access control for static files.
    4.  For enhanced security and performance in production, consider using a dedicated web server (like Nginx or Apache) to serve static files directly, bypassing `bottle.static_file()` for production deployments and only using Bottle for dynamic routes.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Information Disclosure - Severity: Medium (if misconfigured `root` exposes unintended files via `bottle.static_file()`)
    *   Directory Traversal - Severity: High (if `root` in `bottle.static_file()` is not properly restricted)
    *   Unauthorized Access - Severity: High (if sensitive static files are served without access control via `bottle.static_file()`)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information Disclosure: Reduces risk by limiting the scope of files accessible through `bottle.static_file()`.
    *   Directory Traversal: Significantly reduces risk by preventing attackers from using `bottle.static_file()` to access files outside the intended static file directory.
    *   Unauthorized Access: Significantly reduces risk by enforcing access control when serving sensitive static files through Bottle.
*   **Currently Implemented:** [Specify Yes/No/Partially and where it's implemented in your project. Example: Yes - Static files served from dedicated directory using `bottle.static_file()`, Nginx used in production for static files]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Specify where it's missing if not fully implemented. Example: Access control not implemented for sensitive static files served via `bottle.static_file()` / N/A - Fully Implemented]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Output Encoding/Escaping in Bottle Templates and Responses](./mitigation_strategies/implement_output_encodingescaping_in_bottle_templates_and_responses.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Recognize that Bottle's default template engine *does not* automatically escape output.
    2.  Identify all locations in your Bottle application where dynamic data is embedded into HTML templates or generated HTML responses.
    3.  Manually apply output encoding/escaping to all dynamic data *before* it is rendered in templates or included in responses. Use appropriate escaping functions for the context (e.g., HTML escaping using `html.escape()` from Python's standard library).
    4.  If using Bottle's built-in template engine, ensure you are explicitly escaping variables within your template syntax.
    5.  Consider using a templating engine like Jinja2, which can be integrated with Bottle and offers auto-escaping features, to reduce the risk of forgetting to escape output.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Severity: High (due to lack of auto-escaping in Bottle's default templates)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Significantly reduces the risk by preventing injection of malicious scripts into HTML output generated by Bottle applications.
*   **Currently Implemented:** [Specify Yes/No/Partially and where it's implemented in your project. Example: Partially - HTML escaping used in some Bottle templates, but not consistently]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Specify where it's missing if not fully implemented. Example: Consistent HTML escaping across all Bottle templates and Python code is missing / Auto-escaping templating engine not integrated with Bottle]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Set Content Security Policy (CSP) Headers in Bottle Responses](./mitigation_strategies/set_content_security_policy__csp__headers_in_bottle_responses.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Define a Content Security Policy that is appropriate for your Bottle application's resource loading requirements.
    2.  Configure your Bottle application to send the `Content-Security-Policy` HTTP header with each response.
    3.  This can be achieved by manipulating the `bottle.response.headers` object within your Bottle route handlers.
    4.  Set the `Content-Security-Policy` header to your defined policy string.
    5.  Test your CSP implementation by checking browser developer tools for CSP violations when accessing your Bottle application.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Severity: High (as a defense-in-depth mechanism when used with Bottle)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Significantly reduces the *impact* of XSS vulnerabilities in Bottle applications by limiting the browser's ability to execute malicious scripts, even if output escaping is missed.
*   **Currently Implemented:** [Specify Yes/No/Partially and where it's implemented in your project. Example: No - CSP headers not set in Bottle responses]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Specify where it's missing if not fully implemented. Example: CSP header needs to be added to all Bottle responses / CSP policy needs to be defined and implemented within Bottle application]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement CSRF Protection in Bottle Applications](./mitigation_strategies/implement_csrf_protection_in_bottle_applications.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Since Bottle does not provide built-in CSRF protection, you must implement it manually or use a third-party library or middleware.
    2.  Generate and manage CSRF tokens. Store tokens in user sessions (managed by Bottle or a session library).
    3.  Embed CSRF tokens in forms and AJAX requests originating from your Bottle application.
    4.  Validate the CSRF token on the server-side within your Bottle route handlers for all state-changing requests (e.g., POST, PUT, DELETE).
    5.  Reject requests with missing or invalid CSRF tokens.
    6.  Consider creating Bottle middleware to handle CSRF token generation and validation to simplify implementation across your application.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - Severity: High (due to Bottle's lack of built-in CSRF protection)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Significantly reduces the risk by protecting Bottle applications from CSRF attacks, which are not mitigated by default in Bottle.
*   **Currently Implemented:** [Specify Yes/No/Partially and where it's implemented in your project. Example: No - CSRF protection not implemented in Bottle application]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Specify where it's missing if not fully implemented. Example: CSRF protection needs to be implemented for all state-changing forms and AJAX requests in Bottle application]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use Secure Session Management Practices with Bottle](./mitigation_strategies/use_secure_session_management_practices_with_bottle.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  If using Bottle's built-in session handling or integrating a session management library with Bottle, ensure secure session configuration.
    2.  **Enforce HTTPS:** Run your Bottle application exclusively over HTTPS to protect session cookies in transit.
    3.  **Set `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags:** Configure session cookies set by Bottle or your session library to include the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags. This restricts cookie access and transmission.
    4.  **Session ID Regeneration:** Implement session ID regeneration after login and periodically within your Bottle application's session management logic.
    5.  **Session Timeout:** Configure appropriate session timeouts within your Bottle application's session management to limit session lifespan.
    6.  **Secure Storage:** Ensure session data managed by Bottle or your chosen library is stored securely on the server-side.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Session Hijacking - Severity: High (if session cookies are not properly secured in Bottle applications)
    *   Session Fixation - Severity: Medium (if session IDs are not regenerated in Bottle applications)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Session Hijacking: Significantly reduces the risk of session hijacking by securing session cookies and session management within Bottle.
    *   Session Fixation: Reduces the risk of session fixation attacks by implementing session ID regeneration in Bottle applications.
*   **Currently Implemented:** [Specify Yes/No/Partially and where it's implemented in your project. Example: Partially - HTTPS enforced, but HttpOnly and Secure flags not set for Bottle session cookies]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Specify where it's missing if not fully implemented. Example: HttpOnly and Secure flags need to be enabled for Bottle session cookies / Session ID regeneration not implemented in Bottle application]
