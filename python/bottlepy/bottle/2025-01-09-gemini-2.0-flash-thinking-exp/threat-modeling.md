# Threat Model Analysis for bottlepy/bottle

## Threat: [Information Disclosure through Default Error Pages](./threats/information_disclosure_through_default_error_pages.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can trigger application errors (e.g., by providing invalid input or accessing non-existent resources) to view Bottle's default error pages. These pages often contain sensitive information like stack traces, file paths, and internal application structure. This information can be used to understand the application's inner workings and identify further vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive application details, aiding attackers in reconnaissance and exploitation. Could reveal database credentials, API keys, or internal logic.
*   **Affected Bottle Component:** `bottle.handle_error` (default error handler), `bottle.HTTPError`
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement custom error handlers using `app.error()` to provide generic error messages to users and log detailed errors securely.
    *   Disable debug mode (`debug=False`) in production environments.
    *   Ensure error logging is configured to write to secure locations and not exposed publicly.

## Threat: [Unintended File Access via Static File Serving](./threats/unintended_file_access_via_static_file_serving.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could craft malicious URLs to bypass intended restrictions on static file serving. By manipulating path segments (e.g., using `..`), they might be able to access files outside the designated static directories, potentially exposing configuration files, source code, or other sensitive data.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, potentially leading to data breaches, configuration compromise, or exposure of application source code.
*   **Affected Bottle Component:** `bottle.static_file()` function, `bottle.Bottle.mount()` for static routes.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Explicitly define allowed static file directories and ensure the application does not serve sensitive directories as static.
    *   Use secure path joining functions (e.g., `os.path.join()`) and validate that requested file paths remain within the allowed static directory.
    *   Avoid directly using user-provided input in file paths for static file serving without thorough sanitization.
    *   Consider using a dedicated static file server (like Nginx or Apache) in front of Bottle for production deployments, as they often have more robust security features for static content.

## Threat: [Remote Code Execution via Debug Mode in Production](./threats/remote_code_execution_via_debug_mode_in_production.md)

*   **Description:** If a Bottle application is mistakenly run with debug mode enabled in a production environment, the interactive debugger becomes accessible. An attacker who gains access to the server (e.g., through a separate vulnerability) can then execute arbitrary Python code on the server, leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Impact:** Full control of the server, including data access, modification, deletion, and the ability to install malware or pivot to other systems.
*   **Affected Bottle Component:** The `debug` parameter in `bottle.run()` or the `BOTTLE_DEBUG` environment variable.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never** run Bottle applications with `debug=True` in production environments.
    *   Ensure the `BOTTLE_DEBUG` environment variable is not set to a truthy value in production.
    *   Implement infrastructure-level controls to prevent unauthorized access to the server.

## Threat: [Insecure Session Management due to Default Cookie Settings](./threats/insecure_session_management_due_to_default_cookie_settings.md)

*   **Description:** Bottle's default cookie settings for session management might lack crucial security attributes like `HttpOnly` or `Secure`. This makes session cookies vulnerable to client-side scripting attacks (XSS) where an attacker can steal the cookie, or interception over insecure HTTP connections.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking, allowing attackers to impersonate legitimate users and gain unauthorized access to their accounts and data.
*   **Affected Bottle Component:**  Mechanisms for setting cookies, potentially within session management plugins or custom cookie handling.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Explicitly set secure and appropriate cookie attributes (e.g., `httponly=True`, `secure=True`, `samesite='Lax' or 'Strict'`) when managing sessions or setting cookies.
    *   Enforce HTTPS for all application traffic to protect cookies with the `Secure` attribute.
    *   Use a robust session management library or plugin that provides secure defaults.
