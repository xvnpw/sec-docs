## Deep Analysis: Path Traversal via Static File Serving in Bottle Applications

**Context:** This analysis focuses on the "Path Traversal via Static File Serving" attack path within a Bottle application, as identified in the provided attack tree. This path is marked as "HIGH RISK" due to its potential for significant impact.

**Attack Tree Path:**

* **Root:** Access Sensitive Information
    * **Sub-Goal:** Exploit Application Vulnerabilities
        * **Attack Vector:** Path Traversal
            * **Specific Scenario:** Path Traversal via Static File Serving [HIGH RISK PATH]

**Detailed Analysis:**

**1. Understanding the Vulnerability:**

* **Core Concept:** Path Traversal (also known as directory traversal) is a web security vulnerability that allows attackers to access files and directories that are located outside the web server's document root. This is achieved by manipulating file path references within HTTP requests.
* **Bottle Context:** Bottle, by default, can serve static files using the `bottle.static_file()` function. This function takes a filename and a root directory as arguments. The vulnerability arises when:
    * **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application doesn't properly sanitize or validate the `filename` parameter provided by the user in the request.
    * **Predictable or Unrestricted Root:** The `root` directory is not carefully controlled, or the application logic allows users to influence this parameter indirectly.

**2. How the Attack Works in Bottle:**

* **Mechanism:** Attackers craft malicious HTTP requests containing specially crafted filenames. These filenames utilize sequences like `../` (parent directory traversal) or absolute paths to navigate outside the intended `root` directory.
* **Example Attack Request:**
    ```
    GET /static/../../../../etc/passwd HTTP/1.1
    Host: vulnerable-bottle-app.com
    ```
    In this example, the attacker is trying to access the `/etc/passwd` file, a sensitive system file on Linux-based servers. The `../../../../` sequence attempts to navigate up the directory structure from the assumed static file directory.
* **Bottle's Role:** If the Bottle application uses `bottle.static_file()` without proper validation, it might interpret the manipulated path and attempt to locate the file relative to the specified `root`. If the traversal is successful in reaching a sensitive file, the server will serve its content to the attacker.

**3. Prerequisites for a Successful Attack:**

* **Static File Serving Enabled:** The Bottle application must be configured to serve static files using `bottle.static_file()`.
* **Lack of Input Validation:** The application must fail to adequately sanitize or validate the filename provided in the request. This includes:
    * Not stripping or blocking `../` sequences.
    * Not rejecting absolute paths.
    * Not having a whitelist of allowed filenames or paths.
* **Accessible Sensitive Files:** The attacker needs to know or guess the path to sensitive files on the server's filesystem. Common targets include:
    * Configuration files (e.g., database credentials, API keys)
    * Source code
    * Log files
    * System files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`)
    * Temporary files

**4. Potential Impact (Why it's HIGH RISK):**

* **Exposure of Sensitive Data:**  The most immediate impact is the potential for attackers to read sensitive information, leading to:
    * **Data Breaches:** Access to user data, financial information, or intellectual property.
    * **Credential Theft:** Exposure of database credentials, API keys, or other authentication secrets.
* **Server Compromise:** In severe cases, attackers might be able to access executable files or configuration files that could allow them to:
    * **Gain Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  If they can upload or modify executable files.
    * **Escalate Privileges:** If they can access files containing privileged user credentials.
* **Information Disclosure:**  Revealing server configuration details or internal application structure can aid further attacks.
* **Reputational Damage:** A successful attack can severely damage the organization's reputation and customer trust.
* **Legal and Regulatory Consequences:** Data breaches can lead to significant fines and legal repercussions.

**5. Detection and Identification:**

* **Code Review:** Examining the code where `bottle.static_file()` is used is crucial. Look for:
    * How the `filename` parameter is obtained from the request.
    * Whether any validation or sanitization is performed on the `filename`.
    * How the `root` directory is defined and if it's controllable by user input.
* **Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST):** SAST tools can automatically scan the codebase for potential path traversal vulnerabilities.
* **Dynamic Analysis Security Testing (DAST):** DAST tools can simulate attacks by sending malicious requests with path traversal sequences and observing the server's response.
* **Penetration Testing:**  Security experts can manually attempt to exploit the vulnerability to assess its impact.
* **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs):** WAFs can be configured to detect and block requests containing common path traversal patterns.
* **Security Logs:** Monitoring server logs for suspicious file access attempts can help identify potential exploitation.

**6. Prevention and Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Avoid Serving Sensitive Files Directly:** The best defense is to avoid serving sensitive files through the application in the first place. If possible, store sensitive data outside the web server's document root and access it through application logic with proper authorization checks.
* **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    * **Whitelist Approach:** Define a strict whitelist of allowed filenames and extensions. Reject any requests that don't match the whitelist.
    * **Path Canonicalization:** Convert the user-provided path to its canonical form (e.g., by resolving symbolic links and removing redundant separators like `//` and `/.`). Compare the canonicalized path against the allowed paths.
    * **Blacklist Approach (Less Recommended):**  While less robust, you can block common path traversal sequences like `../`. However, attackers can often bypass simple blacklists with variations.
    * **Reject Absolute Paths:**  Disallow filenames that start with `/` or drive letters (e.g., `C:\`).
* **Securely Configure the `root` Parameter:**
    * **Use Absolute Paths:** Ensure the `root` parameter in `bottle.static_file()` points to an absolute path within the intended static file directory.
    * **Minimize Scope:** Restrict the `root` directory to the specific directory containing static files and avoid using the server's root directory.
    * **Avoid User-Controlled `root`:**  Never allow user input to directly influence the `root` parameter.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the web server process has the minimum necessary permissions to access the static files.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Regularly assess the application for vulnerabilities, including path traversal.
* **Keep Bottle and Dependencies Updated:**  Ensure you are using the latest stable version of Bottle and its dependencies to benefit from security patches.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While not a direct mitigation for path traversal, a well-configured CSP can help prevent the execution of malicious scripts if an attacker manages to upload or access them.

**7. Example of Secure Implementation:**

```python
from bottle import route, run, static_file
import os

STATIC_DIR = './public'  # Define a specific, controlled static directory

@route('/static/<filename:path>')
def server_static(filename):
    # Sanitize the filename (example: remove '..')
    if '..' in filename:
        return "Access Denied"  # Or handle the error appropriately

    # Use os.path.join for secure path construction
    return static_file(filename, root=STATIC_DIR)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    run(host='localhost', port=8080, debug=True)
```

**8. Collaboration with Development Team:**

As a cybersecurity expert, it's crucial to communicate these findings clearly to the development team. Focus on:

* **Explaining the Risk:** Emphasize the potential impact of a successful path traversal attack.
