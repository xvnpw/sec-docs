## Deep Analysis: Template Injection Attack Path in Bottle Application

This document provides a deep analysis of the "Template Injection" attack path within a Bottle application, as outlined in the provided attack tree. This analysis is crucial for understanding the risks and implementing effective security measures.

**CRITICAL NODE: Template Injection [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]**

**Description:** Template Injection is a server-side vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject malicious code into template engines. When the application processes this template, the injected code is executed on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise. This is a critical vulnerability due to the high level of control an attacker can gain.

**Impact:** Successful exploitation of Template Injection can have devastating consequences, including:

* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server, allowing them to install malware, steal sensitive data, or disrupt operations.
* **Data Breach:** Attackers can access and exfiltrate sensitive data stored on the server or connected databases.
* **Server Takeover:** Complete control over the server, allowing the attacker to modify files, create new users, and pivot to other systems.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can crash the application or the entire server.
* **Privilege Escalation:** If the application runs with elevated privileges, the attacker can gain those privileges.

**Why it's a High-Risk Path:**

* **Direct Execution:**  Template engines are designed to interpret and execute code. Injecting malicious code directly into this process bypasses typical security checks.
* **Contextual Execution:** The injected code executes within the context of the server-side application, granting access to resources and functionalities.
* **Difficulty in Detection:** Identifying and preventing Template Injection can be challenging if proper sanitization and security measures are not in place.

**HIGH RISK PATH 1: Inject Malicious Code in Template Variables [HIGH RISK PATH]**

**Description:** This path exploits the direct use of user-controlled data within Bottle templates without proper sanitization or escaping. Bottle, by default, uses its own simple templating engine but can also integrate with more feature-rich engines like Jinja2. Regardless of the engine, if user input is directly embedded into the template context, it can be interpreted as code rather than plain text.

**Attack Scenario:**

1. **Vulnerability Identification:** The attacker analyzes the application's code and identifies areas where user input is directly passed to the template engine. This could be through URL parameters, form data, or other input mechanisms.
2. **Crafting Malicious Input:** The attacker crafts input containing template engine syntax that, when rendered, executes arbitrary code. The specific syntax depends on the template engine being used.

**Example (assuming Jinja2 is used with Bottle):**

Let's say a Bottle route renders a template like this:

```python
from bottle import route, run, template

@route('/hello/<name>')
def hello(name):
    return template('<b>Hello {{name}}</b>', name=name)

run(host='localhost', port=8080)
```

An attacker could send a request like: `/hello/{{ ''.__class__.__mro__[2].__subclasses__()[408]('ls -la', shell=True, stdout=-1).communicate()[0].strip() }}`

**Explanation of the payload:**

* `{{ ... }}`: This is the Jinja2 syntax for executing expressions.
* `''.__class__.__mro__[2].__subclasses__()[408]`: This part attempts to access a specific subclass related to process execution (the exact index might vary depending on the Python version).
* `('ls -la', shell=True, stdout=-1).communicate()[0].strip()`: This part executes the shell command `ls -la` and captures its output.

**Impact of Successful Exploitation:**

* In the above example, the server would execute the `ls -la` command, and the output would potentially be displayed in the rendered HTML or accessible through other means.
* More sophisticated payloads could be used to execute arbitrary Python code, leading to RCE.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Contextual Auto-Escaping:**  Ensure that the template engine is configured to automatically escape variables based on the output context (e.g., HTML escaping for HTML output). Bottle's default template engine does this by default. Jinja2 also offers auto-escaping.
* **Manual Escaping:** Explicitly escape user-provided data before passing it to the template. Bottle provides the `html_escape()` function for this purpose.
* **Avoid Direct Variable Usage:**  Whenever possible, avoid directly embedding user input into template variables. Instead, process and sanitize the data before passing it to the template.
* **Sandboxing:** If absolute control over template rendering is needed, consider using a sandboxed template environment that restricts access to sensitive functions and modules.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to limit the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of injected scripts if they manage to bypass server-side defenses.
* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  While not directly preventing template injection, validating and sanitizing user input can reduce the likelihood of malicious payloads being effective.

**HIGH RISK PATH 2: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Template Engine (e.g., Jinja2 if used with Bottle) [HIGH RISK PATH]**

**Description:** This path focuses on exploiting known vulnerabilities within the specific template engine used by the Bottle application. Template engines, like any software, can have security flaws that allow attackers to bypass intended security mechanisms and achieve code execution. This is particularly relevant when using third-party template engines like Jinja2.

**Attack Scenario:**

1. **Vulnerability Research:** Attackers research known vulnerabilities (often documented as CVEs - Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) in the specific version of the template engine used by the application.
2. **Identifying the Template Engine and Version:** Attackers may try to infer the template engine and its version through error messages, HTTP headers, or by analyzing the application's code or dependencies.
3. **Crafting Exploits:** Based on the identified vulnerability, attackers craft specific input or template constructs that trigger the flaw in the template engine.

**Example (Conceptual - Specific CVEs change over time):**

Imagine an outdated version of Jinja2 had a vulnerability where a specific combination of filters and syntax could bypass security checks and allow arbitrary code execution.

An attacker might craft a template input like: `{{ some_variable | vulnerable_filter('malicious_code') }}`

**Impact of Successful Exploitation:**

* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Vulnerabilities in template engines often lead to the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server.
* **Bypassing Security Measures:** Attackers can bypass intended sanitization or escaping mechanisms implemented by the application.
* **Gaining Access to Sensitive Data:**  Exploiting template engine vulnerabilities can grant access to internal application data or server resources.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Keep Template Engine Up-to-Date:** Regularly update the template engine to the latest stable version. Security updates often patch known vulnerabilities.
* **Dependency Management:** Use a robust dependency management system (e.g., `pip` with `requirements.txt` or `poetry`) to track and update dependencies, including the template engine.
* **Security Scanning:** Utilize static and dynamic application security testing (SAST/DAST) tools that can identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
* **Vulnerability Monitoring:** Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases for the specific template engine being used.
* **Consider Alternative Template Engines:** If the current template engine has a history of security issues, consider switching to a more secure alternative.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the application and the template rendering process run with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of a successful exploit.
* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can help detect and block malicious requests targeting known template injection vulnerabilities.

**Conclusion and Recommendations:**

Template Injection poses a significant threat to Bottle applications. Both paths described above highlight the importance of secure template handling. The development team should prioritize the following:

* **Default to Secure Practices:** Implement auto-escaping by default and avoid directly embedding user input in templates.
* **Regularly Update Dependencies:** Keep the Bottle framework and any used template engines (like Jinja2) up-to-date.
* **Security Audits and Code Reviews:** Conduct regular security audits and code reviews to identify potential template injection vulnerabilities.
* **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization, although this is not a complete defense against template injection.
* **Educate Developers:** Ensure developers are aware of the risks associated with template injection and how to prevent it.
* **Implement Security Monitoring:** Monitor application logs and network traffic for suspicious activity that might indicate a template injection attempt.

By understanding the mechanics of these attack paths and implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of successful template injection attacks and protect the application and its users.
