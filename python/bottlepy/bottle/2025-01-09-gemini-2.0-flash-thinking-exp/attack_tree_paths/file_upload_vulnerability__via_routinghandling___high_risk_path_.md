## Deep Analysis: File Upload Vulnerability (via routing/handling) in Bottle Application

**ATTACK TREE PATH:** File Upload Vulnerability (via routing/handling) [HIGH RISK PATH]

**Context:** This analysis focuses on a high-risk attack path targeting a Bottle web application. The attacker aims to leverage weaknesses in the application's file upload mechanism, specifically exploiting the interaction between file handling and Bottle's routing system to execute malicious code.

**Detailed Breakdown of the Attack Path:**

This attack path can be broken down into several key stages:

**1. Identifying Vulnerable File Upload Endpoints:**

* **Reconnaissance:** The attacker starts by identifying potential file upload endpoints within the Bottle application. This can involve:
    * **Manual Inspection:** Examining the application's routes, forms, and API endpoints for any functionality that allows file uploads.
    * **Automated Scanning:** Using tools like Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, or specialized web vulnerability scanners to identify upload forms or API endpoints.
    * **Code Review (if possible):** Analyzing the application's source code (if accessible) to understand how file uploads are handled.
* **Focus on Routing Logic:** The attacker specifically looks for upload endpoints where the subsequent handling of the uploaded file is influenced by Bottle's routing or application logic. This means endpoints where the filename, path, or content of the uploaded file is used in later routing decisions or processing.

**2. Exploiting Weaknesses in File Upload Handling:**

* **Lack of Proper Validation:** The most common weakness is insufficient validation of the uploaded file. This includes:
    * **MIME Type Validation:** The application might rely solely on the client-provided `Content-Type` header, which can be easily spoofed.
    * **File Extension Validation:**  Simple checks against a whitelist of allowed extensions can be bypassed using techniques like double extensions (e.g., `malicious.php.txt`) or null byte injection.
    * **File Content Inspection:**  The application might not perform deep inspection of the file's content to identify malicious payloads.
    * **Filename Sanitization:**  Failure to sanitize filenames can lead to path traversal vulnerabilities (e.g., uploading a file named `../../../../evil.py`).
* **Insufficient Size Restrictions:** While not directly related to code execution, lack of size restrictions can facilitate denial-of-service attacks or be used to upload larger malicious files.
* **Insecure Temporary File Handling:** If the application uses temporary files during the upload process, vulnerabilities might exist in how these files are stored, accessed, or cleaned up.

**3. Bypassing File Type or Size Restrictions:**

* **MIME Type Spoofing:** As mentioned, attackers can manipulate the `Content-Type` header in their HTTP request to bypass basic MIME type checks.
* **Extension Manipulation:** Techniques like double extensions, adding trailing spaces, or using special characters can bypass simple extension whitelists.
* **Magic Byte Manipulation:**  Adding legitimate "magic bytes" to the beginning of a malicious file can trick basic file type detection mechanisms.
* **File Splitting and Reassembly:** In some cases, attackers might split a large malicious file into smaller chunks and upload them separately, hoping to bypass size restrictions or detection.

**4. Uploading Malicious Code (e.g., Python Scripts):**

* **Targeting Python Execution:** Since the application is built with Bottle (a Python framework), uploading Python scripts (`.py`) is a direct way to achieve code execution.
* **Web Shells:** Attackers often upload web shells â€“ small scripts that provide a remote command-line interface on the server.
* **Backdoors:**  More sophisticated malicious code can be uploaded to establish persistent access to the server.

**5. Triggering Execution of Uploaded Code via Bottle's Routing or Application Logic:**

This is the crucial step where the attacker leverages Bottle's features to execute the uploaded malicious code. Several scenarios are possible:

* **Direct Access via Static File Serving:**
    * If Bottle is configured to serve static files from the upload directory (or a directory where the uploaded file is moved), the attacker might be able to directly access the uploaded malicious script via its URL.
    * **Example:** If files are uploaded to `/uploads/` and Bottle serves static files from this directory, accessing `/uploads/evil.py` in a browser could potentially execute the script if the server is configured to execute Python files. **Note:** This is generally not the default behavior and requires specific server configurations.
* **Exploiting Routing Logic:**
    * **Filename as Part of the Route:** If the application uses the uploaded filename in its routing logic (e.g., dynamically generating URLs based on filenames), an attacker could craft a filename that, when accessed, leads to the execution of their uploaded script.
    * **Example:** A route like `/process/<filename>` might be vulnerable if the `filename` is directly used to locate and execute a script.
* **Inclusion Vulnerabilities:**
    * If the application includes or imports files based on user input derived from the uploaded filename or path, an attacker can manipulate this input to include their malicious script.
    * **Example:**  `exec(open(request.forms.get('filename')).read())` (highly insecure example).
* **Template Engine Exploitation:**
    * If the uploaded file's content is later processed by a template engine (e.g., Jinja2), and the application doesn't properly sanitize the content, the attacker might be able to inject template directives that lead to code execution.
* **Background Processing/Queues:**
    * If the application uses background tasks or queues to process uploaded files, vulnerabilities in the processing logic could lead to the execution of malicious code.
* **Database Interaction:**
    * If the uploaded file's content is stored in a database and later retrieved and executed (e.g., through a stored procedure or dynamic code generation), this could lead to code execution.

**Example Scenario (Illustrative):**

Let's imagine a simplified vulnerable Bottle application:

```python
from bottle import route, run, request, static_file
import os

UPLOAD_FOLDER = './uploads'
ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = {'txt', 'jpg', 'png'}

def allowed_file(filename):
    return '.' in filename and filename.rsplit('.', 1)[1].lower() in ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS

@route('/upload', method='POST')
def upload_file():
    upload = request.files.get('upload')
    name, ext = os.path.splitext(upload.filename)
    if upload and allowed_file(upload.filename):
        upload.save(os.path.join(UPLOAD_FOLDER, upload.filename))
        return "File uploaded successfully!"
    return "Allowed file types are txt, jpg, png"

@route('/view/<filename>')
def view_file(filename):
    return static_file(filename, root=UPLOAD_FOLDER)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    os.makedirs(UPLOAD_FOLDER, exist_ok=True)
    run(host='localhost', port=8080, debug=True)
```

**Vulnerability:**  The `/view/<filename>` route directly serves static files from the `UPLOAD_FOLDER`. If an attacker uploads a file named `evil.py` (bypassing the `allowed_file` check somehow, perhaps through a separate vulnerability or misconfiguration), they can then access `/view/evil.py` and potentially execute the Python script if the server is configured to do so.

**Impact of Successful Exploitation:**

A successful exploitation of this attack path can have severe consequences:

* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, gaining complete control over the application and potentially the underlying system.
* **Data Breach:** The attacker can access sensitive data stored on the server, including user credentials, application data, and potentially data from other systems accessible from the compromised server.
* **Server Takeover:** The attacker can gain full control of the server, allowing them to install malware, create backdoors, and use the server for malicious purposes.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** The attacker can upload malicious files that consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service for legitimate users.
* **Website Defacement:** The attacker can modify the website's content to display malicious or unwanted information.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To prevent this type of attack, developers should implement robust security measures:

* **Strict File Validation:**
    * **Whitelist Allowed Extensions:** Only allow specific, safe file extensions.
    * **MIME Type Validation (Server-Side):**  Don't rely solely on the client-provided `Content-Type`. Use libraries to inspect the file's magic bytes to determine its actual type.
    * **Filename Sanitization:**  Sanitize filenames to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities and other injection attacks.
    * **File Content Scanning:**  Use antivirus or malware scanning tools to inspect uploaded files for malicious content.
* **Secure File Storage:**
    * **Store Uploaded Files Outside the Web Root:** Prevent direct access to uploaded files via HTTP.
    * **Generate Unique Filenames:** Avoid using user-provided filenames directly to prevent predictability and overwriting.
    * **Restrict Permissions:** Set appropriate file system permissions to limit access to uploaded files.
* **Secure Routing and Handling:**
    * **Avoid Using User-Provided Filenames Directly in Routes:**  Don't build URLs or file paths directly from user input.
    * **Implement Access Controls:** Ensure that only authorized users can access or process uploaded files.
    * **Sanitize User Input:**  Thoroughly sanitize any user input derived from uploaded files before using it in application logic.
* **Disable Direct Execution of Uploaded Files:** Configure the web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache) to prevent the execution of scripts within the upload directory.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security assessments to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
* **Keep Dependencies Up-to-Date:**  Ensure that Bottle and all other dependencies are updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Run the web application with the minimum necessary privileges.

**Conclusion:**

The "File Upload Vulnerability (via routing/handling)" attack path highlights the critical importance of secure file upload implementation in web applications. By exploiting weaknesses in validation and leveraging Bottle's routing mechanisms, attackers can achieve remote code execution and compromise the entire application. A defense-in-depth approach, combining strict validation, secure storage, and careful handling of uploaded files within the application logic, is essential to mitigate this high-risk threat. Developers must be aware of the potential attack vectors and implement appropriate security controls to protect their Bottle applications.
