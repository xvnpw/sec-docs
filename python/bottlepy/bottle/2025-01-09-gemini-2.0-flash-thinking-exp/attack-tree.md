## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using Bottle Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_bottle_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker and is inherently critical. Success signifies a significant security breach.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Bottle Weaknesses [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_bottle_weaknesses__critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

This is the top-level strategy for the attacker, focusing specifically on vulnerabilities within the Bottle framework. It's a high-risk path because it directly targets the application's foundation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Code [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_code__critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

This is a critical objective for an attacker. Achieving arbitrary code execution grants them complete control over the server, allowing them to steal data, install malware, or disrupt operations. It's a high-risk path due to the severe consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [Template Injection [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/template_injection__critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Inject Malicious Code in Template Variables [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    *   Attackers identify areas where user-controlled data is directly used within Bottle templates without proper sanitization.
    *   They craft malicious input that, when rendered by the template engine, executes arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Template Engine (e.g., Jinja2 if used with Bottle) [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    *   Attackers target known vulnerabilities within the specific template engine used by the Bottle application (e.g., outdated versions of Jinja2).
    *   They leverage these vulnerabilities to inject code that the template engine executes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Pickle Deserialization Vulnerability (if application uses Bottle's request data with pickle) [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/pickle_deserialization_vulnerability__if_application_uses_bottle's_request_data_with_pickle___critic_98837880.md)

If the application uses Bottle's request handling to receive serialized Python objects (using `pickle`) without proper validation.
Attackers craft malicious pickle payloads that, when deserialized, execute arbitrary code on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [File Upload Vulnerability (via routing/handling) [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/file_upload_vulnerability__via_routinghandling___high_risk_path_.md)

Attackers exploit weaknesses in how the Bottle application handles file uploads.
They bypass file type or size restrictions to upload malicious code (e.g., Python scripts).
They then find ways to trigger the execution of this uploaded code through Bottle's routing or other application logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Sensitive Data [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/access_sensitive_data__high_risk_path_.md)

This path aims to gain unauthorized access to confidential information stored or processed by the application. While the immediate impact might vary, the potential for data breaches makes this a high-risk path.

## Attack Tree Path: [Path Traversal via Static File Serving [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/path_traversal_via_static_file_serving__high_risk_path_.md)

If the Bottle application serves static files, attackers can manipulate file paths in their requests.
They use techniques like "../" to navigate outside the intended directories and access sensitive files on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Session Hijacking (if Bottle's default session handling is weak or misused) [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/session_hijacking__if_bottle's_default_session_handling_is_weak_or_misused___high_risk_path_.md)

Attackers attempt to steal or guess valid session identifiers.
This allows them to impersonate legitimate users and gain access to their accounts and data. This often involves exploiting weaknesses in session ID generation, transmission, or storage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Disrupt Application Availability [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/disrupt_application_availability__high_risk_path_.md)

This path focuses on making the application unavailable or unresponsive to legitimate users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Resource Exhaustion via Request Handling [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/resource_exhaustion_via_request_handling__high_risk_path_.md)

Attackers identify endpoints in the Bottle application that perform resource-intensive operations.
They send a large volume of requests to these endpoints, overwhelming the server's resources (CPU, memory, network) and causing a denial of service.
