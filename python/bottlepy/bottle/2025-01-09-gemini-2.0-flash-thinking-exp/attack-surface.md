# Attack Surface Analysis for bottlepy/bottle

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal via Static File Serving](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_via_static_file_serving.md)

*   **Description:** If Bottle's built-in static file serving is used without proper safeguards, attackers can manipulate the URL to access files outside the designated static directory.
    *   **How Bottle Contributes:** Bottle provides a simple way to serve static files. If the application doesn't sanitize the requested path, it can be vulnerable due to Bottle's direct handling of the file serving.
    *   **Example:** A request like `/static/../../../../etc/passwd` attempting to access the system's password file.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potentially exposing sensitive configuration files, source code, or other critical data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using Bottle's built-in static file serving in production environments.
        *   If used, ensure the static directory is properly configured and the requested path is strictly validated to prevent traversal.
        *   Consider using a dedicated web server (like Nginx or Apache) for serving static files.

## Attack Surface: [Debug Mode Enabled in Production](./attack_surfaces/debug_mode_enabled_in_production.md)

*   **Description:** Running a Bottle application with debug mode enabled in a production environment exposes sensitive information and can create vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Bottle Contributes:** Bottle's debug mode provides detailed error messages, stack traces, and potentially an interactive debugger, which are helpful during development but dangerous in production due to Bottle's direct implementation of this feature.
    *   **Example:** An attacker encountering an error and receiving a detailed stack trace revealing internal code paths and variable names, which can aid in further attacks.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential for remote code execution if the interactive debugger is accessible.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never** run Bottle applications in debug mode in production. Ensure the `debug=False` setting is used.
        *   Implement proper logging and error handling for production environments.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Default Session Management](./attack_surfaces/insecure_default_session_management.md)

*   **Description:** Bottle's default session management uses client-side cookies. If not configured securely, these cookies can be vulnerable to interception or manipulation.
    *   **How Bottle Contributes:** Bottle provides a basic cookie-based session mechanism as its default. The security of this mechanism directly depends on how Bottle sets and handles these cookies.
    *   **Example:** An attacker intercepting a session cookie over an unencrypted connection (HTTP) or manipulating a cookie if it's not properly signed.
    *   **Impact:** Session hijacking, allowing attackers to impersonate legitimate users and access their data or perform actions on their behalf.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always use HTTPS to encrypt communication and protect session cookies.
        *   Set the `httponly` flag on session cookies to prevent client-side JavaScript access.
        *   Set the `secure` flag on session cookies to ensure they are only transmitted over HTTPS.
        *   Consider using a more robust session management solution, potentially storing session data server-side.

## Attack Surface: [Method Spoofing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/method_spoofing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Bottle allows HTTP method spoofing (e.g., using a `_method` parameter in a POST request to simulate a PUT or DELETE). If not handled carefully, this can bypass intended access controls.
    *   **How Bottle Contributes:** Bottle provides functionality to interpret the `_method` parameter or `X-HTTP-Method-Override` header for method spoofing as part of its request handling.
    *   **Example:** An attacker using a POST request with `_method=DELETE` to delete a resource that should only be accessible via a genuine DELETE request.
    *   **Impact:**  Circumvention of intended access controls, leading to unauthorized modification or deletion of data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Be aware of Bottle's method spoofing feature and its implications.
        *   Implement robust authorization checks that are not solely reliant on the HTTP method.
        *   Consider disabling or restricting method spoofing if it's not a required feature.
