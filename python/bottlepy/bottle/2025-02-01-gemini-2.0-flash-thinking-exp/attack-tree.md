## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Template Engine Vulnerabilities -> Template Injection](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_template_engine_vulnerabilities_-_template_injection.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Template Injection.
    * **Description:** An attacker injects malicious code into template variables or template directives that are processed by the template engine (e.g., Bottle's SimpleTemplate or Jinja2 if used). When the template is rendered, this malicious code is executed on the server.
    * **Bottle Context:** If the Bottle application uses templates to dynamically generate web pages and incorporates user-controlled input directly into templates without proper sanitization, it becomes vulnerable.
    * **Potential Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker can execute arbitrary operating system commands on the server, leading to full system compromise, data breaches, and service disruption.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Sanitize user inputs before passing them to template rendering.
        * Use parameterized queries for database access within templates (if applicable, though discouraged).
        * Consider using a safer templating engine or escaping user input by default.
        * Regularly audit template usage for potential injection points.
        * Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate some XSS risks from template injection.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Request Handling Vulnerabilities -> File Upload Vulnerabilities -> Upload malicious files & Achieve file execution](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_request_handling_vulnerabilities_-_file_upload_vulnerabilities_-_upload_malicious_files_&_ac_541f32e6.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Malicious File Upload and Execution.
    * **Description:** An attacker uploads a malicious file (e.g., a web shell, executable, or script) to the Bottle application. If the application does not properly validate file types, sizes, and contents, and if the uploaded file can be accessed and executed by the web server or application, the attacker can gain control.
    * **Bottle Context:** If the Bottle application implements file upload functionality (using Bottle's request handling for file uploads), and if it lacks robust validation and secure storage practices, it is vulnerable.
    * **Potential Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE). By executing a web shell or other malicious code, the attacker can gain control of the web server, potentially compromising the entire system and accessing sensitive data.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement robust file upload validation (type, size, content).
        * Store uploaded files outside the webroot to prevent direct access and execution via the web server.
        * Use a dedicated file server if possible.
        * Scan uploaded files for malware.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Request Handling Vulnerabilities -> Path Traversal via Static File Serving -> Craft requests with manipulated paths & Read sensitive files](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_request_handling_vulnerabilities_-_path_traversal_via_static_file_serving_-_craft_requests_w_593e995a.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Path Traversal (Local File Inclusion).
    * **Description:** An attacker crafts HTTP requests with manipulated file paths (e.g., using `../` sequences) to bypass intended directory restrictions when the Bottle application serves static files. This allows them to access files outside the designated static file directory, potentially including sensitive system files or application code.
    * **Bottle Context:** If the Bottle application uses `bottle.static_file` or `bottle.run(server='auto')` to serve static files, and if file path validation is insufficient, it becomes vulnerable to path traversal.
    * **Potential Impact:** Information Disclosure. Attackers can read sensitive files from the server's file system, such as configuration files, source code, or even system files like `/etc/passwd`. This information can be used for further attacks or direct data breaches.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Carefully configure static file serving directories. Avoid serving sensitive directories.
        * Sanitize and validate file paths in `static_file` calls to prevent traversal sequences.
        * Consider disabling static file serving in production if it is not a necessary feature.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Error Handling Vulnerabilities -> Analyze error messages for sensitive information disclosure](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_error_handling_vulnerabilities_-_analyze_error_messages_for_sensitive_information_disclosure.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Information Disclosure via Error Messages.
    * **Description:** When errors occur in the Bottle application, the default error handling (especially in development mode) might display verbose error messages that contain sensitive information. This information can include file paths, configuration details, database connection strings, or internal application logic.
    * **Bottle Context:** Bottle's default error handling can be verbose. If debug mode is enabled in production or if custom error handling is not implemented to prevent information leakage, the application is vulnerable.
    * **Potential Impact:** Information Disclosure. Sensitive information revealed in error messages can aid attackers in understanding the application's architecture, configuration, and potential vulnerabilities, making further attacks easier.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement custom error handling to avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages, especially in production.
        * Log errors securely for debugging purposes, but do not display detailed error messages to users in production.
        * Disable debug mode in production.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Dependencies -> Exploit identified vulnerabilities in dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_dependencies_-_exploit_identified_vulnerabilities_in_dependencies.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Exploiting Vulnerable Dependencies.
    * **Description:** Bottle applications rely on various dependencies (including Bottle itself and other libraries). If any of these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the application.
    * **Bottle Context:** Like any Python application, Bottle applications use external libraries. If these libraries are not regularly updated and scanned for vulnerabilities, the application becomes susceptible to attacks targeting those vulnerabilities.
    * **Potential Impact:** Varies. The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency. It can range from Denial of Service (DoS) to Remote Code Execution (RCE) and data breaches.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update Bottle and all application dependencies to the latest secure versions.
        * Use dependency vulnerability scanning tools in the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect and address vulnerable dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfiguration/Insecure Deployment -> Identify insecure configurations & Exploit these misconfigurations](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfigurationinsecure_deployment_-_identify_insecure_configurations_&_exploit_these_misco_38d3d83a.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Exploiting Misconfigurations and Insecure Deployment.
    * **Description:**  Insecure configurations and deployment practices can introduce vulnerabilities. Common examples include leaving debug mode enabled in production, using weak secret keys, exposing administrative interfaces without proper protection, or having overly permissive firewall rules.
    * **Bottle Context:** Bottle applications, like any web application, need to be deployed securely. Misconfigurations in the Bottle application itself, the web server it runs on, or the surrounding infrastructure can be exploited.
    * **Potential Impact:** Varies. The impact depends on the specific misconfiguration. It can range from information disclosure and unauthorized access to Remote Code Execution (e.g., if debug mode allows code execution) and full system compromise.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Follow secure deployment practices.
        * Disable debug mode in production.
        * Use strong, randomly generated secret keys for any cryptographic operations.
        * Properly configure the web server and firewall to restrict access to only necessary ports and services.
        * Regularly review and harden application configuration and deployment settings.
