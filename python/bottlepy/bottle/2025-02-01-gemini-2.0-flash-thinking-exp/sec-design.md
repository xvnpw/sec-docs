# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project is the Bottle Python web framework. Bottle is a micro web framework for Python that is designed to be fast, simple and lightweight. It is distributed as a single file module and has no dependencies other than the Python standard library.

The primary business goal of the Bottle project is to provide a user-friendly and efficient tool for Python developers to quickly build web applications and APIs. The framework prioritizes ease of use and minimal overhead, making it suitable for small to medium-sized projects, prototypes, and educational purposes.

Key business priorities include:
- Simplicity and ease of use for developers.
- Performance and efficiency for web applications.
- Stability and reliability of the framework.
- Active community support and maintenance.

Most important business risks that need to be addressed:
- Security vulnerabilities in the framework that could be exploited in applications built using Bottle.
- Lack of comprehensive features compared to larger frameworks, potentially limiting its applicability for complex projects.
- Dependency on the Python standard library, which might have its own vulnerabilities.
- Community support waning, leading to slower security updates and bug fixes.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Code review process by maintainers (inferred from open source nature and contribution model). Location: GitHub repository contribution guidelines and pull request reviews.
- security control: Unit and integration testing (inferred from standard software development practices). Location: Test suite within the GitHub repository.
- security control: Reliance on Python standard library security (implicitly inherits security features and vulnerabilities of the Python standard library). Location: Python documentation and standard library source code.

Accepted risks:
- accepted risk: Limited resources for dedicated security testing compared to larger frameworks.
- accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities due to the framework's simplicity and focus on core features.
- accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for identifying and fixing security issues.

Recommended security controls:
- recommended security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code.
- recommended security control: Conduct regular dependency checks to identify and update vulnerable dependencies (although Bottle has minimal dependencies, checking Python version and standard library is still relevant).
- recommended security control: Establish a clear process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities, including a security policy and contact information.
- recommended security control: Consider incorporating fuzzing or dynamic analysis to discover runtime vulnerabilities.

Security requirements:
- Authentication: While Bottle itself does not provide built-in authentication mechanisms, applications built with Bottle will likely require authentication. Security Requirement: Applications using Bottle should implement robust authentication mechanisms to verify user identities.
- Authorization: Similarly, Bottle does not handle authorization. Security Requirement: Applications should implement proper authorization to control access to resources based on user roles and permissions.
- Input Validation: Bottle applications must handle user inputs securely to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting). Security Requirement: All user inputs should be validated and sanitized to prevent common web vulnerabilities.
- Cryptography: Applications might need to use cryptography for secure data storage and communication (e.g., HTTPS, password hashing). Security Requirement: When handling sensitive data, applications should use strong cryptography algorithms and best practices.

## DEPLOYMENT

Deployment options for applications built with Bottle are varied, ranging from simple local deployments to complex cloud-based architectures. Common deployment environments include:

1. Local Development Server: Using Bottle's built-in development server for testing and development. Not recommended for production.
2. WSGI Server (Standalone): Deploying Bottle applications using standalone WSGI servers like Gunicorn or uWSGI, often behind a reverse proxy like Nginx or Apache.
3. Platform as a Service (PaaS): Deploying to platforms like Heroku, Google App Engine, or AWS Elastic Beanstalk, which handle infrastructure management.
4. Containerized Deployment (Docker/Kubernetes): Packaging Bottle applications in Docker containers and deploying them using container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.
5. Serverless Functions: In some cases, Bottle applications (or parts of them) can be adapted to run as serverless functions on platforms like AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions.

```

Build Process Description:

1. Developer writes code and commits changes to the Source Code Repository (GitHub).
2. Code changes in the repository trigger the CI Server (e.g., GitHub Actions).
3. CI Server sets up a Build Environment, which includes necessary dependencies (Python, build tools).
4. Build Environment performs the build process:
    - Fetches source code.
    - Runs linters and SAST scanners (recommended security control).
    - Executes unit and integration tests.
    - Builds the Python package (e.g., creates a wheel or source distribution).
5. Build Artifacts (Python package) are produced.
6. Build Artifacts are published to the Package Registry (PyPI) for distribution.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process we are trying to protect:
- Availability, integrity, and confidentiality of the Bottle framework itself.
- Security of applications built using the Bottle framework.
- Reputation and trust in the Bottle project.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- Source code of the Bottle framework: High sensitivity. Confidentiality and integrity are crucial to prevent unauthorized modifications or exposure of vulnerabilities.
- Build artifacts (Python packages): High sensitivity. Integrity is crucial to ensure users download legitimate and untampered packages.
- Vulnerability information: High sensitivity. Confidentiality is important until a fix is released to prevent exploitation.
- User data in applications built with Bottle: Sensitivity depends on the application. Bottle framework itself does not handle user data, but applications built with it will.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What is the current process for handling security vulnerabilities in Bottle? Is there a security policy or dedicated contact?
- Are there any existing automated security checks (SAST, dependency scanning) in the CI/CD pipeline?
- What is the process for releasing security updates?
- Is there any formal security testing or penetration testing performed on the Bottle framework?

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to provide a secure, reliable, and easy-to-use micro web framework for Python developers.
- SECURITY POSTURE: The project relies on community contributions and standard open-source development practices for security. There is no dedicated security team or budget.
- DESIGN: The design is centered around a single-file library providing core web framework functionalities. Deployment is flexible and depends on the application built with Bottle. Build process involves standard Python packaging and distribution practices.
