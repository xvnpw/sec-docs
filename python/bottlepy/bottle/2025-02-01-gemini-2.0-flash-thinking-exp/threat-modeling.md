# Threat Model Analysis for bottlepy/bottle

## Threat: [Path Traversal via Dynamic Routes](./threats/path_traversal_via_dynamic_routes.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates URL path parameters in dynamic routes (e.g., `/files/<filepath>`) to access files outside the intended directory. They might craft URLs like `/files/../../etc/passwd` to read sensitive system files.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, potential data breaches, system compromise.
*   **Bottle Component Affected:** Routing, Request Handling (specifically dynamic route parameters).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly validate and sanitize user input in route handlers, especially path components.
    *   Use `os.path.normpath`, `os.path.abspath`, and `os.path.commonprefix` to restrict file access within allowed directories.
    *   Avoid directly using user input to construct file paths; use IDs or database references instead.

## Threat: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./threats/server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious code into user-controlled data that is then rendered by a vulnerable template engine (especially simple engines or Bottle's default if not used carefully). The template engine executes this injected code on the server.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, full server compromise, data breaches, denial of service.
*   **Bottle Component Affected:** Templating (if using Bottle's default or simple engines).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use a robust and secure templating engine like Jinja2 with auto-escaping.
    *   Always escape user-provided data when rendering templates.
    *   Avoid constructing templates dynamically from user input.

## Threat: [Insecure Default Development Server in Production](./threats/insecure_default_development_server_in_production.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities or limitations of Bottle's built-in development server if it is mistakenly used in a production environment. This server is not designed for production and lacks security features and performance optimizations.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, information disclosure, potential remote code execution depending on specific vulnerabilities in the development server.
*   **Bottle Component Affected:** Server (Bottle's built-in development server).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Never use Bottle's built-in development server in production.
    *   Use a production-ready WSGI server like Gunicorn, uWSGI, or Waitress.
    *   Enforce the use of production servers in deployment procedures.
