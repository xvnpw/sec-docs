# Attack Surface Analysis for bottlepy/bottle

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal via Dynamic Routes](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_via_dynamic_routes.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can manipulate URL path parameters in dynamic routes to access files or directories outside the intended application scope on the server.
*   **Bottle Contribution:** Bottle's dynamic routing feature allows defining routes with path parameters that can be directly used in file system operations if not handled carefully, directly enabling this attack vector.
*   **Example:**
    *   Route definition: `/static/<filepath>`
    *   Malicious URL: `/static/../../etc/passwd`
    *   If the application directly uses `filepath` to open files without validation, an attacker can read the `/etc/passwd` file.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, access to sensitive system files, application source code exposure.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize path parameters before using them to access files. Use allowlists of allowed characters and paths.
    *   **Path Normalization:** Use functions to normalize paths (e.g., removing `..` and resolving symbolic links) to prevent traversal.
    *   **Restrict File Access:**  Limit the application's file system access to only necessary directories. Avoid using user-provided input to directly construct file paths.
    *   **Consider using static file serving mechanisms:** If serving static files, use Bottle's built-in static file serving or a dedicated web server for better security and control.

## Attack Surface: [Input Validation Vulnerabilities via `request` Object - File Upload](./attack_surfaces/input_validation_vulnerabilities_via__request__object_-_file_upload.md)

*   **Description:**  Bottle's `request` object provides access to user-supplied file uploads. Failure to validate and sanitize uploaded files can lead to critical vulnerabilities.
*   **Bottle Contribution:** Bottle's `request.files` attribute is the direct interface for handling file uploads, making it a key point of entry for file-based attacks.
*   **Example:**
    *   Route handler directly saves `request.files.upload.file` without validation.
    *   Malicious file upload: Uploading a PHP script disguised as an image.
    *   If the uploaded file is accessible via the web, it could lead to remote code execution.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution, Data Breaches, Server Compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **File Type Validation (Allowlist):** Validate file types and extensions against a strict allowlist. Do not rely on client-side validation or file extension alone.
    *   **File Size Limits:** Implement limits on file upload sizes to prevent denial of service and resource exhaustion.
    *   **File Name Sanitization:** Sanitize file names to prevent directory traversal or other injection attacks through filenames.
    *   **Content Scanning:** Perform virus and malware scanning on uploaded files.
    *   **Secure Storage:** Store uploaded files outside the web root or in a dedicated storage service. Ensure proper access controls are in place.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** The application should only have the necessary permissions to handle file uploads and storage, minimizing the impact of a successful exploit.

## Attack Surface: [Template Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/template_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** If user-controlled input is directly embedded into templates without proper escaping or sanitization, attackers can inject malicious template code that executes on the server.
*   **Bottle Contribution:** Bottle's built-in templating and integration with other templating engines make template injection a potential risk if developers are not careful with user input within templates. Bottle facilitates template rendering, making it relevant to this attack surface.
*   **Example (using a hypothetical vulnerable template engine):**
    *   Route handler: `return template('hello_template', name=request.query.name)`
    *   `hello_template.tpl`: `<h1>Hello {{ name }}</h1>` (vulnerable if `{{ name }}` is not properly escaped and the template engine is vulnerable)
    *   Malicious URL: `/?name={{ system('whoami') }}` (example payload for a vulnerable template engine)
    *   This could execute the `whoami` command on the server.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution, Information Disclosure, Server Compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always Escape User Input in Templates:** Ensure that all user-provided data rendered in templates is properly escaped by the templating engine. Use auto-escaping features if available and verify they are active.
    *   **Use Safe Templating Engines:** Choose templating engines known for their security and actively maintained.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Template Rendering:** If possible, run template rendering in a sandboxed environment with limited privileges.
    *   **Avoid Passing Raw User Input to Templates:**  Process and sanitize user input before passing it to the template engine.

## Attack Surface: [Input Validation Vulnerabilities via `request` Object - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_surfaces/input_validation_vulnerabilities_via__request__object_-_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:**  Bottle's `request` object provides access to user-supplied data. Failure to sanitize user input accessed via `request` before rendering it in web pages can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
*   **Bottle Contribution:** Bottle's `request` object is the primary way to access user input, and if this input is directly used in responses without sanitization, Bottle applications become vulnerable to XSS.
*   **Example (XSS):**
    *   Route handler: `return 'Hello ' + request.query.name`
    *   Malicious URL: `/?name=<script>alert('XSS')</script>`
    *   The script will be executed in the user's browser when the response is rendered.
*   **Impact:** Client-side code execution, session hijacking, defacement, phishing attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Output Encoding/Escaping:** Encode or escape output based on the context where it's used (HTML escaping for HTML output, URL encoding for URLs, etc.). Bottle's templating engines often provide auto-escaping features, but ensure they are enabled and used correctly.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement CSP headers to mitigate XSS by controlling the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources.
    *   **Input Validation (for specific cases):** While output encoding is the primary defense for XSS, input validation can also play a role in certain scenarios to reject obviously malicious input.
    *   **Use a Templating Engine with Auto-Escaping:** Leverage templating engines that automatically escape output by default to reduce the risk of developers forgetting to escape user input.
