### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Exploit Request Handling Vulnerabilities -> Path Traversal via Static File Serving -> Craft requests with manipulated paths & Read sensitive files

#### 4.1. Understanding Path Traversal Vulnerability

Path Traversal, also known as Directory Traversal, is a web security vulnerability that allows attackers to access files and directories that are located outside the web server's root directory. This occurs when an application uses user-supplied input to construct file paths without proper sanitization or validation. By manipulating the input, attackers can bypass intended access restrictions and navigate the file system on the server.

Common techniques used in Path Traversal attacks include:

* **Dot-Dot-Slash (../) Sequences:**  These sequences are used to move up directory levels in a file path. For example, `../../../../etc/passwd` attempts to traverse four directories up from the current directory and then access the `/etc/passwd` file.
* **Absolute Paths:**  Providing an absolute file path (e.g., `/etc/passwd`) directly, hoping the application will directly access it.
* **URL Encoding:** Encoding special characters like `/` and `.` using URL encoding (e.g., `%2e%2e%2f` for `../`) to bypass basic input filters.
* **Operating System Specific Paths:** Utilizing operating system-specific path separators (e.g., `\` on Windows) if the application is running on a vulnerable platform and doesn't properly handle different path formats.

#### 4.2. Bottle Context: Static File Serving and Vulnerability Introduction

Bottle, by default, is designed to be lightweight and flexible. It provides functionalities for serving static files, which can be convenient for development and simple applications. However, if not implemented carefully, this feature can introduce Path Traversal vulnerabilities.

**Vulnerable Scenarios in Bottle:**

* **`bottle.static_file()` with Insufficient Path Validation:** The `bottle.static_file(filename, root)` function is used to serve static files. The `root` parameter specifies the directory from which files should be served. If the `filename` parameter, which is often derived from user input (e.g., URL path), is not properly validated, attackers can inject path traversal sequences.

    ```python
    from bottle import route, run, static_file

    @route('/static/<filepath:path>')
    def server_static(filepath):
        return static_file(filepath, root='./static') # Vulnerable if filepath is not sanitized

    run(host='localhost', port=8080)
    ```

    In this example, if an attacker requests `/static/../../../../etc/passwd`, and the `filepath` is not validated, `bottle.static_file` might attempt to serve the file from `./static/../../../../etc/passwd`, which could resolve to `/etc/passwd` if the server's current working directory allows traversal.

* **`bottle.run(server='auto')` in Development/Production (Less Common but Possible):** While `bottle.run(server='auto')` is primarily intended for development, if used carelessly in a production-like environment and combined with static file serving without proper configuration, vulnerabilities can arise. The 'auto' server might not have the robust security features of dedicated web servers like Nginx or Apache, especially if static file serving is not carefully restricted.

**Key Vulnerable Element:** The core issue is the lack of proper sanitization and validation of the `filepath` parameter passed to `bottle.static_file()`.  The application trusts user-provided input to construct file paths without ensuring it stays within the intended `root` directory.

#### 4.3. Attack Vector Breakdown: Crafting Malicious Requests

An attacker would typically follow these steps to exploit Path Traversal in a Bottle application serving static files:

1. **Reconnaissance:**
    * **Identify Static File Serving Endpoints:** Look for URL patterns that suggest static file serving, such as `/static/`, `/files/`, `/assets/`, or similar prefixes in URLs.
    * **Observe Application Behavior:** Send requests to these endpoints with valid file paths to confirm static file serving functionality and understand the expected URL structure.
    * **Error Analysis (Optional):**  If errors are returned for invalid file requests, analyze error messages for clues about the server's file system structure or configuration.

2. **Crafting Malicious Requests with Path Traversal Sequences:**
    * **Inject `../` Sequences:**  Modify the file path in the URL by inserting `../` sequences to attempt to traverse upwards from the intended static file directory.
    * **Example Payloads:**
        * `/static/../../../../etc/passwd`
        * `/static/../../../app.py` (to access application source code)
        * `/static/../../../config.ini` (to access configuration files)
        * URL encoded versions: `/static/%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2fetc/passwd`

3. **Sending Malicious Requests:**
    * Use tools like `curl`, `wget`, or a web browser to send the crafted HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable endpoint.

4. **Analyzing the Response:**
    * **Successful Exploitation:** If the server responds with the content of a sensitive file (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, application code, configuration files), the Path Traversal attack is successful.
    * **Error Responses:** If the server returns errors (e.g., 404 Not Found, 403 Forbidden), it might indicate that the vulnerability is not present, or that some form of input validation is in place (though not necessarily robust enough).  Further testing with different encoding or traversal depths might be needed.
    * **Empty Responses or Unexpected Content:**  If the server returns an empty response or content that is not the expected file, it could mean the path traversal failed, or the server is configured in a way that prevents access to the requested file.

#### 4.4. Potential Impact: Information Disclosure

A successful Path Traversal attack can lead to significant information disclosure, potentially allowing attackers to:

* **Read Sensitive System Files:** Access files like `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow` (if permissions allow), system configuration files, and other sensitive operating system files. This can reveal user accounts, system configurations, and potentially lead to privilege escalation.
* **Access Application Source Code:** Retrieve application source code files (`.py`, `.ini`, `.config`, etc.). This exposes the application's logic, algorithms, database credentials, API keys, and other sensitive information embedded in the code.
* **Read Configuration Files:** Access application configuration files, which often contain database connection strings, API keys, secret keys, and other sensitive settings.
* **Gain Insights for Further Attacks:** The information obtained through Path Traversal can be used to plan and execute more sophisticated attacks, such as exploiting application logic vulnerabilities, gaining unauthorized access to databases, or performing remote code execution.
* **Data Breaches:** In severe cases, exposed configuration files or application data could directly lead to data breaches and compromise of sensitive user information.

#### 4.5. Mitigation Strategies for Bottle Applications

To effectively mitigate Path Traversal vulnerabilities in Bottle applications serving static files, implement the following strategies:

1. **Strictly Control Static File Serving Directories:**
    * **Dedicated Directory:**  Serve static files from a dedicated directory specifically designed for public access. Avoid serving the entire application root directory or sensitive directories.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Only place truly public and non-sensitive files within the static file serving directory.

2. **Sanitize and Validate File Paths:**
    * **Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate the `filepath` parameter received from user requests.
    * **Path Sanitization:**  Use secure path manipulation techniques to prevent traversal sequences.  A robust approach is to use `os.path.normpath()` and `os.path.abspath()` in combination with checking if the resolved path is still within the allowed `root` directory.

    **Example of Secure Path Sanitization in Bottle:**

    ```python
    import os
    from bottle import route, run, static_file, HTTPError

    STATIC_ROOT = './static' # Define your static file directory

    @route('/static/<filepath:path>')
    def server_static(filepath):
        filepath = os.path.normpath(filepath) # Normalize path to remove redundant separators and '..'
        full_path = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(STATIC_ROOT, filepath)) # Get absolute path

        if not full_path.startswith(os.path.abspath(STATIC_ROOT)): # Check if path is still within STATIC_ROOT
            return HTTPError(403, "Access Denied") # Prevent access outside static root

        if not os.path.isfile(full_path): # Ensure it's a file and exists
            return HTTPError(404, "File Not Found")

        return static_file(os.path.basename(full_path), root=STATIC_ROOT, filename=filepath) # Serve using original filename for bottle.static_file

    run(host='localhost', port=8080)
    ```

    **Explanation of Sanitization Code:**

    * `os.path.normpath(filepath)`:  Normalizes the path, resolving redundant separators and `..` components. This helps to clean up potentially malicious paths.
    * `os.path.abspath(os.path.join(STATIC_ROOT, filepath))`:  Constructs the full absolute path by joining the `STATIC_ROOT` and the normalized `filepath`, and then converts it to an absolute path.
    * `full_path.startswith(os.path.abspath(STATIC_ROOT))`:  Crucially, this checks if the resolved `full_path` still starts with the absolute path of the `STATIC_ROOT`. This ensures that the requested file is within the allowed static file directory and prevents traversal outside of it.
    * `os.path.isfile(full_path)`:  Verifies that the resolved path points to an actual file and that the file exists. This prevents attempts to access directories or non-existent files.
    * `HTTPError(403, "Access Denied")` and `HTTPError(404, "File Not Found")`:  Return appropriate HTTP error codes to indicate access denial or file not found, instead of potentially revealing information through generic errors.

3. **Consider Disabling Static File Serving in Production (If Not Needed):**
    * If static file serving is not a core requirement for your production application, consider disabling it altogether. Use a dedicated web server (like Nginx or Apache) to serve static files directly, as they are generally more robust and secure for this purpose. Bottle can then focus on handling dynamic requests.

4. **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
    * Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) that can detect and block Path Traversal attempts. WAFs can analyze HTTP requests and identify malicious patterns, including `../` sequences and other traversal techniques.

5. **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    * Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including Path Traversal, in your Bottle applications.

#### 4.6. Limitations and Edge Cases

* **Complex Path Encoding:** Attackers might use more sophisticated encoding techniques beyond simple URL encoding to bypass basic sanitization. Robust sanitization should handle various encoding schemes.
* **Operating System Differences:** Path handling can vary slightly across operating systems. Ensure your sanitization logic is consistent and effective across the target deployment environments.
* **Application Logic Vulnerabilities:** Path Traversal vulnerabilities can sometimes be combined with other application logic flaws to achieve more significant impact. A comprehensive security assessment should consider the interplay of different vulnerabilities.
* **Configuration Errors:** Even with code-level mitigations, misconfigurations in the deployment environment (e.g., overly permissive file system permissions) can still create vulnerabilities. Secure configuration management is crucial.
