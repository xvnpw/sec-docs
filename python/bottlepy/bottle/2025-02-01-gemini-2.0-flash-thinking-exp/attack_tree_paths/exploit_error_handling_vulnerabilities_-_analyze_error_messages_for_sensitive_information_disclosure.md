### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Exploit Error Handling Vulnerabilities -> Analyze error messages for sensitive information disclosure

#### 4.1. Attack Vector: Information Disclosure via Error Messages

* **Description:** When a Bottle application encounters an error during request processing, it may generate error messages. If not properly configured, these error messages can inadvertently reveal sensitive information about the application's internal workings, configuration, or environment to the user (and potentially an attacker).

* **Bottle Context:** Bottle, by default, provides a helpful debugger and verbose error messages, especially when running in debug mode (`debug=True`). While beneficial for development, this default behavior can be a significant security risk in production environments.  If debug mode is left enabled in production, or if custom error handling is not implemented to sanitize error responses, the application becomes vulnerable to information disclosure.

* **Potential Impact:** Information Disclosure.  The consequences of information disclosure can be severe. Exposed sensitive information can include:
    * **File Paths:** Revealing the server's directory structure, aiding in path traversal attacks.
    * **Configuration Details:**  Displaying database connection strings (usernames, passwords, hostnames), API keys, or internal application settings.
    * **Database Schema Information:**  Error messages from database queries might expose table names, column names, and even data structures.
    * **Internal Application Logic:**  Stack traces and error details can reveal the application's code structure, function names, and algorithms, making reverse engineering and vulnerability discovery easier.
    * **Third-Party Library Versions:**  Error messages might disclose the versions of libraries used, potentially highlighting known vulnerabilities in those libraries.

This information can be leveraged by attackers to:
    * **Gain deeper understanding of the application's architecture.**
    * **Identify potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses.**
    * **Plan and execute more targeted attacks.**
    * **Potentially gain unauthorized access to data or systems.**

* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Implement Custom Error Handling:**  Replace Bottle's default error handler with a custom one that logs detailed errors securely (e.g., to a file or logging service) but returns generic, user-friendly error messages to the client in production.
    * **Disable Debug Mode in Production:**  Ensure that `debug=False` is set when deploying the Bottle application to a production environment. This significantly reduces the verbosity of error messages.
    * **Sanitize Error Messages:**  Even in development, consider sanitizing error messages to remove or redact sensitive information before displaying them.
    * **Use a Dedicated Logging System:**  Implement a robust logging system to capture detailed error information for debugging and monitoring purposes, separate from what is displayed to users.
    * **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Periodically assess the application's error handling mechanisms to identify and address potential information disclosure vulnerabilities.

#### 4.2. Detailed Steps to Exploit

An attacker would typically follow these steps to exploit information disclosure via error messages in a Bottle application:

1. **Reconnaissance and Probing:** The attacker starts by interacting with the application to identify potential error conditions. This can involve:
    * **Invalid Input:** Submitting malformed data to forms or API endpoints.
    * **Accessing Non-Existent Resources:** Requesting URLs that are not supposed to exist.
    * **Triggering Application Logic Errors:**  Attempting actions that might cause exceptions within the application (e.g., division by zero, invalid file operations).
    * **Observing Application Behavior:**  Analyzing the application's responses for any signs of errors, including HTTP status codes (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error) and error messages in the response body.

2. **Analyze Error Messages:** Once an error message is triggered, the attacker carefully examines its content for sensitive information. They look for:
    * **File paths and directory structures.**
    * **Database connection details (usernames, passwords, hostnames).**
    * **API keys or secret tokens.**
    * **Internal function names or code snippets.**
    * **Stack traces revealing application flow.**
    * **Versions of libraries or frameworks used.**

3. **Information Gathering and Attack Planning:** Based on the disclosed information, the attacker can:
    * **Map the application's internal structure.**
    * **Identify potential attack vectors (e.g., path traversal if file paths are revealed).**
    * **Gain insights into the application's configuration and security posture.**
    * **Plan further attacks, such as SQL injection (if database details are exposed) or exploiting known vulnerabilities in identified libraries.**

4. **Escalate Attack (Optional):**  The information gained from error messages can be used to launch more sophisticated attacks. For example, if database credentials are disclosed, the attacker might attempt to directly connect to the database and exfiltrate data.

#### 4.3. Example Error Message (Vulnerable Bottle App)

Let's consider a simple Bottle application that attempts to read a file that might not exist:

```python
from bottle import route, run, request, HTTPError

@route('/read_file')
def read_file():
    filename = request.query.filename
    try:
        with open(filename, 'r') as f:
            content = f.read()
            return f"File content: {content}"
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPError(500, f"Error reading file: {e}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    run(host='localhost', port=8080, debug=True) # Debug mode ON - VULNERABLE!
```

If an attacker accesses `/read_file?filename=non_existent_file.txt`, and debug mode is enabled, the error message might look like this in the browser:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>500 Internal Server Error</title>
    <style type="text/css">
        /* ... (Default Bottle Debugger CSS) ... */
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>500 Internal Server Error</h1>
    <p>Error reading file: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'non_existent_file.txt'</p>
    <h2>Traceback:</h2>
    <pre>
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/path/to/your/bottle_app.py", line 6, in read_file
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'non_existent_file.txt'
    </pre>
    <h2>Request Data:</h2>
    <pre>
GET /read_file?filename=non_existent_file.txt HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
User-Agent: ...
Accept: ...
    </pre>
    <!-- ... (More Debugger Information) ... -->
</body>
</html>
```

**Sensitive Information Disclosed:**

* **File Path:** While not explicitly a full path in this example, the error message reveals the attempted filename `non_existent_file.txt`. In other scenarios, stack traces could reveal full server-side file paths.
* **Code Structure:** The traceback shows the function name (`read_file`) and the line of code where the error occurred, giving insights into the application's logic.
* **Library/Framework Information:**  The presence of the Bottle debugger itself indicates the framework being used.

In a more complex application, the traceback could reveal database connection strings, API keys embedded in code, or other sensitive configuration details.

#### 4.4. Code Example (Vulnerable Bottle App) - Already provided in 4.3

#### 4.5. Code Example (Mitigated Bottle App)

Here's the same Bottle application with mitigated error handling:

```python
from bottle import route, run, request, HTTPError, error, default_app

def custom_error_handler(status_code, message, traceback, error):
    # Log the detailed error securely (e.g., to a file or logging service)
    with open("error.log", "a") as log_file:
        log_file.write(f"[{status_code}] {message}\nTraceback:\n{traceback}\n\n")
    # Return a generic, user-friendly error message
    return f"<h1>Oops! Something went wrong.</h1><p>Please contact support if the issue persists.</p>"

app = default_app()
app.error_handler[500] = custom_error_handler # Register custom handler for 500 errors

@app.route('/read_file')
def read_file():
    filename = request.query.filename
    try:
        with open(filename, 'r') as f:
            content = f.read()
            return f"File content: {content}"
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPError(500, "Error reading file") # Generic error message

if __name__ == '__main__':
    run(app=app, host='localhost', port=8080, debug=False) # Debug mode OFF - MITIGATED!
```

**Key Mitigations:**

* **Custom Error Handler:**  The `custom_error_handler` function is registered to handle 500 errors.
* **Generic Error Message:**  The `HTTPError` in `read_file` now raises a generic message "Error reading file" instead of exposing the exception details.
* **Secure Logging:** The `custom_error_handler` logs the full error details (including traceback) to a file (`error.log`) for debugging, but this information is not exposed to the user.
* **Debug Mode Off:** `debug=False` is set when running the application in production.

Now, when accessing `/read_file?filename=non_existent_file.txt`, the user will see a generic error page:

```html
<h1>Oops! Something went wrong.</h1><p>Please contact support if the issue persists.</p>
```

The detailed error information is logged server-side but not revealed to the client.

#### 4.6. Tools and Techniques for Detection

* **Manual Code Review:**  Examine the application's code, especially error handling logic, to identify areas where detailed error messages might be exposed. Look for places where exceptions are caught and their messages are directly returned to the client without sanitization.
* **Web Application Scanners:**  Use automated web application security scanners (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite Scanner, Nikto) to crawl the application and identify potential information disclosure vulnerabilities. These scanners often look for verbose error messages and stack traces in responses.
* **Fuzzing and Input Validation Testing:**  Submit various types of invalid input to different parts of the application to trigger error conditions and observe the error messages returned.
* **Penetration Testing:**  Engage security professionals to perform penetration testing, specifically focusing on error handling and information disclosure vulnerabilities.

#### 4.7. Severity and Likelihood Assessment

* **Severity:** **Medium to High**. The severity depends on the sensitivity of the information disclosed. If database credentials, API keys, or other highly sensitive data are revealed, the severity is high. Even less sensitive information like file paths and internal logic can significantly aid attackers in further attacks, making the severity at least medium.
* **Likelihood:** **Medium to High**.  The likelihood is high if:
    * Debug mode is enabled in production.
    * Default error handling is used without customization.
    * Developers are not aware of the risks of verbose error messages.
    * The application handles a wide range of user inputs and interactions, increasing the chances of triggering errors.

**Overall Risk:**  The risk of information disclosure via error messages in Bottle applications is significant, especially if default configurations are used in production.

#### 4.8. Conclusion

Information disclosure through error messages is a common yet critical vulnerability in web applications, including those built with Bottle.  By understanding Bottle's default error handling behavior and implementing proper mitigation strategies like custom error handlers, disabling debug mode in production, and sanitizing error messages, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of exposing sensitive information. Regular security assessments and code reviews are crucial to ensure that error handling mechanisms are secure and do not inadvertently aid attackers. Prioritizing secure error handling is a fundamental aspect of building robust and secure Bottle applications.
