Here's the updated threat list containing only high and critical threats directly involving the Bottle framework:

| Threat | Description (Attacker Action & Method) | Impact | Affected Bottle Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Insecure Cookie Handling leading to Session Hijacking** | An attacker intercepts or obtains a user's session cookie due to missing `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, or weak `SameSite` attributes configured via Bottle's cookie handling. They can then use this cookie to impersonate the legitimate user and access their account. | Unauthorized access to user accounts, potential data breaches, and manipulation of user data. | Bottle's Cookie Handling (e.g., `response.set_cookie`, `request.get_cookie`) | High | - **Explicitly set `HttpOnly` attribute:**  Use `response.set_cookie(..., httponly=True)`. <br> - **Enforce `Secure` attribute in HTTPS:** Use `response.set_cookie(..., secure=True)` and ensure the application is served over HTTPS. <br> - **Set appropriate `SameSite` attribute:** Use `response.set_cookie(..., samesite='Strict'/'Lax')` to mitigate CSRF risks. <br> - **Consider using a dedicated session management library for more robust features.** |
| **Client-Side Template Injection (if using Bottle's built-in templating with user input)** | An attacker injects malicious code into user-controlled data that is then directly rendered by Bottle's built-in templating engine (SimpleTemplate) without proper escaping. This code can be executed in the user's browser, potentially leading to XSS. | Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser, leading to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites. | Bottle's SimpleTemplate engine (`bottle.template`, `bottle.view`) | High | - **Always escape user-provided data when rendering it in templates.** Use the escaping mechanisms provided by the templating engine (e.g., `{{! variable }}` in SimpleTemplate). <br> - **Consider using a more secure and feature-rich templating engine like Jinja2, which offers better auto-escaping by default.** Bottle supports using different template engines. <br> - **Avoid constructing template strings dynamically from user input.** |
| **Server-Side Template Injection (if using Bottle's built-in templating with unsanitized server-side data)** | An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the application logic to inject malicious code into data that is processed by Bottle's built-in templating engine on the server-side. This can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server. | Full compromise of the server, data breaches, and the ability to control the application and underlying system. | Bottle's SimpleTemplate engine (`bottle.template`, `bottle.view`) | Critical | - **Never directly embed unsanitized data into template strings, especially if the data originates from external sources or user input.** <br> - **Treat template rendering as a security-sensitive operation.** <br> - **Consider using a sandboxed templating environment if dynamic template generation is absolutely necessary.** |
| **Denial of Service through Slowloris-style Attacks on the Built-in Development Server** | An attacker sends partial HTTP requests to the Bottle development server (accessed via `bottle.run`), keeping connections open and exhausting server resources. This is a known vulnerability of simple development servers. | Application unavailability, preventing legitimate users from accessing the service. | Bottle's Built-in Development Server (`bottle.run`) | High | - **Never use the built-in development server in production environments.** <br> - **Use a production-ready WSGI server like Gunicorn or uWSGI, which are more resilient to such attacks.** |

This list highlights the most critical and high-risk threats that are directly related to the Bottle framework's functionalities. Remember to address these vulnerabilities to ensure the security of your Bottle applications.
