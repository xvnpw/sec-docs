# Attack Tree Analysis for bottlepy/bottle

Objective: To compromise application that use given project by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the project itself.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
* Compromise Application
    * Exploit Bottle Weaknesses
        * Response Generation Vulnerabilities **[HIGH RISK PATH]**
            * Template Injection (if using templating) **[HIGH RISK PATH]**
                * Execute Arbitrary Code **CRITICAL NODE**
        * Development Server in Production **CRITICAL NODE** **[HIGH RISK PATH]**
            * Lack of Security Features **[HIGH RISK PATH]**
        * Error Handling Vulnerabilities
            * Information Disclosure via Error Messages **CRITICAL NODE**
```


## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Response Generation Vulnerabilities -> Template Injection -> Execute Arbitrary Code](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_response_generation_vulnerabilities_-_template_injection_-_execute_arbitrary_code.md)

* **Response Generation Vulnerabilities:**
    * Description: Weaknesses in how the application generates responses, particularly when incorporating dynamic content.
    * Likelihood: Medium
    * Impact: High
    * Effort: Low to Medium
    * Skill Level: Intermediate
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium

* **Template Injection (if using templating):**
    * Description: If the application uses a templating engine and user-controlled data is directly embedded into templates without proper escaping, an attacker can inject malicious code.
    * Likelihood: Medium
    * Impact: Critical
    * Effort: Low to Medium
    * Skill Level: Intermediate
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium

* **Execute Arbitrary Code (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * Description: Successful exploitation of template injection allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    * Likelihood: High (if template injection is successful)
    * Impact: Critical
    * Effort: N/A
    * Skill Level: N/A
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Development Server in Production -> Lack of Security Features](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_development_server_in_production_-_lack_of_security_features.md)

* **Development Server in Production (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * Description: Running Bottle's built-in development server in a production environment, which lacks essential security features.
    * Likelihood: Low to Medium
    * Impact: High
    * Effort: N/A
    * Skill Level: Beginner
    * Detection Difficulty: Low

* **Lack of Security Features:**
    * Description: The development server lacks security features present in production-ready servers, making exploitation easier.
    * Likelihood: Always true for the development server
    * Impact: High
    * Effort: N/A
    * Skill Level: N/A
    * Detection Difficulty: N/A

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Nodes](./attack_tree_paths/critical_nodes.md)

* **Execute Arbitrary Code:**
    * Description: The attacker achieves the ability to run arbitrary commands on the server.
    * Likelihood: High (if a preceding vulnerability is exploited)
    * Impact: Critical
    * Effort: N/A
    * Skill Level: N/A
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium

* **Development Server in Production:**
    * Description: The application is running using Bottle's development server in a live environment.
    * Likelihood: Low to Medium
    * Impact: High
    * Effort: N/A
    * Skill Level: Beginner (for exploitation)
    * Detection Difficulty: Low

* **Information Disclosure via Error Messages:**
    * Description: The application exposes sensitive information through error messages, often due to debug mode being enabled in production.
    * Likelihood: Medium
    * Impact: Medium
    * Effort: Low
    * Skill Level: Beginner
    * Detection Difficulty: Low
