# Threat Model Analysis for bottlepy/bottle

## Threat: [Path Traversal via Insecure Route Parameters](./threats/path_traversal_via_insecure_route_parameters.md)

*   **Threat:** Path Traversal via Insecure Route Parameters
    *   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate URL parameters within a route definition to access files or directories outside the intended scope. For example, if a route is defined as `/download/<filepath>`, an attacker might use `../sensitive.txt` as the `filepath` to access a sensitive file on the server. This directly exploits how Bottle handles route parameters.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive files, potential data breaches, and exposure of application source code or configuration files.
    *   **Affected Component:** Bottle's routing mechanism, specifically how route parameters are handled and used within request handlers.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly sanitize and validate all route parameters before using them to access files or directories.
        *   Use functions like `os.path.abspath` and `os.path.normpath` to normalize paths and prevent traversal.
        *   Implement whitelists of allowed file paths or directories.
        *   Avoid directly using user-provided input to construct file paths.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Default Error Pages in Production](./threats/information_disclosure_via_default_error_pages_in_production.md)

*   **Threat:** Information Disclosure via Default Error Pages in Production
    *   **Description:** When running in debug mode (the default for development), Bottle displays detailed error pages including stack traces and potentially sensitive information about the application's internal state and file paths. An attacker accessing the application in production with debug mode enabled could gain valuable insights. This is a direct consequence of Bottle's default error handling behavior in development.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive information, including file paths, code structure, and potentially database credentials or API keys if they appear in error messages. This information can be used to further exploit the application.
    *   **Affected Component:** Bottle's error handling mechanism and default error page rendering.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never run Bottle in debug mode in production.** Ensure the `debug=False` setting is used when deploying the application.
        *   Implement custom error handlers to provide user-friendly error messages without revealing internal details.
        *   Log errors securely for debugging purposes instead of displaying them to users.

## Threat: [Insecure Cookie Handling Leading to Session Hijacking](./threats/insecure_cookie_handling_leading_to_session_hijacking.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Cookie Handling Leading to Session Hijacking
    *   **Description:** If cookies set by the Bottle application lack important security attributes like `HttpOnly` or `Secure`, attackers can potentially steal or manipulate them. For example, a cookie without `HttpOnly` can be accessed by client-side JavaScript, making it vulnerable to XSS attacks. A cookie without `Secure` can be intercepted over non-HTTPS connections. This directly relates to how Bottle's `response.set_cookie` function operates.
    *   **Impact:**  Session hijacking, where an attacker gains control of a user's session, allowing them to impersonate the user and perform actions on their behalf.
    *   **Affected Component:** Bottle's response handling, specifically the `response.set_cookie` function.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Explicitly set secure cookie attributes when setting cookies using Bottle's response object:
            *   `httponly=True`: Prevents client-side JavaScript from accessing the cookie.
            *   `secure=True`: Ensures the cookie is only transmitted over HTTPS connections.
            *   `samesite='Strict'` or `'Lax'`: Helps prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

## Threat: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./threats/server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

*   **Threat:** Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)
    *   **Description:** If user-provided data is directly embedded into templates without proper escaping, an attacker can inject malicious code that will be executed on the server when the template is rendered. This is a risk if using Bottle's built-in templating or other *integrated* templating engines, as the integration is part of Bottle's functionality.
    *   **Impact:**  Remote code execution on the server, allowing the attacker to gain full control of the application and potentially the underlying system.
    *   **Affected Component:** Bottle's templating integration and the specific templating engine being used (e.g., Jinja2, Mako) *within the context of Bottle's integration*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always escape user-provided data before rendering it in templates.** Use the templating engine's built-in escaping mechanisms.
        *   Avoid constructing templates dynamically from user input.
        *   Use a templating engine that automatically escapes by default or enforce strict escaping policies.
        *   Consider using a logic-less templating language where possible.
