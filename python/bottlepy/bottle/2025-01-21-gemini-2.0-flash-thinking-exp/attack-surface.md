# Attack Surface Analysis for bottlepy/bottle

## Attack Surface: [Route Parameter Injection](./attack_surfaces/route_parameter_injection.md)

**Description:** Attackers can manipulate route parameters to cause unintended actions or access unauthorized resources.

**How Bottle Contributes:** Bottle's flexible routing system allows defining routes with dynamic parameters. If these parameters are directly used in file system operations, database queries, or other sensitive operations without proper sanitization, it creates an entry point for injection attacks.

**Example:** A route like `/view/<filename>` could be exploited with `/view/../../etc/passwd` to access sensitive files if `filename` is not validated.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to files, potential code execution if parameters are used in `eval()`-like functions (less common but possible), or manipulation of application logic.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all route parameters.
* Use parameterized queries or ORM features to prevent SQL injection if parameters are used in database interactions.
* Avoid directly using route parameters in file system operations. Use a predefined set of allowed values or map parameters to internal identifiers.

## Attack Surface: [Request Data Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/request_data_deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** If the application automatically deserializes request data (e.g., JSON, Pickle) without proper validation, attackers can send malicious payloads to execute arbitrary code or cause denial of service.

**How Bottle Contributes:** Bottle provides convenient access to request data through methods like `request.json` and `request.body`. If the application blindly trusts and deserializes this data without validation, it becomes vulnerable.

**Example:** An attacker sends a crafted JSON payload that, when deserialized, triggers a vulnerability in the deserialization library or exploits application logic.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), data corruption.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid automatic deserialization of untrusted data whenever possible.
* If deserialization is necessary, use secure deserialization libraries and implement strict validation of the deserialized data structure and content.
* Consider using safer data formats like JSON over Pickle for inter-process communication.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure File Upload Handling](./attack_surfaces/insecure_file_upload_handling.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities arise when handling file uploads without proper security measures, allowing attackers to upload malicious files or overwrite existing ones.

**How Bottle Contributes:** Bottle provides mechanisms to handle file uploads through `request.files`. If the application doesn't validate file types, names, and destinations, it's susceptible to attacks.

**Example:** An attacker uploads a PHP script disguised as an image and then accesses it to execute arbitrary code on the server. Or, they use path traversal in the filename to overwrite critical system files.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), data breaches, defacement, Denial of Service (DoS).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict validation of file types (using magic numbers or content inspection, not just file extensions).
* Generate unique and unpredictable filenames for uploaded files.
* Store uploaded files outside the web root or in a dedicated storage service.
* Sanitize filenames to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.
* Implement file size limits.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

**Description:** If user-controlled input is directly embedded into template code without proper escaping, attackers can inject malicious template directives to execute arbitrary code on the server.

**How Bottle Contributes:** Bottle integrates with various template engines. If developers directly pass user input to the template rendering engine without proper sanitization or using safe rendering methods, it can lead to SSTI.

**Example:** A vulnerable template might render `{{ user_input }}` directly. An attacker could provide `{{ 7*7 }}` or more malicious code to be executed on the server.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), information disclosure, privilege escalation.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid directly embedding user input into template code.
* Use template engines with auto-escaping enabled by default.
* If dynamic content is necessary, use the template engine's built-in escaping mechanisms or a dedicated sanitization library.
* Consider using logic-less template engines where possible.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Cookie Handling](./attack_surfaces/insecure_cookie_handling.md)

**Description:** Improperly configured or handled cookies can lead to session hijacking or other security vulnerabilities.

**How Bottle Contributes:** Bottle provides access to cookies through `request.cookies` and allows setting cookies in responses. If cookies are not configured with appropriate security flags, they become vulnerable.

**Example:** Session cookies without the `HttpOnly` flag can be accessed by client-side JavaScript, making them susceptible to XSS attacks. Cookies without the `Secure` flag can be intercepted over insecure HTTP connections.

**Impact:** Session hijacking, account takeover, information disclosure.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Set the `HttpOnly` flag for session cookies to prevent client-side JavaScript access.
* Set the `Secure` flag for cookies to ensure they are only transmitted over HTTPS.
* Use strong and unpredictable session IDs.
* Implement proper session management and timeout mechanisms.

## Attack Surface: [Use of Bottle's Development Server in Production](./attack_surfaces/use_of_bottle's_development_server_in_production.md)

**Description:** Bottle's built-in development server is not designed for production environments and lacks security features.

**How Bottle Contributes:** Bottle provides a simple development server for ease of use during development. However, using this server in production exposes the application to various risks.

**Example:** The development server might not handle concurrent requests securely, be vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks, or expose debugging information.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), information disclosure, potential for remote code execution depending on underlying vulnerabilities.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Never use Bottle's built-in development server in production.**
* Deploy Bottle applications using a production-ready WSGI server like Gunicorn or uWSGI.
