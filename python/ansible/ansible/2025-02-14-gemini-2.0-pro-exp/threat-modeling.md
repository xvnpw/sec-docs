# Threat Model Analysis for ansible/ansible

## Threat: [Credential Exposure in Plain Text](./threats/credential_exposure_in_plain_text.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the Ansible repository (e.g., Git) or the control node and finds credentials (SSH keys, passwords, API tokens) stored in plain text within playbooks, variable files, or inventory files. The attacker could use these credentials to directly connect to target systems.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to managed hosts, data exfiltration, lateral movement within the network, potential for complete system compromise.
*   **Ansible Component Affected:** Playbooks, Variable Files (`vars/`, `group_vars/`, `host_vars/`), Inventory Files.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use Ansible Vault to encrypt sensitive data.
    *   Integrate with external secrets management systems (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.) using appropriate Ansible modules (e.g., `hashivault_secret`, `aws_secretsmanager_secret`).
    *   Never commit secrets to version control.
    *   Use environment variables (with caution and proper security on the control node) as a temporary measure, but prefer dedicated secrets management.

## Threat: [Malicious Ansible Galaxy Role/Collection](./threats/malicious_ansible_galaxy_rolecollection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker publishes a malicious role or collection to Ansible Galaxy (or a compromised legitimate role is published).  A developer unknowingly downloads and uses this role/collection. The malicious code could install backdoors, steal data, or disrupt systems.
*   **Impact:** Introduction of malware, data breaches, system compromise, denial of service.
*   **Ansible Component Affected:** Ansible Galaxy, Roles, Collections.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly vet roles/collections before use: check author reputation, code reviews, download counts, and recent activity.
    *   Pin role/collection versions to avoid automatically pulling potentially compromised updates.
    *   Use a private Ansible Galaxy server or proxy to control which roles/collections are available.
    *   Sign and verify collections using GPG.
    *   Use Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to identify known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation via `become` Misuse](./threats/privilege_escalation_via__become__misuse.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a misconfigured `become` directive (e.g., `become: yes` used globally or without proper restrictions) in a playbook.  If a less privileged account is compromised, the attacker can use `become` to gain root or other elevated privileges.
*   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, unauthorized access to sensitive data and system configurations.
*   **Ansible Component Affected:** `become` directive (in playbooks), Privilege Escalation Modules (e.g., `ansible.builtin.sudo`, `ansible.builtin.su`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use `become` only when necessary and for specific tasks, not globally.
    *   Specify the `become_user` explicitly.
    *   Configure `become_method` (e.g., `sudo`, `su`) appropriately and securely.
    *   Restrict `sudo` access on target hosts to only allow the necessary commands.
    *   Use `allow_world_readable_tmpfiles = False` in `ansible.cfg` to prevent potential privilege escalation through world-readable temporary files.

## Threat: [Ansible Module Vulnerability](./threats/ansible_module_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability exists in an Ansible core module or a community-contributed module. An attacker crafts a specific input to exploit this vulnerability, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on target hosts, denial of service, potential for privilege escalation.
*   **Ansible Component Affected:** Ansible Modules (core and community).
*   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the specific vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Ansible and all installed modules up to date.
    *   Subscribe to Ansible security advisories.
    *   Use a vulnerability scanner to identify known vulnerabilities.
    *   Carefully review the code of custom modules.

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Logging (`no_log: false`)](./threats/sensitive_data_logging___no_log_false__.md)

*   **Description:** Tasks that handle sensitive data (e.g., setting passwords) do *not* have `no_log: true` set.  The sensitive data is then logged to the Ansible output, potentially exposing it to unauthorized users.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data in logs, potential for credential theft.
*   **Ansible Component Affected:** Playbooks, Tasks, `no_log` parameter.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use `no_log: true` for *all* tasks that handle sensitive data.
    *   Be extremely careful when disabling `no_log`, as it can expose secrets.
    *   Use Ansible Vault or external secrets management to avoid handling secrets directly in playbooks.
