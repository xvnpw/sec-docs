# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for ansible/ansible

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) within Ansible](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege__polp__within_ansible.md)

**Description:**
1.  **`become` Sparingly:** Use the `become` directive (and its associated options like `become_user`, `become_method`) *only* for tasks that *absolutely require* elevated privileges. Avoid `become: yes` at the play or playbook level. Apply it at the task level.
2.  **`become_user`:**  Specify a non-root user with `become_user` whenever possible.  Create dedicated system users on target hosts with the *minimum* necessary permissions for specific tasks (e.g., a user for package management, a user for database administration).
3.  **`become_method`:** Choose the most appropriate privilege escalation method (`sudo`, `su`, `pbrun`, etc.) based on the target system and security requirements.
4.  **Test `become` Configurations:** Thoroughly test all Ansible playbooks and roles to ensure they function correctly with the restricted `become` settings.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Severity: High):** Limits the potential for an attacker to gain full root access to target systems, even if they compromise the Ansible control node or gain access to Ansible credentials.
    *   **Unauthorized Access (Severity: High):** Restricts the actions an attacker can perform if they gain unauthorized access to the Ansible environment.
    *   **Accidental Damage (Severity: Medium):** Reduces the risk of accidental damage caused by misconfigured Ansible tasks running with excessive privileges.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduction: High. Significantly reduces the impact of a compromised Ansible user.
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduction: High. Limits the attacker's capabilities.
    *   **Accidental Damage:** Risk reduction: Medium. Reduces the blast radius of errors.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `become` is used in the `install_nginx.yml` playbook for the package installation task.
    *   `become_user` is set to `apt_installer` in `install_nginx.yml`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Review all playbooks and roles to ensure `become` is used *only* at the task level. Check `update_system.yml` and `deploy_application.yml`.
    *   Audit and document the use of `become_user` across all playbooks.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Ansible Vault for Secrets Management](./mitigation_strategies/ansible_vault_for_secrets_management.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Encrypt Sensitive Data:** Use `ansible-vault` to encrypt entire files (e.g., `vars/secrets.yml`) or individual variables within files that contain sensitive data (passwords, API keys, etc.).
2.  **Secure Vault Password:**  *Never* store the Ansible Vault password in the repository.  Use one of the following methods to provide the password securely:
    *   **Environment Variable:** Set an environment variable (e.g., `ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD`) on the Ansible control node *only* during playbook execution.
    *   **Password File:** Use the `--vault-password-file` option with `ansible-playbook` to specify a file containing the password.  Protect this file with strict permissions.
    *   **Prompt:** Use the `--ask-vault-pass` option to be prompted for the password interactively.
    *   **Secrets Management Integration:** (Preferred) Integrate with a dedicated secrets management solution (see next strategy).
3.  **Vault ID (Optional):** Use Vault IDs (`--vault-id`) to manage multiple Vault passwords, especially in environments with different teams or projects.
4.  **Regular Password Rotation:** Rotate the Ansible Vault password regularly (e.g., every 90 days) and update all encrypted files.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Secrets Exposure (Severity: High):** Prevents secrets from being stored in plaintext in playbooks, roles, inventory files, or version control.
    *   **Credential Theft (Severity: High):** Reduces the risk of credentials being stolen if the Ansible control node or repository is compromised.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Secrets Exposure:** Risk reduction: Very High. Eliminates the risk of plaintext secrets within the Ansible project.
    *   **Credential Theft:** Risk reduction: High. Significantly reduces the impact of a compromised Ansible environment.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   None.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Encrypt all files containing sensitive data with `ansible-vault`.
    *   Implement a secure method for providing the Vault password (environment variable or password file, *pending* integration with a secrets manager).
    *   Establish a Vault password rotation policy.

## Mitigation Strategy: [External Secrets Management Integration (HashiCorp Vault Lookup)](./mitigation_strategies/external_secrets_management_integration__hashicorp_vault_lookup_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Install Lookup Plugin:** Ensure the necessary Ansible lookup plugin for your chosen secrets management solution (e.g., `hashi_vault` for HashiCorp Vault) is installed.
2.  **Configure Authentication:** Configure Ansible to authenticate with the secrets management solution securely (e.g., using AppRole, token, or other appropriate methods). This configuration is typically done in `ansible.cfg` or using environment variables.
3.  **Retrieve Secrets Dynamically:** Use the lookup plugin within your playbooks to retrieve secrets dynamically at runtime.  For example:
    ```yaml
    - name: Get a secret from Vault
      debug:
        msg: "The secret is: {{ lookup('hashi_vault', 'secret/mysecret:value', vault_addr='https://vault.example.com', auth_method='token', token='your_token') }}"
    ```
    (Adjust the parameters based on your Vault configuration.)
4.  **Avoid Hardcoding:** *Never* hardcode secrets or Vault access credentials directly in playbooks.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Secrets Exposure (Severity: High):** Prevents secrets from being stored in plaintext anywhere in the Ansible code or inventory.
    *   **Credential Theft (Severity: High):** Reduces the risk of credentials being stolen if the Ansible control node or repository is compromised.
    *   **Unauthorized Access (Severity: High):** The secrets management solution's access control policies limit which Ansible components can access specific secrets.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Secrets Exposure:** Risk reduction: Very High. Eliminates the risk of plaintext secrets.
    *   **Credential Theft:** Risk reduction: High. Significantly reduces the impact of a compromised Ansible environment.
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduction: High. Provides granular control over secret access.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   None.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Complete implementation of HashiCorp Vault integration, including installing the `hashi_vault` lookup plugin, configuring authentication, and modifying playbooks to use the lookup plugin for all secret retrieval.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restricted Module Usage and Input Validation (Ansible-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/restricted_module_usage_and_input_validation__ansible-specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Favor Specific Modules:**  Prioritize using Ansible's built-in, specialized modules (e.g., `apt`, `yum`, `file`, `template`, `user`, `service`) over the more generic and potentially dangerous `shell`, `command`, `raw`, and `script` modules.
2.  **`quote` Filter:** If you *must* use `shell` or `command` with variables that might contain user-supplied or untrusted data, *always* use the Ansible `quote` filter to properly escape the input.  This prevents command injection vulnerabilities.  Example:
    ```yaml
    - name: Run a command with a variable
      command: "mycommand {{ my_variable | quote }}"
    ```
3.  **`validate` and `failed_when`:** Use Ansible's `validate` and `failed_when` conditions to check the output of commands and ensure they meet expected criteria. This can help detect errors or malicious activity.
4. **Avoid Command Construction with String Concatenation:** Do not build commands by concatenating strings with variables. This is a major source of injection vulnerabilities.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Command Injection (Severity: High):** The `quote` filter and careful module selection are crucial for preventing command injection.
    *   **Code Injection (Severity: High):** Reduces the risk of arbitrary code execution through Ansible modules.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Command Injection:** Risk reduction: High. Proper use of the `quote` filter is essential.
    *   **Code Injection:** Risk reduction: Medium. Limits the attacker's ability to execute arbitrary code.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   None.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Review all playbooks and roles to identify uses of `shell`, `command`, `raw`, and `script`. Replace them with safer alternatives where possible.
    *   For any remaining uses, *always* apply the `quote` filter to variables. Add `validate` and `failed_when` conditions where appropriate.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Ansible `check_mode` and `diff` for Safe Testing](./mitigation_strategies/ansible__check_mode__and__diff__for_safe_testing.md)

**Description:**
1.  **`check_mode` (Dry Run):** Use the `--check` flag with `ansible-playbook` to run the playbook in "check mode." This simulates the execution *without* making any actual changes to the target systems. It shows what *would* have changed.
2.  **`diff` Mode:** Use the `--diff` flag (often combined with `--check`) to display a detailed diff of the changes that *would* be made. This helps you understand the potential impact of the playbook.
3.  **Testing Environment:** Always test playbooks in a non-production environment (e.g., a staging or development environment) before deploying them to production.
4.  **Review Output:** Carefully review the output of `check_mode` and `diff` to identify any unexpected changes or potential issues.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Accidental Damage (Severity: Medium):** Prevents unintended changes to production systems due to errors in playbooks.
    *   **Insecure Configurations (Severity: Medium):** Helps identify potential misconfigurations before they are applied.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Accidental Damage:** Risk reduction: Medium. Provides a safety net for testing changes.
    *   **Insecure Configurations:** Risk reduction: Low to Medium. Helps catch errors before deployment.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   None

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Incorporate `--check` and `--diff` into the standard testing workflow for all playbooks.
    *   Document the process for reviewing `check_mode` and `diff` output.
