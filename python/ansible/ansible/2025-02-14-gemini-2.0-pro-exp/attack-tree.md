## Attack Tree Path: [[[Gain Unauthorized RCE on Target Hosts]] (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/__gain_unauthorized_rce_on_target_hosts____critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** The ultimate objective of the attacker.  Achieving RCE allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the target systems managed by Ansible.
*   **Impact:** Very High - Complete system compromise, data exfiltration, lateral movement, potential for further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Compromise Ansible Control Node]] (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/__compromise_ansible_control_node____critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** Gaining control of the machine where Ansible is installed and from which playbooks are executed. This provides a central point of control over the managed infrastructure.
*   **Impact:** Very High - Full control over the Ansible environment, ability to deploy malicious playbooks, access to sensitive data (e.g., credentials).

    *   **[[SSH Key Theft]] (Critical Node)**
        *   **Description:** Obtaining the SSH private keys used by Ansible to connect to managed hosts.
        *   **Impact:** Very High - Direct access to all managed hosts, bypassing many security controls.
        *   **High-Risk Path: [Phishing] ====> [[SSH Key Theft]]**
            *   **Description:** Tricking the Ansible administrator into revealing their SSH private key through a deceptive email or website.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** Very High
            *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

    *   **[Weak Control Node Security]**
        *   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in the control node's operating system or services.
        *   **Impact:** Very High - Full control of the control node, leading to control of the Ansible environment.
        *   **High-Risk Path: [OS Vuln] ====> [Weak Control Node Security]**
            *   **Description:** Exploiting an unpatched vulnerability in the control node's operating system.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** Very High
            *   **Effort:** Medium to High
            *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
        *   **High-Risk Path: [Misconfigured Firewall] ====> [Weak Control Node Security]**
            *   **Description:** Exploiting open ports or weak firewall rules to gain access to the control node.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
            *   **Impact:** High
            *   **Effort:** Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [[Exploit Vulnerabilities in Ansible Modules/Code]](./attack_tree_paths/_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_ansible_modulescode_.md)

*   **Description:** Leveraging flaws in Ansible modules to execute malicious code on managed hosts.
*   **Impact:** High to Very High - Can lead to RCE on managed hosts.
*   **High-Risk Path: [Module Vuln (Known)] ====> [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Ansible Modules/Code]**
    *   **Description:** Exploiting a publicly known vulnerability in an Ansible module (e.g., a CVE).
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
* **High-Risk Path: [Lack of Input Validation] ====> [Custom Module Injection] ====> [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Ansible Modules/Code]**
    *   **Description:**  A custom-developed Ansible module fails to properly validate user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code that is then executed by Ansible.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [[Inject Malicious Playbook/Vars]](./attack_tree_paths/_inject_malicious_playbookvars_.md)

*   **Description:** Modifying Ansible playbooks or variable files to include malicious commands, which are then executed by Ansible on managed hosts.
*   **Impact:** Very High - Can lead to RCE on managed hosts, data breaches, and system compromise.
* **High-Risk Path: [Compromised Dependency] ====> [Supply Chain Attack on Playbook Source] ====> [Inject Malicious Playbook/Vars]**
    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises a third-party library or role that is used by an Ansible playbook.  The compromised dependency contains malicious code that is executed when the playbook runs.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** High
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced to Expert
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
* **High-Risk Path: [Malicious Code in Trusted Repo] ====> [Supply Chain Attack on Playbook Source] ====> [Inject Malicious Playbook/Vars]**
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to a trusted repository (e.g., a Git repository) where Ansible playbooks or roles are stored and directly injects malicious code.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** High
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
