# Threat Model Analysis for ansible/ansible

## Threat: [Malicious Playbook Injection](./threats/malicious_playbook_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized write access to the Ansible codebase (playbooks, roles) and injects malicious tasks. This could involve adding commands to execute arbitrary code on managed nodes, modifying configurations to create backdoors, or deleting critical data. The attacker might exploit weak access controls on the repository or the Ansible controller itself.

**Impact:** Critical. Complete compromise of managed infrastructure is possible, leading to data breaches, service disruption, or ransomware attacks.

**Affected Ansible Component:** Playbooks, Roles, potentially the Ansible Controller's file system.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement strict access control and authentication for the Ansible repository (e.g., using Git with protected branches and code review processes).
*   Enforce code review for all playbook and role changes before deployment.
*   Utilize digital signatures or checksums to verify the integrity of playbooks.
*   Regularly audit changes to Ansible code and access logs.
*   Harden the Ansible controller to prevent unauthorized access to the file system.

## Threat: [Ansible Vault Password Compromise](./threats/ansible_vault_password_compromise.md)

**Description:** An attacker obtains the password used to encrypt Ansible Vault files. This could happen through social engineering, phishing, brute-force attacks (if the password is weak), or by compromising the system where the password is stored or used. Once the password is known, the attacker can decrypt sensitive information like credentials and API keys stored in the vault.

**Impact:** High. Exposure of sensitive credentials and secrets, potentially leading to unauthorized access to managed systems and external services.

**Affected Ansible Component:** Ansible Vault encryption/decryption process.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Use strong and unique passwords for Ansible Vault.
*   Securely store and manage the Ansible Vault password (e.g., using a password manager with strong encryption and access controls, or a dedicated secrets management solution).
*   Consider using alternative secret management solutions that integrate with Ansible and offer more robust security features (e.g., HashiCorp Vault).
*   Implement multi-factor authentication for accessing systems where the Vault password is stored or used.

## Threat: [Insecure Storage of Ansible Credentials](./threats/insecure_storage_of_ansible_credentials.md)

**Description:** Ansible credentials (e.g., SSH keys, passwords) used to connect to managed nodes are stored insecurely on the Ansible controller. This could involve storing them in plain text files, with overly permissive file permissions, or in easily accessible locations. An attacker gaining access to the Ansible controller could then steal these credentials.

**Impact:** High. Allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to managed nodes, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.

**Affected Ansible Component:** Ansible Controller's file system, potentially inventory files if credentials are embedded there.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Avoid storing credentials directly in playbooks or inventory files.
*   Use Ansible Vault to encrypt sensitive credentials.
*   Utilize SSH key-based authentication instead of passwords whenever possible.
*   Ensure proper file permissions on the Ansible controller to restrict access to credential files (e.g., only the Ansible user should have read access).
*   Consider using Ansible's connection plugins that support secure credential management (e.g., using SSH agent forwarding).

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle Attack on Ansible Communication](./threats/man-in-the-middle_attack_on_ansible_communication.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts the communication between the Ansible controller and managed nodes. This could happen if the network connection is not properly secured. The attacker might be able to steal credentials transmitted during authentication or inject malicious commands into the Ansible execution stream.

**Impact:** High. Potential for credential theft, unauthorized command execution on managed nodes, and system compromise.

**Affected Ansible Component:** Ansible's connection plugins (e.g., `paramiko_ssh`, `ssh`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Ensure secure communication channels are used (e.g., SSH with strong encryption algorithms).
*   Verify the authenticity of managed nodes using SSH host key checking.
*   Avoid running Ansible tasks over untrusted networks.
*   Consider using VPNs or other secure network tunnels for Ansible communication.

## Threat: [Compromise of the Ansible Controller](./threats/compromise_of_the_ansible_controller.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Ansible controller machine. This could be through exploiting vulnerabilities in the operating system or applications running on the controller, using stolen credentials, or through social engineering. Once compromised, the attacker has control over the Ansible infrastructure and can execute arbitrary commands on all managed nodes.

**Impact:** Critical. Complete compromise of the entire managed infrastructure.

**Affected Ansible Component:** The entire Ansible Controller system and its software.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Harden the Ansible controller operating system and applications (e.g., disable unnecessary services, apply security patches).
*   Implement strong access controls and authentication for the Ansible controller (e.g., strong passwords, multi-factor authentication).
*   Keep the Ansible controller software up-to-date with security patches.
*   Monitor the Ansible controller for suspicious activity using intrusion detection systems and log analysis.
*   Restrict network access to the Ansible controller to only authorized users and systems.

## Threat: [Insecure Playbook Design Leading to Privilege Escalation](./threats/insecure_playbook_design_leading_to_privilege_escalation.md)

**Description:** Playbooks are written in a way that unintentionally grants elevated privileges to unauthorized users or processes on managed nodes. This could involve using the `become` directive inappropriately or executing commands with overly permissive `sudo` rules. An attacker exploiting this could gain root access on the target systems.

**Impact:** High. Potential for complete compromise of individual managed nodes.

**Affected Ansible Component:** Playbooks, specifically the `become` directive and task execution logic.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Follow the principle of least privilege when designing playbooks. Only grant the necessary permissions for each task.
*   Carefully review the use of the `become` directive and ensure it's only used when absolutely necessary.
*   Implement and enforce strict `sudo` rules on managed nodes.
*   Use Ansible's built-in features for privilege management responsibly.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Ansible Modules](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_ansible_modules.md)

**Description:** Security vulnerabilities exist within the Ansible modules themselves. An attacker could craft specific input or exploit module logic to execute arbitrary code on the Ansible controller or managed nodes, bypass security controls, or cause denial of service.

**Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability. Could range from medium impact (e.g., information disclosure) to critical impact (e.g., remote code execution).

**Affected Ansible Component:** Specific Ansible modules.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Keep Ansible and its modules updated to the latest versions.
*   Be aware of known vulnerabilities in Ansible modules and avoid using affected modules if possible.
*   Contribute to the Ansible project by reporting and fixing vulnerabilities.
*   Review the code of custom Ansible modules for potential security flaws.
