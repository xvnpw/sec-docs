## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Malicious Playbook Execution](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_malicious_playbook_execution.md)

**Description:** This path represents the scenario where an attacker injects malicious code into Ansible playbooks and successfully executes them, leading to the compromise of managed nodes and potentially the application.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Inject Malicious Playbook:**
        *   **Compromise Source Code Repository (containing playbooks) [CRITICAL NODE]:** Attackers gain access to the repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) and directly modify playbooks. This has a high impact as it can affect all deployments using those playbooks.
        *   **Compromise Ansible Control Node (direct playbook modification) [CRITICAL NODE]:** Attackers compromise the machine running Ansible and directly alter the playbook files. This grants immediate control over Ansible's actions.
        *   **Insecure Storage of Playbooks (accessible to attacker):** Playbooks are stored in a location accessible to the attacker (e.g., shared network drive with weak permissions).
    *   **Trigger Playbook Execution:**
        *   **Social Engineering (trick admin into running malicious playbook):** Attackers trick an administrator into manually executing a malicious playbook.
        *   **Automated Execution Trigger (vulnerable CI/CD pipeline):** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the CI/CD pipeline to inject and trigger the execution of a malicious playbook.
        *   **Compromise Ansible Control Node (force execution) [CRITICAL NODE]:** Having compromised the control node, attackers can directly initiate the execution of malicious playbooks.
    *   **Achieve Malicious Outcome:** Successful execution of the malicious playbook leads to actions like:
        *   Executing arbitrary commands on managed nodes.
        *   Deploying malicious software.
        *   Modifying application configurations.
        *   Exfiltrating sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Ansible Control Node](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_ansible_control_node.md)

**Description:** This path focuses on compromising the Ansible control node itself, which provides a central point of control over the managed infrastructure.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Exploiting operating system vulnerabilities on the control node.
    *   Exploiting application vulnerabilities on the control node (e.g., if a web interface is present for Ansible management).
    *   Compromising a user account on the control node through methods like phishing or credential stuffing.
    *   Exploiting insecure configurations of the control node (e.g., weak passwords, open ports).
    *   **Achieve Control Node Access:** Successful exploitation grants the attacker access to the control node.
    *   **Leverage Control Node Access for Application Compromise:** With control node access, attackers can:
        *   Modify and execute playbooks.
        *   Modify the inventory and execute playbooks against unintended targets.
        *   Steal Ansible credentials and directly access managed nodes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Credential Management](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_credential_management.md)

**Description:** This path highlights the risks associated with insecurely managed Ansible credentials, which can grant attackers unauthorized access to managed nodes.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Steal Ansible Credentials:**
        *   Insecure Storage of Credentials (plain text, weak encryption): Credentials are stored insecurely, making them easily accessible.
        *   **Compromise Ansible Control Node (accessing stored credentials) [CRITICAL NODE]:** Attackers compromise the control node and retrieve stored credentials.
    *   **Abuse Stolen Credentials:**
        *   **Achieve Unauthorized Access:** Using the stolen credentials, attackers can:
            *   Directly access managed nodes (if the credentials allow SSH or other direct access).
            *   Execute malicious playbooks, impersonating legitimate users.
