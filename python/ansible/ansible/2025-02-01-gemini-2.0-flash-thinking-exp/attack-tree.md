**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Code Injection via Malicious Playbooks/Roles:** Injecting malicious tasks or modules into playbooks or roles that will be executed on managed nodes. This can lead to arbitrary command execution, data exfiltration, or system disruption.
*   **Logic Manipulation:** Altering the intended logic of playbooks to perform unauthorized actions, such as modifying configurations in a way that creates backdoors or weakens security.
*   **Resource Hijacking:** Using compromised playbooks to deploy resource-intensive tasks (e.g., cryptomining) on managed nodes.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2. Compromise Private Git Repository [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2__compromise_private_git_repository__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Credential Theft:** Stealing credentials (e.g., SSH keys, API tokens) used to access the Git repository. This could be through phishing, malware, or exploiting vulnerabilities in systems where credentials are stored.
*   **Insider Threat (Compromised Account):**  Compromising the account of a user with write access to the repository.
*   **Vulnerability Exploitation in Git Server:** Exploiting known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the Git server software (e.g., GitLab, GitHub Enterprise, Bitbucket Server).
*   **Social Engineering:** Tricking developers or administrators into granting unauthorized access or pushing malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2. Malicious Playbook/Role Development by Insider [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2__malicious_playbookrole_development_by_insider__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Intentional Backdoors:** An insider with playbook development access intentionally introduces malicious code or configurations designed to create backdoors, exfiltrate data, or disrupt operations at a later time.
*   **Sabotage:** An insider intentionally modifies playbooks to cause system instability, data corruption, or service outages.
*   **Data Theft:** An insider develops playbooks that are designed to collect and exfiltrate sensitive data from managed systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Parameter Injection:** Injecting malicious code or commands through playbook variables that are derived from external, untrusted sources (e.g., user input, external APIs).
*   **Dynamic Playbook Generation Exploitation:** If playbooks are dynamically generated based on untrusted input, attackers can manipulate the input to inject malicious playbook code.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.1. Unvalidated Input in Playbooks (e.g., `vars_prompt`, `include_vars`) [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_1__unvalidated_input_in_playbooks__e_g____vars_prompt____include_vars____critical_node__high-ris_c87f0063.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Command Injection:** Injecting shell commands into variables used in `command`, `shell`, or `script` modules when these variables are populated from untrusted input.
*   **File Path Manipulation:** Injecting malicious file paths into variables used in `include_vars`, `include`, `import`, or `copy` modules to read or write arbitrary files on the control node or managed nodes.
*   **Jinja2 Template Injection (Indirect):**  While template injection is listed separately, unvalidated input can also indirectly lead to template injection if the input is later used within a Jinja2 template without proper sanitization.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Credential Compromise & Mismanagement [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/3__credential_compromise_&_mismanagement__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Direct Access to Files:** Gaining access to playbook or inventory files through file system access, version control access, or backup access and reading plaintext credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Version Control History Mining:** Searching version control history for accidentally committed Vault passwords.
*   **Log File Analysis:** Examining log files or command history for accidentally logged or recorded Vault passwords.
*   **Configuration File Exposure:** Finding Vault passwords stored in unencrypted configuration files that are accessible to attackers.
*   **Publicly Accessible Repositories:** If version control repositories containing Vault passwords are made public or accidentally exposed.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.3.1. Password in Version Control [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/3_3_1__password_in_version_control__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Control Node Compromise:** If an attacker compromises the Ansible control node, they can access command history files (e.g., `.bash_history`) or log files that might contain accidentally logged Vault passwords.
*   **Log Aggregation System Compromise:** If logs are aggregated to a central logging system, compromising that system could expose accidentally logged passwords.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.3.3. Password in Unencrypted Configuration Files [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/3_3_3__password_in_unencrypted_configuration_files__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)
