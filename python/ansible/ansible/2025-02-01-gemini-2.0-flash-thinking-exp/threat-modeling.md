# Threat Model Analysis for ansible/ansible

## Threat: [Compromised Ansible Controller](./threats/compromised_ansible_controller.md)

**Description:** An attacker compromises the Ansible controller machine, gaining control through OS vulnerabilities, weak credentials, or exposed services. This allows them to use the controller's Ansible installation to execute arbitrary playbooks across the managed infrastructure.

**Impact:**  Complete infrastructure takeover. Attackers can deploy malware, steal sensitive data from all managed nodes, disrupt critical services, and establish persistent access to the entire environment.

**Ansible Component Affected:** Ansible Controller Machine (OS, Ansible installation, configuration)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Harden the Ansible controller operating system (OS) with security patches, firewall rules, and disabling unnecessary services.
*   Implement strong multi-factor authentication and authorization for all controller access.
*   Keep Ansible and all its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
*   Restrict network access to the controller to only essential services and authorized networks.
*   Deploy intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to monitor and protect the controller.
*   Utilize a dedicated, hardened server specifically for the Ansible controller role.

## Threat: [Malicious Playbook Execution](./threats/malicious_playbook_execution.md)

**Description:** An attacker with unauthorized access to the playbook repository or the Ansible controller injects or modifies playbooks to contain malicious tasks. When these compromised playbooks are executed, they perform harmful actions on managed nodes.

**Impact:**  Severe data breaches, widespread denial of service, system instability across the infrastructure, deployment of ransomware or other malware, and unauthorized privileged access to managed nodes.

**Ansible Component Affected:** Playbooks, Ansible Execution Engine

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enforce strict access control to playbook repositories using version control systems with branch protection and access restrictions.
*   Implement mandatory, thorough code review processes for every playbook change before deployment.
*   Utilize static analysis and linting tools to automatically detect potential vulnerabilities and malicious patterns in playbooks.
*   Establish dedicated playbook testing and staging environments to validate playbook behavior before production deployment.
*   Apply the principle of least privilege for Ansible users and service accounts, limiting their permissions to only what is strictly necessary.
*   Explore and implement digital signing of playbooks to ensure integrity and authenticity (if supported by tooling).

## Threat: [Credential Exposure on Ansible Controller](./threats/credential_exposure_on_ansible_controller.md)

**Description:** Attackers successfully gain access to sensitive credentials (SSH keys, passwords, API tokens) stored on the Ansible controller. This could occur through filesystem access, memory scraping, or exploiting vulnerabilities in credential management practices. With these credentials, attackers can impersonate Ansible and directly access managed nodes.

**Impact:**  Widespread unauthorized access to managed nodes and services. Attackers can perform actions with Ansible's privileges, leading to system-wide compromise, large-scale data breaches, and significant service disruption.

**Ansible Component Affected:** Ansible Controller (Credential Storage, Ansible Vault)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Absolutely avoid storing credentials directly within playbooks or inventory files.**
*   Mandatory use of Ansible Vault to encrypt all sensitive data within playbooks and inventory.
*   Prioritize SSH key-based authentication over passwords and implement robust key management practices.
*   Integrate Ansible with dedicated, enterprise-grade secrets management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, CyberArk) for secure credential storage and retrieval.
*   Strictly restrict access to the Ansible controller's filesystem and configuration files using operating system level permissions.
*   Implement regular and automated rotation of all Ansible-related credentials.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Managed Nodes via Ansible Credentials](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_managed_nodes_via_ansible_credentials.md)

**Description:** If Ansible credentials, particularly SSH private keys, are compromised (e.g., leaked from the controller, stolen from insecure storage), attackers can directly utilize these credentials to bypass the Ansible controller and gain direct access to managed nodes.

**Impact:**  Direct, unauthorized privileged access to managed nodes. Attackers can perform any action on compromised nodes, potentially leading to data exfiltration, system destruction, and complete control over individual servers.

**Ansible Component Affected:** Managed Nodes (SSH Access, Ansible Credentials)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust and secure management and rotation procedures for all Ansible credentials.
*   Enforce strong access controls on managed nodes, independent of Ansible access mechanisms, using firewalls and access lists.
*   Implement comprehensive monitoring of access attempts to managed nodes and establish alerting for any suspicious or unauthorized activity.
*   Conduct regular audits of authorized SSH keys present on managed nodes, removing any unnecessary or outdated keys.
*   Consider adopting short-lived credentials or dynamic credential provisioning techniques to minimize the window of opportunity for compromised credentials.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Ansible Modules or Plugins](./threats/vulnerable_ansible_modules_or_plugins.md)

**Description:** Ansible modules or plugins, especially those sourced from third-party or community repositories, may contain undisclosed security vulnerabilities. Exploiting these vulnerabilities could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on managed nodes during playbook execution, potentially gaining elevated privileges.

**Impact:**  Compromise of managed nodes, potential for privilege escalation to root or administrator level, and the possibility of lateral movement to other systems within the infrastructure. The severity depends on the specific vulnerability and the module's privileges.

**Ansible Component Affected:** Ansible Modules, Ansible Plugins

**Risk Severity:** High (potential for critical impact depending on vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Maintain Ansible and all installed modules/plugins updated with the latest security patches released by vendors and the Ansible community.
*   Prioritize the use of modules and plugins from trusted and reputable sources, carefully evaluating community-developed modules before adoption.
*   Conduct security reviews and vulnerability assessments of modules and plugins before incorporating them into production playbooks, especially for community-contributed components.
*   Favor the use of Ansible's built-in modules whenever possible, as they generally undergo more rigorous security vetting and are maintained by the core Ansible team.
*   Explore and implement vulnerability scanning tools specifically designed for Ansible modules (if such tools become available).

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation via Ansible Modules](./threats/privilege_escalation_via_ansible_modules.md)

**Description:** Misconfigured or inherently vulnerable Ansible modules could be exploited to achieve privilege escalation on managed nodes. For instance, a module might inadvertently grant excessive permissions or permit the execution of commands with root privileges when not strictly required.

**Impact:**  Attackers successfully gain root or administrator-level privileges on managed nodes, granting them complete control over the compromised systems. This allows for arbitrary actions, including data manipulation, system takeover, and further attacks within the infrastructure.

**Ansible Component Affected:** Ansible Modules, Playbook Design

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Strictly adhere to the principle of least privilege when designing Ansible playbooks and roles, granting only the necessary permissions for each task.
*   Thoroughly review the permissions and actions performed by each Ansible module used in playbooks, ensuring they align with the intended purpose and security requirements.
*   Avoid utilizing modules that necessitate or grant excessive privileges unless absolutely essential and justified by a strong security rationale.
*   Implement privilege separation and role-based access control within Ansible playbooks to limit the scope of permissions granted to specific tasks and users.
*   Exercise caution and judiciously use `become` and `become_user` directives, ensuring they are employed only when necessary and with a clear understanding of the security implications.

## Threat: [Malicious Playbook Content (Intentional or Accidental)](./threats/malicious_playbook_content__intentional_or_accidental_.md)

**Description:** Playbooks themselves can contain malicious code or configurations, either intentionally inserted by a malicious actor or accidentally introduced due to human error or lack of security awareness. Execution of these malicious playbooks can directly inflict harm on managed nodes.

**Impact:**  Wide-ranging impacts, from subtle system misconfigurations and data corruption to catastrophic system compromise, widespread data breaches, and complete denial of service across the managed infrastructure. The specific impact depends on the nature and intent of the malicious playbook content.

**Ansible Component Affected:** Playbooks

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Mandate rigorous and comprehensive code review processes for all playbook changes, involving multiple reviewers with security expertise.
*   Implement automated static analysis and linting tools to proactively identify potential security issues, coding errors, and malicious patterns within playbooks.
*   Conduct thorough testing of playbooks in isolated, non-production environments before deploying them to production systems.
*   Establish secure access control mechanisms for playbook repositories, limiting write access to only authorized and trusted personnel.
*   Provide comprehensive security training and education to Ansible users and developers, emphasizing secure coding practices for playbooks and the potential security risks associated with misconfigurations or malicious content.
