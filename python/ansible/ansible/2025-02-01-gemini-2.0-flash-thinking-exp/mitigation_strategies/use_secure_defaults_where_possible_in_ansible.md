#### 4.5. Threats Mitigated, Impact, and Current/Missing Implementation

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Insecure Default Configurations (Medium Severity):**  This strategy directly mitigates the risk of introducing insecure configurations by unintentionally or unnecessarily overriding secure defaults. By prioritizing defaults, the application benefits from pre-vetted and generally secure settings. The severity is correctly identified as medium because insecure configurations can lead to vulnerabilities exploitable by attackers, potentially compromising confidentiality, integrity, or availability.
    *   **Configuration Errors (Low Severity):**  Relying on well-tested defaults reduces the likelihood of manual configuration errors. Defaults are typically thoroughly tested and validated, minimizing the risk of misconfigurations that could lead to operational issues or security vulnerabilities. The severity is low because configuration errors, while disruptive, are less likely to directly lead to severe security breaches compared to intentionally insecure configurations.
    *   **Increased Attack Surface (Medium Severity):**  Deviating from secure defaults without proper justification can inadvertently increase the attack surface by enabling unnecessary features or services, or by weakening security controls. This strategy helps minimize the attack surface by encouraging the use of secure defaults and requiring justification for deviations. The severity is medium because an increased attack surface provides more potential entry points for attackers, increasing the overall risk of compromise.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Insecure Default Configurations (Medium Impact):**  Leveraging secure defaults directly improves the overall security posture by reducing the likelihood of exploitable vulnerabilities arising from misconfigurations. The impact is medium because addressing insecure defaults significantly reduces a common class of security risks.
    *   **Configuration Errors (Low Impact):**  Reducing configuration errors improves system stability and reliability, indirectly contributing to security by minimizing potential disruptions and unexpected behaviors. The impact is low because while stability is important, it's a secondary security benefit compared to directly preventing vulnerabilities.
    *   **Increased Attack Surface (Medium Impact):**  Minimizing the attack surface reduces the number of potential entry points for attackers, making the application inherently more secure. The impact is medium because a smaller attack surface directly translates to a reduced risk of successful attacks.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. This indicates a good starting point. The team is already generally using secure defaults, which is a positive foundation. However, the lack of formal processes for avoiding overrides and regular reviews represents significant gaps.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Formalize a practice of prioritizing and leveraging Ansible secure defaults:** This requires creating explicit guidelines, training, and potentially incorporating checks into the development workflow to actively encourage the use of defaults.
    *   **Develop guidelines for when and how to deviate from defaults securely:**  This involves defining clear criteria for justified overrides, documenting best practices for secure customization, and establishing a review process for deviations.
    *   **Implement regular reviews of Ansible configurations to ensure secure defaults are maintained:** This necessitates establishing a schedule, defining the scope of reviews, and potentially utilizing automation to facilitate the review process.
