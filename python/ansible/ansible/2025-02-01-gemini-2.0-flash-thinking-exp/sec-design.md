# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Automate IT infrastructure management tasks across diverse environments (cloud, on-premises, hybrid).
  - Simplify complex deployments and configurations.
  - Improve operational efficiency and reduce manual errors.
  - Enable consistent and repeatable infrastructure provisioning and management.
  - Accelerate application deployment and updates.
  - Foster collaboration between development and operations teams (DevOps).
- Business Risks:
  - Misconfiguration of infrastructure leading to service disruptions or security vulnerabilities.
  - Unauthorized access to managed systems through compromised Ansible control nodes or credentials.
  - Supply chain attacks targeting Ansible dependencies or distributions.
  - Data breaches due to insecure handling of sensitive information within playbooks or managed systems.
  - Operational disruptions due to vulnerabilities in Ansible core or modules.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Code reviews for core Ansible and included modules (described in Ansible development guidelines).
  - security control: Vulnerability scanning of Ansible codebase and dependencies (likely performed by community and Red Hat).
  - security control: Release management process with signed releases (available on Ansible releases page).
  - security control: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) within Ansible Automation Platform (commercial offering, but concepts applicable to open-source).
  - security control: Secure communication channels (SSH, WinRM with HTTPS) for managing remote systems.
  - security control: Vault for encrypting sensitive data within playbooks (documented in Ansible Vault documentation).
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security fixes, potential delays in patching vulnerabilities.
  - accepted risk: Complexity of Ansible ecosystem and potential for misconfigurations by users.
  - accepted risk: Open-source nature implies public availability of code, potentially aiding attackers in finding vulnerabilities.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated Supply Chain Security checks for dependencies and build artifacts.
  - security control: Enhance input validation and sanitization in Ansible modules to prevent injection attacks.
  - security control: Promote adoption of security best practices through documentation and tooling (e.g., Ansible-lint with security rules).
  - security control: Implement regular security audits and penetration testing of Ansible deployments.
  - security control: Strengthen secret management practices beyond Ansible Vault, consider integration with dedicated secret management solutions.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: Secure authentication mechanisms for accessing Ansible control nodes (e.g., SSH key-based authentication, multi-factor authentication).
    - Requirement: Authentication for accessing managed nodes should be configurable and support various methods (e.g., SSH keys, passwords, Kerberos).
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Implement granular role-based access control (RBAC) within Ansible to limit user permissions.
    - Requirement: Authorization mechanisms to control which users or systems can manage specific target nodes or resources.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Robust input validation for all Ansible modules to prevent injection vulnerabilities (e.g., command injection, SQL injection).
    - Requirement: Validation of playbook syntax and structure to prevent unexpected behavior or errors.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Use strong cryptography for encrypting sensitive data at rest (Ansible Vault) and in transit (SSH, WinRM with HTTPS).
    - Requirement: Secure key management practices for SSH keys, Vault passwords, and other cryptographic keys.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - IT Infrastructure Automation: Ansible is used to automate critical infrastructure management tasks, including provisioning, configuration, and patching. Disruptions to Ansible or compromised Ansible deployments can severely impact business operations.
  - Application Deployment Automation: Ansible automates application deployments, impacting the speed and reliability of application releases and updates. Security vulnerabilities in Ansible can lead to compromised application deployments.
  - Security Automation: Ansible is increasingly used for security automation tasks like security configuration management, incident response, and compliance checks. Failure of Ansible in these areas can weaken the organization's security posture.
- Data Sensitivity:
  - Credentials (Passwords, API Keys, SSH Keys): Ansible manages sensitive credentials for accessing and managing target systems. Compromise of these credentials can lead to unauthorized access and data breaches. High sensitivity.
  - Configuration Data: Ansible playbooks and inventory contain configuration data for systems and applications. This data can include sensitive information about system architecture, security settings, and application logic. Medium to High sensitivity depending on the specific data.
  - Logs and Audit Trails: Ansible logs and audit trails contain information about automation activities, including commands executed and systems accessed. This data is important for security monitoring and incident investigation. Medium sensitivity.
