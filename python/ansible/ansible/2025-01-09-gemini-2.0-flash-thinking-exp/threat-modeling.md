# Threat Model Analysis for ansible/ansible

## Threat: [Malicious Playbook Execution](./threats/malicious_playbook_execution.md)

**Threat:** Malicious Playbook Execution

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the Ansible control node or the playbook repository and executes a crafted playbook. This playbook could contain tasks to install malware, exfiltrate data, modify configurations, or disrupt services on managed nodes. The attacker could leverage their access to execute this playbook directly or manipulate automated execution workflows.
*   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of managed nodes, data breaches, service outages, reputational damage, financial loss.
*   **Affected Component:** Ansible Playbooks, Ansible Control Node, Ansible Executor.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong access controls and multi-factor authentication for the Ansible control node.
    *   Store playbooks in a secure version control system with access controls and code review processes.
    *   Utilize Ansible Vault to encrypt sensitive data within playbooks.
    *   Implement change management processes for playbook modifications.
    *   Regularly audit playbook content for malicious or insecure tasks.
    *   Use a dedicated, hardened environment for the Ansible control node.
    *   Employ security scanning tools to analyze playbooks for potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Credential Theft from Control Node](./threats/credential_theft_from_control_node.md)

**Threat:** Credential Theft from Control Node

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises the Ansible control node and gains access to stored credentials used to connect to managed nodes. This could involve accessing Ansible Vault keys, SSH private keys, or other stored credentials. The attacker can then use these credentials to directly access and control managed nodes.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to managed nodes, data breaches, system compromise, lateral movement within the infrastructure.
*   **Affected Component:** Ansible Control Node, Ansible Vault, Connection Plugins (e.g., `paramiko`, `winrm`).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce strong access controls and multi-factor authentication for the Ansible control node.
    *   Securely store Ansible Vault keys, potentially using hardware security modules (HSMs).
    *   Implement robust key management practices, including regular rotation of SSH keys and other credentials.
    *   Avoid storing credentials directly in playbooks; use Ansible Vault or external secret management solutions.
    *   Encrypt the Ansible control node's filesystem.
    *   Monitor access logs on the control node for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Manipulation of Ansible Inventory](./threats/manipulation_of_ansible_inventory.md)

**Threat:** Manipulation of Ansible Inventory

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Ansible inventory files. They could modify the inventory to target legitimate nodes with malicious playbooks, add attacker-controlled nodes to be managed by Ansible, or remove legitimate nodes to cause disruptions.
*   **Impact:**  Execution of malicious tasks on legitimate nodes, inclusion of rogue systems in the managed infrastructure, denial of service by preventing automation on critical systems.
*   **Affected Component:** Ansible Inventory, Ansible Control Node.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure the Ansible inventory files with appropriate file system permissions.
    *   Store the inventory in a version control system with access controls and audit logging.
    *   Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity of the inventory before playbook execution.
    *   Use dynamic inventory sources where appropriate, as they can be more difficult to tamper with directly.
    *   Monitor changes to the inventory files for unauthorized modifications.

## Threat: [Insecure Module Usage](./threats/insecure_module_usage.md)

**Threat:** Insecure Module Usage

*   **Description:** Developers use Ansible modules in an insecure manner within playbooks. This could involve passing sensitive information as plain text arguments, using modules with known vulnerabilities, or misconfiguring module parameters leading to unintended security flaws.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, introduction of vulnerabilities on managed nodes, potential for privilege escalation.
*   **Affected Component:** Ansible Modules, Ansible Playbooks.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Provide security training to developers on secure Ansible module usage.
    *   Enforce code reviews to identify insecure module usage patterns.
    *   Utilize Ansible Vault for passing sensitive data to modules.
    *   Keep Ansible and its modules updated to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Use linters and static analysis tools to identify potential security issues in playbooks.

## Threat: [Malicious Ansible Roles or Collections](./threats/malicious_ansible_roles_or_collections.md)

**Threat:** Malicious Ansible Roles or Collections

*   **Description:** Developers unknowingly use malicious Ansible roles or collections downloaded from Ansible Galaxy or other sources. These roles or collections could contain malicious tasks designed to compromise managed nodes.
*   **Impact:** Introduction of malware, backdoors, or vulnerabilities into the managed infrastructure.
*   **Affected Component:** Ansible Roles, Ansible Collections, Ansible Galaxy.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully vet and review Ansible roles and collections before using them.
    *   Prefer using roles and collections from trusted and reputable sources.
    *   Utilize tools to scan roles and collections for potential security issues.
    *   Implement a process for managing and updating dependencies of roles and collections.
    *   Consider hosting internal repositories for approved and verified roles and collections.

## Threat: [Weak or Default Credentials in Connection Plugins](./threats/weak_or_default_credentials_in_connection_plugins.md)

**Threat:** Weak or Default Credentials in Connection Plugins

*   **Description:**  Ansible is configured to connect to managed nodes using weak or default credentials (e.g., default passwords for WinRM). An attacker who knows or can guess these credentials can bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to managed nodes, system compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** Connection Plugins (e.g., `paramiko`, `winrm`), Ansible Configuration.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce strong, unique passwords for all accounts used by Ansible to connect to managed nodes.
    *   Utilize SSH key-based authentication whenever possible.
    *   Avoid using default credentials; change them immediately upon deployment.
    *   Regularly audit and rotate credentials used by Ansible.

## Threat: [Compromised SSH Keys on Control Node](./threats/compromised_ssh_keys_on_control_node.md)

**Threat:** Compromised SSH Keys on Control Node

*   **Description:** The SSH private keys used by the Ansible control node to authenticate to managed nodes are compromised. An attacker with access to these keys can impersonate the control node and gain unauthorized access to all managed nodes.
*   **Impact:** Widespread unauthorized access to managed infrastructure, system compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** Ansible Control Node, SSH Key Management.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Securely store and manage SSH private keys on the Ansible control node.
    *   Restrict access to the private key files.
    *   Consider using SSH agent forwarding with caution.
    *   Implement regular key rotation.
    *   Monitor access to the private key files.
