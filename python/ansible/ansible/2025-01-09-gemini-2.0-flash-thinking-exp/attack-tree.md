## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Ansible (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_ansible__critical_node_.md)

* This is the ultimate goal and represents the successful compromise of the target application using Ansible as the attack vector.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Ansible Controller (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_ansible_controller__critical_node_.md)

* This node represents attacks focused on gaining control of the Ansible controller, which is a central point of control for the infrastructure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access to Ansible Controller System (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_to_ansible_controller_system__critical_node_.md)

* This node represents the successful breach of the Ansible controller system itself, providing a foothold for further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit OS Vulnerabilities on Controller](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_os_vulnerabilities_on_controller.md)

* Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in the operating system of the Ansible controller to gain unauthorized access.
* This often involves using publicly available exploits.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weak Credentials on Controller](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weak_credentials_on_controller.md)

* Attackers use brute-force or dictionary attacks to guess weak passwords for user accounts on the Ansible controller.
* Default or easily guessable passwords are prime targets.

## Attack Tree Path: [Social Engineering against Controller Admins](./attack_tree_paths/social_engineering_against_controller_admins.md)

* Attackers use social engineering techniques, such as phishing, to trick administrators into revealing their credentials for the Ansible controller.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Ansible Configuration or Execution (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_ansible_configuration_or_execution__critical_node_.md)

* This node represents attacks that aim to alter Ansible's behavior to execute malicious actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code into Playbooks](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_into_playbooks.md)

* Attackers insert malicious code into Ansible playbooks, which will then be executed on the managed nodes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Source Code Repository containing Playbooks](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_source_code_repository_containing_playbooks.md)

* Attackers gain unauthorized access to the source code repository (e.g., Git) where Ansible playbooks are stored.
* This allows them to directly modify playbooks and inject malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Developer Accounts with Repository Access](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_developer_accounts_with_repository_access.md)

* Attackers compromise the accounts of developers who have access to the playbook repository.
* This allows them to inject malicious code under the guise of legitimate changes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Ansible Authentication Mechanisms (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_ansible_authentication_mechanisms__critical_node_.md)

* This node represents attacks focused on bypassing or exploiting Ansible's authentication mechanisms.

## Attack Tree Path: [Steal Ansible Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/steal_ansible_credentials.md)

* Attackers attempt to steal Ansible credentials (e.g., SSH keys, vault passwords, environment variables) to gain unauthorized access to managed nodes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Managed Nodes via Ansible (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_managed_nodes_via_ansible__critical_node_.md)

* This node represents attacks that leverage Ansible to directly compromise the managed nodes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Overly Permissive Ansible User Accounts](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_overly_permissive_ansible_user_accounts.md)

* Attackers exploit Ansible user accounts that have been granted excessive privileges on the managed nodes.
* This allows them to perform actions beyond their intended scope.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Malicious Code via Ansible Modules](./attack_tree_paths/execute_malicious_code_via_ansible_modules.md)

* Attackers use Ansible modules to execute arbitrary commands or scripts on the managed nodes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Misuse Module Parameters for Malicious Purposes](./attack_tree_paths/misuse_module_parameters_for_malicious_purposes.md)

* Attackers inject malicious commands or scripts into the parameters of Ansible modules.

## Attack Tree Path: [Deploy Backdoors or Malware via Ansible](./attack_tree_paths/deploy_backdoors_or_malware_via_ansible.md)

* Attackers use Ansible's automation capabilities to deploy backdoors or malware on the managed nodes for persistent access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Exfiltration via Ansible](./attack_tree_paths/data_exfiltration_via_ansible.md)

* Attackers use Ansible modules to copy sensitive data from the managed nodes to an attacker-controlled location.
