# Attack Surface Analysis for ansible/ansible

## Attack Surface: [Control Node Compromise](./attack_surfaces/control_node_compromise.md)

**Description:** The Ansible control node, where Ansible is executed, becomes compromised, granting attackers full control over the Ansible environment and potentially all managed nodes.

**How Ansible Contributes:** The control node *is* the central point for managing infrastructure via Ansible. If compromised, the attacker inherits Ansible's privileges and access to managed nodes.

**Example:** An attacker gains SSH access to the control node using stolen credentials or exploits an OS vulnerability. They can then execute arbitrary Ansible playbooks to reconfigure systems, exfiltrate data, or cause denial of service *through Ansible*.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the managed infrastructure, data breaches, service disruption, and potential for lateral movement to other systems *via Ansible's capabilities*.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong access controls and multi-factor authentication *for the control node*.
* Regularly patch and update the control node's operating system and *Ansible installation*.
* Harden the control node by disabling unnecessary services and restricting network access.
* Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems on the control node.
* Follow the principle of least privilege for *Ansible user accounts* on the control node.
* Securely store *Ansible configuration files* and restrict access.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Playbook Injection/Execution](./attack_surfaces/malicious_playbook_injectionexecution.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject or modify Ansible playbooks to execute malicious commands or configurations on managed nodes.

**How Ansible Contributes:** Ansible *executes* playbooks with the specified privileges on target systems. If a playbook is malicious, Ansible will faithfully execute its instructions.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to a shared playbook repository and inserts tasks that create backdoor accounts on all managed servers. When the playbook is run *by Ansible*, these backdoors are deployed.

**Impact:**  Widespread compromise of managed nodes, installation of malware, data manipulation, and denial of service *orchestrated by Ansible*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict access controls and version control for playbook repositories.
* Implement code review processes for all playbook changes.
* Use static analysis tools to scan playbooks for potential security vulnerabilities.
* Sign playbooks to ensure their integrity and authenticity *before Ansible executes them*.
* Limit the use of powerful modules like `command` and `shell` where possible, opting for more specific and safer modules.
* Implement change management processes for playbook deployments.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Playbooks/Vault](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_playbooksvault.md)

**Description:** Sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, or private keys, is exposed within playbooks or the Ansible Vault, making it vulnerable to unauthorized access.

**How Ansible Contributes:** Ansible uses playbooks to manage configurations, which may involve handling sensitive credentials. *Ansible Vault* provides encryption, but weak vault passwords or insecure storage can negate its benefits.

**Example:** Developers store database credentials directly in a playbook, even if encrypted with a weak *Ansible Vault* password. An attacker gains access to the playbook and cracks the weak vault password, revealing the credentials.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to critical systems and services, potential data breaches, and compromise of other infrastructure components.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enforce strong and unique passwords for *Ansible Vault*.
* Securely store the *Ansible Vault* password (e.g., using a password manager or hardware security module).
* Avoid storing sensitive information directly in playbooks whenever possible.
* Utilize external secret management solutions and integrate them with Ansible using lookup plugins.
* Regularly rotate sensitive credentials.
* Implement access controls to restrict who can view or modify playbooks containing sensitive data.

## Attack Surface: [Weak or Default Credentials for Managed Nodes](./attack_surfaces/weak_or_default_credentials_for_managed_nodes.md)

**Description:** Ansible uses weak or default credentials to connect to managed nodes, making them susceptible to brute-force attacks or exploitation of known default credentials.

**How Ansible Contributes:** Ansible *relies* on credentials (e.g., SSH keys, passwords) to authenticate to managed nodes. Weak credentials provide an easy entry point *for Ansible*.

**Example:** Ansible is configured to connect to managed servers using a default "admin"/"password" combination. An attacker can leverage this *through Ansible's connection mechanisms*.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to managed nodes, potential for lateral movement, data breaches, and system compromise.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enforce strong and unique passwords for all managed node accounts *used by Ansible*.
* Implement key-based authentication for SSH connections *initiated by Ansible*.
* Disable or change default credentials on all managed nodes.
* Regularly rotate credentials *used by Ansible*.
* Implement account lockout policies on managed nodes to prevent brute-force attacks.
