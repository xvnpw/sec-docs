*   **Attack Surface: Unauthenticated or Weakly Authenticated Web Interface Access**
    *   **Description:** The Locust web interface, used for controlling and monitoring load tests, is accessible without proper authentication or with weak default credentials.
    *   **How Locust Contributes:** Locust provides a built-in web interface for management. If not secured, this becomes a direct entry point.
    *   **Example:** An attacker accesses the Locust web interface using default credentials (`locust`/`locust` or no authentication configured) and starts malicious load tests targeting internal systems or exfiltrates test data displayed on the interface.
    *   **Impact:** Full control over load testing infrastructure, potential for denial-of-service attacks against internal or external targets, exposure of sensitive test data and configurations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication mechanisms on the Locust web interface (e.g., username/password with strong password policies, integration with existing authentication systems).
        *   Disable default credentials and enforce password changes upon initial setup.
        *   Restrict access to the web interface to authorized networks or IP addresses using firewalls or network segmentation.
        *   Consider using HTTPS for the web interface to encrypt communication.

*   **Attack Surface: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the Web Interface**
    *   **Description:** Input fields or data displayed within the Locust web interface are not properly sanitized, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts that execute in the browsers of users accessing the interface.
    *   **How Locust Contributes:** Locust's web interface handles user input for test names, hostnames, and displays test results and logs, creating potential injection points.
    *   **Example:** An attacker injects a malicious JavaScript payload into a test name. When an administrator views the test results, the script executes in their browser, potentially stealing session cookies or performing actions on their behalf.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise of users accessing the Locust web interface, potential for further attacks against the Locust infrastructure or the target application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and output encoding/escaping on all data handled by the Locust web interface.
        *   Utilize security headers like `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.
        *   Regularly scan the Locust codebase for potential XSS vulnerabilities.

*   **Attack Surface: Code Injection via Test Scripts**
    *   **Description:**  Malicious code can be injected into Locust test scripts, leading to arbitrary code execution on the agent nodes.
    *   **How Locust Contributes:** Locust executes user-defined Python scripts on the agent nodes. If these scripts are sourced from untrusted locations or not properly reviewed, they can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** An attacker modifies a test script to execute system commands on the agent machine, potentially gaining unauthorized access or disrupting the agent's operation.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of agent nodes, potential for lateral movement within the network.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict code review processes for all Locust test scripts.
        *   Source test scripts from trusted and controlled repositories.
        *   Avoid using dynamic code execution (e.g., `eval`, `exec`) within test scripts unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.
        *   Run Locust agents with the least privileges necessary.
        *   Utilize security scanning tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in test scripts.
