# Threat Model Analysis for sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy

## Threat: [SQL Injection - Bypassing ORM with Raw SQL Injection](./threats/sql_injection_-_bypassing_orm_with_raw_sql_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input that, when incorporated into a raw SQL query string (using `sqlalchemy.text()` or string formatting), alters the query's logic to execute unintended commands. The attacker might try to read data they shouldn't have access to, modify data, or even execute operating system commands if the database user has sufficient privileges.
*   **Impact:** Data breach (confidentiality), data modification/deletion (integrity), potential system compromise (availability, confidentiality, integrity).
*   **SQLAlchemy Component Affected:** `sqlalchemy.text()`, string formatting within query construction, any usage of raw SQL strings.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Primary:** Always use parameterized queries with `text()`: `stmt = text("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = :username"); conn.execute(stmt, {"username": user_input})`.
    *   **Secondary:** Prefer the SQLAlchemy Core or ORM query builder (e.g., `select()`, `filter()`, `join()`) over raw SQL whenever possible.
    *   **Tertiary:** Input validation and sanitization (length limits, character restrictions) as defense-in-depth, even when using parameterized queries.
    *   **Code Review:** Mandatory code reviews to flag any use of raw SQL without bound parameters.
    * **Static Analysis:** Employ static analysis tools to detect potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [SQL Injection through ORM Misuse](./threats/sql_injection_through_orm_misuse.md)

*   **Description:**  Even when using the ORM, an attacker might find ways to inject SQL if developers use string concatenation or formatting *within* ORM methods like `filter()`. For example, constructing a filter condition like `filter("username = '" + user_input + "'")` is vulnerable.
*   **Impact:**  Similar to raw SQL injection: data breach, data modification/deletion, potential system compromise.
*   **SQLAlchemy Component Affected:**  ORM query building methods (e.g., `filter()`, `filter_by()`, `order_by()`, `group_by()`) when used with improperly constructed string expressions.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Primary:**  Always use the ORM's built-in parameterization features.  For example: `filter(User.username == user_input)` or `filter_by(username=user_input)`.
    *   **Secondary:**  Input validation and sanitization.
    *   **Code Review:**  Focus on identifying any string concatenation or formatting within ORM query construction.
    * **Static Analysis:** Use tools to detect potential injection vulnerabilities even within ORM usage.

## Threat: [Unintentional Data Serialization](./threats/unintentional_data_serialization.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to sensitive data by triggering the serialization of entire ORM objects (including fields they shouldn't see) to JSON, XML, or other output formats. This often happens when developers use generic serialization or forget to exclude sensitive columns.
*   **Impact:** Data breach (confidentiality).
*   **SQLAlchemy Component Affected:**  ORM object serialization, lazy loading of related objects.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Primary:** Use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) or explicit serialization methods that only include the necessary fields.
    *   **Secondary:**  Avoid using the default `__repr__` method for objects containing sensitive data.
    *   **Tertiary:**  Carefully review lazy loading configurations and use eager loading with explicit attribute selection where appropriate.
    * **Serialization Libraries:** Use libraries like Marshmallow with whitelisting of allowed fields.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Inefficient Queries](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_inefficient_queries.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts requests that trigger extremely inefficient database queries (e.g., full table scans, Cartesian products, excessive joins). This consumes excessive database resources (CPU, memory, I/O), slowing down or crashing the database server.
*   **Impact:**  Denial of service (availability).
*   **SQLAlchemy Component Affected:**  Any SQLAlchemy query construction (ORM or Core), especially those involving joins, subqueries, or complex filtering.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Primary:**  Query optimization: Use database profiling tools to identify and optimize slow queries. Ensure appropriate indexes are in place.
    *   **Secondary:**  Avoid unnecessary joins and subqueries.
    *   **Tertiary:**  Use pagination (`limit()` and `offset()`) for large datasets.
    * **Timeouts:** Set appropriate timeouts for database operations.

## Threat: [Connection Pool Exhaustion](./threats/connection_pool_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a large number of requests that open database connections but don't release them properly. This exhausts the connection pool, preventing legitimate users from connecting to the database.
*   **Impact:**  Denial of service (availability).
*   **SQLAlchemy Component Affected:**  `sqlalchemy.create_engine()` (connection pooling configuration), session management (opening and closing sessions).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Primary:**  Use SQLAlchemy's connection pooling features with appropriate settings (pool size, timeout, etc.).
    *   **Secondary:**  Ensure connections are properly released back to the pool after use (e.g., by closing the session or result set).
    *   **Tertiary:**  Use context managers (`with session.begin():`) to ensure automatic session closure.
    * **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting at the application level.

## Threat: [Unintended Data Modification/Deletion](./threats/unintended_data_modificationdeletion.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker (or a developer error) triggers unintended data modification or deletion due to incorrect use of the ORM's update or delete methods. This might happen because of missing or incorrect filtering criteria, or misunderstanding cascading deletes.
*   **Impact:**  Data corruption (integrity).
*   **SQLAlchemy Component Affected:**  ORM `update()` and `delete()` methods, relationship configuration (cascading deletes).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Primary:**  Always use explicit and precise filtering criteria when updating or deleting data.
    *   **Secondary:**  Carefully review and understand the configuration of relationships and cascading deletes.
    *   **Tertiary:**  Use database transactions to group operations and ensure atomicity.
    * **Auditing:** Implement auditing to track changes to sensitive data.
