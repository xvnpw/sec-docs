## Attack Tree Path: [1. SQL Injection (Despite SQLAlchemy's ORM) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__sql_injection__despite_sqlalchemy's_orm___critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:**  Even though SQLAlchemy is an ORM designed to prevent SQL injection, improper usage can still lead to vulnerabilities. This is the most critical area to address.
*   **High-Risk Paths:**

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Improper Use of `text()` or `literal_column()`](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_improper_use_of__text____or__literal_column___.md)

    *   **1.1.1 Directly Embedding User Input in `text()`:**
        *   *Attack Vector:*  The attacker provides malicious input that, when directly concatenated into a SQL query string using `text()`, alters the query's logic.  For example, if the code is `text("SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '" + user_input + "'")`, an attacker could input `' OR '1'='1`, resulting in `SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '' OR '1'='1'`, which would return all users.
        *   *Likelihood:* Medium
        *   *Impact:* High
        *   *Effort:* Low
        *   *Skill Level:* Novice
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium
    *   **1.1.2 Directly Embedding User Input in `literal_column()`:**
        *   *Attack Vector:* Similar to `text()`, `literal_column()` allows direct insertion of SQL fragments.  If user input is used here without sanitization, it can lead to SQL injection.  This is often used for dynamically constructing column names, which is inherently risky.
        *   *Likelihood:* Low
        *   *Impact:* High
        *   *Effort:* Low
        *   *Skill Level:* Novice
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3 Incorrect Use of `execute()` with Raw SQL](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_incorrect_use_of__execute____with_raw_sql.md)

    *   **1.3.1 Passing unsanitized user input directly to `connection.execute()`:**
        *   *Attack Vector:*  If raw SQL is used with `connection.execute()` and user input is directly embedded in the SQL string, it's vulnerable to SQL injection, just like using `text()` incorrectly.
        *   *Likelihood:* Medium
        *   *Impact:* High
        *   *Effort:* Low
        *   *Skill Level:* Novice
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium
    *   **1.3.2 Using string formatting to build SQL queries within `execute()`:**
         *   *Attack Vector:* Using Python's string formatting (e.g., f-strings) to build the SQL query passed to `execute()` is *extremely dangerous* and creates a direct SQL injection vulnerability.
         *   *Likelihood:* Medium
         *   *Impact:* High
         *   *Effort:* Low
         *   *Skill Level:* Novice
         *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Denial of Service (DoS) via SQLAlchemy](./attack_tree_paths/2__denial_of_service__dos__via_sqlalchemy.md)

*   **Description:** Attacks that aim to make the application unavailable by exhausting resources related to SQLAlchemy.
*   **High-Risk Paths:**

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1 Connection Pool Exhaustion](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_connection_pool_exhaustion.md)

    *   **2.1.1 Creating excessive connections without closing them properly:**
        *   *Attack Vector:*  If the application repeatedly opens database connections without closing them (e.g., forgetting to use `with engine.connect() as conn:` or missing `conn.close()` in a `try...finally` block), the connection pool will eventually be exhausted, preventing new connections and making the application unresponsive.
        *   *Likelihood:* Medium
        *   *Impact:* Medium
        *   *Effort:* Low
        *   *Skill Level:* Novice
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Easy
    *   **2.1.3 Application logic errors leading to connection leaks:**
        *   *Attack Vector:* Exceptions or other errors in the application logic might prevent connections from being closed, leading to the same exhaustion problem as 2.1.1.
        *   *Likelihood:* Medium
        *   *Impact:* Medium
        *   *Effort:* Low
        *   *Skill Level:* Novice
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Information Disclosure](./attack_tree_paths/3__information_disclosure.md)

*   **Description:**  Revealing sensitive information about the database or application.
*   **Critical Node:**

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2 Leaking Connection Parameters](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_leaking_connection_parameters.md)

    *   **Description:** Exposing database connection details (username, password, host, database name) can allow an attacker to directly connect to the database.
    *   **High-Risk Paths:**
        *   **3.2.1 Storing database credentials in insecure locations:**
            *   *Attack Vector:*  Hardcoding credentials in the application code, storing them in unencrypted configuration files, or committing them to version control (e.g., Git) makes them easily accessible to attackers.
            *   *Likelihood:* Medium
            *   *Impact:* High
            *   *Effort:* Very Low
            *   *Skill Level:* Novice
            *   *Detection Difficulty:* Easy
        *   **3.2.2 Exposing connection string in error messages:**
            *   *Attack Vector:*  If the application displays detailed error messages to users, and these messages include the database connection string, an attacker can gain access to the database credentials.
            *   *Likelihood:* Medium
            *   *Impact:* High
            *   *Effort:* Very Low
            *   *Skill Level:* Novice
            *   *Detection Difficulty:* Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Privilege Escalation](./attack_tree_paths/5__privilege_escalation.md)

*   **Description:**  Gaining higher privileges within the database than intended.
*   **Critical Node:**

## Attack Tree Path: [5.1 Exploiting Database User Permissions](./attack_tree_paths/5_1_exploiting_database_user_permissions.md)

    *   **Description:**  If the database user the application connects with has excessive privileges, any vulnerability (e.g., SQL injection) can be exploited to gain much greater control over the database.
    *   **High-Risk Path:**
        *   **5.1.1 The application's database user having excessive privileges:**
            *   *Attack Vector:*  If the database user has permissions like `CREATE TABLE`, `DROP TABLE`, `GRANT`, or even `SELECT` on all tables, an attacker who compromises the application (e.g., through SQL injection) can perform any of these actions.  The principle of least privilege should always be applied.
            *   *Likelihood:* Medium
            *   *Impact:* High
            *   *Effort:* Very Low
            *   *Skill Level:* Novice
            *   *Detection Difficulty:* Easy
