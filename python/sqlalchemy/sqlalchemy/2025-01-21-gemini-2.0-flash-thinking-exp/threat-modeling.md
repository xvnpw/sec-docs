# Threat Model Analysis for sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy

## Threat: [SQL Injection via Unsafe `text()` Usage](./threats/sql_injection_via_unsafe__text____usage.md)

* **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious SQL code into the application's database queries by manipulating user input that is directly embedded into a `sqlalchemy.text()` construct without proper sanitization or parameterization. The attacker might craft input that alters the intended query logic, allowing them to access, modify, or delete data they are not authorized to interact with.
* **Impact:**  Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. The attacker might be able to bypass authentication or authorization mechanisms, potentially gaining full control over the database.
* **Affected SQLAlchemy Component:** `sqlalchemy.sql.text.text()`
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Always use parameterized queries with `bindparams()` when using `text()` and incorporating user input.**
    * **Avoid directly embedding user input into `text()` constructs whenever possible.**
    * **Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the application level before passing data to SQLAlchemy.**
