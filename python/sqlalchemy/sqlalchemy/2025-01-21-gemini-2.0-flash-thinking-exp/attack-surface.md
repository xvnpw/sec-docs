# Attack Surface Analysis for sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection via Raw SQL or Improperly Constructed Queries](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_via_raw_sql_or_improperly_constructed_queries.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into queries executed against the database, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
    *   **How SQLAlchemy Contributes:** While SQLAlchemy provides mechanisms for safe query construction (like parameterized queries), developers might still use raw SQL (`text()`) or construct queries using string concatenation, bypassing these safeguards.
    *   **Example:**
        ```python
        username = input("Enter username: ")
        query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "'"  # Vulnerable!
        with engine.connect() as connection:
            result = connection.execute(text(query))
        ```
        An attacker could input `' OR '1'='1` to bypass authentication.
    *   **Impact:** Critical. Full database compromise, data breaches, data manipulation, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always use parameterized queries:** Utilize SQLAlchemy's ORM or `text()` with bound parameters.
        *   **Avoid string concatenation for query building:**  Do not directly embed user input into SQL strings.
        *   **Use SQLAlchemy's ORM for most operations:** The ORM generally handles query construction safely.

## Attack Surface: [ORM Injection](./attack_surfaces/orm_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate ORM queries by influencing filter conditions, order by clauses, or relationship loading strategies through user-controlled input.
    *   **How SQLAlchemy Contributes:**  Dynamically constructing ORM queries based on user input without proper validation can lead to unexpected query behavior.
    *   **Example:**
        ```python
        sort_by = input("Sort by field: ")
        users = session.query(User).order_by(sort_by).all() # Potentially vulnerable
        ```
        An attacker could input `User.password` to potentially expose sensitive data in the ordering.
    *   **Impact:** High. Unauthorized data access, information disclosure, potential denial of service due to inefficient queries.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use whitelists for allowed fields or values:**  Validate user input against a predefined set of acceptable options.
        *   **Avoid directly using user input in `order_by`, `filter`, or other query building methods without validation.**
        *   **Map user-provided input to predefined safe options.**
        *   **Consider using more restrictive query building patterns when dealing with user input.**

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Database Credentials](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_database_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive database connection details (username, password, host) are exposed, allowing unauthorized access to the database.
    *   **How SQLAlchemy Contributes:** SQLAlchemy requires connection details to be provided, and if these are stored insecurely, it contributes to the attack surface.
    *   **Example:**
        ```python
        engine = create_engine('postgresql://user:password@host:port/database') # Insecure!
        ```
        Storing the password directly in the connection string in code.
    *   **Impact:** Critical. Full database compromise, data breaches, data manipulation, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Store credentials securely:** Use environment variables, dedicated secrets management systems (like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager), or configuration files with restricted access.
        *   **Avoid hardcoding credentials in code.**
        *   **Ensure proper file permissions on configuration files containing credentials.**
        *   **Rotate database credentials regularly.**

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Connection Parameters](./attack_surfaces/insecure_connection_parameters.md)

*   **Description:** The database connection is established using insecure parameters, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping or man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **How SQLAlchemy Contributes:** SQLAlchemy uses the provided connection parameters, and if these are insecure, the library facilitates the insecure connection.
    *   **Example:**
        ```python
        engine = create_engine('postgresql://user:password@host:port/database', connect_args={'sslmode': 'disable'}) # Insecure!
        ```
        Disabling SSL/TLS encryption for the database connection.
    *   **Impact:** High. Data interception, credential theft, man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enforce SSL/TLS encryption for database connections:** Configure `sslmode` appropriately in the connection string or connection arguments.
        *   **Use strong authentication methods supported by the database.**
        *   **Ensure the database server is also configured for secure connections.**

## Attack Surface: [Database Driver Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/database_driver_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the underlying database driver used by SQLAlchemy can be exploited to compromise the application or the database.
    *   **How SQLAlchemy Contributes:** SQLAlchemy relies on database-specific drivers (e.g., psycopg2 for PostgreSQL, mysqlclient for MySQL). Vulnerabilities in these drivers directly impact SQLAlchemy's security.
    *   **Example:** A known vulnerability in a specific version of `psycopg2` that allows remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Critical to High. Depending on the vulnerability, it could lead to remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical depending on the specific vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep database drivers updated:** Regularly update the database drivers to the latest stable versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Monitor security advisories for the database drivers in use.**
        *   **Consider using dependency scanning tools to identify vulnerable dependencies.**
