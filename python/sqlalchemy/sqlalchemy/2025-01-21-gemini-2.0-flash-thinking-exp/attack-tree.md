## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via SQLAlchemy Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_sqlalchemy_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

* This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. It represents the successful compromise of the application by exploiting weaknesses within the SQLAlchemy library or its usage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit SQLAlchemy Weaknesses [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_sqlalchemy_weaknesses__critical_node_.md)

* This node represents the attacker's focus on leveraging vulnerabilities specifically related to SQLAlchemy, rather than general web application flaws. It encompasses various attack vectors that exploit how SQLAlchemy interacts with the database and the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_sql_injection_vulnerabilities__critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

* This critical node and high-risk path represent the most significant threat. Attackers aim to inject malicious SQL code into database queries executed by SQLAlchemy. Successful exploitation can lead to:
    * Data breaches (accessing sensitive information).
    * Data manipulation (modifying or deleting data).
    * Potential execution of arbitrary commands on the database server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Unsanitized User Input in Raw SQL Queries [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_unsanitized_user_input_in_raw_sql_queries__critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

* This is a direct and common method of SQL injection. When developers use `sqlalchemy.text()` to execute raw SQL and directly embed user-provided input without proper sanitization, it creates a straightforward injection point.
        * Inject Malicious SQL into `text()` constructs [HIGH RISK PATH]:
            * Attackers craft malicious SQL fragments within user input that, when concatenated or interpolated into the raw SQL string, alter the intended query logic. This allows them to execute arbitrary SQL commands.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious SQL into `text()` constructs [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_sql_into__text____constructs__high_risk_path_.md)

* Attackers craft malicious SQL fragments within user input that, when concatenated or interpolated into the raw SQL string, alter the intended query logic. This allows them to execute arbitrary SQL commands.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in ORM Query Construction [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_orm_query_construction__high_risk_path_.md)

* Even when using SQLAlchemy's Object-Relational Mapper (ORM), vulnerabilities can arise if user input influences the construction of queries without proper validation.
        * Manipulate Filtering Logic via User-Controlled Parameters [HIGH RISK PATH]:
            * Attackers can inject malicious conditions into `filter()` or `where()` clauses by manipulating user-controlled parameters. This can bypass intended filtering logic, allowing access to unauthorized data or manipulation of unintended records.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Filtering Logic via User-Controlled Parameters [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_filtering_logic_via_user-controlled_parameters__high_risk_path_.md)

* Attackers can inject malicious conditions into `filter()` or `where()` clauses by manipulating user-controlled parameters. This can bypass intended filtering logic, allowing access to unauthorized data or manipulation of unintended records.
