# Threat Model Analysis for sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy

## Threat: [SQL Injection via String Formatting](./threats/sql_injection_via_string_formatting.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input that is directly embedded into a SQL query string using string formatting (e.g., f-strings or `%` operator) before being executed by SQLAlchemy. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands against the database.

**Impact:** Data breach (accessing sensitive data), data manipulation (modifying or deleting data), potential for privilege escalation within the database, and in some cases, even operating system command execution if database features allow it.

**Affected Component:** `sqlalchemy.engine.Connection.execute()`, particularly when used with string formatting directly on user-provided data.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Always use parameterized queries: Utilize SQLAlchemy's parameter binding mechanisms (e.g., passing parameters as a dictionary or tuple to `execute()`). This ensures that user input is treated as data, not executable code.
* Avoid string formatting for SQL construction: Do not use f-strings, `%` operator, or `+` for concatenating user input directly into SQL query strings.

## Threat: [SQL Injection via Insecure ORM Usage](./threats/sql_injection_via_insecure_orm_usage.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities arising from improper use of SQLAlchemy's ORM features. This can involve crafting malicious input that influences `filter()` conditions, `order_by()` clauses, or other ORM methods in a way that leads to the execution of unintended SQL. This often involves dynamic construction of query fragments based on user input without proper sanitization.

**Impact:** Similar to direct SQL injection: data breach, data manipulation, potential privilege escalation.

**Affected Component:** ORM query building methods like `Query.filter()`, `Query.where()`, `Query.order_by()`, and the `text()` construct when used with unsanitized input.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Parameterize inputs in ORM queries: When using `filter()` or similar methods with user-provided data, use parameterized expressions or SQLAlchemy's built-in mechanisms for safe value comparison.
* Be cautious with `text()` constructs: Avoid using the `text()` construct with direct user input. If necessary, ensure proper sanitization and parameterization.
* Validate and sanitize user input: Implement robust input validation and sanitization before using user-provided data in ORM queries.
