# Attack Surface Analysis for sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection through Unsanitized User Input in Raw SQL](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_through_unsanitized_user_input_in_raw_sql.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into queries by manipulating user-supplied data that is directly incorporated into raw SQL strings.
*   **How SQLAlchemy Contributes:** SQLAlchemy's `session.execute(text(...))` and similar methods allow the execution of arbitrary SQL. If developers directly embed user input into the string passed to these methods without proper sanitization, it creates a direct SQL injection vulnerability.
*   **Example:**
    ```python
    user_input = request.args.get('username')
    query = text(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '{user_input}'")
    session.execute(query)
    ```
    An attacker could provide `'; DROP TABLE users; --` as input.
*   **Impact:** Full database compromise, including data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. Potential for executing operating system commands on the database server in some configurations.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always use parameterized queries:** Utilize SQLAlchemy's parameter binding features when executing raw SQL.
    *   **Avoid string formatting/concatenation for building SQL with user input:** Use SQLAlchemy's expression language or parameterized queries instead.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection through Insecure ORM Usage (String-Based Expressions)](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_through_insecure_orm_usage__string-based_expressions_.md)

*   **Description:** While SQLAlchemy's ORM provides some protection, using string-based expressions in methods like `filter()` or `order_by()` with unsanitized user input can still lead to SQL injection.
*   **How SQLAlchemy Contributes:** SQLAlchemy allows string-based expressions for dynamic query building in ORM methods. If user input is directly inserted into these strings, it bypasses the ORM's intended protection mechanisms.
*   **Example:**
    ```python
    sort_by = request.args.get('sort')
    users = session.query(User).order_by(sort_by).all()
    ```
    An attacker could provide `username; DROP TABLE users; --` as input.
*   **Impact:** Similar to raw SQL injection, potentially leading to full database compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Prefer column objects over string-based expressions:** Use SQLAlchemy's column objects (e.g., `User.username`) for filtering and ordering whenever possible.
    *   **Whitelist allowed values for dynamic ordering/filtering:** If dynamic ordering or filtering is required, validate user input against a predefined list of allowed columns or criteria.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Information through Connection Strings](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_information_through_connection_strings.md)

*   **Description:** Database connection strings often contain sensitive information like usernames, passwords, and database names. If these are exposed, attackers can gain unauthorized access.
*   **How SQLAlchemy Contributes:** SQLAlchemy requires connection strings to connect to databases. If these strings are hardcoded or stored insecurely, they become an attack vector directly related to SQLAlchemy's configuration.
*   **Example:**
    ```python
    engine = create_engine('postgresql://user:password@host:port/database') # Hardcoded
    ```
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the database, potentially leading to data breaches, manipulation, or deletion.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Store connection strings securely:** Use environment variables, dedicated secrets management tools, or encrypted configuration files.
    *   **Avoid hardcoding credentials:** Never directly embed credentials in the application code.
