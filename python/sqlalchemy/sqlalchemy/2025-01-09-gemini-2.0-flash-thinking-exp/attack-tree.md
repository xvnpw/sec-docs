## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path, Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_sql_injection_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into queries executed by SQLAlchemy due to improper handling of user input in SQL query construction.
*   **Critical Node: Direct Parameterization Bypass (High-Risk Path, Critical Node)**
    *   **Attack Steps:**
        *   Identify Vulnerable Query Construction (Critical Node): Attackers analyze the application code to find instances where SQL queries are built using string concatenation or f-strings directly incorporating user input, instead of using SQLAlchemy's parameterization features.
        *   Inject SQL Keywords/Operators (Critical Node): Once a vulnerable query construction is identified, attackers craft malicious input containing SQL keywords and operators (e.g., `'; DROP TABLE users; --`) to manipulate the query's logic.
*   **Critical Node: Insecure Use of `text()` or `literal_column()` (High-Risk Path)**
    *   **Attack Steps:**
        *   Identify Usage of Raw SQL Constructs: Attackers look for instances where the developers have used `sqlalchemy.text()` or `sqlalchemy.literal_column()` to execute raw SQL queries.
        *   Inject Malicious SQL within Raw String (Critical Node): If user-provided data is directly embedded within the raw SQL string passed to `text()` or `literal_column()` without proper sanitization or parameterization, attackers can inject malicious SQL code.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Configuration Issues (High-Risk Path, Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_configuration_issues__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit insecure configurations related to database connection details, granting them unauthorized access.
*   **Critical Node: Exposed Database Credentials (High-Risk Path, Critical Node)**
    *   **Attack Steps:**
        *   Access Configuration Files/Environment Variables: Attackers attempt to access configuration files, environment variables, or other locations where database credentials might be stored.
        *   Retrieve Credentials (Critical Node): If successful in accessing these locations, attackers retrieve the database username and password.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Abuse ORM Features/Misuse (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/3__abuse_orm_featuresmisuse__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers leverage the ORM's features in unintended ways due to improper configuration or lack of input validation, leading to data manipulation or privilege escalation.
*   **Critical Node: Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path)**
    *   **Attack Steps:**
        *   Identify Models Vulnerable to Mass Assignment: Attackers identify SQLAlchemy models where attributes can be directly updated based on user-provided data without explicit definition of allowed fields.
        *   Provide Unexpected Data During Object Creation/Update: Attackers craft malicious requests containing unexpected or unauthorized data for model attributes, potentially modifying sensitive information or escalating privileges.
