*   **SQL Injection via Unsafe Query Construction:**
    *   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into database queries, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
    *   **How SQLAlchemy Contributes:** Using `text()` constructs with unsanitized user input directly embedded into the SQL string bypasses SQLAlchemy's parameterization. Similarly, `literal_column()` treats user input as raw SQL. Dynamic construction of queries using string concatenation with user input also creates vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:**
        ```python
        from sqlalchemy import text, create_engine

        engine = create_engine('sqlite:///:memory:')
        user_input = "'; DROP TABLE users; --"
        query = text("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + user_input + "'")
        with engine.connect() as connection:
            connection.execute(query) # Vulnerable to SQL injection
        ```
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data modification or deletion, potential for privilege escalation, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always use parameterized queries:** Utilize SQLAlchemy's ORM or the `bindparam()` function with `text()` to ensure user input is treated as data, not executable code.
        *   **Avoid `text()` or `literal_column()` with user-provided data:** If absolutely necessary, implement rigorous input validation and sanitization.
        *   **Use the ORM for data manipulation:** The ORM generally handles query construction safely.

*   **Database Connection String Exposure:**
    *   **Description:** Sensitive database credentials (username, password, host) are exposed, allowing unauthorized access to the database.
    *   **How SQLAlchemy Contributes:** SQLAlchemy requires a connection string to connect to the database. If this string is stored insecurely, it becomes an attack vector.
    *   **Example:**
        ```python
        engine = create_engine('postgresql://user:password@host:port/database') # Credentials in code
        ```
        Or storing the connection string in a configuration file without proper access controls.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the database, including data access, modification, and deletion.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Store connection strings securely:** Use environment variables, dedicated secrets management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager), or encrypted configuration files with restricted access.
        *   **Avoid hardcoding credentials:** Never embed credentials directly in the application code.

*   **Raw SQL Execution with User Input:**
    *   **Description:** Executing raw SQL queries constructed from user input without proper sanitization, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **How SQLAlchemy Contributes:**  Methods like `engine.execute()` or `connection.execute()` allow direct execution of SQL strings, which can be dangerous if the strings are built using untrusted input.
    *   **Example:**
        ```python
        from sqlalchemy import create_engine

        engine = create_engine('sqlite:///:memory:')
        table_name = input("Enter table name: ") # User input
        with engine.connect() as connection:
            connection.execute(f"SELECT * FROM {table_name}") # Vulnerable if table_name is malicious
        ```
    *   **Impact:** Same as SQL Injection: data breach, data modification or deletion, potential for privilege escalation, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid using raw SQL with user input whenever possible:** Prefer using the ORM or parameterized queries.
        *   **If raw SQL is necessary, implement rigorous input validation and sanitization:**  Ensure the input conforms to expected patterns and does not contain malicious SQL syntax.
