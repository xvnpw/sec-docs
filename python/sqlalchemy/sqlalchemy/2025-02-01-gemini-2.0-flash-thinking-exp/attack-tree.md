## Attack Tree Path: [SQL Injection Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/sql_injection_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit weaknesses in how the application constructs and executes SQL queries, allowing them to inject malicious SQL code. This injected code is then executed by the database, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
*   **Why High-Risk:** SQL Injection is a well-known and highly impactful vulnerability. Successful exploitation can lead to complete database compromise, data breaches, and significant damage to the application and organization. It is often relatively easy to exploit with readily available tools and techniques.
*   **Critical Nodes within this Path:**
    *   **Execute unsanitized user input via `text()` or `execute()` [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Description:** Developers use SQLAlchemy's `text()` or `execute()` methods to run raw SQL queries. If user-provided input is directly embedded into these raw SQL strings without proper sanitization or parameterization, attackers can inject malicious SQL code.
        *   **Example:**  Imagine a search function where the query is built like this: `session.execute(text("SELECT * FROM items WHERE name LIKE '" + user_input + "%'"))`. An attacker could input `' OR 1=1 --` as `user_input` to bypass the intended filter and retrieve all items.
        *   **Mitigations:**
            *   **Always use parameterized queries:**  Utilize SQLAlchemy's parameter binding features when using `text()` or `execute()`.  This separates SQL code from user data, preventing injection.
            *   **Sanitize user inputs:**  While parameterization is the primary defense, input validation and sanitization can provide an additional layer of security.
            *   **Prefer ORM features:**  Whenever possible, use SQLAlchemy's ORM features (like `filter()`, `where()`, etc.) which handle parameterization automatically, reducing the risk of manual errors.
    *   **Insecure use of `filter()` or `where()` with string concatenation [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Description:** Even when using SQLAlchemy's ORM, developers might incorrectly construct dynamic filter conditions by concatenating user input strings directly into `filter()` or `where()` clauses. This bypasses the ORM's intended protection and creates an SQL injection vulnerability.
        *   **Example:**  Consider filtering users by username: `username = request.args.get('username')`; `users = session.query(User).filter("username LIKE '" + username + "%'").all()`.  An attacker could inject SQL code through the `username` parameter.
        *   **Mitigations:**
            *   **Use parameterized queries in ORM filters:**  Utilize SQLAlchemy's parameter binding within `filter()` and `where()` clauses.  For example: `session.query(User).filter(User.username.like(username + '%')).all()` is still vulnerable. The correct approach is to use parameter markers: `session.query(User).filter(User.username.like('%' + bindparam('username_param') + '%')).params(username_param=username).all()` or even better, use ORM's built-in parameter handling: `session.query(User).filter(User.username.like('%' + username + '%')).all()` (in many cases SQLAlchemy will handle this safely, but it's best to explicitly use parameter binding for dynamic parts).  However, the safest and clearest approach is to use ORM's built-in parameter handling and avoid string concatenation altogether within filters.
            *   **Avoid string concatenation for dynamic conditions:**  Rely on ORM's built-in features for dynamic query construction and parameter binding.

## Attack Tree Path: [Information Disclosure [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/information_disclosure__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers aim to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information exposed by the application. This information can include database schema details, internal application paths, or even database credentials. Information disclosure can directly violate confidentiality and can also be used to facilitate further attacks.
*   **Why High-Risk:** Information disclosure vulnerabilities are often easy to exploit and detect. While the immediate impact might seem lower than SQL injection, leaked information can significantly aid attackers in planning and executing more severe attacks. Insecure credential management directly leads to high-impact compromise.
*   **Critical Nodes within this Path:**
    *   **Verbose Error Messages exposing Database Schema or Internal Details [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Description:** In production environments, applications might be misconfigured to display detailed error messages when exceptions occur. These error messages, especially those originating from SQLAlchemy or the database driver, can reveal sensitive information like database schema, table names, column names, internal file paths, and even parts of SQL queries.
        *   **Example:** An unhandled exception during a database query might display a traceback that includes the full SQL query, database connection string (potentially with username), and internal application paths.
        *   **Mitigations:**
            *   **Implement proper error handling:**  Use try-except blocks to catch exceptions and handle them gracefully.
            *   **Generic error pages in production:** Configure web servers and application frameworks to display generic, user-friendly error pages in production environments that do not reveal technical details.
            *   **Secure logging:** Log detailed error information securely to a centralized logging system for debugging and monitoring, but ensure these logs are not publicly accessible.
    *   **Hardcoded or easily accessible database credentials [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Description:** Database connection strings, which often include usernames and passwords, might be hardcoded directly into the application code, configuration files stored in version control, or easily accessible configuration files on the server. Attackers who gain access to these credentials can directly access the database.
        *   **Example:** A database connection string like `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'postgresql://user:password@host:port/database'` hardcoded in `config.py` or environment variables exposed in a vulnerable way.
        *   **Mitigations:**
            *   **Never hardcode credentials:**  Avoid embedding database credentials directly in code or configuration files.
            *   **Use environment variables:** Store database credentials as environment variables, which are configured outside of the application codebase.
            *   **Secrets management systems:**  Utilize dedicated secrets management systems (like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, etc.) to securely store, manage, and access database credentials. These systems provide features like access control, auditing, and rotation of secrets.
            *   **Restrict file system access:** Ensure that configuration files containing connection details (even if not hardcoded credentials) have restricted file system permissions, limiting access to only necessary users and processes.
