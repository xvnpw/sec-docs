# Threat Model Analysis for sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy

## Threat: [SQL Injection via `text()` constructs](./threats/sql_injection_via__text____constructs.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts malicious SQL code and injects it through user-controlled input that is directly embedded into `sqlalchemy.text()` constructs without proper parameterization. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries.

**Impact:**
*   Data Breach: Unauthorized access to sensitive data.
*   Data Manipulation: Modification or deletion of data.
*   Privilege Escalation: Gaining elevated database privileges.
*   Denial of Service: Disrupting database operations.

**SQLAlchemy Component Affected:** `sqlalchemy.sql.text.text()` function.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Always use parameterized queries with `text()`:** Utilize the `:param` syntax and pass parameters as arguments to `text()`.
*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Sanitize user input before using it in any part of a query, even with parameterization as a defense-in-depth measure.
*   **Code Reviews:** Regularly review code using `text()` to ensure proper parameterization is in place.
*   **Static Analysis Tools:** Employ tools to automatically detect potential SQL injection vulnerabilities in code using `text()`.

## Threat: [SQL Injection via Dynamic Query Fragment Construction](./threats/sql_injection_via_dynamic_query_fragment_construction.md)

**Description:** Attackers manipulate user input to influence the construction of query fragments (e.g., `WHERE` clauses) dynamically. If not handled carefully, this can lead to injection vulnerabilities even when using ORM methods if raw SQL or string manipulation is involved in building conditions.

**Impact:**
*   Data Breach: Unauthorized access to sensitive data.
*   Data Manipulation: Modification or deletion of data.
*   Privilege Escalation: Gaining elevated database privileges.
*   Denial of Service: Disrupting database operations.

**SQLAlchemy Component Affected:** ORM Query construction, potentially involving string manipulation or conditional logic based on user input within query building.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Parameterize all user-controlled input:** Even when building query fragments, ensure user input is parameterized and not directly concatenated into SQL strings.
*   **Use ORM methods for filtering and conditions:** Leverage ORM methods like `filter_by()`, `filter()`, and relationship queries to construct conditions in a safe manner.
*   **Avoid string-based query construction:** Minimize or eliminate the use of string concatenation or formatting to build query fragments based on user input.
*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Validate and sanitize user input before using it to influence query construction logic.

## Threat: [Database Connection String Exposure in Code/Configuration](./threats/database_connection_string_exposure_in_codeconfiguration.md)

**Description:** Database connection strings, containing sensitive credentials, are hardcoded in application code, configuration files committed to version control, or stored insecurely. Attackers gaining access to these locations can extract the credentials.

**Impact:**
*   Full Database Compromise: Attackers gain direct access to the database, bypassing application security and potentially leading to data breaches, manipulation, and denial of service.

**SQLAlchemy Component Affected:** Configuration of SQLAlchemy Engine (`create_engine()`), where the connection string is provided.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Never hardcode connection strings:** Avoid embedding connection strings directly in code or configuration files.
*   **Use Environment Variables:** Store connection strings in environment variables, accessed at runtime.
*   **Secure Configuration Management:** Utilize dedicated secret management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to store and manage connection strings.
*   **Restrict Access to Configuration Files:** Ensure configuration files are only accessible to authorized personnel and processes.
*   **Encrypt Connection Strings at Rest (if applicable):** Consider encrypting connection strings in configuration files.
