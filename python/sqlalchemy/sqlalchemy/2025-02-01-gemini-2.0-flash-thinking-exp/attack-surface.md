# Attack Surface Analysis for sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy

## Attack Surface: [Raw SQL Injection via `text()`](./attack_surfaces/raw_sql_injection_via__text___.md)

Description:  Executing raw SQL queries using `text()` or similar functions without proper input sanitization allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

*   **SQLAlchemy Contribution:** SQLAlchemy's flexibility allows raw SQL execution via `text()`, which bypasses ORM's built-in protection if used without parameterization.
*   **Example:**
    *   **Vulnerable Code:** `query = text("SELECT * FROM items WHERE item_name = '" + request.args.get('item_name') + "'")`
    *   **Attack:** An attacker provides an `item_name` like `' OR 1=1 --` leading to `SELECT * FROM items WHERE item_name = '' OR 1=1 --`, bypassing intended filtering and potentially exposing all items.
*   **Impact:** Data Breach, Data Modification, Account Takeover, Denial of Service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Parameterized Queries with `text()`:**  Always use parameterized queries when using `text()`: `text("SELECT * FROM items WHERE item_name = :item_name")`. Pass parameters as a dictionary to `execute()`: `session.execute(query, {"item_name": request.args.get('item_name')}).
    *   **Avoid String Interpolation:** Never directly embed user input into raw SQL strings using string formatting or concatenation.
    *   **Prefer ORM Querying:** Utilize SQLAlchemy's ORM query building methods as much as possible, as they inherently handle parameterization and reduce the risk of SQL injection in common scenarios.

## Attack Surface: [`literal_column` and Unsafe Dynamic Column Selection](./attack_surfaces/_literal_column__and_unsafe_dynamic_column_selection.md)

Description: Misusing functions like `literal_column` with unsanitized user input enables attackers to inject arbitrary SQL fragments, including column names or functions, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

*   **SQLAlchemy Contribution:** SQLAlchemy provides `literal_column` for advanced use cases, but its misuse with user-provided input becomes a direct injection point.
*   **Example:**
    *   **Vulnerable Code:** `sort_column = request.args.get('sort_by')` ; `query = select(Product).order_by(literal_column(sort_column))`
    *   **Attack:** An attacker provides `sort_by` as `CASE WHEN admin=1 THEN price ELSE name END --`. This injects a conditional expression into the `ORDER BY` clause, potentially revealing sensitive information based on sorting order or causing database errors.
*   **Impact:** Information Disclosure, Data Manipulation, Denial of Service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation and Whitelisting:**  If dynamic column selection is absolutely necessary, strictly validate and whitelist allowed column names or SQL fragments.
    *   **Mapping to Safe Options:** Map user-provided choices to a predefined set of safe column names or query components within the application code.
    *   **Avoid `literal_column` with User Input:** Refactor code to avoid using `literal_column` or similar functions with direct user-controlled input. Explore safer ORM-based dynamic query approaches.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Custom SQL Functions/Extensions](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_custom_sql_functionsextensions.md)

Description:  If custom SQL functions or database extensions integrated with SQLAlchemy contain vulnerabilities, they can be exploited through SQLAlchemy queries.

*   **SQLAlchemy Contribution:** SQLAlchemy's ability to integrate with custom SQL functions means it can inadvertently expose vulnerabilities present in those custom components.
*   **Example:**
    *   **Scenario:** A custom PostgreSQL function used for full-text search has a SQL injection vulnerability. This function is called within SQLAlchemy queries.
    *   **Attack:** An attacker crafts input to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability within the custom function when it's executed via SQLAlchemy, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or modification.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution on Database Server (if the custom function vulnerability allows), Data Breach, Data Manipulation, Denial of Service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (depending on the vulnerability in the custom function)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rigorous Security Audits:** Conduct thorough security audits and penetration testing of all custom SQL functions and database extensions.
    *   **Secure Development Lifecycle:** Implement a secure development lifecycle for custom SQL functions, including code reviews and security testing.
    *   **Regular Updates and Patching:** Keep custom functions and extensions updated with security patches and monitor for security advisories.
    *   **Minimize Custom Code Usage:**  Reduce the reliance on custom SQL functions where possible. Explore if standard SQLAlchemy or database features can achieve the desired functionality securely.
