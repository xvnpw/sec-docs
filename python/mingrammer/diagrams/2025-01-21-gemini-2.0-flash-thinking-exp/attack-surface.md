# Attack Surface Analysis for mingrammer/diagrams

## Attack Surface: [Code Injection via Diagram Definition](./attack_surfaces/code_injection_via_diagram_definition.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious user injects arbitrary code into the diagram definition, which is then executed by the Python interpreter when the `diagrams` library processes it.
    *   **How Diagrams Contributes:** The `diagrams` library interprets Python code to create diagrams. If user-provided data is directly incorporated into this code, it can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** An application allows users to name nodes. A malicious user enters `"; import os; os.system('evil_command');"` as the node name. If this is directly used in the `diagrams` code, the command will be executed.
    *   **Impact:** Full system compromise, data breach, denial of service, or any other action the injected code can perform.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never directly incorporate user input into the Python code used to define diagrams.**
        *   Use parameterized approaches or templating engines that prevent direct code injection.
        *   Sanitize and validate all user input rigorously before using it in diagram definitions.
        *   Implement strict input validation to ensure data conforms to expected formats.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion through Complex Diagrams](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_through_complex_diagrams.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious user crafts an extremely complex diagram definition that consumes excessive server resources (CPU, memory) during rendering, leading to a denial of service.
    *   **How Diagrams Contributes:** The `diagrams` library needs to process the diagram definition and render it. Highly complex diagrams require significant computational resources.
    *   **Example:** A user submits a diagram definition with thousands of interconnected nodes and edges, causing the server to become unresponsive while trying to render it.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, application slowdown, increased infrastructure costs.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement limits on the complexity of diagrams (e.g., maximum number of nodes, edges).
        *   Use timeouts for diagram rendering processes.
        *   Implement resource monitoring and alerting to detect and respond to excessive resource usage.
        *   Consider asynchronous processing of diagram generation to avoid blocking the main application thread.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via SVG Output](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_svg_output.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious JavaScript code is injected into the diagram definition and rendered into the SVG output. When a user views this SVG in their browser, the script executes.
    *   **How Diagrams Contributes:** The `diagrams` library can generate diagrams in SVG format, which allows embedding of JavaScript. If user-controlled data is included in the SVG without proper sanitization, XSS is possible.
    *   **Example:** A user includes `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` in a node label. When the application serves the generated SVG, this script executes in the viewer's browser.
    *   **Impact:** Session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Sanitize all user-provided data that is included in the SVG output.** Remove or escape potentially malicious HTML tags and JavaScript.
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of XSS.
        *   Avoid directly serving user-generated SVG files from the application's main domain. Consider using a separate, isolated domain.
