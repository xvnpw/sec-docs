## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via diagrams](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_diagrams.md)

**Description:** Attackers target the way the application processes user input used to create diagram definitions. If not properly sanitized, this input can be manipulated to inject malicious code or cause other harm.
* **Critical Node: Malicious Diagram Definition Injection:**
    * **Description:** The attacker's ability to inject arbitrary or malicious content into the diagram definition code. This is a critical point as it allows for various subsequent attacks.
* **High-Risk Path: Inject Malicious Code/Commands via Diagram Attributes:**
    * **Description:** Attackers focus on injecting malicious code or commands through diagram attributes like labels, filenames, or other configurable properties.
    * **Critical Node: Exploit Unsafe String Interpolation/Templating:**
        * **Description:** If the application uses string interpolation or templating to build diagram definitions without proper sanitization, attackers can inject code that gets executed when the `diagrams` library processes the input.
        * **Example:** If a user-provided name is directly inserted into a diagram label without escaping, it could lead to command injection if the underlying rendering process is vulnerable.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Output Generation Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_output_generation_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

**Description:** Attackers target the process of generating output files (e.g., images) from the diagram definitions. Vulnerabilities here can lead to system compromise or other security issues.
* **Critical Node: Path Traversal/Overwrite (If application allows specifying output path):**
    * **Description:** If the application allows users to specify the output file path without proper sanitization, an attacker can use path traversal techniques (e.g., `../../../../important_file.txt`) to overwrite critical system files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

**Description:** Attackers target known vulnerabilities in the libraries that `diagrams` depends on. Exploiting these vulnerabilities can have significant consequences.
* **Critical Node: Leverage Vulnerabilities in `diagrams`' Dependencies:**
    * **Description:**  `diagrams` relies on other libraries. If these dependencies have known vulnerabilities, an attacker can potentially exploit them through the application's use of `diagrams`.
    * **Example:** A vulnerability in an image processing library used by `diagrams` could be exploited to achieve remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfiguration/Improper Usage](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfigurationimproper_usage.md)

**Description:** This involves vulnerabilities arising from how developers use the `diagrams` library, often due to oversights or lack of awareness of security implications.
* **High-Risk Path: Expose Sensitive Information in Diagrams:**
    * **Description:** Developers might inadvertently include sensitive information directly in the diagram definitions (e.g., hardcoding API keys in node labels). If these diagrams are exposed, this information could be leaked.
