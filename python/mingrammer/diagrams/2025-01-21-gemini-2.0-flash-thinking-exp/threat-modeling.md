# Threat Model Analysis for mingrammer/diagrams

## Threat: [Code Injection via Diagram Definition](./threats/code_injection_via_diagram_definition.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker crafts malicious input that is used to dynamically construct the diagram definition code (Python code using the `diagrams` library). This could involve injecting arbitrary Python code into node labels, attributes, or other parts of the diagram definition. When the application executes this code *using the `diagrams` library to render the diagram*, the injected malicious code is also executed.
    *   **How:** The attacker might exploit a lack of input sanitization or validation in the application where user-provided data is directly incorporated into the diagram definition string or data structures that are then processed by the `diagrams` library.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Arbitrary code execution on the server or within the diagram generation environment.
        *   Potential for data breaches by accessing sensitive information.
        *   System compromise, allowing the attacker to gain control of the server.
        *   Denial of service by crashing the application or consuming excessive resources.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `diagrams` Library - Diagram Definition Parsing (the part of the library that interprets and executes the Python code defining the diagram).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Sanitization:** Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user-provided input *before* incorporating it into the diagram definition that will be used by the `diagrams` library. Use allow-lists and escape potentially harmful characters.
        *   **Avoid Dynamic Code Generation:** Minimize or avoid dynamically generating diagram definition code based on user input that will be directly processed by the `diagrams` library. If necessary, use safer alternatives like templating engines with strict escaping.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the diagram generation process that utilizes the `diagrams` library with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of successful code injection.
        *   **Code Review:** Regularly review the code that handles diagram definition generation for potential injection vulnerabilities, especially where it interacts with the `diagrams` library.

## Threat: [Server-Side Resource Exhaustion (DoS)](./threats/server-side_resource_exhaustion__dos_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker provides diagram definitions that are intentionally designed to be extremely complex or resource-intensive for the `diagrams` library to render. This could involve a massive number of nodes and edges, intricate relationships, or the use of computationally expensive rendering options supported by the library.
    *   **How:** The attacker submits crafted diagram definitions through the application's interface or API, which are then processed by the `diagrams` library.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Denial of service, making the application unresponsive or unavailable to legitimate users.
        *   Excessive consumption of server resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) by the `diagrams` library's rendering process, potentially impacting other applications running on the same server.
        *   Increased infrastructure costs due to high resource utilization.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `diagrams` Library - Diagram Rendering Engine (the part of the `diagrams` library or its dependencies that generates the visual representation of the diagram).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation and Limits:** Implement limits on the complexity of diagrams that can be generated *using the `diagrams` library* (e.g., maximum number of nodes, edges).
        *   **Resource Monitoring and Throttling:** Monitor server resource usage and implement throttling mechanisms to prevent a single user or request from causing the `diagrams` library to consume excessive resources.
        *   **Asynchronous Processing:** Process diagram generation *using the `diagrams` library* asynchronously to avoid blocking the main application thread.
        *   **Timeouts:** Set timeouts for diagram generation requests that utilize the `diagrams` library to prevent indefinite resource consumption.

## Threat: [Path Traversal during Image Saving](./threats/path_traversal_during_image_saving.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker manipulates the output file path used when saving the generated diagram image *by the `diagrams` library* to write the file to an arbitrary location on the server's file system.
    *   **How:** This could occur if the application allows users to specify the output file path without proper validation or sanitization, and this path is then directly used by the `diagrams` library's saving functionality.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Overwriting critical system files, potentially leading to system instability or compromise.
        *   Writing malicious files to accessible locations, which could be executed later.
        *   Gaining unauthorized access to sensitive files on the server.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `diagrams` Library - Output File Path Handling (the part of the library that determines where the generated image is saved).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Restrict Output Paths:** Do not allow users to directly specify the output file path that will be used by the `diagrams` library. Instead, use a predefined set of allowed directories.
        *   **Path Sanitization:** If user-provided input is used to construct the output path that will be passed to the `diagrams` library, rigorously sanitize it to prevent path traversal attempts (e.g., removing ".." sequences).
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the process saving the diagram *via the `diagrams` library* has only the necessary permissions to write to the intended output directory.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attacks on the `diagrams` Library](./threats/supply_chain_attacks_on_the__diagrams__library.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker compromises the `diagrams` library itself, either by injecting malicious code into the official repository or by distributing a compromised version of the package.
    *   **How:** This could involve compromising developer accounts, exploiting vulnerabilities in the packaging process, or typosquatting (creating a similar-sounding but malicious package).
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Applications using the compromised `diagrams` library could be vulnerable to various attacks, including remote code execution, data exfiltration, or backdoors *when the library's code is executed*.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   The `diagrams` Library Package itself.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Verify Package Integrity:** Use package management tools to verify the integrity of the `diagrams` package using checksums or signatures.
        *   **Use Trusted Repositories:** Obtain the `diagrams` library from trusted sources like the official PyPI repository.
        *   **Dependency Pinning:** Pin the exact versions of dependencies, including `diagrams`, in your project's requirements file to avoid automatically installing potentially compromised newer versions.
        *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Use SCA tools to monitor dependencies, including `diagrams`, for known vulnerabilities and potential supply chain risks.
