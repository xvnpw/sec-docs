## Attack Tree Path: [1. Execute Arbitrary Code (Primary Goal)](./attack_tree_paths/1__execute_arbitrary_code__primary_goal_.md)

**1a. Input Validation Vulnerabilities (Diagram Definition) [Critical Node]:**
    *   **Description:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input used to define the structure of the diagram (e.g., node names, connections, labels). This is the most direct and likely path to code execution.
    *   **Attack Scenario:**
        *   An attacker provides a crafted node label containing Python code. For example, if the application uses string formatting unsafely: `f"Node('{user_input}')"`. If `user_input` is `'); import os; os.system('rm -rf /'); print('` , this could lead to disastrous consequences.
        *   Another example: using backticks within a node label if the application doesn't escape them properly: `Node('`whoami`')`.  
        *   Exploiting any form of template injection if the application uses a templating engine to generate the diagram definition and doesn't properly escape user input.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (if input validation is weak or absent) / Medium (if some basic validation exists)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (full server compromise, data loss, system destruction)
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (depends on the complexity of the input validation bypass; simple string injection is low effort)
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (requires understanding of Python, web application vulnerabilities, and potentially string formatting/template injection techniques)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (might be detected by intrusion detection systems or code analysis, but can be obfuscated; well-crafted attacks might bypass simple filters)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Strict Whitelisting:** Allow only a predefined set of characters and patterns for all input fields. Reject anything that doesn't match.
        *   **Length Limits:** Enforce strict length limits on all input fields.
        *   **Context-Aware Validation:** Validate the data type of each input field (e.g., integer, string, specific format).
        *   **Avoid String Concatenation/Interpolation:** *Never* build the diagram definition by directly concatenating user input with Python code. Use the `diagrams` library's API methods (`Node()`, `Edge()`, etc.) to construct the diagram programmatically. This is *crucially* important.
        *   **Input Sanitization Libraries:** Use libraries like `bleach` (Python) to sanitize input and remove or escape potentially harmful characters.
        *   **Regular Expression Validation:** Use regular expressions to enforce strict input formats.
        *   **Templating Engine (with Auto-Escaping):** If using a templating engine, ensure it automatically escapes user input to prevent injection vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [1b. Input Validation Vulnerabilities (Diagram Attributes/Options) [Critical Node]:](./attack_tree_paths/1b__input_validation_vulnerabilities__diagram_attributesoptions___critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** Similar to 1a, but the vulnerability lies in the handling of user-controlled attributes or options passed to the `diagrams` library (e.g., `graph_attr`, `node_attr`, `edge_attr`). If these are not validated, they can be a vector for code injection.
    *   **Attack Scenario:**
        *   The application allows users to specify node colors or styles through a web form. An attacker injects malicious code into the color attribute, hoping it will be executed when the diagram is rendered.
        *   If the application uses user input to construct the `graph_attr` dictionary directly, an attacker could inject arbitrary attributes that might be interpreted as code by the underlying rendering engine.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (less common than direct code injection in the definition, but still a significant risk)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (full server compromise)
    *   **Effort:** Medium (requires understanding of the `diagrams` API and how attributes are processed)
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced (requires a deeper understanding of how `diagrams` interacts with the rendering engine)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (similar to 1a; requires careful analysis of how attributes are handled)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Apply *all* the same mitigation techniques as described for 1a (whitelisting, length limits, context-aware validation, avoiding string concatenation, sanitization libraries, regular expressions, secure templating).
        *   **Specific Attribute Validation:** Implement specific validation rules for each attribute, based on its expected data type and format. For example, a color attribute should be validated against a list of allowed colors or a specific color format (e.g., hex code).
        *   **Limit Attribute Control:** Restrict the range of attributes that users can control. Avoid allowing users to set arbitrary attributes.
