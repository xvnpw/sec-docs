# Attack Surface Analysis for mingrammer/diagrams

## Attack Surface: [Diagram Definition as Code Injection](./attack_surfaces/diagram_definition_as_code_injection.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Diagram Definition as Code Injection
    *   **Description:**  The `diagrams` library uses Python code to define diagrams. If an application allows user input or external data to directly influence this code, it can lead to the execution of arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **How Diagrams Contributes:**  The core functionality of `diagrams` relies on interpreting and executing Python code provided to it. If this code is not carefully controlled, it becomes an entry point for malicious code.
    *   **Example:** An application takes a user-provided string as a node label and directly embeds it into the `diagrams` code. An attacker could input `"); import os; os.system('rm -rf /'); print("` as the label, leading to command execution.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the server, data breaches, denial of service, and other malicious activities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Never directly embed user input into diagram definition code. Treat all external data with suspicion.
        *   Use parameterized diagram definitions or a more abstract representation of the diagram structure. This separates the data from the code.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization. Filter out potentially harmful characters or code constructs.
        *   Run diagram generation in a sandboxed environment or with limited privileges. This restricts the impact of any successful code injection.

## Attack Surface: [SVG Output and Script Injection (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS)](./attack_surfaces/svg_output_and_script_injection__cross-site_scripting_-_xss_.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** SVG Output and Script Injection (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS)
    *   **Description:** If the application generates SVG diagrams using `diagrams` and displays them in a web browser without proper sanitization, malicious JavaScript can be embedded within the SVG, leading to XSS attacks.
    *   **How Diagrams Contributes:** `diagrams` can generate SVG output, which is a vector for XSS if not handled carefully. The library itself doesn't inherently sanitize SVG output for script injection.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a diagram definition where a node label includes `<svg onload=alert('XSS')>`. When this SVG is rendered in a browser, the JavaScript will execute.
    *   **Impact:**  Stealing user session cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, defacing the application, and other client-side attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize SVG output before displaying it in a web browser. Use a dedicated SVG sanitization library to remove potentially harmful elements and attributes.
        *   Set appropriate Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict the execution of inline scripts and other potentially dangerous content.
        *   Avoid displaying user-generated content directly as SVG. If possible, render the diagram on the server-side and serve it as a raster image (PNG, JPEG).
