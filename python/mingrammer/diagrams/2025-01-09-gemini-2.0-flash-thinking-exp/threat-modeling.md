# Threat Model Analysis for mingrammer/diagrams

## Threat: [Code Injection via Diagram Definition](./threats/code_injection_via_diagram_definition.md)

* **Threat:** Code Injection via Diagram Definition
    * **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious code into the diagram definition (e.g., node labels, attributes) if this definition is constructed using unsanitized user input or data from untrusted sources. This injected code could be Python code that gets executed by the `diagrams` library during processing.
    * **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server hosting the application. This could lead to data breaches, system compromise, denial of service, or further attacks on internal infrastructure.
    * **Affected Component:**  `diagrams` core functionality, specifically the modules responsible for parsing and processing diagram definitions (e.g., node and edge creation, attribute handling).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Sanitize and validate all user-provided input used to construct diagram definitions.
        * Avoid directly embedding user input into code that defines diagram elements. Use parameterized approaches or safe templating mechanisms.
        * Implement strict input validation rules based on expected data types and formats.
        * Consider using a sandboxed environment for diagram generation if user-provided definitions are unavoidable.

## Threat: [Command Injection via Rendering Engines](./threats/command_injection_via_rendering_engines.md)

* **Threat:** Command Injection via Rendering Engines
    * **Description:** The `diagrams` library often uses external rendering engines like Graphviz's `dot`. If the input passed to these engines (derived from the diagram definition within `diagrams`) is not properly sanitized *by the `diagrams` library*, an attacker could inject shell commands that get executed by the operating system when the rendering engine is invoked.
    * **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on the server. This could lead to system compromise, data exfiltration, or denial of service.
    * **Affected Component:** `diagrams` integration with rendering engines (e.g., functions within `diagrams` that construct command-line arguments for `dot` or other renderers).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Ensure the `diagrams` library is updated to the latest version to benefit from any security patches.
        * Carefully review the library's documentation on how it interacts with rendering engines.
        * Avoid constructing command-line arguments for rendering engines directly from user input within the application's code that uses `diagrams`. Rely on `diagrams` to handle this securely.
        * If possible, use safer methods for interacting with rendering engines (e.g., using libraries that provide a more controlled interface), if `diagrams` offers such options.
        * Run rendering engines with the least privileges necessary.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Resource Exhaustion (Complex Diagrams)](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__through_resource_exhaustion__complex_diagrams_.md)

* **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) through Resource Exhaustion (Complex Diagrams)
    * **Description:** An attacker could provide or generate diagram definitions that are excessively complex (e.g., a very large number of nodes and edges) which the `diagrams` library attempts to process and render. This can consume significant server resources (CPU, memory), potentially leading to a denial of service for other users or the application itself.
    * **Impact:** Application unavailability or significant performance degradation, impacting legitimate users.
    * **Affected Component:** `diagrams` core functionality, particularly the rendering process and how `diagrams` interacts with the underlying rendering engine for complex diagrams.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement limits on the complexity (number of nodes, edges) of diagrams that can be generated and processed by the application using `diagrams`.
        * Set timeouts for diagram rendering processes initiated by `diagrams`.
        * Monitor server resource usage during diagram generation triggered by `diagrams` and implement alerts for excessive consumption.
        * Consider using asynchronous processing for diagram generation initiated via `diagrams` to prevent blocking the main application thread.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure through Diagram Content](./threats/information_disclosure_through_diagram_content.md)

* **Threat:** Information Disclosure through Diagram Content
    * **Description:** If the diagram definitions processed by `diagrams` or the generated diagram images contain sensitive information (e.g., internal network topology, server names, API keys, personally identifiable information), and the `diagrams` library does not offer sufficient mechanisms to prevent this or the application doesn't handle the output securely, unauthorized access to these diagrams could lead to information disclosure.
    * **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, potentially leading to further attacks, compliance violations, or reputational damage.
    * **Affected Component:** The entire `diagrams` workflow, from definition processing to rendering and the application's handling of the output. The direct involvement of `diagrams` is in processing the definition and generating the output.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Carefully review the content of diagrams before using `diagrams` to generate them to ensure they do not inadvertently reveal sensitive information.
        * Implement access controls at the application level to restrict who can view or download generated diagrams.
        * Encrypt stored diagram images if they contain sensitive data.
        * Consider using watermarks or other techniques to identify the source and intended audience of diagrams.

## Threat: [Path Traversal during Image Storage](./threats/path_traversal_during_image_storage.md)

* **Threat:** Path Traversal during Image Storage
    * **Description:** If the application allows users to indirectly influence the output path for generated diagrams through parameters passed to `diagrams` functions, and `diagrams` itself doesn't sufficiently sanitize these paths, an attacker could potentially use path traversal techniques (e.g., using `..` in the path) to write the image to an unintended location on the server's file system. This assumes the application passes user-influenced data to `diagrams` for output path handling.
    * **Impact:** Overwriting critical system files, exposing sensitive information stored in other directories, or potentially achieving code execution if the attacker can overwrite executable files.
    * **Affected Component:** Functions within `diagrams` responsible for saving the generated diagram image to disk, specifically if they handle user-provided or influenced output paths.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid allowing user input to directly determine the output path used by `diagrams`.
        * If user input influences the output path, ensure the application sanitizes and validates it *before* passing it to `diagrams`.
        * Use a predefined and restricted directory for storing generated diagrams, preventing users from specifying arbitrary paths through `diagrams`.
        * Implement proper file system permissions to restrict write access to only the intended directories.
