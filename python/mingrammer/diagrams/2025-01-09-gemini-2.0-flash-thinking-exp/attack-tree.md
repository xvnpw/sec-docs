## Attack Tree Path: [Craft Malicious DSL Input (Code Injection)](./attack_tree_paths/craft_malicious_dsl_input__code_injection_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Craft Malicious DSL Input
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input for the `diagrams` library's DSL (Domain Specific Language) with the intention of executing arbitrary code on the server. This is a critical entry point for code injection.
    *   **Critical Node Justification:** This node is critical because it's the initial step in exploiting code injection vulnerabilities and also serves as an entry point for other attacks like SSRF and DoS.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Unsafe `eval()` or similar constructs](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_unsafe__eval____or_similar_constructs.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploit Unsafe `eval()` or similar constructs (if used internally by diagrams for dynamic behavior)
    *   **Description:** If the `diagrams` library uses functions like `eval()` or similar mechanisms to dynamically execute parts of the DSL, an attacker can inject malicious Python code that will be executed by the server.
    *   **Critical Node Justification:** This is a direct and high-impact vulnerability. Successful exploitation leads to immediate arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit vulnerabilities in DSL parsing logic](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_dsl_parsing_logic.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploit vulnerabilities in DSL parsing logic
    *   **Description:** Attackers exploit flaws in how the `diagrams` library parses the DSL. By providing specially crafted input that the parser doesn't handle correctly, they can potentially inject and execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Critical Node Justification:** This is another direct route to code execution. The complexity of parsing logic often introduces vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Python Code](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_python_code.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Execute Arbitrary Python Code
    *   **Description:** The attacker successfully executes arbitrary Python code on the server hosting the application. This gives them full control over the server and the application.
    *   **Critical Node Justification:** This is the ultimate goal of the high-risk code injection path and represents the most severe impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit path traversal vulnerabilities in file handling](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_path_traversal_vulnerabilities_in_file_handling.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploit path traversal vulnerabilities in file handling within diagrams (e.g., loading custom icons, fonts)
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious DSL input that exploits the way the `diagrams` library handles file paths, potentially allowing access to sensitive files or even overwriting them.
    *   **Critical Node Justification:** While not leading to immediate code execution, it allows access to sensitive information and can be a stepping stone for further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft Malicious DSL Input (SSRF)](./attack_tree_paths/craft_malicious_dsl_input__ssrf_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Craft Malicious DSL Input (leading to SSRF)
    *   **Description:** The attacker crafts malicious DSL input to force the server to make requests to unintended internal or external resources.
    *   **Critical Node Justification:** This is the entry point for SSRF attacks, which can lead to information disclosure or further exploitation of internal systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit features allowing inclusion of remote resources](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_features_allowing_inclusion_of_remote_resources.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploit features allowing inclusion of remote resources (e.g., fetching icons from URLs)
    *   **Description:** Attackers leverage features that allow including external resources via URLs to trigger Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities.
    *   **Critical Node Justification:** This is the specific mechanism enabling SSRF, making it a critical point for implementing security controls.

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft Malicious DSL Input (Resource Exhaustion)](./attack_tree_paths/craft_malicious_dsl_input__resource_exhaustion_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Craft Malicious DSL Input (leading to Resource Exhaustion)
    *   **Description:** Attackers craft DSL input designed to consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory), leading to a Denial of Service.
    *   **Critical Node Justification:** While the impact is generally lower than code execution, the ease of execution makes this a critical entry point for DoS attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft Malicious DSL Input (Crashing)](./attack_tree_paths/craft_malicious_dsl_input__crashing_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Craft Malicious DSL Input (leading to Crashing)
    *   **Description:** Attackers provide malformed or unexpected DSL input that triggers unhandled exceptions or errors, causing the application to crash.
    *   **Critical Node Justification:** Similar to resource exhaustion, the input stage for causing crashes is a critical point for implementing input validation and error handling.
