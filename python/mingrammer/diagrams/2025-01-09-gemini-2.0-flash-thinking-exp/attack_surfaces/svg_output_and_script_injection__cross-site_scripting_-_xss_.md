**To:** Development Team

**From:** Cybersecurity Expert

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Introduction:**

This document provides a deep analysis of the identified attack surface: **SVG Output and Script Injection (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS)** within applications utilizing the `diagrams` library (https://github.com/mingrammer/diagrams). We will delve into the technical details, potential attack vectors, impact, and provide comprehensive mitigation strategies.

**1. Understanding the Vulnerability: SVG and Executable Content**

Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation. This inherent capability to include interactive elements, including scripting, is the core of the vulnerability. While beneficial for dynamic graphics, it also opens a significant security risk if not handled carefully.

**Key Points about SVG and Scripting:**

* **XML Structure:** SVG files are essentially XML documents. This allows for embedding various elements, including `<script>` tags and event handlers (e.g., `onload`, `onclick`).
* **Browser Execution:** Modern web browsers are designed to parse and render SVG content, including executing JavaScript embedded within it. This execution occurs within the security context of the website displaying the SVG, meaning the script has access to cookies, local storage, and other browser data associated with that domain.
* **`diagrams` Library Role:** The `diagrams` library is a powerful tool for programmatically generating diagrams as code. It outputs these diagrams in various formats, including SVG. While the library itself is not inherently insecure, its ability to generate SVG output directly contributes to this attack surface if the generated SVG is not properly sanitized before being displayed in a web browser.

**2. Detailed Attack Vectors and Scenarios:**

The primary attack vector revolves around injecting malicious JavaScript code into the SVG output generated by `diagrams`. This injection can occur in various parts of the SVG structure:

* **Node Labels and Text Elements:**  As highlighted in the initial description, injecting script within text elements like node labels is a common and easily exploitable vector.
    * **Example:**  `Node("User", label='<svg onload=alert("XSS")>')`
* **Tooltips and Title Attributes:** SVG elements can have `title` attributes that are often displayed as tooltips. Malicious scripts can be injected here.
    * **Example:** `<rect title='<svg onload=alert("XSS")>'>`
* **Event Handlers in SVG Elements:**  SVG elements support various event handlers that can trigger JavaScript execution.
    * **Example:** `<rect onclick='alert("XSS")'>`
* **External References (Less Likely with `diagrams` Directly, but Possible in Extensions):** While less direct with the core `diagrams` library, if extensions or custom code are used to incorporate external SVG elements, these could contain malicious scripts.

**Scenario Breakdown:**

1. **Attacker Identifies Input:** The attacker identifies a point in the application where user input (directly or indirectly) influences the generation of a diagram using `diagrams`. This could be:
    * User-provided names for nodes or edges.
    * Data used to populate diagram elements.
    * Configuration settings that affect the diagram's appearance.

2. **Crafted Malicious Input:** The attacker crafts input containing malicious SVG code. This code will typically include JavaScript designed to perform harmful actions.

3. **`diagrams` Generates SVG:** The application uses the attacker's input to generate an SVG diagram using the `diagrams` library. Without proper sanitization, the malicious script is embedded within the SVG output.

4. **Vulnerable Display Mechanism:** The application displays the generated SVG in a web browser without sanitizing it. This could be through:
    * Directly embedding the SVG code in the HTML.
    * Serving the SVG file with a content type that allows browser execution (e.g., `image/svg+xml`).

5. **Script Execution:** When the browser renders the SVG, it encounters the malicious script and executes it within the context of the application's domain.

**3. Impact Assessment (Detailed):**

A successful XSS attack via malicious SVG can have severe consequences:

* **Session Hijacking:** The attacker can steal session cookies, allowing them to impersonate the logged-in user and gain unauthorized access to their account and data.
* **Credential Theft:**  Malicious scripts can inject fake login forms or redirect users to phishing pages to steal usernames and passwords.
* **Data Exfiltration:** Sensitive data displayed on the page or accessible through the user's session can be extracted and sent to the attacker's server.
* **Account Compromise:** By gaining access to a user's account, the attacker can modify data, perform actions on their behalf, or even delete the account.
* **Defacement:** The attacker can alter the appearance of the web page, displaying malicious content or propaganda.
* **Redirection to Malicious Sites:** Users can be redirected to websites hosting malware or other harmful content.
* **Keylogging and Form Grabbing:**  Malicious scripts can monitor user keystrokes and capture data entered into forms, including sensitive information like credit card details.
* **Denial of Service (Client-Side):**  Resource-intensive scripts can be injected to overload the user's browser, causing it to freeze or crash.
* **Propagation of Attacks:** If the application allows users to share or embed these malicious SVGs, the attack can spread to other users.

**4. Mitigation Strategies (In-Depth):**

Implementing a multi-layered approach is crucial for effectively mitigating this risk.

* **Server-Side SVG Sanitization:** This is the **most critical** mitigation strategy.
    * **Dedicated Sanitization Libraries:** Utilize well-established and actively maintained SVG sanitization libraries. Examples include:
        * **DOMPurify (JavaScript, but can be used server-side with Node.js):**  Highly recommended for its robust sanitization capabilities and wide adoption.
        * **Bleach (Python):** A popular Python library for sanitizing HTML and SVG.
        * **Sanitize-html (Node.js):** Another Node.js option for HTML and SVG sanitization.
    * **How it Works:** These libraries parse the SVG content and remove or neutralize potentially harmful elements and attributes, such as `<script>` tags, event handlers, and `javascript:` URLs.
    * **Implementation:** Integrate the sanitization library into the server-side code that processes and serves the generated SVG. Sanitize the SVG *before* sending it to the client's browser.

* **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  CSP is a browser security mechanism that allows you to define a whitelist of sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources.
    * **How it Helps:**  By configuring CSP headers, you can restrict the execution of inline scripts and event handlers within the SVG.
    * **Example CSP Header:** `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'none'; object-src 'none';`
        * `default-src 'self'`:  Allows resources only from the same origin.
        * `script-src 'none'`:  Disables the execution of inline scripts and scripts loaded from external sources.
        * `object-src 'none'`:  Prevents the loading of plugins like Flash.
    * **Implementation:** Configure your web server to send appropriate CSP headers with responses that include the SVG content.

* **Input Validation and Encoding:** While not a complete solution on its own, rigorous input validation and encoding can help prevent malicious scripts from ever reaching the SVG generation stage.
    * **Validation:**  Validate all user inputs that influence the diagram generation, ensuring they adhere to expected formats and do not contain potentially malicious characters or patterns.
    * **Encoding:**  Encode user-provided data before incorporating it into the SVG. For example, HTML-encode special characters like `<`, `>`, and `"` to prevent them from being interpreted as part of HTML or SVG tags.

* **Consider Server-Side Rendering to Raster Images:** If the interactive features of SVG are not essential, consider rendering the diagram on the server-side as a raster image format like PNG or JPEG.
    * **How it Helps:** Raster images do not support embedded scripts, eliminating the XSS risk.
    * **Trade-offs:** Loss of vector scalability and potential loss of some interactive features.
    * **Implementation:** Explore libraries or services that can convert SVG to raster images on the server.

* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security assessments, including penetration testing, to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including XSS in SVG output.

* **Developer Training:**  Educate the development team about the risks of XSS and the importance of secure coding practices when handling user input and generating dynamic content like SVG.

**5. Recommendations for the Development Team:**

* **Prioritize Server-Side SVG Sanitization:** Implement a robust server-side SVG sanitization process using a dedicated library like DOMPurify or Bleach. This should be a mandatory step before displaying any generated SVG.
* **Implement and Enforce CSP:** Configure appropriate Content Security Policy headers to restrict the execution of inline scripts and other potentially dangerous content.
* **Treat All User Input as Potentially Malicious:**  Adopt a security-first mindset and rigorously validate and encode all user-provided data that influences diagram generation.
* **Evaluate the Need for SVG Interactivity:** If interactivity is not critical, consider rendering diagrams as raster images on the server-side.
* **Integrate Security Testing into the Development Lifecycle:** Include security testing, including XSS vulnerability scanning, as part of the regular development process.
* **Stay Updated on Security Best Practices:** Continuously learn about new XSS attack vectors and best practices for preventing them.

**Conclusion:**

The potential for script injection (XSS) through SVG output generated by the `diagrams` library is a significant security concern that requires immediate attention. By understanding the attack vectors and implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, we can significantly reduce the risk of exploitation and protect our application and its users. Server-side SVG sanitization is paramount and should be the primary focus of our efforts. A layered approach, combining sanitization with CSP and other security measures, will provide the most robust defense against this type of attack.
