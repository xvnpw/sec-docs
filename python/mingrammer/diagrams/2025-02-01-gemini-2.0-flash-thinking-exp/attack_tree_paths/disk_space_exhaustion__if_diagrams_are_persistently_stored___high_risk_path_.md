## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Disk Space Exhaustion

This document provides a deep analysis of the "Disk Space Exhaustion (if diagrams are persistently stored)" attack tree path, identified as a HIGH RISK PATH for an application utilizing the `mingrammer/diagrams` library. This analysis outlines the objective, scope, and methodology used, followed by a detailed examination of the attack path, its potential impact, and effective mitigation strategies.

### 1. Define Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the "Disk Space Exhaustion" attack path to:

* **Understand the Attack Vector:**  Detail how an attacker could exploit the application to exhaust disk space through diagram generation and storage.
* **Assess the Potential Impact:**  Evaluate the severity and scope of the consequences resulting from successful disk space exhaustion.
* **Evaluate Proposed Mitigations:** Analyze the effectiveness and feasibility of the suggested mitigation strategies.
* **Identify Additional Mitigation Strategies:** Explore further security measures to prevent or minimize the risk of disk space exhaustion.

### 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the "Disk Space Exhaustion (if diagrams are persistently stored)" attack path within the context of an application using `mingrammer/diagrams`. The scope includes:

* **Attack Vector Analysis:**  Detailed examination of how an attacker can repeatedly generate and store diagrams to consume disk space.
* **Impact Assessment:**  Evaluation of the consequences of disk space exhaustion on the application's functionality, availability, and data integrity.

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Disk Space Exhaustion

**Attack Tree Path:** Disk Space Exhaustion (if diagrams are persistently stored) [HIGH RISK PATH]

**Attack Vector:** Repeatedly generate and store large diagrams to fill up the server's disk space.

**Impact:** Application outage due to lack of disk space, storage issues.

**Mitigation:** Implement limits on the number and size of diagrams that can be stored. Implement automated cleanup mechanisms for old diagrams. Monitor disk space usage.

#### 4.1 Attack Vector Deep Dive: Repeated Diagram Generation and Storage

* **Exploiting Diagram Generation Functionality:** An attacker can leverage the application's diagram generation functionality, likely exposed through an API or user interface, to create diagrams.  If the application doesn't have proper input validation or rate limiting, an attacker can automate this process.
    * **Automated Scripting:** Attackers can easily write scripts to repeatedly call the diagram generation endpoint with varying parameters. This can be done programmatically without requiring manual interaction.
    * **Large Diagram Generation:**  Attackers might try to generate diagrams with a large number of nodes and edges, or complex layouts, which inherently require more storage space. They might experiment with different diagram types and configurations to maximize storage consumption.
    * **Bypassing UI Limitations:** If the user interface has some limitations on diagram size or generation frequency, attackers might directly interact with the underlying API to bypass these restrictions.

* **Persistent Storage Vulnerability:** The core vulnerability lies in the persistent storage of diagrams without adequate controls. If diagrams are stored indefinitely without limits or cleanup mechanisms, the accumulation of even moderately sized diagrams can eventually lead to disk space exhaustion.
    * **Storage Location:** Understanding where diagrams are stored is crucial. Are they stored in:
        * **File System:**  Directly on the server's file system. This is often simpler to implement initially but can be less scalable and harder to manage in the long run.
        * **Database:**  Within a database (e.g., as BLOBs). Databases can offer better management and scalability but might have their own storage limitations.
        * **Object Storage (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage):**  More scalable and cost-effective for large amounts of data, but still requires proper management and potentially cost implications if storage limits are exceeded.
    * **Lack of Storage Quotas:**  If there are no storage quotas defined at the application level or operating system level for diagram storage, the attacker can potentially consume all available disk space.

#### 4.2 Impact Assessment: Application Outage and Storage Issues

Disk space exhaustion can have severe consequences for the application and the underlying infrastructure:

* **Application Outage:**
    * **Service Disruption:**  When the disk is full, the application will likely become unresponsive or crash.  It may be unable to write new data, including temporary files, logs, or session data, leading to critical failures.
    * **Diagram Generation Failure:**  Users will be unable to generate new diagrams as the application cannot store them.
    * **Loss of Functionality:**  Other application features that rely on disk space (e.g., caching, temporary file storage) will also fail.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Effectively, the attacker achieves a Denial of Service by making the application unavailable to legitimate users.

* **Storage Issues:**
    * **Data Loss or Corruption (Indirect):** While the attack primarily targets disk space, if the system crashes due to disk exhaustion, there's a risk of data corruption or loss, especially if write operations were in progress.
    * **Performance Degradation (Preceding Outage):** As disk space dwindles, the system's performance can degrade significantly. Read and write operations become slower, impacting the overall application responsiveness even before a complete outage.
    * **Backup Failures:**  If backups rely on sufficient disk space, they might fail when the disk is full, further increasing the risk of data loss in case of other incidents.
    * **System Instability:**  Disk space exhaustion can lead to broader system instability, potentially affecting other applications or services running on the same server if resources are shared.

* **Business Impact:**
    * **Reputation Damage:** Application outages can damage the organization's reputation and erode user trust.
    * **Financial Losses:**  Downtime can lead to direct financial losses due to lost productivity, missed business opportunities, and potential SLA breaches.
    * **Recovery Costs:**  Recovering from a disk space exhaustion incident can involve time and resources for investigation, cleanup, and restoration of services.

#### 4.3 Mitigation Strategy Evaluation and Enhancements

The proposed mitigations are a good starting point, but we can elaborate and enhance them:

* **1. Implement Limits on the Number and Size of Diagrams:**
    * **Granularity of Limits:**
        * **User-based limits:**  Limit the number and total size of diagrams per user account. This prevents a single compromised or malicious account from exhausting all resources.
        * **Organization-based limits:** If the application supports organizations or teams, implement limits per organization.
        * **Global limits:**  Set overall limits for the entire application to prevent extreme scenarios.
    * **Types of Limits:**
        * **Maximum Number of Diagrams:**  Restrict the total number of diagrams a user/organization can store.
        * **Maximum Diagram Size:**  Limit the file size of individual diagrams. This can be challenging to enforce perfectly as diagram size depends on complexity, but reasonable limits can be set based on typical diagram sizes.
        * **Total Storage Quota:**  Allocate a specific amount of disk space per user/organization for diagram storage. This is often the most effective approach.
    * **Enforcement Mechanisms:**
        * **During Diagram Creation:**  Check limits before allowing a new diagram to be stored. Reject the request if limits are exceeded and provide informative error messages to the user.
        * **Background Checks:**  Periodically check storage usage against limits and enforce actions (e.g., deletion, notification) if limits are exceeded.

* **2. Implement Automated Cleanup Mechanisms for Old Diagrams:**
    * **Cleanup Criteria:**
        * **Age-based cleanup:**  Delete diagrams that haven't been accessed or modified in a certain period (e.g., 3 months, 6 months).
        * **Storage-based cleanup (Least Recently Used - LRU):**  When storage limits are approached, automatically delete the least recently used diagrams to free up space.
        * **User-initiated cleanup:**  Allow users to manually delete their own diagrams or manage their storage.
    * **Cleanup Process:**
        * **Scheduled Jobs:**  Implement background jobs (e.g., cron jobs) to periodically run cleanup tasks.
        * **Soft Deletion:**  Consider "soft deletion" (marking diagrams as deleted but not immediately removing them from storage) initially, allowing for potential recovery if needed.  Hard deletion can be performed later.
        * **User Notification:**  Inform users before deleting their diagrams, especially if age-based cleanup is used. Provide options to retain diagrams if necessary.

* **3. Monitor Disk Space Usage:**
    * **Real-time Monitoring:**  Implement monitoring tools to track disk space usage on the server(s) hosting the application and diagram storage.
    * **Alerting Thresholds:**  Set up alerts to notify administrators when disk space usage reaches critical levels (e.g., 80%, 90%, 95%).
    * **Metrics to Monitor:**
        * **Disk space utilization percentage.**
        * **Free disk space (in GB or MB).**
        * **Diagram storage growth rate.**
    * **Monitoring Tools:**  Utilize system monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, Nagios, CloudWatch, Azure Monitor) or application performance monitoring (APM) solutions.

* **4. Additional Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Rate Limiting Diagram Generation:**  Implement rate limiting on the diagram generation API or UI endpoints to prevent attackers from rapidly generating a large number of diagrams in a short period.
    * **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Validate diagram parameters (e.g., number of nodes, edges, complexity) to prevent the generation of excessively large diagrams due to malicious input.
    * **Storage Quotas at Infrastructure Level:**  If using cloud storage or virtual machines, leverage infrastructure-level storage quotas and limits to provide an additional layer of protection.
    * **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Periodically conduct security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including resource exhaustion issues.
    * **Incident Response Plan:**  Develop an incident response plan to handle disk space exhaustion incidents, including steps for detection, containment, recovery, and post-incident analysis.
