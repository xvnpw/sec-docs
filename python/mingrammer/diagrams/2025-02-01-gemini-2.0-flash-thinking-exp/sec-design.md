# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, the `diagrams` Python library, aims to simplify the creation of system architecture diagrams as code. By providing a declarative way to define infrastructure and application components, it enables developers, architects, and DevOps engineers to easily visualize and document their systems.

* Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Enhance system documentation and communication through visual diagrams.
  - Increase developer productivity by providing a code-driven approach to diagram creation.
  - Facilitate collaboration and understanding of system architectures across teams.
  - Reduce the effort and time required to create and maintain up-to-date system diagrams.

* Business Risks:
  - Supply chain vulnerability: If the library is compromised, applications using it could be indirectly affected, especially if diagrams are used for security-sensitive system documentation or configuration.
  - Misrepresentation of system architecture: Bugs or inaccuracies in the library could lead to misleading diagrams, potentially causing misunderstandings or incorrect decisions about system design and security.
  - Availability risk: If the library becomes unavailable (e.g., PyPI outage, repository deletion), users might be unable to generate or update diagrams, impacting documentation workflows.

# SECURITY POSTURE

* Security Controls:
  - security control: Repository hosted on GitHub, leveraging GitHub's security features for code hosting and access control. (Implemented: GitHub)
  - security control: Open-source project, allowing for community review and contribution to identify and fix potential vulnerabilities. (Implemented: GitHub)
  - security control: Use of Python Package Index (PyPI) for distribution, relying on PyPI's infrastructure for package integrity and availability. (Implemented: PyPI)

* Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in dependencies: The library relies on third-party Python packages, which may contain security vulnerabilities.
  - accepted risk: Open-source vulnerability disclosure: Security vulnerabilities, once discovered, are publicly disclosed, potentially increasing the window of exploitation before patches are widely adopted.
  - accepted risk: Community-driven development: Security relies on the vigilance and security awareness of community contributors.

* Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated dependency scanning to identify and address vulnerabilities in third-party packages.
  - security control: Integrate Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools into the CI/CD pipeline to detect potential security flaws in the library's code.
  - security control: Implement Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation to provide transparency about the library's components and dependencies.
  - security control: Consider code signing for releases to ensure the integrity and authenticity of distributed packages.
  - security control: Establish a security policy and vulnerability disclosure process to handle security issues effectively.

* Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to the library itself, as it's a development tool. Authentication is relevant for the platforms where the library is hosted (GitHub, PyPI).
  - Authorization: Access control to the GitHub repository should be managed using GitHub's roles and permissions. Authorization is relevant for PyPI account used for publishing.
  - Input Validation: The library should validate user-provided diagram definitions to prevent unexpected behavior or errors. This is important to ensure robustness and prevent potential denial-of-service or other issues if malicious input is provided (though less of a security vulnerability in this context).
  - Cryptography: Cryptography is not a primary requirement for this library as it does not handle sensitive data directly. However, if future features involve handling credentials or sensitive information (e.g., for connecting to cloud providers to automatically generate diagrams), appropriate cryptographic measures would be necessary. For now, focus on secure handling of dependencies and build process.

# DESIGN

The `diagrams` library is designed as a Python package that provides a domain-specific language (DSL) for defining system architecture diagrams. Users write Python code using the library's API to describe nodes, edges, and groups, and the library renders these definitions into various diagram formats.

## C4 CONTAINER

For a library like `diagrams`, the "containers" are more akin to modules or components within the library itself.  Given its nature, a detailed container diagram might be an internal view of the library's architecture. However, for the purpose of threat modeling at a higher level, we can consider the main functional parts as containers.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

* Critical Business Processes:
  - Maintaining the integrity and availability of the `diagrams` library package on PyPI.
  - Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the diagram generation functionality.
  - Protecting the source code repository from unauthorized access and modification.

* Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Source code of the `diagrams` library (Medium sensitivity - intellectual property, potential for supply chain attacks if compromised).
  - PyPI publishing credentials (High sensitivity - compromise could lead to malicious package releases).
  - Diagram definitions created by users (Low to Medium sensitivity - may contain information about system architecture, but the library itself doesn't store or transmit this data).

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

  - Are there plans to implement code signing for releases?
  - What are the dependencies of the `diagrams` library, and are they regularly reviewed for vulnerabilities?

* Assumptions:
  - The project is intended to be open-source and community-driven.
  - Security is a consideration for the project, especially given its potential use in system documentation and the broader software supply chain.
  - The primary distribution channel is PyPI.
  - The project uses GitHub for source code hosting and collaboration.
