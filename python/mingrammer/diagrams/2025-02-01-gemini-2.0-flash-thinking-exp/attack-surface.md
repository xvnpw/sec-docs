## Attack Surface: [Diagram Definition Code Injection](./attack_surfaces/diagram_definition_code_injection.md)

### 1. Diagram Definition Code Injection

*   **Description:**  Vulnerability arising from dynamically generating diagram definitions (Python code using `diagrams`) based on user input or external data, allowing attackers to inject malicious Python code.
*   **How Diagrams Contributes:** `diagrams` library executes Python code to render diagrams. If the code generation process is flawed and incorporates unsanitized external input, it becomes vulnerable to injection, as `diagrams` will execute the resulting (potentially malicious) Python code.
*   **Example:**
    *   An application takes user-provided node labels via a web form.
    *   This label is directly inserted into the Python code that defines the diagram node using `diagrams`.
    *   An attacker inputs a malicious label like: `"; import os; os.system('evil_command');"`
    *   When the application executes this code with `diagrams`, the malicious command (`evil_command` in this example) is executed on the server.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Server Compromise, Data Breach, Denial of Service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Sanitization and Validation:**  Strictly sanitize and validate all user inputs or external data used to construct diagram definitions. Use allow-lists for allowed characters and patterns.
    *   **Parameterization/Templating:**  Instead of string concatenation to build diagram code, use templating engines or parameterization techniques that separate code structure from user-provided data.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the diagram generation process with minimal necessary privileges to limit the impact of successful code injection.
    *   **Code Review:**  Thoroughly review code that generates diagram definitions to identify potential injection points.
    *   **Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST):** Utilize SAST tools to automatically detect potential code injection vulnerabilities in the diagram generation logic.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Diagram Complexity](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_diagram_complexity.md)

### 2. Denial of Service (DoS) via Diagram Complexity

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit the computational cost of generating complex diagrams to overwhelm server resources, leading to application unavailability.
*   **How Diagrams Contributes:** `diagrams` library relies on graph processing and rendering, which can become resource-intensive for diagrams with a large number of nodes and edges.  Generating extremely complex diagrams through `diagrams` can consume excessive server resources.
*   **Example:**
    *   An application allows users to define diagrams with a variable number of nodes.
    *   An attacker sends repeated requests to generate diagrams with an extremely large number of nodes (e.g., thousands or millions) using the application's diagram generation feature.
    *   The server becomes overloaded trying to process these complex diagram requests initiated via `diagrams`, leading to slow response times or complete unresponsiveness for legitimate users.
*   **Impact:** Application Unavailability, Performance Degradation, Resource Exhaustion, Server Instability.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation and Limits:**  Implement limits on the complexity of diagrams that can be generated (e.g., maximum number of nodes, edges, depth). Validate user inputs to enforce these limits before passing them to `diagrams`.
    *   **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting to restrict the number of diagram generation requests from a single user or IP address within a given timeframe, especially for diagram generation endpoints.
    *   **Resource Monitoring and Alerting:**  Monitor server resource usage (CPU, memory) during diagram generation. Set up alerts to detect unusual spikes that might indicate a DoS attack targeting diagram generation.
    *   **Asynchronous Processing:**  Offload diagram generation to background tasks or queues to prevent blocking the main application thread and improve responsiveness, especially when dealing with potentially complex diagrams.
    *   **Caching:** Cache generated diagrams where possible to avoid redundant processing for frequently requested diagrams, reducing the load on the server for repeated requests.
