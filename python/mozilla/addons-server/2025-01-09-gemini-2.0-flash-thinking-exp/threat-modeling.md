# Threat Model Analysis for mozilla/addons-server

## Threat: [Malicious Add-on Upload](./threats/malicious_add-on_upload.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker, posing as a legitimate developer or through a compromised account, uploads an add-on containing malicious code (e.g., malware, spyware, cryptominers) via the `addons-server`'s add-on submission API. The malicious code could be designed to execute on user browsers after installation.
*   **Impact:** Users who install the malicious add-on could have their systems compromised, personal data stolen, or experience performance degradation.
*   **Affected Component:** Add-on Submission API, Add-on Validation Pipeline, Add-on Storage.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement rigorous static and dynamic analysis of submitted add-ons within `addons-server`.
    *   Employ code signing and verification mechanisms for add-ons managed by `addons-server`.
    *   Utilize sandboxing or isolated environments for add-on execution enforced by `addons-server` or the browser.
    *   Establish a robust manual review process for add-ons, especially those requesting sensitive permissions within the `addons-server` workflow.
    *   Implement rate limiting and CAPTCHA on the submission endpoint within `addons-server` to prevent automated malicious uploads.

## Threat: [Malicious Add-on Update Injection](./threats/malicious_add-on_update_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises the `addons-server`'s update mechanism or a developer's account to push a malicious update to a previously legitimate add-on. This update, distributed through `addons-server`, could introduce malicious functionality to users who already trust and have installed the add-on.
*   **Impact:** A large number of users could be quickly compromised through a trusted update channel managed by `addons-server`, leading to widespread data breaches or system compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** Add-on Update API, Add-on Storage, Developer Authentication System within `addons-server`.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure the add-on update distribution channels within `addons-server` with strong authentication and encryption.
    *   Implement cryptographic signing and verification of add-on updates managed by `addons-server`.
    *   Provide mechanisms within the `addons-server` interface for users to review and approve significant permission changes in updates.
    *   Monitor for unusual update patterns or code changes within `addons-server`.
    *   Implement multi-factor authentication for developer accounts managed by `addons-server`.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Add-on API Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_add-on_api_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers discover and exploit vulnerabilities in the APIs provided by `addons-server` for add-ons to interact with the platform or user browsers. This could allow malicious add-ons to bypass intended security restrictions or gain unauthorized access to data or functionality exposed through `addons-server`.
*   **Impact:** Malicious add-ons could escalate privileges, access sensitive browser data, or perform actions on behalf of the user without their consent by leveraging vulnerabilities in `addons-server` APIs.
*   **Affected Component:** Add-on APIs (various endpoints and functionalities within `addons-server`), Permission Management System within `addons-server`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the `addons-server` codebase, focusing on the add-on APIs.
    *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all API requests handled by `addons-server`.
    *   Follow secure coding practices during API development within the `addons-server` project.
    *   Implement rate limiting and anomaly detection for API usage within `addons-server`.

## Threat: [Data Breach of Add-on Metadata and Content](./threats/data_breach_of_add-on_metadata_and_content.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the database or storage systems managed by `addons-server` containing add-on metadata (descriptions, author information, versions, permissions) and the add-on code itself. This could be achieved through SQL injection, compromised credentials, or other vulnerabilities within the `addons-server` infrastructure.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive developer information managed by `addons-server`, potential for tampering with add-on content leading to supply chain attacks via `addons-server`, and loss of intellectual property stored within `addons-server`.
*   **Affected Component:** Database, Add-on Storage, Authentication and Authorization Modules within `addons-server`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong access controls and authentication for accessing the database and storage systems managed by `addons-server`.
    *   Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit within the `addons-server` infrastructure.
    *   Regularly patch and update the database and storage systems used by `addons-server`.
    *   Conduct regular security assessments of the `addons-server` infrastructure.

## Threat: [Account Takeover of Add-on Developers](./threats/account_takeover_of_add-on_developers.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to developer accounts managed by `addons-server` through phishing, credential stuffing, or other methods. This allows them to upload malicious add-ons or tamper with existing ones within the `addons-server` platform under the guise of the legitimate developer.
*   **Impact:** Malicious add-ons could be distributed with the trust associated with the compromised developer through the `addons-server` platform, leading to widespread user compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** Developer Authentication System, Account Management Features within `addons-server`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce strong password policies for developer accounts managed by `addons-server`.
    *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for developer logins to `addons-server`.
    *   Monitor for suspicious login activity within `addons-server` and provide alerts to developers.
    *   Educate developers about phishing and social engineering attacks targeting `addons-server` accounts.

## Threat: [Exploitation of `addons-server` Core Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of__addons-server__core_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers discover and exploit security vulnerabilities within the `addons-server` codebase itself (e.g., remote code execution, cross-site scripting, SQL injection).
*   **Impact:** Attackers could gain control of the `addons-server` instance, potentially leading to the compromise of all managed add-ons and user data within the platform.
*   **Affected Component:** Core `addons-server` codebase (various modules and functions).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the `addons-server` instance up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates.
    *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the `addons-server` codebase.
    *   Follow secure coding practices during development and maintenance of `addons-server`.
    *   Implement a web application firewall (WAF) to protect the `addons-server` instance against common web attacks.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** `addons-server` relies on various third-party libraries and dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited to compromise the `addons-server` instance.
*   **Impact:** Attackers could gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, or cause denial of service on the `addons-server` platform.
*   **Affected Component:** All components within `addons-server` relying on vulnerable dependencies.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
