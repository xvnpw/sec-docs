# Attack Surface Analysis for mozilla/addons-server

## Attack Surface: [Bypassing Add-on Validation and Uploading Malicious Add-ons](./attack_surfaces/bypassing_add-on_validation_and_uploading_malicious_add-ons.md)

* **Description:** Attackers exploit weaknesses in the add-on validation process **within addons-server** to upload add-ons containing malware, spyware, or other malicious code.
    * **How addons-server contributes to the attack surface:** The complexity of add-on manifests, potential vulnerabilities in the validation logic **implemented within addons-server**, and the reliance on automated checks **within the platform** can be targets for bypass.
    * **Example:** An attacker crafts an add-on with obfuscated malicious JavaScript that is not detected by the automated validation **scripts in addons-server** but executes harmful actions once installed in a user's browser.
    * **Impact:**  Widespread malware distribution, user data theft, browser compromise, and reputational damage to the platform.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Implement robust server-side validation **within addons-server**, including schema validation, content security policies (CSP), and input sanitization. Regularly update validation rules and signatures **in the platform**. Employ static and dynamic analysis tools for deeper inspection **integrated with the submission process**. Implement a layered validation approach with multiple checks **in the backend**.

## Attack Surface: [Serving Malicious Add-on Updates](./attack_surfaces/serving_malicious_add-on_updates.md)

* **Description:** Attackers compromise developer accounts or the update mechanism **within addons-server** to push malicious updates to existing users of a legitimate add-on.
    * **How addons-server contributes to the attack surface:** The update distribution mechanism **within addons-server**, if not properly secured, can be a point of compromise. Vulnerabilities in the developer account management or update signing processes **managed by addons-server** are critical.
    * **Example:** An attacker gains access to a developer's account **managed by addons-server** and pushes an update to their popular add-on that injects malicious advertisements into users' browsing sessions.
    * **Impact:**  Compromise of existing user base, potential data theft, malware distribution, and erosion of trust.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Implement strong multi-factor authentication (MFA) for developer accounts **integrated with addons-server**. Secure the update signing process with robust key management **within the platform's infrastructure**. Regularly audit account activity and permissions **within addons-server's database**. Implement mechanisms for users to report suspicious updates **through the platform**.

## Attack Surface: [Metadata Manipulation Leading to XSS or Misinformation](./attack_surfaces/metadata_manipulation_leading_to_xss_or_misinformation.md)

* **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in how add-on metadata (name, description, permissions, etc.) is processed **by addons-server** to inject malicious scripts (XSS) or misleading information.
    * **How addons-server contributes to the attack surface:**  Inadequate sanitization and escaping of user-provided metadata **within the addons-server codebase** can allow for the injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript.
    * **Example:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript into the description of their add-on **through the addons-server submission form**. When other users view the add-on page **served by addons-server**, the script executes in their browser, potentially stealing cookies or redirecting them to phishing sites.
    * **Impact:**  Cross-site scripting attacks targeting users browsing the add-on platform, spreading misinformation, and damaging the reputation of legitimate add-ons.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Implement strict input sanitization and output encoding **in the addons-server code** for all user-provided metadata. Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) **configured on the server** to restrict the execution of inline scripts. Regularly audit metadata fields for potential vulnerabilities **within the platform's data**.

## Attack Surface: [API Endpoints for Add-on Submission and Management](./attack_surfaces/api_endpoints_for_add-on_submission_and_management.md)

* **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the API endpoints **provided by addons-server** used by developers to submit, update, and manage their add-ons can be exploited for unauthorized actions.
    * **How addons-server contributes to the attack surface:** The design and implementation of the API endpoints **within addons-server**, including authentication, authorization, and input validation, are critical. Flaws in these areas can be exploited.
    * **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the add-on update API **of addons-server** to modify the source code of another developer's add-on without proper authorization.
    * **Impact:**  Unauthorized modification or deletion of add-ons, potential for injecting malicious code, and disruption of the add-on ecosystem.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms **for all API endpoints in addons-server**. Employ rate limiting **on API endpoints managed by addons-server** to prevent abuse. Thoroughly validate all input parameters **received by the API**. Regularly audit API endpoints for security vulnerabilities **in the addons-server codebase**. Follow secure API design principles **during development of addons-server**.

## Attack Surface: [Developer Account Takeover](./attack_surfaces/developer_account_takeover.md)

* **Description:** Attackers compromise developer accounts **managed by addons-server** through weak passwords, phishing, or other methods, gaining control over their add-ons.
    * **How addons-server contributes to the attack surface:** The security of the developer account management system **within addons-server**, including password reset mechanisms and security features, is crucial. Weaknesses here increase the risk of account takeover.
    * **Example:** An attacker uses a brute-force attack or credential stuffing **against the addons-server login system** to gain access to a developer's account and then uploads a malicious update to their popular add-on.
    * **Impact:**  Malicious updates, unauthorized add-on modifications, and reputational damage.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Enforce strong password policies **within addons-server**. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) **integrated with the platform**. Provide clear guidance to developers on account security best practices **related to the addons-server platform**. Monitor for suspicious login activity **within the platform's logs**.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_dependencies.md)

* **Description:** `addons-server` relies on various third-party libraries and frameworks. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited to compromise the platform **itself**.
    * **How addons-server contributes to the attack surface:** The selection and management of dependencies **within the addons-server project** are critical. Using outdated or vulnerable libraries introduces risk.
    * **Example:** A known security vulnerability exists in a specific version of a Python library **used by addons-server**. An attacker exploits this vulnerability to gain remote code execution on the server **running addons-server**.
    * **Impact:**  Server compromise, data breaches, and potential for widespread attacks.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Maintain an up-to-date inventory of all dependencies **used by addons-server**. Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using security tools **integrated into the development pipeline**. Implement a process for promptly patching or updating vulnerable dependencies **within the addons-server codebase**. Employ dependency pinning to ensure consistent versions **during deployment**.
