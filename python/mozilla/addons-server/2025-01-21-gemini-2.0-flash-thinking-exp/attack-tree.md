## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via addons-server (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_addons-server__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this node means the attacker has achieved their objective of executing arbitrary code within the application's context by leveraging vulnerabilities in the `addons-server`.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Add-on (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_add-on__critical_node_.md)

This critical node represents the attacker's attempt to introduce a harmful add-on into the system. Success here allows the malicious code within the add-on to potentially be executed by the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Add-on Submission Checks (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_add-on_submission_checks__critical_node_.md)

This node is critical because it represents the attacker's ability to circumvent the intended security measures designed to prevent malicious add-ons from entering the system. Success here directly enables the injection of malicious add-ons.

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft Add-on with Obfuscated Malicious Code (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/craft_add-on_with_obfuscated_malicious_code__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers can attempt to bypass automated static analysis tools by obfuscating malicious code within the add-on. This makes it harder for the tools to detect the harmful intent.

## Attack Tree Path: [Submit Add-on During Off-Hours/High Volume (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/submit_add-on_during_off-hourshigh_volume__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers may try to exploit the human element of the review process by submitting malicious add-ons during periods when reviewers are less attentive or the volume of submissions is high, increasing the chance of slipping through unnoticed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Inadequate Input Sanitization During Submission -> Inject Malicious Payloads in Manifest or Code (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_inadequate_input_sanitization_during_submission_-_inject_malicious_payloads_in_manifest_or_c_98680edd.md)

This path involves exploiting weaknesses in how the `addons-server` handles input during the add-on submission process. Attackers can inject malicious code or scripts directly into the manifest file or other parts of the add-on package, which can then be executed by the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Developer Account (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_developer_account__critical_node_.md)

This node is critical as it allows an attacker to leverage the trust and permissions associated with a legitimate developer. By gaining control of a developer account, the attacker can upload malicious add-ons that bypass normal scrutiny.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Developer Account -> Phishing Attack on Developer (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_developer_account_-_phishing_attack_on_developer__high-risk_path_.md)

This path involves using social engineering techniques, such as phishing emails, to trick developers into revealing their login credentials. Once the attacker has the credentials, they can upload malicious add-ons.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in addons-server Itself (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in_addons-server_itself__critical_node_.md)

This node represents a direct attack on the `addons-server` infrastructure. Success here can lead to various forms of compromise, including the ability to inject malicious add-ons, access sensitive data, or disrupt the service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in addons-server Itself -> Exploit Server-Side Vulnerabilities -> Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) -> Stored XSS via Malicious Add-on Metadata (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in_addons-server_itself_-_exploit_server-side_vulnerabilities_-_cross-site_scr_855c2872.md)

Attackers can inject malicious scripts into the metadata associated with an add-on (e.g., name, description). When users interact with this metadata through the `addons-server` interface, the script can execute in their browser, potentially leading to account takeover or information disclosure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in addons-server Itself -> Exploit Server-Side Vulnerabilities -> Dependency Vulnerabilities -> Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Used Libraries (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in_addons-server_itself_-_exploit_server-side_vulnerabilities_-_dependency_vul_4859994e.md)

This path involves exploiting known security vulnerabilities in the third-party libraries used by the `addons-server`. If these libraries are not regularly updated, attackers can leverage publicly available exploits to compromise the server.
