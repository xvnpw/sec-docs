# Threat Model Analysis for mozilla/addons-server

## Threat: [Malicious Add-on Uploads](./threats/malicious_add-on_uploads.md)

**Description:** An attacker, having compromised a developer account or exploited a vulnerability in the `addons-server` submission process, uploads a malicious add-on. This add-on contains code designed to harm users or the application. The attacker might aim to exfiltrate data, perform cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, or execute arbitrary code within the context of users who install the add-on.

**Impact:** User data compromise, application security breaches, defacement of the application interface, unauthorized actions performed on behalf of users, and potential legal repercussions.

**Affected Component:** Add-on Submission API, Add-on Validation/Review Process, Add-on Storage.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement strong multi-factor authentication for developer accounts on `addons-server`.
*   Enforce rigorous automated and manual code review processes for all submitted add-ons within `addons-server`.
*   Utilize static and dynamic analysis tools within `addons-server` to detect malicious code patterns.
*   Sandbox add-on execution environments within `addons-server` to limit their access to system resources.
*   Implement a reporting mechanism for users to flag suspicious add-ons on `addons-server`.
*   Have a clear process within `addons-server` for quickly removing malicious add-ons.

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization within Add-on Data](./threats/insecure_deserialization_within_add-on_data.md)

**Description:** If `addons-server` uses deserialization to process add-on data (e.g., for storing or retrieving complex objects), vulnerabilities in the deserialization process could allow attackers to inject malicious serialized objects that, when deserialized, execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Impact:** Remote code execution on the `addons-server` infrastructure, potentially leading to full server compromise and data breaches.

**Affected Component:** Data Deserialization Modules within `addons-server`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Avoid using deserialization of untrusted data within `addons-server` if possible.
*   If deserialization is necessary, use safe deserialization libraries and techniques within `addons-server`.
*   Implement integrity checks and signatures for serialized data within `addons-server`.
*   Regularly update deserialization libraries within `addons-server` to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attacks via Compromised Add-on Updates](./threats/supply_chain_attacks_via_compromised_add-on_updates.md)

**Description:** A legitimate add-on's update is compromised after its initial upload on `addons-server`. An attacker gains access to the developer's update mechanism and injects malicious code into a new version of the add-on. Users who update to this compromised version are then vulnerable.

**Impact:** Similar to malicious add-on uploads, including user data compromise, application security breaches, and unauthorized actions. The impact can be widespread as users trust updates from previously legitimate sources.

**Affected Component:** Add-on Update Mechanism, Add-on Storage within `addons-server`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement strong signing and verification mechanisms for add-on updates within `addons-server`.
*   Require developers to use secure update channels (e.g., HTTPS with certificate pinning) enforced by `addons-server`.
*   Monitor for unusual update patterns or changes in add-on code within `addons-server`.

## Threat: [Authentication and Authorization Flaws in API Access](./threats/authentication_and_authorization_flaws_in_api_access.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in how our application authenticates and authorizes with the `addons-server` API could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access. This could involve exploiting weak API keys, insecure token management, or flaws in the authorization logic within `addons-server`.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to add-on data, the ability to modify or delete add-ons, or potentially gain control over developer accounts, depending on the scope of the vulnerability within `addons-server`.

**Affected Component:** API Authentication and Authorization Modules within `addons-server`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Use strong and securely stored API keys or tokens provided by `addons-server`.
*   Implement proper OAuth 2.0 or similar authorization flows provided by `addons-server`.
*   Follow the principle of least privilege when granting API access within `addons-server`.
*   Regularly audit API access controls and authentication mechanisms within `addons-server`.
*   Securely manage and rotate API keys provided by `addons-server`.

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Add-on Interactions](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_add-on_interactions.md)

**Description:** If `addons-server` allows add-on metadata to contain arbitrary URLs and our application interacts with external resources based on this data without proper validation, an attacker could manipulate the add-on data to cause our server to make requests to internal or unintended external resources.

**Impact:** Exposure of internal services, potential for further attacks on internal infrastructure, and data exfiltration from internal systems.

**Affected Component:** Add-on Metadata Storage within `addons-server`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Strictly validate and sanitize any URLs or external resource references allowed in add-on metadata within `addons-server`.
*   `addons-server` should use allow-lists instead of block-lists for allowed external domains in metadata.

## Threat: [Dependency Confusion within Add-ons](./threats/dependency_confusion_within_add-ons.md)

**Description:** A malicious actor creates an add-on with a name similar to a legitimate internal dependency or library used by other add-ons within the `addons-server` ecosystem. If the add-on loading mechanism prioritizes the malicious add-on, it could be loaded instead of the legitimate dependency, leading to code execution within other add-ons.

**Impact:** Compromise of other add-ons hosted on `addons-server`, potentially leading to the same impacts as malicious add-on uploads. This is a subtle attack that can be difficult to detect.

**Affected Component:** Add-on Loading Mechanism, Dependency Resolution within the `addons-server` environment.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement strong namespace management and dependency resolution mechanisms for add-ons within `addons-server`.
*   Enforce unique naming conventions for add-ons and their internal dependencies within `addons-server`.
*   Verify the integrity and source of add-on dependencies within `addons-server`.
*   Consider using code signing or other mechanisms to ensure the authenticity of add-ons and their components within `addons-server`.
