# Attack Surface Analysis for mozilla/addons-server

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Add-on Submission](./attack_surfaces/malicious_add-on_submission.md)

* **Description:** Attackers submit add-ons containing malicious code (e.g., spyware, cryptominers, botnet clients).
* **How addons-server Contributes:** Provides the platform for submitting and distributing add-ons, making it a direct channel for introducing malicious software into user browsers. The effectiveness of the `addons-server`'s review process directly impacts this risk.
* **Example:** An attacker submits an add-on that claims to be a productivity tool but secretly steals browsing history and sends it to a remote server.
* **Impact:** Compromised user data, system compromise, reputational damage to the platform and legitimate add-on developers.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Developers:** Not directly applicable as they are the potential attackers.
    * **Users:** Install add-ons only from trusted sources and developers. Carefully review the permissions requested by an add-on before installation. Utilize browser features to manage and monitor installed add-ons.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Add-on Updates](./attack_surfaces/compromised_add-on_updates.md)

* **Description:** Attackers gain control of a legitimate add-on's update mechanism *through the addons-server* to push malicious updates to existing users.
* **How addons-server Contributes:** Manages the update distribution process. Vulnerabilities in the `addons-server`'s authentication and authorization mechanisms for developers, or weaknesses in the update verification process, can be exploited.
* **Example:** An attacker compromises a developer's account *on addons-server* and pushes an update to a popular add-on that injects advertisements into web pages or steals user credentials.
* **Impact:** Widespread compromise of users who have the legitimate add-on installed, significant reputational damage.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Developers:** Implement strong account security measures, including multi-factor authentication *on addons-server*. Secure the add-on signing process and protect private keys *used with addons-server*. Regularly audit access to developer accounts and the update pipeline *within addons-server*.
    * **Users:** Pay attention to unexpected changes in add-on behavior after updates. Consider disabling automatic updates and reviewing updates before installation (if supported by the browser). Report suspicious add-on behavior.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Add-on Permissions](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_add-on_permissions.md)

* **Description:** Attackers create add-ons that request overly broad or unnecessary permissions to gain access to sensitive user data or browser functionalities.
* **How addons-server Contributes:** Facilitates the declaration and granting of add-on permissions. Weaknesses in the `addons-server`'s permission model or its enforcement during the review process can be exploited.
* **Example:** An add-on requests "access your data for all websites" when it only needs to interact with a specific domain, potentially allowing it to steal login credentials from unrelated sites.
* **Impact:** Privacy violations, data theft, unauthorized access to browser functionalities.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Developers:** Request only the minimum necessary permissions for the add-on's functionality. Clearly explain the purpose of each requested permission in the add-on's description *on addons-server*.
    * **Users:** Be cautious of add-ons requesting excessive permissions. Understand the implications of granting specific permissions. Regularly review the permissions granted to installed add-ons.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Developer Accounts](./attack_surfaces/compromised_developer_accounts.md)

* **Description:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to developer accounts *on addons-server*.
* **How addons-server Contributes:** Manages developer accounts and their access to add-on management functionalities. Weak account security practices *on the addons-server platform itself* can lead to compromises.
* **Example:** An attacker uses stolen credentials or exploits a vulnerability in the `addons-server` authentication system to access a developer account and upload a malicious add-on or push a malicious update.
* **Impact:** Distribution of malicious add-ons, defacement of legitimate add-ons, reputational damage.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Developers:** Use strong, unique passwords for their `addons-server` accounts. Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) if offered by the platform. Be cautious of phishing attempts targeting developer credentials.
    * **Users:** Indirectly affected. Rely on the platform's security measures and developer best practices.

## Attack Surface: [API Abuse](./attack_surfaces/api_abuse.md)

* **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the `addons-server` API to perform unauthorized actions.
* **How addons-server Contributes:** Provides an API for developers and potentially other clients to interact with the platform. Weaknesses in authentication, authorization, or input validation *within the addons-server API* can be exploited.
* **Example:** An attacker exploits an API vulnerability to delete a legitimate add-on or modify its metadata.
* **Impact:** Disruption of service, manipulation of add-on information, potential for further attacks.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Developers:** If using the `addons-server` API, follow secure coding practices and adhere to API usage guidelines.
    * **Users:** Indirectly affected. Rely on the platform's API security measures.
