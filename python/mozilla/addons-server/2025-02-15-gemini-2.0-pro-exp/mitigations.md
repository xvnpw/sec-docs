# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for mozilla/addons-server

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rigorous Static Analysis of Submitted Add-ons (within `addons-server`)](./mitigation_strategies/rigorous_static_analysis_of_submitted_add-ons__within__addons-server__.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Submission Pipeline Integration (Server-Side):** The `addons-server` code itself handles the initial reception of add-on submissions.  Immediately upon receiving a submission, the server triggers the static analysis process *before* storing the add-on permanently.
    2.  **Multiple Analysis Tools (Server-Side Components):** The `addons-server` either directly integrates with or calls out to multiple static analysis tools. These tools are treated as server-side components or services.
        *   **JavaScript Linter (Server-Side Execution):** A linter (e.g., ESLint with security plugins) is executed *by the server* on the extracted JavaScript code from the add-on.
        *   **Manifest Analyzer (Server-Side Component):** A dedicated component within `addons-server` parses and analyzes the `manifest.json` file, checking for excessive/suspicious permissions.
        *   **Dangerous API/Pattern Checker (Server-Side Logic):** `addons-server` contains code (e.g., Python functions, regular expressions) that directly scans the add-on's code for known dangerous API calls and patterns. This logic is part of the server's codebase.
    3.  **Dangerous API/Pattern Database (Server-Managed):** The `addons-server` maintains and manages a database (or a configuration file loaded into memory) of dangerous APIs, code patterns, and regular expressions. This database is accessed directly by the server-side analysis logic.
    4.  **Fuzzy Hashing (Server-Side Calculation):** The `addons-server` calculates a fuzzy hash (e.g., ssdeep, TLSH) of the add-on's code *on the server*.
    5.  **Fuzzy Hash Comparison (Server-Side Database Query):** The `addons-server` queries its own database (or an associated service) to compare the calculated fuzzy hash against known malicious add-on hashes.
    6.  **Obfuscation Detection (Server-Side Heuristics):** `addons-server` includes code (e.g., Python functions) that implements heuristics to detect code obfuscation within the add-on's JavaScript.
    7.  **Rejection/Flagging (Server-Side Decision):** Based on the results of *all* the server-side analysis steps, `addons-server` either automatically rejects the submission (database update to mark as rejected) or flags it for manual review (database update to mark for review).
    8. **Regular Updates (Server-Side Updates):** The static analysis tools, the dangerous API/pattern database, and the fuzzy hash database are updated as part of the `addons-server` deployment process.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Code Injection (Severity: Critical):** Prevents add-ons with malicious JavaScript from being accepted *by the server*.
    *   **Excessive Permission Requests (Severity: High):** The server identifies and flags/rejects add-ons requesting excessive permissions.
    *   **Known Malware Distribution (Severity: Critical):** The server detects and prevents the acceptance of known malware.
    *   **Obfuscated Malware (Severity: High):** The server flags potentially obfuscated code for further review.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Code Injection:** Risk reduction: 80-90% (server-side enforcement).
    *   **Excessive Permission Requests:** Risk reduction: 70-80% (server-side validation).
    *   **Known Malware Distribution:** Risk reduction: 95%+ (server-side database lookup).
    *   **Obfuscated Malware:** Risk reduction: 50-60% (server-side heuristics).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Likely: Some basic linting and manifest.json validation are part of the `addons-server` code.
    *   Possible: A custom tool for dangerous API detection might be integrated into the server.
    *   Unlikely: Comprehensive fuzzy hashing, obfuscation detection, and a fully integrated, regularly updated database are less likely to be *fully* within the `addons-server` codebase.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Fully integrated, multi-tool static analysis pipeline *within* the `addons-server` codebase.
    *   Server-managed and regularly updated database of dangerous APIs, patterns, and fuzzy hashes.
    *   Robust, server-side obfuscation detection logic.
    *   Automated rejection/flagging logic based on analysis results, all handled by the server.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dynamic Analysis (Sandboxing) of Submitted Add-ons (with `addons-server` interaction)](./mitigation_strategies/dynamic_analysis__sandboxing__of_submitted_add-ons__with__addons-server__interaction_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Submission Queue (Server-Managed):** `addons-server` maintains a queue of add-on submissions that are awaiting dynamic analysis.
    2.  **Sandbox Orchestration (Server-Initiated):** `addons-server` is responsible for initiating the dynamic analysis process. This might involve:
        *   Sending a message to a separate sandboxing service.
        *   Provisioning a new sandbox environment (e.g., creating a new Docker container).
        *   Copying the add-on package to the sandbox.
    3.  **Execution Command (Server-Provided):** `addons-server` provides the command to execute the add-on within the sandbox.
    4.  **Result Retrieval (Server-Handled):** `addons-server` retrieves the results of the dynamic analysis from the sandbox (or the sandboxing service). This might involve:
        *   Polling for results.
        *   Receiving a callback from the sandboxing service.
        *   Retrieving a report file from a shared storage location.
    5.  **Rejection/Flagging (Server-Side Decision):** Based on the dynamic analysis report, `addons-server` either automatically rejects the submission or flags it for manual review. This decision is made by the server's code.
    6. **Timeout Management (Server-Enforced):** `addons-server` enforces a timeout for the dynamic analysis process. If the analysis takes too long, the server terminates the process and flags the add-on.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Zero-Day Exploits (Severity: Critical):** The server facilitates the detection of zero-day exploits through dynamic analysis.
    *   **Evasive Malware (Severity: High):** The server helps identify malware that evades static analysis.
    *   **Data Exfiltration (Severity: High):** The server processes reports that can reveal data exfiltration attempts.
    *   **Cryptojacking (Severity: Medium):** The server handles reports that can indicate cryptojacking.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Zero-Day Exploits:** Risk reduction: 60-70% (server-orchestrated analysis).
    *   **Evasive Malware:** Risk reduction: 70-80% (server-initiated dynamic analysis).
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Risk reduction: 80-90% (server processing of analysis reports).
    *   **Cryptojacking:** Risk reduction: 75-85% (server handling of analysis reports).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Unlikely: Full integration with a dynamic analysis system is complex.
    *   Possible: `addons-server` might have basic hooks for triggering external analysis, but not full orchestration and result processing.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Complete integration with a dynamic analysis system, including provisioning, execution, and result retrieval, all managed by `addons-server`.
    *   Server-side logic for handling timeouts and making rejection/flagging decisions based on dynamic analysis reports.
    *   A robust queuing system for managing submissions awaiting dynamic analysis.

## Mitigation Strategy: [API Security (Specifically for `addons-server` APIs)](./mitigation_strategies/api_security__specifically_for__addons-server__apis_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Authentication (Server-Side Enforcement):** All API endpoints within `addons-server` *require* authentication.  The server code validates API keys, OAuth 2.0 tokens, or other credentials *before* processing any request.
    2.  **Authorization (Server-Side Logic):** `addons-server` implements granular authorization checks.  For each API request, the server verifies that the authenticated user/application has the necessary permissions to perform the requested action. This logic is part of the server's codebase.
    3.  **Input Validation (Server-Side Schemas):** `addons-server` defines strict schemas for all API parameters.  The server code validates incoming requests against these schemas *before* processing them.  Invalid requests are rejected.
    4.  **Add-on Metadata Validation (Server-Side Checks):** `addons-server` performs specific validation on add-on metadata received via API calls (e.g., name, description, version, permissions).  This includes checks for length limits, allowed characters, and consistency.
    5.  **Rate Limiting (Server-Side Implementation):** `addons-server` implements rate limiting for all API endpoints.  The server tracks the number of requests from each user/application and blocks requests that exceed the defined limits.  This logic is part of the server's codebase.
    6.  **CSRF Protection (Server-Side Tokens):** If the `addons-server` API is used by web frontends, the server generates and validates anti-CSRF tokens to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.
    7. **API Access Logging (Server-Side Logging):** `addons-server` logs all API requests, including the user/application, the endpoint, the parameters, and the response status. These logs are stored securely and monitored.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized API Access (Severity: Critical):** Authentication and authorization prevent unauthorized users/applications from accessing the API.
    *   **Data Breaches (Severity: Critical):** Granular authorization limits the potential damage from a compromised API key.
    *   **Injection Attacks (Severity: High):** Input validation prevents attackers from injecting malicious data into the server.
    *   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks (Severity: High):** Rate limiting prevents attackers from overwhelming the API.
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (Severity: High):** CSRF protection prevents attackers from hijacking user sessions.
    * **Malicious Add-on Submission via API (Severity: Critical):** Specific validation of add-on metadata via the API prevents malicious submissions.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized API Access:** Risk reduction: 99%+.  Strong authentication is highly effective.
    *   **Data Breaches:** Risk reduction: 70-80% (depends on the granularity of authorization).
    *   **Injection Attacks:** Risk reduction: 90%+.  Strict input validation is highly effective.
    *   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks:** Risk reduction: 80-90%.  Rate limiting is effective.
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Risk reduction: 99%+.  Anti-CSRF tokens are highly effective.
    * **Malicious Add-on Submission via API:** Risk reduction: 80-90% (server-side validation).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Likely: Basic authentication and authorization are implemented.
    *   Likely: Some level of input validation exists.
    *   Possible: Rate limiting might be implemented, but may not be comprehensive.
    *   Possible: CSRF protection might be in place if the API is used by web frontends.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive, granular authorization checks for *all* API endpoints.
    *   Strict input validation schemas for *all* API parameters.
    *   Robust rate limiting with different limits for different endpoints and user roles.
    *   Complete and consistent CSRF protection (if applicable).
    *   Thorough API access logging and monitoring.
    *   Specific, in-depth validation of add-on metadata submitted via the API.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dependency Management (within `addons-server` build process)](./mitigation_strategies/dependency_management__within__addons-server__build_process_.md)

* **Description:**
    1.  **Dependency Tracking (Build System):** The `addons-server` build process uses a dependency management tool (e.g., `pip` for Python, `npm` for JavaScript) to explicitly list all dependencies and their versions.
    2.  **Vulnerability Scanning (Automated Build Step):** As part of the build process, a vulnerability scanner (e.g., `pip-audit`, `npm audit`, OWASP Dependency-Check) is *automatically* run to check for known vulnerabilities in the declared dependencies.
    3.  **Build Failure (Automated):** If the vulnerability scanner finds any vulnerabilities with a severity level above a defined threshold (e.g., "High" or "Critical"), the build process *fails automatically*. This prevents the deployment of code with known vulnerable dependencies.
    4.  **Dependency Pinning (Configuration):** Dependencies are pinned to specific versions (or narrow version ranges) in the dependency management configuration file (e.g., `requirements.txt`, `package-lock.json`).
    5. **Regular Dependency Updates (Scheduled Task/Process):** A scheduled task or process is in place to regularly update dependencies to their latest secure versions. This might involve:
        *   Running the dependency management tool's update command.
        *   Running the vulnerability scanner again.
        *   Creating a pull request with the updated dependencies.
    6. **SCA Tool Integration (Optional, but Recommended):** A Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool is integrated into the build process to provide more comprehensive vulnerability analysis and license compliance checks.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities in Dependencies (Severity: High to Critical):** Prevents the deployment of code that relies on libraries with known security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks (Severity: High):** Reduces the risk of a compromised dependency being introduced into the codebase.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities in Dependencies:** Risk reduction: 90%+. Automated vulnerability scanning and build failure are highly effective.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks:** Risk reduction: 60-70%. Dependency pinning and regular updates help mitigate this risk.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Likely: Dependency management with a tool like `pip` or `npm` is used.
    *   Possible: Some form of vulnerability scanning might be in place.
    *   Unlikely: Fully automated build failure based on vulnerability scans and regular, automated dependency updates are less likely to be fully implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Automated build failure based on vulnerability scan results.
    *   Regular, automated dependency updates with a scheduled task or process.
    *   Integration of a comprehensive SCA tool.
    *   Strict dependency pinning with a well-defined update strategy.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Denial of Service (DoS) Mitigation (Specific to `addons-server` Functionality)](./mitigation_strategies/denial_of_service__dos__mitigation__specific_to__addons-server__functionality_.md)

* **Description:**
    1.  **Resource Limits (Server-Side Enforcement):**
        *   **Add-on Size Limits:** `addons-server` enforces a strict maximum size limit for uploaded add-on packages.  This limit is enforced *before* the add-on is fully processed or stored.
        *   **Submission Rate Limits (Per User/IP):** `addons-server` limits the number of add-on submissions allowed from a single user account or IP address within a given time period.
        *   **Review Rate Limits (Per User):** If `addons-server` handles user reviews, it limits the number of reviews a single user can submit within a given time period.
    2. **Database Query Optimization (Server-Side Code):**
        *   All database queries within `addons-server` are carefully optimized to minimize execution time and resource consumption.
        *   Appropriate indexes are used on database tables.
        *   Avoidance of inefficient queries (e.g., full table scans).
    3. **Caching (Server-Side Implementation):**
        *   `addons-server` implements caching for frequently accessed data (e.g., add-on metadata, search results) to reduce database load.
        *   Appropriate cache invalidation strategies are used.
    4. **Asynchronous Processing (Server-Side Tasks):**
        *   Long-running tasks (e.g., static analysis, dynamic analysis) are handled asynchronously to prevent blocking the main server thread.
        *   A task queue (e.g., Celery) is used to manage these tasks.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Severity: High):** Prevents attackers from consuming excessive server resources (CPU, memory, disk space) by uploading large add-ons, submitting numerous requests, or triggering expensive database queries.
    *   **Application-Layer DoS (Severity: High):** Mitigates DoS attacks that target specific application functionalities (e.g., add-on submission, search).
    * **Review Bombing/Manipulation (Severity: Medium):** Limits the ability of users to manipulate reviews through excessive submissions.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk reduction: 80-90%.  Resource limits and query optimization are effective.
    *   **Application-Layer DoS:** Risk reduction: 70-80% (depends on the specific mitigations implemented).
    * **Review Bombing/Manipulation:** Risk reduction: 85-95%. Rate limiting is very effective.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Possible: Some basic resource limits might be in place.
    *   Possible: Some level of database query optimization is likely.
    *   Unlikely: Comprehensive rate limiting, caching, and asynchronous processing are less likely to be fully and consistently implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive and consistent resource limits for all relevant server functionalities.
    *   Thorough database query optimization and indexing.
    *   Robust caching mechanisms with appropriate invalidation strategies.
    *   Asynchronous processing for all long-running tasks.
    *   Specific rate limits for add-on submissions and reviews.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Storage and Handling (Specific to `addons-server` Data)](./mitigation_strategies/data_storage_and_handling__specific_to__addons-server__data_.md)

* **Description:**
    1.  **Secure Add-on Storage (Server Configuration/Code):**
        *   `addons-server` is configured to store add-on files in a secure location (e.g., a dedicated file system with restricted access, object storage with appropriate ACLs).
        *   Access to this storage location is strictly controlled and logged.
    2.  **Database Security (Server Configuration/Code):**
        *   The database used by `addons-server` is configured with strong security settings (e.g., secure passwords, limited user privileges, encryption at rest and in transit).
        *   Database connections from `addons-server` use secure protocols.
    3.  **Data Validation (Server-Side Code):**
        *   `addons-server` validates all data *before* storing it in the database or file system. This includes checks for data types, formats, and lengths.
    4.  **Data Sanitization (Server-Side Code):**
        *   `addons-server` sanitizes any data that is displayed to users (e.g., add-on descriptions, reviews) to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
    5. **Regular Backups (Server Operations):**
        * Regular, automated backups of the `addons-server` database and add-on files are performed.
        * Backups are stored securely and tested regularly.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Add-on Files (Severity: High):** Secure storage prevents attackers from directly accessing add-on files.
    *   **Database Breaches (Severity: Critical):** Secure database configuration reduces the risk of data breaches.
    *   **Data Corruption (Severity: Medium):** Data validation and backups help prevent and recover from data corruption.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Severity: High):** Data sanitization prevents XSS attacks.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Add-on Files:** Risk reduction: 80-90% (depends on the specific storage security measures).
    *   **Database Breaches:** Risk reduction: 70-80% (depends on the database security configuration).
    *   **Data Corruption:** Risk reduction: 90%+. Regular backups are highly effective.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Risk reduction: 90%+. Data sanitization is highly effective.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Likely: Basic database security measures are in place.
    *   Likely: Some level of data validation and sanitization is implemented.
