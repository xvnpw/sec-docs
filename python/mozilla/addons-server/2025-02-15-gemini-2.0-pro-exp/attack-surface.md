# Attack Surface Analysis for mozilla/addons-server

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Addon Submission](./attack_surfaces/malicious_addon_submission.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers attempt to upload and distribute malicious code disguised as legitimate Firefox addons, bypassing security checks.
*   **addons-server Contribution:** `addons-server` is the *primary* component responsible for receiving, validating, storing, signing, and distributing addons. Its design and implementation are directly responsible for preventing malicious submissions.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts an addon that appears benign but contains hidden malicious JavaScript that steals user data *after* evading the automated validation process.
*   **Impact:**  Compromise of user data, installation of malware, redirection to phishing sites, widespread harm due to Firefox's large user base.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Multi-Layered Validation:** Implement multiple, independent validation layers (static analysis, dynamic analysis, manual review for high-risk cases).
    *   **Strict Input Sanitization:** Rigorously sanitize all input from the addon package.
    *   **Dependency Scanning:** Analyze addon dependencies for known vulnerabilities and malicious packages.
    *   **Regular Validator Updates:** Continuously update validation tools to address new bypass techniques.
    *   **Code Signing Enforcement:** Ensure only properly signed addons can be installed. Protect signing keys rigorously.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Implement systems to detect unusual patterns in addon submissions.

## Attack Surface: [Addon Signing Key Compromise](./attack_surfaces/addon_signing_key_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the private key(s) used for digitally signing addons.
*   **addons-server Contribution:** `addons-server` manages the addon signing process and interacts with the key management infrastructure. Its security directly impacts the protection of the signing keys.
*   **Example:** An attacker compromises a server or developer workstation with access to the signing keys, or exploits a vulnerability in the key management system.
*   **Impact:** The attacker can sign *any* malicious addon, and it will be trusted by Firefox, leading to widespread user compromise. This is a catastrophic scenario.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Hardware Security Modules (HSMs):** Store signing keys in HSMs.
    *   **Strict Access Control:** Implement rigorous access control for signing keys and related systems.
    *   **Key Rotation:** Regularly rotate signing keys.
    *   **Multi-Signature Schemes:** Consider requiring multiple keys for signing.
    *   **Auditing and Monitoring:** Implement comprehensive auditing and monitoring of key access and signing.
    *   **Incident Response Plan:** Have a plan to revoke compromised keys and notify users.

## Attack Surface: [API Abuse and Unauthorized Access](./attack_surfaces/api_abuse_and_unauthorized_access.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the `addons-server` API to gain unauthorized access to data or functionality, bypassing authentication or authorization.
*   **addons-server Contribution:** `addons-server` *defines and implements* the APIs for managing addons, users, and other features. The security of these APIs is entirely dependent on the `addons-server` code.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits an IDOR vulnerability to access or modify private addon data belonging to other users, or uses a brute-force attack to gain administrative access.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized modification of addons, service disruption, potential compromise of user accounts.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Authentication:** Implement strong authentication, including MFA for administrative accounts.
    *   **Robust Authorization:** Enforce strict authorization checks (RBAC).
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on API endpoints.
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate all input to API endpoints.
    *   **Secure Session Management:** Use secure session management practices.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.

## Attack Surface: [Validator Bypass and Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/validator_bypass_and_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers find ways to circumvent the addon validation process or exploit vulnerabilities *within* the validator itself (e.g., `addons-linter`).
*   **addons-server Contribution:** `addons-server` integrates and relies on the validator. The security of the validator and its *integration* within `addons-server` are crucial.  This includes how `addons-server` handles the validator's output and errors.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts an addon that triggers a buffer overflow in the `addons-linter` during validation, allowing arbitrary code execution on the server. Or, an attacker finds a logic flaw to sneak malicious code past the checks.
*   **Impact:** Server compromise, potential for remote code execution, bypassing of security controls, ability to upload malicious addons.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Fuzzing:** Regularly fuzz the validator.
    *   **Sandboxing:** Run the validator in a sandboxed environment.
    *   **Memory Safety:** Use memory-safe languages or tools where possible.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep the validator and dependencies up-to-date.
    *   **Code Review:** Conduct thorough code reviews of the validator and its integration.
    *   **Input Validation (for the Validator):** The validator itself should have robust input validation.
