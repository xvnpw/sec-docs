Okay, let's craft a design document for the Mozilla Addons Server project, keeping in mind its purpose and potential security considerations.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a secure and reliable platform for hosting and distributing Firefox add-ons (extensions and themes).
*   Maintain user trust by ensuring the integrity and safety of add-ons.
*   Enable a thriving ecosystem for add-on developers.
*   Support Mozilla's mission of promoting openness, innovation, and opportunity on the Web.
*   Facilitate easy discovery and installation of add-ons for Firefox users.
*   Scale to accommodate a large number of add-ons and users.
*   Provide mechanisms for reporting and handling malicious or problematic add-ons.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Distribution of malicious add-ons that could compromise user security or privacy.
*   Service downtime or performance issues that disrupt user access to add-ons.
*   Reputational damage due to security breaches or privacy violations.
*   Loss of developer trust due to unfair or inconsistent policies or processes.
*   Inability to scale to meet growing demand.
*   Legal and regulatory compliance issues related to add-on content and distribution.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls (based on the GitHub repository and general knowledge of Mozilla's practices):

*   security control: Code review process for submitted add-ons (both automated and manual). Mentioned in multiple places, including documentation and likely enforced through GitHub workflows.
*   security control: Automated static analysis of add-on code for known vulnerabilities and malicious patterns. Mentioned in documentation and likely integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
*   security control: Signing of add-ons to ensure authenticity and prevent tampering. Described in documentation related to add-on submission and distribution.
*   security control: Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS vulnerabilities. Likely implemented in the web application's HTTP headers.
*   security control: Use of Django framework, which provides built-in protection against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., CSRF, XSS). Inherent in the project's technology stack.
*   security control: Regular security audits and penetration testing. Assumed based on Mozilla's security practices.
*   security control: Bug bounty program to incentivize external security researchers. Assumed based on Mozilla's security practices.
*   security control: Two-factor authentication (2FA) for privileged accounts (e.g., administrators, reviewers). Assumed based on Mozilla's security practices.
*   security control: Rate limiting to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks. Likely implemented at the API level and potentially at the web server level.
*   security control: Data encryption at rest and in transit. Assumed based on Mozilla's security practices and cloud provider capabilities.
*   security control: Regular software updates and patching to address vulnerabilities. Assumed based on Mozilla's security practices and use of dependency management tools.
*   security control: Input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks. Implemented within the Django application code.
*   security control: Use of a web application firewall (WAF) to protect against common web attacks. Likely implemented as part of the cloud infrastructure.
*   security control: Logging and monitoring of system activity to detect and respond to security incidents. Assumed based on Mozilla's security practices and cloud provider capabilities.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Zero-day vulnerabilities in third-party libraries or dependencies. Mitigated by regular updates and security scanning.
*   accepted risk: Human error in code review process. Mitigated by automated checks and multiple reviewers.
*   accepted risk: Sophisticated targeted attacks that bypass existing security controls. Mitigated by defense-in-depth strategy and incident response plan.
*   accepted risk: Denial-of-service attacks that overwhelm rate limiting. Mitigated by scalable infrastructure and DDoS protection services.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   Implement Subresource Integrity (SRI) for all externally loaded scripts and stylesheets.
*   Enforce HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   Implement a robust vulnerability disclosure program with clear guidelines and response times.
*   Regularly review and update CSP policies to ensure they are effective and do not break functionality.
*   Consider implementing a sandboxing mechanism for add-on execution within the browser.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   All users interacting with sensitive data or functionality (e.g., submitting add-ons, reviewing add-ons, administering the system) must be authenticated.
    *   Support for strong passwords and multi-factor authentication.
    *   Secure session management to prevent session hijacking.
*   Authorization:
    *   Role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive data and functionality based on user roles.
    *   Principle of least privilege: users should only have access to the resources they need to perform their tasks.
    *   Regular review of user permissions to ensure they are appropriate.
*   Input Validation:
    *   All user input must be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks (e.g., XSS, SQL injection).
    *   Use of whitelisting rather than blacklisting where possible.
    *   Validation should occur on both the client-side and server-side.
*   Cryptography:
    *   All sensitive data (e.g., passwords, API keys) must be stored securely using strong cryptographic algorithms.
    *   Use of HTTPS for all communication between the client and server.
    *   Secure key management practices.
    *   Digital signatures for add-ons to ensure integrity and authenticity.

## DEPLOYMENT

Possible Deployment Solutions:

1.  **Cloud-based deployment (AWS, GCP, Azure):** This is the most likely scenario, given Mozilla's scale and infrastructure needs. It offers scalability, reliability, and a wide range of managed services.
2.  **Hybrid cloud deployment:** A combination of cloud and on-premises infrastructure. This is less likely, but possible if Mozilla has specific requirements for data residency or control.
3.  **On-premises deployment:** Entirely self-managed infrastructure. This is the least likely scenario, given the complexity and cost of managing a large-scale service like Addons Server.

Chosen Solution (Detailed Description): Cloud-based deployment on AWS.

## BUILD

The build process for addons-server likely involves several stages, from development to deployment. Here's a breakdown, focusing on security:

1.  **Development:** Developers write code and commit it to the GitHub repository.
2.  **Continuous Integration (CI):**
    *   A CI system (likely GitHub Actions, based on the repository) automatically triggers builds on each commit.
    *   **Linting:** Code is checked for style and potential errors using linters (e.g., ESLint, pylint).
    *   **Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST):** Code is scanned for security vulnerabilities using SAST tools (e.g., Bandit, Snyk).
    *   **Dependency Scanning:** Dependencies are checked for known vulnerabilities (e.g., using pip-audit or Snyk).
    *   **Unit Tests:** Automated tests are run to verify the functionality of individual components.
    *   **Integration Tests:** Tests are run to verify the interaction between different components.
3.  **Artifact Creation:** If all tests and checks pass, build artifacts are created. This likely includes:
    *   Python packages.
    *   Docker images (for containerized deployment).
4.  **Artifact Storage:** Build artifacts are stored in a secure repository (e.g., AWS ECR for Docker images, a package repository for Python packages).
5.  **Continuous Deployment (CD):**
    *   A CD system (likely integrated with the CI system) automatically deploys the new artifacts to a staging or production environment.
    *   **Smoke Tests:** Basic tests are run in the deployment environment to ensure the application is functioning correctly.
    *   **Security Scanning (of the running application):** Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) might be performed.
