## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Craft Malicious Add-on -> Bypass Validation -> Submit Malicious Add-on](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_craft_malicious_add-on_-_bypass_validation_-_submit_malicious_add-on.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This path represents a direct attack where the attacker creates a malicious add-on designed to evade the security checks implemented by addons-server.
*   **Steps:**
    *   **Craft Malicious Add-on [HR]:**
        *   **Description:** The attacker develops an add-on containing malicious code. This code might perform actions like stealing user data, injecting advertisements, redirecting traffic, or installing further malware. The attacker will likely employ obfuscation techniques to make the malicious code harder to detect.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Medium to High
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
    *   **Bypass Validation [HR]:**
        *   **Description:** The attacker attempts to submit the malicious add-on to the system, circumventing the validation processes. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the validator itself (e.g., a TOCTOU vulnerability), using subtle code constructs that are not flagged by the validator, or exploiting weaknesses in the submission process.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Medium to High
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
    * **Submit Malicious Add-on:**
        *   **Description:** Final step of submitting crafted add-on.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Phish Admin -> Gain Admin Access -> Compromise Add-on Repository](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_phish_admin_-_gain_admin_access_-_compromise_add-on_repository.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This path focuses on compromising an administrator account through social engineering (phishing) to gain control over the add-on repository.
*   **Steps:**
    *   **Phish Admin [HR]:**
        *   **Description:** The attacker sends targeted emails to administrators, impersonating a trusted entity (e.g., Mozilla, a system administrator, a colleague). These emails aim to trick the administrator into revealing their credentials (username and password), clicking on a malicious link, or opening a malicious attachment.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Gain Admin Access [HR]:**
        *   **Description:**  Once the attacker obtains the administrator's credentials, they use them to log in to the addons-server administrative interface.
        *   **Likelihood:** High (if phishing is successful)
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Login attempts from unusual locations or at unusual times might be flagged.)
    * **Compromise Add-on Repository:**
        *  **Description:** With admin access attacker can upload malicious add-ons, modify existing ones.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Social Engineer -> Gain Admin Access -> Compromise Add-on Repository](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_social_engineer_-_gain_admin_access_-_compromise_add-on_repository.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This path focuses on compromising an administrator account through social engineering to gain control over the add-on repository.
*   **Steps:**
    *   **Social Engineer [HR]:**
        *   **Description:** The attacker uses social engineering techniques to trick administrators.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
    *   **Gain Admin Access [HR]:**
        *   **Description:**  Once the attacker obtains the administrator's credentials, they use them to log in to the addons-server administrative interface.
        *   **Likelihood:** High (if social engineering is successful)
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Login attempts from unusual locations or at unusual times might be flagged.)
    * **Compromise Add-on Repository:**
        *  **Description:** With admin access attacker can upload malicious add-ons, modify existing ones.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Modify Key (under Tamper with Signing)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_modify_key__under_tamper_with_signing_.md)

*   **Description:** This represents the attacker gaining access to and modifying or stealing the private signing keys used to sign add-ons. This is a critical node because it undermines the entire trust model of the add-on system.
*   **Likelihood:** Very Low
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Very High
*   **Skill Level:** Expert
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Distribute Malicious Add-ons OR Disrupt Add-on Service (Root Node)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_distribute_malicious_add-ons_or_disrupt_add-on_service__root_node_.md)

* **Description:** This is attacker's main goal.
* **Likelihood:** -
* **Impact:** Very High
* **Effort:** -
* **Skill Level:** -
* **Detection Difficulty:** -
