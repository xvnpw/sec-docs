## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Vulnerabilities in addons-server Application Logic [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_addons-server_application_logic__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Exploiting Web Application Vulnerabilities (1.1) [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]:
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   SQL Injection: Injecting malicious SQL queries to manipulate database operations, potentially leading to data breaches, data modification, or authentication bypass.
            *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Injecting malicious scripts into web pages served by addons-server, targeting users' browsers to steal cookies, redirect users, or deface websites.
            *   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Forcing authenticated users to perform unintended actions on addons-server, such as modifying settings or uploading malicious addons.
            *   Authentication Bypass: Circumventing authentication mechanisms to gain unauthorized access to administrative or user accounts.
            *   Insecure Deserialization: Exploiting vulnerabilities in deserialization processes to execute arbitrary code on the server.
            *   Command Injection: Injecting malicious commands into the server's operating system through vulnerable input fields or parameters.

        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   Authentication and Authorization Flaws: Bypassing or weakening API authentication and authorization mechanisms to gain unauthorized access to API endpoints and data.
            *   Data Exposure: Exploiting vulnerabilities that lead to unintentional exposure of sensitive data through API responses.
            *   API Injection: Injecting malicious payloads into API requests to manipulate server-side logic or data.
            *   Rate Limiting Bypass: Circumventing rate limits to perform excessive API requests, potentially leading to denial of service or brute-force attacks.
    *   Exploiting Dependency Vulnerabilities (1.3) [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]:
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   Leveraging known exploits for vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and frameworks used by addons-server.
