# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a secure and reliable platform for users to discover, install, and manage browser extensions, themes, and other add-ons for Mozilla products, primarily Firefox.
  - Ensure the availability of a wide variety of add-ons to enhance user experience and browser functionality.
  - Protect users from malicious or harmful add-ons.
  - Support the Mozilla ecosystem and community of add-on developers.
  - Maintain the integrity and security of the Firefox browser and user data.

- Most Important Business Risks:
  - Risk of users installing malicious add-ons that could compromise their security and privacy.
  - Risk of platform downtime or performance issues affecting user experience and trust.
  - Risk of legal and reputational damage due to security breaches or distribution of harmful content.
  - Risk of developer dissatisfaction leading to a decrease in the quantity and quality of available add-ons.
  - Risk of supply chain attacks targeting the add-on distribution platform.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Code reviews are likely performed as part of the development process, although not explicitly stated in the provided context. Location: GitHub repository - code review process is standard practice for Mozilla projects.
  - security control: Automated testing including unit and integration tests. Location: GitHub repository - test suites are present in the codebase.
  - security control: Regular security audits and penetration testing. Location: Mozilla's security practices - Mozilla has a dedicated security team and conducts regular security assessments.
  - security control: Input validation and sanitization throughout the application. Location: Codebase - Django framework encourages input validation, and it's expected to be implemented in views and forms.
  - security control: Authentication and authorization mechanisms to manage user accounts and developer access. Location: Codebase - Django's authentication and permission framework is likely used.
  - security control: HTTPS enforced for all communication. Location: Deployment infrastructure - standard practice for web applications, especially those handling user data.
  - security control: Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS attacks. Location: Web application configuration - CSP headers are expected to be configured.
  - security control: Subresource Integrity (SRI) to ensure integrity of loaded resources. Location: Web application configuration - SRI attributes are expected to be used for external resources.
  - security control: Dependency scanning to identify vulnerabilities in third-party libraries. Location: CI/CD pipeline - dependency scanning tools are commonly used in modern development workflows.
  - security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) to identify potential security flaws in the code. Location: CI/CD pipeline - SAST tools can be integrated into the build process.
  - security control: Rate limiting to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks. Location: API gateway or application layer - rate limiting is a common practice for public APIs.
  - security control: Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect against common web attacks. Location: Infrastructure - WAF is typically deployed in front of web applications.
  - security control: Security monitoring and logging to detect and respond to security incidents. Location: Infrastructure and application - logging and monitoring are essential for security operations.
  - accepted risk: Performance impact of security controls. Location: General security vs performance trade-off - security measures can sometimes introduce performance overhead.
  - accepted risk: Complexity of security configurations and maintenance. Location: General security operations - managing security controls can be complex and require ongoing effort.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to identify runtime vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Enhance dependency scanning to include software composition analysis (SCA) for license compliance and deeper vulnerability analysis.
  - security control: Implement Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP) for real-time attack detection and prevention.
  - security control: Introduce more rigorous add-on validation and scanning processes, including static and dynamic analysis of add-on code before distribution.
  - security control: Implement a bug bounty program to encourage external security researchers to find and report vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Regularly review and update security configurations and policies.
  - security control: Conduct security awareness training for developers and operations teams.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - requirement: Secure authentication mechanism for users accessing the platform (e.g., Mozilla accounts).
    - requirement: Secure authentication for add-on developers to manage their add-ons.
    - requirement: Multi-factor authentication (MFA) should be considered for developer accounts and administrative access.
  - Authorization:
    - requirement: Role-based access control (RBAC) to manage permissions for different user roles (e.g., users, developers, administrators, reviewers).
    - requirement: Fine-grained authorization to control access to specific resources and functionalities.
    - requirement: Enforce least privilege principle for all users and services.
  - Input Validation:
    - requirement: Comprehensive input validation for all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., XSS, SQL injection).
    - requirement: Sanitize user-generated content to prevent malicious scripts from being stored and executed.
    - requirement: Validate file uploads to prevent malicious file uploads.
  - Cryptography:
    - requirement: Use strong encryption algorithms and protocols for data in transit (HTTPS) and data at rest (database encryption if applicable).
    - requirement: Securely store and manage cryptographic keys.
    - requirement: Implement proper hashing and salting for password storage.
    - requirement: Ensure compliance with relevant cryptographic standards and regulations.

- Build Process Description:
  - Developer makes code changes and pushes them to the GitHub repository.
  - GitHub Actions CI pipeline is triggered on code push.
  - CI pipeline stages:
    - Checkout Code: Retrieves the latest code from the repository.
    - Build Application: Compiles the application code and builds necessary artifacts.
    - Run Unit Tests: Executes unit tests to verify code functionality.
    - Run Integration Tests: Executes integration tests to verify component interactions.
    - Run SAST (Static Application Security Testing): Performs static code analysis to identify potential security vulnerabilities.
    - Run DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing): Performs dynamic application security testing (if feasible in CI, might be more suitable for staging/pre-prod environments).
    - Run SCA (Software Composition Analysis): Scans dependencies for known vulnerabilities and license compliance issues.
    - Publish Artifacts: Builds container images or packages and pushes them to a container registry.
  - Security Scan Results are evaluated:
    - If scans pass (no critical vulnerabilities found), build artifacts are pushed to the Container Registry.
    - If scans fail (critical vulnerabilities found), developers are notified, and the build process is stopped to prevent deployment of vulnerable code.
  - Build Artifacts (e.g., container images) in the Container Registry are then used for deployment to the target environment.
