# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for mozilla/addons-server

## Mitigation Strategy: [Automated Static Analysis of Addons](./mitigation_strategies/automated_static_analysis_of_addons.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Integrate a static analysis tool on the `addons-server`.
    2.  Configure the `addons-server` to automatically run the static analysis tool against uploaded addon packages upon submission.
    3.  The `addons-server` should be configured to use the tool to detect malicious patterns, vulnerabilities, and policy violations in addon code (JavaScript, manifest files, etc.).
    4.  Implement logic in `addons-server` to automatically reject addon submissions based on critical issues identified by the static analysis tool.
    5.  The `addons-server` should flag less severe issues for manual review and potentially provide warnings to developers through the server's interface.
    6.  Regularly update the static analysis tool and its rules on the `addons-server`.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Addon Uploads (High Severity):** Prevents the server from accepting and distributing addons containing overtly malicious code.
    *   **Vulnerable Addons (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of the server distributing addons with known security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Policy Violations (Medium Severity):** Enforces addon development policies server-side, preventing distribution of non-compliant addons.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Addon Uploads:** High reduction in risk by proactively blocking malicious submissions at the server level.
    *   **Vulnerable Addons:** Medium reduction in risk by identifying and flagging common vulnerabilities server-side, requiring further manual review for complex cases.
    *   **Policy Violations:** Medium reduction in risk by ensuring basic compliance is checked by the server before distribution.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Likely partially implemented in `addons-server`. Look for server-side code related to addon validation during upload and processing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Code Signing and Signature Verification](./mitigation_strategies/code_signing_and_signature_verification.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Configure `addons-server` to require developers to upload digitally signed addon packages.
    2.  Implement a signature verification process within `addons-server` to validate digital signatures of uploaded addons server-side.
    3.  `addons-server` should only accept and distribute addons with valid signatures.
    4.  The server should store and manage information about addon signatures and display signature status in server-generated addon listings and API responses.
    5.  Implement server-side key management and auditing for signing key infrastructure (if `addons-server` manages signing keys).

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Addon Tampering (High Severity):** Server-side verification prevents distribution of tampered addons.
    *   **Malicious Addon Injection (High Severity):** Server-enforced signing makes injection harder in the distribution pipeline.
    *   **Origin Spoofing (Medium Severity):** Server-displayed signature status helps users verify origin based on server-provided information.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Addon Tampering:** High reduction in risk by server-side enforcement of addon integrity.
    *   **Malicious Addon Injection:** High reduction in risk due to server-side authentication of addon origin.
    *   **Origin Spoofing:** Medium reduction in risk by server providing origin verification information to users.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Likely implemented to some extent in `addons-server`. Look for server-side code related to signature verification during addon processing and storage/display of signature information.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Strict Server-Side Enforcement of Signing:** Server-side configuration to strictly enforce signing for all addon distributions.
