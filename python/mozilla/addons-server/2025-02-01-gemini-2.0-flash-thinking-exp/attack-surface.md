# Attack Surface Analysis for mozilla/addons-server

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Addon Upload - Code Injection](./attack_surfaces/malicious_addon_upload_-_code_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers upload addons containing malicious code (JavaScript, WebAssembly, etc.) through `addons-server`'s upload mechanisms, aiming to compromise users' browsers or systems upon installation.
*   **addons-server Contribution:** `addons-server` provides the core functionality for addon upload and is the gateway for addons to be distributed. Vulnerabilities in its upload processing and validation directly enable this attack surface.
*   **Example:** An attacker uploads an addon via the developer portal of `addons-server`. This addon, once installed by users from the platform, executes malicious JavaScript to steal browsing data or perform actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Impact:** Widespread user browser compromise, data exfiltration, malware distribution affecting users who install addons from `addons-server`, severe reputational damage to the platform.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Strong Addon Validation:** Implement multi-layered validation including static analysis, dynamic analysis (sandboxing), and manual review processes *within `addons-server`*.
        *   **Strict Content Security Policy (CSP) Enforcement:**  `addons-server` should enforce strict CSP for addon pages and contexts to limit the capabilities of uploaded code, even if malicious.
        *   **Regular Security Audits of Validation Pipeline:**  Continuously audit and penetration test the addon validation pipeline of `addons-server` to identify and fix bypass vulnerabilities.
        *   **Automated Malware Scanning Integration:** Integrate with robust malware scanning services *within `addons-server`'s workflow* to detect known malicious patterns in addon packages.
    *   **Users:** (Limited direct mitigation, platform responsibility is primary)
        *   Install addons only from verified developers and sources *within the `addons-server` ecosystem if such verification exists*.
        *   Rely on the platform's security measures and report suspicious addons to the platform administrators.

## Attack Surface: [Addon Validation Bypass](./attack_surfaces/addon_validation_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers discover and exploit weaknesses in `addons-server`'s addon validation logic to upload malicious addons that should have been rejected.
*   **addons-server Contribution:** The complexity and implementation of `addons-server`'s validation system are the direct source of potential bypass vulnerabilities. Weaknesses in code, logic flaws, or incomplete coverage in validation rules create this attack surface.
*   **Example:** An attacker finds a way to obfuscate malicious JavaScript code within an addon package that bypasses the static analysis tools used by `addons-server`. The addon is then published and distributed.
*   **Impact:** Malicious addons are distributed through `addons-server`, leading to user compromise, data theft, and erosion of trust in the platform's security. Undermines the core security promise of the addon platform.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Comprehensive Validation Rule Sets:** Develop and maintain extensive and regularly updated validation rules *within `addons-server`*, covering various attack vectors and code patterns.
        *   **Fuzzing and Negative Testing:** Employ fuzzing and negative testing techniques specifically against the `addons-server` validation engine to uncover edge cases and bypasses.
        *   **Security Research Collaboration:** Engage with security researchers and bug bounty programs to incentivize the discovery and reporting of validation bypass vulnerabilities in `addons-server`.
        *   **Continuous Monitoring and Improvement:** Continuously monitor the effectiveness of validation processes and adapt them based on new attack techniques and feedback.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Addon Delivery Infrastructure](./attack_surfaces/compromised_addon_delivery_infrastructure.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers compromise the infrastructure (servers, CDNs, storage) managed or relied upon by `addons-server` to deliver addon files, enabling them to replace legitimate addons with malicious ones during distribution.
*   **addons-server Contribution:** `addons-server`'s architecture and deployment choices directly determine the delivery infrastructure. If `addons-server` uses insecure infrastructure or has misconfigurations in its delivery pipeline, it creates this attack surface.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the CDN account used by `addons-server` to host addon files. They replace the legitimate file for a popular addon with a malicious version. Users downloading or updating this addon from `addons-server` will receive the compromised file.
*   **Impact:** Wide-scale distribution of malicious addons affecting potentially all users of `addons-server`.  Massive user compromise, data theft, and catastrophic reputational damage to the platform, potentially leading to complete loss of user trust.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Secure Infrastructure Configuration:** Implement robust security hardening and configuration management for all infrastructure components *managed by or for `addons-server`* involved in addon delivery.
        *   **Access Control and Monitoring:** Enforce strict access controls and continuous monitoring of the addon delivery infrastructure *managed by or for `addons-server`* for unauthorized access and modifications.
        *   **Integrity Verification:** Implement cryptographic integrity checks (e.g., signed URLs, checksums) *within `addons-server`'s delivery mechanism* to ensure addon files are not tampered with during delivery.
        *   **Incident Response Plan:** Develop and regularly test an incident response plan specifically for infrastructure compromise scenarios affecting addon delivery *within the context of `addons-server` operations*.

## Attack Surface: [API Authentication and Authorization Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/api_authentication_and_authorization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Weaknesses in the API authentication and authorization mechanisms of `addons-server`'s developer and client-facing APIs allow unauthorized actions, such as malicious addon updates or data breaches.
*   **addons-server Contribution:** `addons-server`'s API design and implementation are directly responsible for the security of its APIs. Flaws in authentication, authorization, or session management within `addons-server`'s API layer create this attack surface.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits an API authentication vulnerability in `addons-server` to impersonate a legitimate addon developer. They then use the API to push a malicious update to a popular addon, bypassing normal validation processes because they are authenticated as the developer.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized manipulation of addons, potential distribution of malicious updates, data breaches through API access, account takeover of developers, and denial of service attacks against API endpoints.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Secure API Authentication:** Implement robust and industry-standard API authentication mechanisms *within `addons-server`*, such as OAuth 2.0 or API keys with proper rotation and management.
        *   **Granular Authorization Controls:** Enforce fine-grained authorization checks *within `addons-server`'s API layer* to ensure users can only access and modify resources they are explicitly permitted to.
        *   **API Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Regularly audit and penetration test `addons-server`'s APIs specifically for authentication, authorization, and injection vulnerabilities.
        *   **Rate Limiting and Abuse Prevention:** Implement rate limiting and abuse detection mechanisms *within `addons-server`'s API infrastructure* to protect against brute-force attacks and denial-of-service attempts.
