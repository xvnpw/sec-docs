Here are the high and critical attack surfaces that directly involve `addons-server`:

*   **Attack Surface:** Malicious Add-on Upload
    *   **Description:** Attackers upload add-ons containing malicious code or functionality.
    *   **How addons-server contributes to the attack surface:** `addons-server` provides the primary mechanism for developers to upload and distribute their add-ons. Without proper security measures, this upload process becomes a direct entry point for malicious code.
    *   **Example:** A developer uploads an add-on that injects JavaScript into every webpage a user visits, stealing their credentials.
    *   **Impact:** User data compromise, system compromise, browser hijacking, participation in botnets.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust static and dynamic code analysis tools during the add-on review process. Enforce strict code signing and verification. Utilize sandboxing or containerization for add-on execution during review.
        *   **Users:** Install add-ons only from trusted sources and developers. Review add-on permissions carefully before installation. Keep browser and add-on versions up-to-date.

*   **Attack Surface:** Compromised Add-on Update Mechanism
    *   **Description:** Attackers compromise the update mechanism to push malicious updates to existing users of legitimate add-ons.
    *   **How addons-server contributes to the attack surface:** `addons-server` manages the distribution of add-on updates. If this process is not secured, attackers can exploit it.
    *   **Example:** An attacker compromises a developer's update server and pushes a malicious update that installs ransomware on user machines.
    *   **Impact:** Widespread user compromise, data loss, system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Secure their update servers rigorously. Implement strong authentication and authorization for update pushes. Sign update packages cryptographically.
        *   **Users:** Ensure automatic updates are enabled for add-ons. Be cautious of unusual update prompts or behaviors.

*   **Attack Surface:** Developer Account Takeover
    *   **Description:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to developer accounts on `addons-server`.
    *   **How addons-server contributes to the attack surface:** `addons-server` manages developer accounts and their associated privileges for uploading and managing add-ons. Weak account security makes it a target.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uses stolen credentials to log into a developer account and uploads a malicious version of a popular add-on.
    *   **Impact:** Distribution of malicious add-ons, reputation damage for legitimate developers, widespread user compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Enforce strong password policies and multi-factor authentication (MFA). Regularly review account activity. Secure their development environments.
        *   **Users:**  This is primarily a developer-side issue, but users benefit from `addons-server` enforcing strong developer account security.

*   **Attack Surface:** API Abuse (Developer Focused)
    *   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities or lack of proper controls in the developer-facing APIs of `addons-server`.
    *   **How addons-server contributes to the attack surface:** `addons-server` exposes APIs for developers to manage their add-ons (upload, update, etc.). Weaknesses in these APIs can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the add-on submission API to bypass review processes or inject malicious metadata.
    *   **Impact:** Circumvention of security controls, potential for malicious add-on distribution, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all API endpoints. Enforce strict authentication and authorization. Implement rate limiting and API usage monitoring. Conduct regular security audits of the API.

*   **Attack Surface:** Add-on Review Process Bypass
    *   **Description:** Attackers find ways to circumvent the add-on review process, allowing malicious add-ons to be published.
    *   **How addons-server contributes to the attack surface:** `addons-server`'s review process is a critical security control. Weaknesses or loopholes in this process can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts an add-on that appears benign during automated checks but contains malicious code that is triggered later or under specific conditions.
    *   **Impact:** Distribution of malicious add-ons, user compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Continuously improve and refine the automated and manual review processes. Employ a combination of static and dynamic analysis techniques. Implement human review by trained security experts. Encourage community reporting of suspicious add-ons.
