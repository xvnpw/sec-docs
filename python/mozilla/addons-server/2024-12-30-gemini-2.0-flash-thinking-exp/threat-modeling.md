### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving addons-server

Here are the high and critical threats from the previous list that directly involve the `addons-server` component:

*   **Threat:** Malicious Addon Upload
    *   **Description:** An attacker, posing as a legitimate developer or using a compromised account, uploads an addon containing malicious code (e.g., malware, spyware, cryptominers). This addon is then hosted on the `addons-server` and potentially distributed to users of the application.
    *   **Impact:** Users installing the malicious addon could have their devices compromised, leading to data theft, system instability, or inclusion in botnets. The application's reputation could be severely damaged due to the distribution of malicious software through its platform.
    *   **Affected Component:** Addon Upload API, Addon Validation Modules, File Storage System.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust server-side validation of addon packages, including static and dynamic analysis.
        *   Utilize a sandboxed environment for addon execution during validation.
        *   Implement code signing for addons to verify the developer's identity.
        *   Establish a clear process for reporting and removing malicious addons.

*   **Threat:** Supply Chain Attacks via Compromised Addon Developers
    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises the account of a legitimate addon developer and uploads malicious updates to existing, trusted addons. This affects all users who have installed the compromised addon.
    *   **Impact:** Widespread distribution of malware through previously trusted channels, potentially affecting a large number of users. This can severely damage user trust in the addon ecosystem.
    *   **Affected Component:** Addon Update API, Developer Authentication System.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong multi-factor authentication for addon developer accounts.
        *   Implement mechanisms for developers to securely manage their API keys and credentials.
        *   Provide developers with tools to monitor their account activity for suspicious behavior.
        *   Implement a delay or review process for updates to popular addons.

*   **Threat:** Insufficient Addon Validation
    *   **Description:** Weak or incomplete validation processes on the `addons-server` fail to detect vulnerabilities or malicious code within uploaded addons.
    *   **Impact:** Malicious or vulnerable addons can be distributed to users, leading to various security risks.
    *   **Affected Component:** Addon Validation Modules, Static Analysis Tools, Dynamic Analysis Environment.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Continuously improve and update addon validation processes, incorporating both static and dynamic analysis techniques.
        *   Utilize industry-standard security scanning tools and techniques.
        *   Establish clear criteria for addon rejection based on security findings.
        *   Regularly review and update validation rules to address new threats.

*   **Threat:** Compromised Addon Delivery
    *   **Description:** The infrastructure used to deliver addons from the `addons-server` is compromised, allowing attackers to inject malicious code into addon packages during transit.
    *   **Impact:** Users download and install compromised addons, even if the original uploaded version was clean. This bypasses upload validation checks.
    *   **Affected Component:** Addon Download API, CDN or File Delivery System.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong security measures for the addon delivery infrastructure, including access controls and intrusion detection systems.
        *   Utilize HTTPS for all addon downloads to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
        *   Implement integrity checks (e.g., checksums or digital signatures) for addon packages to verify their authenticity before installation.

*   **Threat:** Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Addon Downloads
    *   **Description:** Attackers intercept addon download requests and inject malicious code into the addon package before it reaches the user, if the connection is not properly secured by the `addons-server`.
    *   **Impact:** Users install compromised addons, even if the `addons-server` itself is secure.
    *   **Affected Component:** Addon Download API, Network Communication (specifically the enforcement of HTTPS).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce HTTPS for all addon downloads and ensure proper certificate validation on the `addons-server`.

*   **Threat:** API Abuse for Malicious Purposes
    *   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the `addons-server` API to automate the upload of malicious addons, manipulate addon metadata, or perform other unauthorized actions at scale.
    *   **Impact:** Rapid proliferation of malicious addons, potential disruption of the addon platform, and damage to the reputation of the application using `addons-server`.
    *   **Affected Component:** All `addons-server` API endpoints.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust authentication and authorization for all API endpoints.
        *   Enforce rate limiting to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
        *   Regularly audit and penetration test the API for vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks.

*   **Threat:** Authentication and Authorization Issues with the addons-server API
    *   **Description:** Weak authentication or authorization mechanisms for accessing the `addons-server` API allow unauthorized parties to manage addons or access sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized management of addons, potential data breaches, and compromise of the addon ecosystem.
    *   **Affected Component:** API Authentication and Authorization Modules.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication mechanisms, such as API keys with proper scoping and rotation.
        *   Enforce the principle of least privilege for API access.
        *   Regularly review and update API access controls.
