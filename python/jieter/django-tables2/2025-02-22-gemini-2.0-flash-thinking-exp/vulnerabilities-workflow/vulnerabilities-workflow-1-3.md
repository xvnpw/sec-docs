Based on the analysis, no vulnerabilities meeting the specified criteria were identified in the project.

The analysis focused on identifying high or critical vulnerabilities exploitable by external attackers on a public instance, excluding:

- Vulnerabilities caused by developers' insecure use of the library.
- Issues related only to missing documentation.
- Denial of service vulnerabilities.

No vulnerabilities of high or critical rank were found that are:

- Valid and not already mitigated within the `django-tables2` project itself.
- Triggerable by an external attacker on a publicly available instance of an application using `django-tables2`.
- Not denial of service vulnerabilities.
- Not caused by developers explicitly using insecure code patterns in their application code when utilizing `django-tables2`.
- Not solely due to missing documentation requiring mitigation.

Therefore, there are no vulnerabilities to list according to the provided requirements.
