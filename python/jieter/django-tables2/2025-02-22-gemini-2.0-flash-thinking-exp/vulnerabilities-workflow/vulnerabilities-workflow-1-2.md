- **Vulnerability Name:** Unauthenticated Data Export Vulnerability  
  - **Description:**  
    The `ExportMixin` (used in the `FilteredPersonListView`) automatically “exports” a table’s complete dataset when it detects a valid export trigger (by default, the GET parameter `_export`). An external attacker can simply append (for example, `?_export=csv`) to the URL of any publicly accessible view that uses `ExportMixin` and receive an export of all rows—even bypassing any pagination or UI restrictions.  
    **Step‑by‑step trigger:**  
    1. Identify a view (such as the one provided by `FilteredPersonListView`) that employs `ExportMixin`.  
    2. Issue a GET request to the view URL (e.g. `/filtered/`) without authentication.  
    3. Append `?_export=csv` (or another supported format) to the URL.  
    4. Receive an export (CSV or XLS) of the entire dataset.
  - **Impact:**  
    An attacker is able to exfiltrate potentially sensitive or confidential data in bulk, bypassing any UI restrictions or client‑side pagination. This can lead to serious data breaches.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
    The export mixin validates the export trigger and format but does not enforce any authentication or authorization checks.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**  
    Access control measures (such as authentication and authorization checks) or CSRF/non‑GET method verification must be implemented before triggering export.
  - **Preconditions:**  
    A publicly accessible view employing `ExportMixin` exists and it lacks proper authentication/authorization checks.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**  
    - In `/code/example/app/views.py`, the class `FilteredPersonListView` extends `ExportMixin` without any additional checks.  
    - The GET parameter `_export` (e.g. `/?_export=csv`) is used to trigger the export of the table data, and the mixin immediately returns the export response without verifying the requestor’s identity.
  - **Security Test Case:**  
    1. Deploy the Django application using the view that employs `ExportMixin` (with no extra access control).  
    2. In a browser or via a tool like curl, visit the URL normally (e.g. `http://example.com/filtered/`).  
    3. Append the export trigger to the query string (e.g. `http://example.com/filtered/?_export=csv`).  
    4. Verify that the response is a complete CSV (or XLS) export of the full dataset without any authentication prompt.

- **Vulnerability Name:** DEBUG Mode Enabled in Production  
  - **Description:**  
    The example project settings (in `/code/example/settings.py`) have `DEBUG = True` and `ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["*"]`. When an application is deployed with DEBUG enabled, any error (for example, visiting a non‑existent URL) results in a detailed error page that includes stack traces, settings, and potentially sensitive configuration details.  
    **Step‑by‑step trigger:**  
    1. Deploy the application with the provided example settings.  
    2. Visit an invalid URL or trigger an error.  
    3. The application returns a detailed error page with internal information.
  - **Impact:**  
    Detailed error pages may disclose internal file paths, configuration settings (such as database settings), and portions of the source code. This information facilitates reconnaissance against the application.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical  
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
    No mitigation exists; the application uses development settings unconditionally.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**  
    In production, `DEBUG` must be set to `False` and `ALLOWED_HOSTS` should be restricted to trusted domain names.
  - **Preconditions:**  
    The application is deployed using the `/code/example/settings.py` configuration without modifications.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**  
    - The settings file (`/code/example/settings.py`) includes:  
      ```
      DEBUG = True
      ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["*"]
      ```  
    - This configuration causes any unhandled exception to display detailed debug information publicly.
  - **Security Test Case:**  
    1. Deploy the application using the provided settings.  
    2. Navigate to a URL that will trigger an error (for example, a non‑existent page).  
    3. Confirm that a detailed error page with a stack trace and configuration details is shown.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Weak SECRET_KEY in Production  
  - **Description:**  
    The `SECRET_KEY` is hard‑coded in the example settings (`SECRET_KEY = "this is super secret"`), making it easily guessable. In Django, the `SECRET_KEY` is used for cryptographic signing (for sessions, CSRF protection, password reset tokens, etc.).  
    **Step‑by‑step trigger:**  
    1. Deploy the application using the provided settings.  
    2. An attacker who discovers the weak key can use it to forge session cookies or CSRF tokens.
  - **Impact:**  
    With a known secret key, an attacker can forge cryptographically signed data. This may result in session hijacking, unauthorized actions, or data tampering.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical  
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
    There is no mitigation; the insecure key is statically defined in the settings.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**  
    A strong, randomly generated secret key must be used for production – ideally supplied via a secure environment variable.
  - **Preconditions:**  
    The application is deployed unmodified from `/code/example/settings.py`, thereby using the weak secret key.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**  
    - In `/code/example/settings.py`, the line  
      ```
      SECRET_KEY = "this is super secret"
      ```  
      is used, which is not unique or random.
  - **Security Test Case:**  
    1. Deploy the application with the provided settings.  
    2. Using the known value of the `SECRET_KEY`, attempt to craft a session cookie or CSRF token that the server accepts.  
    3. If successful, this confirms that the cryptographic signing is compromised by the weak key.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Media File Serving Vulnerability  
  - **Description:**  
    The URL configuration (in `/code/example/urls.py`) includes a route that serves media files via Django’s built‑in static file server:  
    ```
    path("media/<path>", static.serve, {"document_root": settings.MEDIA_ROOT}),
    ```  
    This view is intended only for development and lacks production‑grade security controls.  
    **Step‑by‑step trigger:**  
    1. Deploy the application in a production‑like environment using the example URL configuration.  
    2. Access files under `/media/` using crafted URLs (or directory traversal strings).
  - **Impact:**  
    An attacker may be able to access or traverse directories within the `MEDIA_ROOT`, potentially leading to unauthorized disclosure of sensitive files.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
    The project relies on Django’s development static file server (`django.views.static.serve`), which does not enforce strict protections.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**  
    In production, media files should be served by a dedicated web server (e.g. Nginx or Apache) that applies proper access restrictions rather than using Django’s development view.
  - **Preconditions:**  
    The application is deployed in a production‑like environment with the provided URL configuration, leaving `/media/` openly accessible.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**  
    - The URL configuration in `/code/example/urls.py` includes:  
      ```
      path("media/<path>", static.serve, {"document_root": settings.MEDIA_ROOT}),
      ```  
      which means that any file under `MEDIA_ROOT` can be served without additional security checks.
  - **Security Test Case:**  
    1. Deploy the application with the example URL configuration (simulating production).  
    2. Request known media files (or attempt directory traversal via paths such as `../`) using URLs like `http://example.com/media/sensitive_file.pdf`.  
    3. Verify that files are served without authentication or access control.
