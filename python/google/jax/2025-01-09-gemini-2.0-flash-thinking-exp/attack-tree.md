## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit JAX Compilation/Execution Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_jax_compilationexecution_vulnerabilities.md)

This category represents vulnerabilities that can be exploited during the process of JAX compiling Python code into optimized kernels or during the execution of these kernels. Successful exploitation in this area often leads to arbitrary code execution, making it a critical concern.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code during JIT Compilation](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_during_jit_compilation.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker gains control over input data that is passed to a JAX function which is then Just-In-Time (JIT) compiled. By crafting this input carefully, the attacker can inject malicious code that gets incorporated into the compiled kernel. When this kernel is executed, the injected malicious code runs with the privileges of the application.
* **Likelihood:** Medium
* **Impact:** High (Arbitrary Code Execution)
* **Effort:** Medium
* **Skill Level:** Intermediate/Expert
* **Detection Difficulty:** Difficult

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit JAX Interoperability and External Interfaces](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_jax_interoperability_and_external_interfaces.md)

This category focuses on vulnerabilities arising from JAX's interaction with external data sources, libraries, and systems. Improper handling of data at these interfaces can create significant security risks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Serialization/Deserialization Flaws](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_serializationdeserialization_flaws.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application serializes JAX data (e.g., using `jax.numpy.save`, `jax.numpy.load`, or custom serialization methods) and later deserializes it. If the deserialization process is not handled securely, a maliciously crafted serialized data stream from an attacker can trigger vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities can range from arbitrary code execution (by injecting executable code or objects) to data corruption.
* **Likelihood:** Medium
* **Impact:** High (Arbitrary Code Execution, Data Corruption)
* **Effort:** Medium
* **Skill Level:** Intermediate/Expert
* **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit External Libraries Used by JAX](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_external_libraries_used_by_jax.md)

**Attack Vector:** JAX relies on various external libraries (e.g., XLA, specific backend libraries for GPU/TPU support). If these external libraries contain security vulnerabilities, an attacker might be able to indirectly exploit them through the JAX application. This could involve providing specific inputs or triggering particular JAX functions that interact with the vulnerable part of the external library. The impact depends on the nature of the vulnerability in the external library.
* **Likelihood:** Medium
* **Impact:** High (Depends on the vulnerability in the external library, can range from DoS to RCE)
* **Effort:** Low/Medium
* **Skill Level:** Intermediate (using existing exploits) to Expert (developing new exploits)
* **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit JAX's Custom Operation Mechanism (CustomCall)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_jax's_custom_operation_mechanism__customcall_.md)

This category highlights the risks associated with JAX's ability to integrate custom, often native code operations. While powerful, this feature introduces a significant attack surface if not managed securely.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Custom Operations](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_custom_operations.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the application allows users (or potentially attackers) to define or upload custom JAX operations (using `jax.experimental.jax_c.CustomCall` or similar mechanisms), an attacker can provide a malicious custom operation. This operation, written in C++, CUDA, or another language, can contain arbitrary code that executes when the custom operation is invoked by the JAX application.
* **Likelihood:** Medium
* **Impact:** High (Arbitrary Code Execution)
* **Effort:** Medium
* **Skill Level:** Intermediate/Expert
* **Detection Difficulty:** Difficult

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Existing Custom Operations](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_existing_custom_operations.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application utilizes custom JAX operations that were developed internally or by a third party. These custom operations, being native code, are susceptible to common vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, format string bugs, or improper handling of input data. An attacker can craft specific inputs to these custom operations to trigger these vulnerabilities, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or other malicious outcomes.
* **Likelihood:** Low/Medium
* **Impact:** High (Arbitrary Code Execution, depending on the vulnerability)
* **Effort:** Medium/High
* **Skill Level:** Intermediate/Expert
* **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate/Difficult
