# Assume we have a custom operation defined in a shared library (e.g., custom_op.so)

  # Imagine the C++ code takes input_data as a filename and executes it
  # This is a command injection vulnerability.
  os.system(f"cat {input_data}") # VERY DANGEROUS - DO NOT DO THIS IN REAL CODE

  # In a real scenario, the custom op might perform some computation
  # and return a JAX array. Here, we just return a placeholder.
  return jnp.array([0])

# Register the custom operation with JAX
# (In reality, this involves more complex setup with shared libraries)

# --- Potential Attack Scenarios ---

# Scenario 1: Direct Input Injection

# An attacker might be able to control the 'data' passed to process_data.
# If 'data' is used directly in the custom operation without sanitization,
# it can lead to command injection.

attacker_controlled_input = "; cat /etc/passwd" # Malicious input

# Scenario 2: Replacing the Custom Operation (More complex)

# the environment or the way JAX loads custom operations.

# Imagine the attacker replaces the 'vulnerable_custom_op' with a malicious one.

# Restore the original function (for demonstration purposes)

# Scenario 3: Vulnerability within the Custom Operation's Native Code (Out of scope for this Python example)

# This is the most common scenario. The vulnerability lies in the C/C++ or CUDA code.
# Examples:
# - Buffer overflows: Passing overly large input that overwrites memory.
# - Format string bugs: Passing specially crafted strings that allow memory access.
# - Use-after-free: Accessing memory that has already been freed.

# Mitigation Strategies (Illustrative - not exhaustive)

# 1. Input Validation:
def safe_custom_op(input_data):
  """A safer version with input validation."""
  if not isinstance(input_data, str) or ".." in input_data or ";" in input_data:
    raise ValueError("Invalid input")
  # ... (rest of the custom operation logic)
  return jnp.array([0])

# 2. Sandboxing (More complex - requires system-level tools):
# - Use containers (Docker) to isolate the application.
# - Employ seccomp profiles to restrict system calls made by the custom operation.

# 3. Secure Coding Practices in Custom Operations:
# - Avoid using system calls directly if possible.
# - Carefully manage memory to prevent buffer overflows and use-after-free errors.
# - Sanitize all inputs received by the custom operation.
# - Follow the principle of least privilege for the custom operation's execution.
