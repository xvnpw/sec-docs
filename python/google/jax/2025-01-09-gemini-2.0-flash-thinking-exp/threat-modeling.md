# Threat Model Analysis for google/jax

## Threat: [Malicious Code Injection during JIT Compilation](./threats/malicious_code_injection_during_jit_compilation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input data designed to exploit vulnerabilities *within JAX's* JIT compilation process. This could involve providing specially crafted numerical values or data structures that, when processed by the JAX compiler, lead to the inclusion of arbitrary code in the compiled output. This injected code would then execute with the privileges of the JAX process.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server or client machine running the JAX application. This could lead to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected JAX Component:** `jax.jit` function, XLA compiler (as part of JAX).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize and validate all input data rigorously before it is processed by JAX.
        *   Keep JAX updated to the latest versions to patch known compiler vulnerabilities.
        *   Run JAX processes with the least necessary privileges.
        *   Consider using secure sandboxing techniques if executing JAX with untrusted inputs.

## Threat: [Gradient Manipulation for Model Subversion](./threats/gradient_manipulation_for_model_subversion.md)

*   **Description:** In machine learning applications using JAX's automatic differentiation capabilities, an attacker could attempt to manipulate the gradient computation process. This could involve crafting adversarial inputs that lead to misleading gradients, causing the model to learn incorrect patterns or make biased predictions. This manipulation directly leverages *JAX's* autodiff functionality.
    *   **Impact:** Compromised integrity of the machine learning model, leading to incorrect predictions, biased outcomes, or even security vulnerabilities if the model is used for security-critical tasks.
    *   **Affected JAX Component:** `jax.grad`, `jax.vmap`, and related autodiff functions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Employ robust adversarial training techniques to make models more resilient to gradient manipulation.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent the injection of obvious adversarial examples.
        *   Monitor model performance and behavior for signs of manipulation.

## Threat: [Memory Access Violations on GPUs/TPUs](./threats/memory_access_violations_on_gpustpus.md)

*   **Description:** If *JAX code itself* contains bugs related to memory management when running on GPUs or TPUs, an attacker who can control inputs or trigger specific code paths could potentially cause memory access violations. This could lead to crashes or, in more severe cases, the ability to read or write arbitrary memory on the accelerator. This directly relates to how JAX manages memory on these devices.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service due to crashes, potential information disclosure from accelerator memory, or even the possibility of executing code on the GPU/TPU.
    *   **Affected JAX Component:**  XLA runtime (as part of JAX), GPU/TPU backend interfaces within JAX.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Adhere to best practices for memory management when writing JAX code that targets accelerators.
        *   Thoroughly test JAX applications on the intended hardware to identify and fix memory-related bugs.
        *   Keep JAX and its accelerator drivers updated to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        *   Isolate JAX processes running on accelerators to limit the impact of potential memory corruption.

## Threat: [Unsafe Deserialization of JAX Objects](./threats/unsafe_deserialization_of_jax_objects.md)

*   **Description:** If *JAX objects* (e.g., compiled functions using `jax.jit`, model parameters) are serialized (e.g., using `pickle` or custom serialization methods) and then deserialized from untrusted sources, this could lead to arbitrary code execution. The deserialization process might instantiate objects or execute code embedded within the serialized data. This vulnerability stems from how JAX objects are handled during serialization.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the system where the deserialization occurs, leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected JAX Component:** Any function or module involved in serializing and deserializing JAX objects (e.g., custom saving/loading routines, potentially leveraging Python's `pickle` with JAX objects).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never deserialize JAX objects from untrusted or unauthenticated sources.**
        *   If deserialization from external sources is necessary, use secure serialization formats and libraries that are less prone to code execution vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement integrity checks (e.g., digital signatures) on serialized JAX objects to verify their authenticity and prevent tampering.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Distributed JAX Communication](./threats/man-in-the-middle_attacks_on_distributed_jax_communication.md)

*   **Description:** When using *JAX's distributed capabilities* across multiple devices or machines, communication between these nodes might be vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks if not properly secured. An attacker could intercept, eavesdrop on, or even modify the data being exchanged between JAX processes. This threat specifically targets JAX's distributed functionality.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure of sensitive data being transmitted between JAX nodes, corruption of computations due to modified data, or even the ability to inject malicious commands into the distributed system.
    *   **Affected JAX Component:** `jax.distributed` module, any custom communication logic built directly using JAX's distributed primitives.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use secure communication protocols like TLS/SSL to encrypt communication channels between JAX nodes.
        *   Implement mutual authentication between JAX processes to verify the identity of communicating parties.
        *   Ensure the network infrastructure used for distributed JAX computations is secure and protected from unauthorized access.
