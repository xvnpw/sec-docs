# Attack Surface Analysis for google/jax

## Attack Surface: [Code Injection via JAX Transformations](./attack_surfaces/code_injection_via_jax_transformations.md)

**Description:** Malicious code can be injected and executed through the improper handling of user-controlled inputs within JAX transformations like `jax.jit`, `jax.vmap`, or `jax.pmap`.

**How JAX Contributes:** JAX's ability to compile and execute arbitrary Python functions, especially when combined with transformations that operate on these functions based on input, creates an opportunity for code injection if input isn't carefully sanitized.

**Example:** An application allows users to define the shape of a JAX array. A malicious user provides a shape string like `'os.system("rm -rf /")'` which, if directly used in a JAX transformation, could lead to command execution on the server.

**Impact:** Critical - Full compromise of the server or execution environment, data loss, and potential for further attacks.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Strict Input Validation:  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user-provided inputs before using them in JAX transformations. Use whitelisting and avoid directly using raw input to define function behavior or data structures.
*   Principle of Least Privilege: Run JAX computations with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of successful code injection.
*   Sandboxing: Isolate JAX execution within a sandbox environment to restrict the actions that injected code can perform.

## Attack Surface: [Memory Corruption in Custom C++ Kernels](./attack_surfaces/memory_corruption_in_custom_c++_kernels.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, use-after-free, or other memory safety issues in custom C++ kernels registered with JAX can be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution.

**How JAX Contributes:** JAX allows developers to extend its functionality with custom C++ kernels. If these kernels are not implemented securely, they introduce a direct pathway for memory corruption vulnerabilities.

**Example:** A custom kernel processing image data has a buffer overflow vulnerability. A specially crafted input image exceeding the buffer size can overwrite memory, potentially allowing an attacker to control the execution flow.

**Impact:** Critical - Arbitrary code execution on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure C++ Development Practices: Adhere to strict memory management practices, use safe string handling functions, and employ static and dynamic analysis tools during the development of custom kernels.
*   Thorough Testing and Auditing: Rigorously test custom kernels with various inputs, including edge cases and potentially malicious data. Conduct security audits of the kernel code.
*   Input Validation in Kernels: Validate all inputs passed to custom kernels to ensure they are within expected bounds and formats.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities in JAX Data Structures](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_jax_data_structures.md)

**Description:**  If the application deserializes JAX data structures (e.g., using `jax.numpy.load`) from untrusted sources, vulnerabilities in the deserialization process could be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

**How JAX Contributes:** JAX provides functionalities for saving and loading its data structures. If these mechanisms are used to handle data from untrusted sources without proper safeguards, it opens the door to deserialization attacks.

**Example:** An application loads a JAX array from a file provided by a user. A malicious user crafts a file containing a serialized JAX array with embedded malicious code that gets executed during the deserialization process.

**Impact:** High - Potential for arbitrary code execution on the server.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid Deserializing Untrusted Data:  Do not deserialize JAX data structures from untrusted or unauthenticated sources.
*   Integrity Checks: Implement integrity checks (e.g., cryptographic signatures) on serialized JAX data to ensure it hasn't been tampered with.
*   Secure Serialization Libraries: If alternative serialization methods are used, ensure they are known to be secure and regularly updated.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion during JAX Compilation](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_during_jax_compilation.md)

**Description:** Maliciously crafted JAX code or inputs can trigger computationally expensive compilation processes, leading to denial of service by consuming excessive CPU or memory resources.

**How JAX Contributes:** JAX's just-in-time compilation process can be computationally intensive. If an attacker can influence the compilation process with complex or deeply nested operations, they can force the system to expend significant resources.

**Example:** A user provides a JAX function with an extremely large and complex computation graph that, when `jax.jit` is applied, consumes all available CPU resources, making the application unresponsive.

**Impact:** High - Denial of service, impacting application availability.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Timeouts and Resource Limits: Implement timeouts and resource limits for JAX compilation processes to prevent them from consuming excessive resources.
*   Input Complexity Limits:  Impose limits on the complexity of user-provided JAX code or input data that could trigger expensive compilations.
*   Rate Limiting: Limit the frequency of JAX compilation requests from individual users or sources.
