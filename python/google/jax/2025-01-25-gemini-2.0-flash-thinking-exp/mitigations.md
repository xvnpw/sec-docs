## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization for JAX Functions](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization_for_jax_functions.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Input Validation and Sanitization for JAX Functions
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify JAX Input Points:**  Pinpoint all locations where external data is directly used as input to JAX functions, especially those that are JIT-compiled. This includes arguments to `jax.jit`, `jax.pmap`, `jax.vmap`, and other JAX transformation functions.
    2.  **Define JAX Input Schemas:** For each JAX input point, define strict schemas specifying the expected data types, shapes, and ranges of JAX arrays (or other JAX compatible data structures). Consider the numerical stability and expected behavior of JAX functions with different input ranges.
    3.  **Implement JAX Input Validation Logic:** Write code that uses JAX or NumPy functions to validate input data *before* it is passed to JAX transformations or computations. Leverage `jax.numpy` functions for efficient validation within JAX contexts if possible. Check array shapes, data types (using `jax.numpy.dtype`), and numerical ranges (using `jax.numpy.min`, `jax.numpy.max`, etc.).
    4.  **Sanitize JAX Input Data (If Necessary):** If sanitization is needed for JAX inputs (e.g., clipping values to a safe range, normalizing data), use JAX or NumPy functions to perform these operations efficiently within the JAX ecosystem.
    5.  **Handle Invalid JAX Input:** Implement error handling within your JAX application to gracefully manage invalid input. Raise informative exceptions or return error codes when JAX input validation fails. Ensure that invalid input does not lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities in JAX computations.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **JIT Compilation Exploits (High Severity):** Prevents malicious or unexpected input from triggering vulnerabilities during JIT compilation within JAX, such as code injection or unexpected program behavior due to type confusion or out-of-bounds access.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion via JAX Computations (Medium Severity):** Limits the potential for malicious input to cause excessively large or complex JAX computations by controlling the shape and size of input arrays, mitigating potential Denial of Service through computational overload within JAX.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **JIT Compilation Exploits:** High risk reduction. Directly addresses the vulnerability by ensuring only validated and expected data reaches the JIT compiler and JAX runtime, reducing the attack surface for JIT-related exploits.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion via JAX Computations:** Medium risk reduction. Helps control computational complexity within JAX, but might not prevent all forms of resource exhaustion if validation is not comprehensive enough or if vulnerabilities exist in JAX itself.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic data type validation is performed in some data loading pipelines before data enters JAX computations in `data_processing.py`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Shape and range validation for JAX array inputs are not consistently implemented across all JAX functions, especially in model inference and training pipelines.
    *   Sanitization logic specific to JAX inputs (e.g., clipping, normalization within JAX) is not systematically applied.
    *   Error handling for invalid JAX input is not robustly implemented throughout the application, potentially leading to unhandled exceptions or unexpected behavior in JAX computations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict and Monitor JIT Compilation Environment for JAX](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_and_monitor_jit_compilation_environment_for_jax.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Restrict and Monitor JIT Compilation Environment for JAX
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Dedicated JIT Compilation Process (If Possible):**  If your application architecture allows, consider running JAX JIT compilation in a dedicated process or container, separate from the main application logic. This can provide an additional layer of isolation.
    2.  **Limit JIT Process Permissions:**  Restrict the permissions of the process or container responsible for JAX JIT compilation. Minimize access to sensitive files, network resources, and system capabilities. Use techniques like dropping capabilities in Docker or setting restrictive user permissions.
    3.  **System Call Filtering for JIT Process (Advanced):** Employ system call filtering mechanisms (e.g., seccomp, SELinux) to restrict the system calls that the JIT compilation process can make. This can limit the potential damage if a JIT compilation exploit occurs. Focus on blocking potentially dangerous system calls.
    4.  **Resource Monitoring for JIT Compilation:** Implement monitoring specifically for the JIT compilation process. Track resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O) during compilation. Unusual spikes or patterns could indicate malicious activity or unexpected compilation behavior.
    5.  **Logging and Auditing of JIT Compilation Events:** Log key events related to JIT compilation, such as compilation start/end times, input shapes, and any errors or warnings generated during compilation. This logging can be valuable for security auditing and incident response.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **JIT Compilation Exploits (High Severity):** Limits the potential impact of successful JIT compilation exploits within JAX by restricting the attacker's ability to access system resources or perform malicious actions from the compilation environment.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **JIT Compilation Exploits:** Medium to High risk reduction. Significantly reduces the potential damage from a JIT exploit by containing it within a restricted environment. The level of reduction depends on the effectiveness of the isolation and restriction measures implemented. Monitoring and logging enhance detection and response capabilities.
*   **Currently Implemented:**  JAX application is deployed in Docker containers, providing basic process isolation for the entire application, including JIT compilation. Basic resource monitoring is in place at the container level.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No dedicated process or container specifically for JAX JIT compilation. Compilation happens within the main application container.
    *   No specific restrictions on system calls or file system access for the JIT compilation process beyond the general container restrictions.
    *   System call filtering (seccomp, SELinux) is not implemented for the JIT compilation environment.
    *   Monitoring is not specifically focused on JIT compilation events or resource usage *during* compilation.
    *   Detailed logging and auditing of JIT compilation events are not implemented.
