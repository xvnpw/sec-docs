# Threat Model Analysis for google/jax

## Threat: [Unsafe Deserialization of JAX Functions/Data](./threats/unsafe_deserialization_of_jax_functionsdata.md)

*   **Threat:** Unsafe Deserialization of JAX Functions/Data
*   **Description**:
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker crafts malicious serialized JAX functions or data and injects them into the application's data stream. The application, upon deserializing this data, unknowingly executes attacker-controlled code.
    *   **How:** JAX's JIT compilation process can execute code during deserialization if the serialized data contains instructions or references to malicious code.
*   **Impact**:
    *   **Impact:** **Critical**. Arbitrary code execution on the server or client machine running the JAX application, leading to complete system compromise, data breaches, or denial of service.
*   **Affected JAX Component**:
    *   **Affected JAX Component:** `jax.numpy.save`, `jax.numpy.load`, custom serialization/deserialization logic for JAX objects, JIT compiler.
*   **Risk Severity**:
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies**:
    *   **Mitigation Strategies**:
        *   **Input Validation:** Rigorously validate and sanitize all input data, especially from untrusted sources.
        *   **Trusted Sources Only:** Only load serialized JAX functions and data from completely trusted and verified sources.
        *   **Secure Serialization:** Design custom serialization to be secure and avoid deserialization vulnerabilities.
        *   **Sandboxing/Containerization:** Isolate JAX processes to limit the impact of code execution vulnerabilities.
        *   **Code Review:** Conduct thorough code reviews of deserialization logic.

## Threat: [Exploiting JIT Compilation Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploiting_jit_compilation_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploiting JIT Compilation Vulnerabilities
*   **Description**:
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker crafts specific JAX code or input data that triggers a vulnerability within the JAX JIT compiler (XLA) or related components. This can lead to arbitrary code execution, memory corruption, or denial of service.
    *   **How:** By exploiting bugs in the JIT compilation process, attackers can bypass security checks or cause unexpected behavior in the compiled code.
*   **Impact**:
    *   **Impact:** **High** to **Critical**. Arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure, depending on the vulnerability.
*   **Affected JAX Component**:
    *   **Affected JAX Component:** JIT compiler (XLA), `jax.jit`, `jax.pmap`, JIT compilation functions, core JAX runtime.
*   **Risk Severity**:
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies**:
    *   **Mitigation Strategies**:
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep JAX and XLA updated to the latest versions for security patches.
        *   **Vulnerability Monitoring:** Monitor JAX security advisories and release notes.
        *   **Report Suspected Bugs:** Report any suspected JAX or XLA vulnerabilities to the development team.
        *   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize inputs to reduce the attack surface.
        *   **Sandboxing/Containerization:** Isolate JAX processes to limit vulnerability impact.

## Threat: [Uncontrolled JIT Compilation Resource Consumption](./threats/uncontrolled_jit_compilation_resource_consumption.md)

*   **Threat:** Uncontrolled JIT Compilation Resource Consumption
*   **Description**:
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker provides inputs that cause the JAX application to compile extremely complex functions or functions with very large input shapes, leading to excessive resource consumption and denial of service.
    *   **How:** Exploiting the resource-intensive nature of JIT compilation to overwhelm the system with compilation requests.
*   **Impact**:
    *   **Impact:** **Medium** to **High**. Denial of service, application slowdown, infrastructure instability due to resource exhaustion.
*   **Affected JAX Component**:
    *   **Affected JAX Component:** JIT compiler, `jax.jit`, `jax.pmap`, JIT compilation functions, resource management within JAX runtime.
*   **Risk Severity**:
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies**:
    *   **Mitigation Strategies**:
        *   **Resource Limits:** Implement resource limits and quotas for JAX computations (time, memory, CPU/GPU).
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate input data shapes and complexity before JIT compilation.
        *   **Asynchronous JIT:** Use asynchronous JIT compilation to maintain responsiveness.
        *   **Compilation Caching:** Leverage JAX's compilation caching to avoid redundant compilations.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on requests triggering JIT compilation.

## Threat: [Memory Exhaustion due to Large JAX Computations](./threats/memory_exhaustion_due_to_large_jax_computations.md)

*   **Threat:** Memory Exhaustion due to Large JAX Computations
*   **Description**:
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker provides inputs that cause JAX computations to consume excessive memory, leading to memory exhaustion and application crashes or instability.
    *   **How:** Providing large input arrays, triggering memory-intensive computations, or exploiting memory leaks in JAX code.
*   **Impact**:
    *   **Impact:** **Medium** to **High**. Denial of service, application crashes, instability, potential data corruption.
*   **Affected JAX Component**:
    *   **Affected JAX Component:** JAX NumPy (`jax.numpy`), automatic differentiation (`jax.grad`, `jax.vjp`), memory allocation within JAX runtime.
*   **Risk Severity**:
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies**:
    *   **Mitigation Strategies**:
        *   **Memory Monitoring and Limits:** Implement memory monitoring and limits for JAX processes.
