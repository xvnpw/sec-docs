# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- Development and distribution of the JAX library.
- Enabling machine learning and numerical computation research.
- Maintaining the integrity and reliability of the JAX system.

Data to Protect:
- JAX source code: Sensitivity: High (intellectual property, potential vulnerabilities).
- Build artifacts (packages): Sensitivity: Medium (integrity and availability for users).
- Internal build and test infrastructure: Sensitivity: Medium (confidentiality and integrity of build process).
- Research data processed by JAX (in user environments): Sensitivity: Variable (depending on the research domain, could be highly sensitive personal or confidential data).

Data Sensitivity:
- JAX source code is publicly available on GitHub, but modifications and internal development processes should be protected.
- Build artifacts need to be protected from tampering to ensure users download legitimate and secure packages.
- Research data processed by JAX is the responsibility of the researchers and their organizations, but JAX should be designed to facilitate secure data processing practices.
