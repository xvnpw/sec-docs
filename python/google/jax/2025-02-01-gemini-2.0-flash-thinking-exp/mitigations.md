# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for google/jax

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization for JIT Compilation](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization_for_jit_compilation.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify all user inputs** that are used as arguments to JAX functions that are JIT-compiled (using `jax.jit`).
    2.  **Define strict validation rules** for each input based on the expected data type, shape, and allowed values.
    3.  **Implement input sanitization** to remove or escape potentially harmful characters or patterns.
    4.  **Parameterize JAX functions:** Pass user inputs as arguments instead of embedding them directly in function definitions.
    5.  **Utilize JAX's shape and type annotations:** Decorate JIT-compiled functions with `jax.ShapeDtypeStruct` or type hints to enforce expected input structures and data types.
    6.  **Employ abstract values during tracing (if applicable):** Use abstract values (e.g., `jax.ShapeDtypeStruct`) when tracing JIT functions to limit the influence of concrete user data during compilation.
    7.  **Test input validation rigorously:** Write unit tests to ensure validation and sanitization logic works as expected.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Code Injection via JIT Compilation (High Severity):** Malicious user input could alter compiled code, leading to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Data Corruption/Manipulation (Medium Severity):** Unexpected input shapes or types could cause incorrect JAX computations.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Malicious inputs could trigger resource-intensive JIT compilation.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Code Injection via JIT Compilation:** High Risk Reduction. Prevents code injection by controlling input influence on compiled code.
    *   **Data Corruption/Manipulation:** Medium Risk Reduction. Reduces risk by enforcing expected data types and shapes.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion:** Medium Risk Reduction. Reduces risk by limiting resource-intensive compilation from malicious inputs.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Implemented in the API endpoint `/predict` for image data validation before JAX model inference.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Input validation is less strict in the model training data preprocessing pipeline.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Handling of Serialized JAX Objects](./mitigation_strategies/secure_handling_of_serialized_jax_objects.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Minimize serialization of JAX objects:** Avoid serialization unless necessary.
    2.  **Restrict deserialization sources:** Only deserialize from trusted and controlled sources.
    3.  **Implement integrity checks:** Generate cryptographic signatures or checksums for serialized JAX objects.
    4.  **Verify integrity before deserialization:** Recalculate and compare signatures/checksums before deserializing.
    5.  **Control access to deserialization functionalities:** Limit access to code that deserializes JAX objects.
    6.  **Regularly review serialization/deserialization code:** Audit code for potential vulnerabilities.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Exploiting deserialization could lead to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Object Tampering/Data Integrity Issues (Medium Severity):** Modified serialized JAX objects could compromise model behavior.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities:** High Risk Reduction. Integrity checks and restricted sources reduce exploitation risk.
    *   **Object Tampering/Data Integrity Issues:** High Risk Reduction. Integrity checks ensure object authenticity.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Model weights are serialized and stored in private cloud storage with restricted access and checksum generation.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Integrity verification (checksum comparison) is not implemented during model loading in the application.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Careful Use of Advanced JAX Features in User-Facing Applications](./mitigation_strategies/careful_use_of_advanced_jax_features_in_user-facing_applications.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify usage of advanced JAX features:** Review codebase for features like `jax.eval_shape`, `jax.make_jaxpr`, dynamic function generation, or custom primitives in user-facing components.
    2.  **Assess security implications:** Analyze potential risks if these features are exposed to untrusted input.
    3.  **Restrict access to advanced features:** Limit usage to backend or internal components if possible.
    4.  **Implement strict validation and sanitization (if necessary):** If used with user input, implement extreme validation and consider sandboxing.
    5.  **Regularly review usage of advanced features:** Periodically review code to ensure secure usage.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unintended Behavior or Exploitation of Advanced Features (Medium to High Severity):** Misuse of advanced JAX features with untrusted input could lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unintended Behavior or Exploitation of Advanced Features:** Medium Risk Reduction. Careful review, restricted usage, and validation minimize risks.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Advanced JAX features are primarily used in internal model development, not directly user-facing.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No formal policy on using advanced JAX features in user-facing applications. A guideline and security review process are needed for future use.
