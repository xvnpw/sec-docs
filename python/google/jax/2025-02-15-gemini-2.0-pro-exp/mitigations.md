## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Sanitization and Validation using JAX Functions](./mitigation_strategies/input_sanitization_and_validation_using_jax_functions.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Type Checking with JAX Types:**  Use JAX's type hints and ensure that inputs are of the expected JAX data types (e.g., `jnp.float32`, `jnp.int64`).  This leverages JAX's type system for validation.
2.  **Shape Checking with JAX:**  Use JAX's array shape properties (e.g., `array.shape`) and functions like `jnp.reshape` (with appropriate error handling) to verify and enforce expected input dimensions.  Use assertions or conditional checks based on `array.shape`.
3.  **Range Checking with `jnp.clip`:**  Use `jnp.clip(array, a_min, a_max)` to constrain input values within a safe range.  This is a JAX-specific function that efficiently enforces bounds on array elements.
4.  **NaN/Inf Checking with `jnp.isnan` and `jnp.isinf`:**  Explicitly check for `NaN` and `Inf` values using `jnp.isnan(array)` and `jnp.isinf(array)`.  Use JAX's conditional logic (e.g., `jnp.where`) to handle these values appropriately (reject, replace, or propagate with error handling).
5.  **Data Normalization/Standardization with JAX:**  Use JAX's numerical functions (e.g., `jnp.mean`, `jnp.std`, `jnp.linalg.norm`) to normalize or standardize input data to a consistent range. This leverages JAX's efficient computation for preprocessing.
6. **Document Input Constraints:** Clearly document all input constraints and validation rules, referencing the specific JAX functions used.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Numerical Instability Exploits (Medium Severity):** `jnp.clip`, `jnp.isnan`, `jnp.isinf` directly prevent these.
*   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Shape checking and range checking help prevent excessively large or malformed inputs.
*   **Code Injection (through malformed data) (High Severity):** Strict type and shape checking reduce the attack surface.
*   **Model Poisoning (if input is training data) (High Severity):** Sanitization helps prevent malicious training data.

**Impact:**
*   **Numerical Instability:** Significantly reduces the risk.
*   **DoS:** Reduces the risk (in conjunction with other resource limits).
*   **Code Injection:** Reduces the risk.
*   **Model Poisoning:** Reduces the risk.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Basic type checking is performed.
*   Some shape checking is done in certain parts of the code.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Comprehensive range checking using `jnp.clip` is not consistently implemented.
*   `NaN`/`Inf` checking using `jnp.isnan` and `jnp.isinf` is not consistently implemented.
*   Data normalization/standardization using JAX functions is not consistently applied.
*   Input constraints are not fully documented, referencing JAX functions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Side-Channel Attack Mitigation using JAX Techniques](./mitigation_strategies/side-channel_attack_mitigation_using_jax_techniques.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Constant-Time Operations (Attempt with JAX):**  For sensitive computations, *attempt* to use JAX operations that exhibit constant-time behavior. This is extremely challenging and may require:
    *   **Custom JAX Operations:**  Writing custom JAX operations (using `jax.custom_jvp` or `jax.custom_vjp`) that are carefully designed to be constant-time. This requires deep expertise.  The implementation would involve low-level code (potentially C++ or CUDA) interacting with JAX.
    *   **Careful Analysis:**  Thoroughly analyzing the timing behavior of existing JAX operations to identify potential variations and avoid them if possible.
2.  **Adding Noise with JAX (Differential Privacy):**  Use JAX's random number generation (`jax.random`) and numerical functions to introduce carefully calibrated random noise to the computations.  This can be guided by differential privacy principles.  Libraries built on top of JAX for differential privacy would be the ideal approach.  The noise must be added in a way that masks side-channel leakage without significantly degrading accuracy.  This often involves JAX-specific implementations of DP algorithms.
3.  **Asynchronous Execution and Padding with JAX:** Use JAX's asynchronous dispatch features (`jax.jit(..., donate_argnums=...)` or explicit `jax.block_until_ready()`) strategically.  While primarily for performance, carefully managing execution timing *can* make timing attacks more difficult.  Padding inputs to a fixed size using JAX functions (e.g., `jnp.pad`) can also help mitigate timing variations. This is a weak defense on its own.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Timing Attacks (Medium to High Severity):**  `jax.block_until_ready()` and careful use of `jax.jit` can *help*, but constant-time operations are the ideal (and difficult) goal.
*   **Power Analysis Attacks (Medium to High Severity):**  Adding noise using JAX's random number generation is the primary JAX-specific mitigation.
*   **Electromagnetic (EM) Side-Channel Attacks (Medium to High Severity):** Similar to power analysis, noise addition is the main JAX-based approach.

**Impact:**
*   **Timing/Power/EM Attacks:** Effectiveness varies greatly. Constant-time JAX operations (if achievable) are best. Noise addition with JAX provides moderate protection. Asynchronous execution and padding with JAX offer weak protection.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   None.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   The entire side-channel mitigation strategy needs to be implemented, focusing on the JAX-specific techniques described above. This is a highly specialized area.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Device Memory Management with JAX](./mitigation_strategies/device_memory_management_with_jax.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Prefer High-Level JAX APIs:** Use JAX's high-level array creation and manipulation functions (e.g., `jnp.array`, `jnp.zeros`, `jnp.ones`, and the `jnp` namespace in general). Avoid direct interaction with device memory buffers unless absolutely necessary.
2.  **Explicitly Clear Sensitive Data with JAX:** After a JAX array containing sensitive data is no longer needed, explicitly clear its contents by filling it with zeros *using JAX functions*.  For example: `jax.numpy.copyto(sensitive_array, jnp.zeros_like(sensitive_array))`. This ensures the clearing operation is performed on the device.
3. **Minimize Data Copies with JAX:** Be mindful of data copies between the host and the device. Use JAX's in-place operations (where available) and avoid unnecessary data transfers to reduce the risk of leaks.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Information Leakage (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of sensitive data remaining in device memory.

**Impact:**
*   **Information Leakage:** Reduces the risk, but careful coding with JAX is essential.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   The project primarily uses JAX's high-level APIs.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Explicit clearing of sensitive data in device memory using JAX functions is not consistently performed.
