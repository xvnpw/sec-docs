# Threat Model Analysis for google/jax

## Threat: [Evasion Attack (Adversarial Example - Inference Time)](./threats/evasion_attack__adversarial_example_-_inference_time_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts an adversarial example – a slightly modified input that is visually indistinguishable from a legitimate input – to cause a *deployed* JAX-based model to make an incorrect prediction. The attacker leverages JAX's gradient computation capabilities (`jax.grad`) to efficiently generate these adversarial perturbations.
*   **Impact:** The model misclassifies the adversarial input, leading to incorrect decisions or actions. This could bypass security, manipulate outputs, or cause other targeted errors. The high impact comes from the ability to *reliably* and *specifically* control model behavior.
*   **Affected JAX Component:** `jax.grad` (crucially used for generating adversarial examples), `jax.jit` (if the model is JIT-compiled for faster inference, making attacks easier), the model's forward pass function (defined using JAX primitives).
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Adversarial Training (with JAX):** Generate adversarial examples using `jax.grad` and include them in the training data. This is a *direct* use of JAX to mitigate a JAX-facilitated threat.
    *   **Input Gradient Regularization:** Add a penalty to the loss function that discourages large gradients with respect to the input (calculated using `jax.grad`).
    *   **Randomized Smoothing:** Add random noise (using `jax.random`) to inputs.
    *   **Certified Defenses:** Explore defenses with mathematical robustness guarantees.

## Threat: [Training Data Poisoning (Targeted Attack)](./threats/training_data_poisoning__targeted_attack_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker subtly modifies a small, specific portion of the training dataset. The goal is to cause the JAX-trained model to misclassify *particular* inputs after training, achieving a precise malicious outcome (e.g., misclassifying a specific stop sign as a speed limit sign). The attacker uses their understanding of how JAX processes data during training.
*   **Impact:** Targeted misclassifications by the model, leading to incorrect decisions with potentially severe consequences (e.g., bypassing security, causing accidents). The *targeted* nature makes this high/critical.
*   **Affected JAX Component:** `jax.numpy` (for data manipulation), `jax.jit` (if used for accelerating training), custom training loops using JAX primitives. The core issue is how JAX *processes* the poisoned data, not a single function.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Influence Function Analysis:** Use influence functions (efficiently computed with JAX's differentiation capabilities) to identify highly influential training points.
    *   **Data Sanitization (Domain-Specific):** Implement strict validation based on expert knowledge of the data.
    *   **Backdoor Detection:** Use specialized techniques to detect and mitigate backdoors (a form of targeted poisoning).

## Threat: [Training Data Poisoning (Availability Attack)](./threats/training_data_poisoning__availability_attack_.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker injects a large amount of random/irrelevant data into the training set.  The goal is to degrade the *overall* accuracy of the JAX-trained model, making it unreliable or unusable.
*   **Impact:**  Reduced model accuracy across all inputs, leading to unreliable predictions and degraded application functionality.  This broad impact makes it high severity.
*   **Affected JAX Component:**  `jax.numpy` (data manipulation), `jax.jit` (if used for training), custom training loops. The vulnerability is in how JAX processes the *entire* poisoned dataset during training.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Data Quality Metrics:** Monitor metrics (e.g., variance) during preprocessing to detect deviations.
    *   **Regularization:** Use stronger regularization (L1, L2 – easily implemented in JAX) to make the model less sensitive to noise.
    *   **Cross-Validation:** Use rigorous cross-validation to detect the impact of poisoning.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (Resource Exhaustion - Input-Triggered)](./threats/denial_of_service__resource_exhaustion_-_input-triggered_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a crafted input to a JAX-based model, designed to trigger excessive computation or memory usage. This exploits JAX's ability to perform complex, potentially unbounded, computations on accelerators (GPUs/TPUs). The input might lead to extremely deep networks or excessive iterations.
*   **Impact:** The application becomes unavailable or unresponsive, disrupting service. This is a classic DoS, made possible by JAX's computational power.
*   **Affected JAX Component:** `jax.jit` (if used for compilation, potentially exacerbating the issue), `jax.lax` (low-level operations that could be abused), any JAX functions involved in the model's computation. The vulnerability is in how JAX *executes* the computation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation (Shape/Type/Complexity):** *Strictly* validate input shape, type, and *estimated* computational complexity *before* JAX processing.
    *   **Resource Quotas:** Limit CPU/GPU/memory per request.
    *   **Asynchronous Processing:** Prevent a single malicious request from blocking the application.
    *   **JAX Profiling:** Use JAX's profiling to identify and optimize potential bottlenecks.

## Threat: [JAX Library Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/jax_library_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability *within* the JAX library itself (e.g., a buffer overflow in a JAX function, a logic error in `jax.jit`, or an insecure default). This is a direct attack on JAX.
*   **Impact:** Varies widely, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service. The potential for *arbitrary code execution* makes this critical.
*   **Affected JAX Component:** Any part of the JAX library (`jax.numpy`, `jax.lax`, `jax.jit`, etc.).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if a remotely exploitable vulnerability exists).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep JAX and all dependencies updated. This is the *primary* defense.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use tools to detect known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Security Audits:** Conduct periodic audits of the codebase, including JAX.
    *   **Minimal Dependency Footprint:** Reduce the number of dependencies.
