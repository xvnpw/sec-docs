# Attack Surface Analysis for google/jax

## Attack Surface: [Numerical Instability Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/numerical_instability_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit limitations of floating-point arithmetic within JAX computations to cause incorrect results, denial of service, or potentially (though less likely) information leakage.
    *   **JAX Contribution:** JAX's core functionality is numerical computation, making it inherently susceptible. JAX's performance and ability to handle large computations can amplify the impact of these exploits.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides a carefully crafted, near-boundary input to a JAX-based function, causing a `NaN` to propagate and corrupt the output.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Denial of Service (DoS)
        *   Incorrect results/predictions
        *   Potential (low probability) information leakage
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** Rigorous checks on all inputs, rejecting values outside expected bounds or of incorrect data types.  This is the *most important* mitigation.
        *   **NaN/Inf Checks:** Explicitly check for and handle `NaN` and `Inf` values within the JAX code. Implement error handling or fallback mechanisms.
        *   **Higher Precision (where feasible):** Use `float64` instead of `float32` when numerical stability is critical and performance allows.
        *   **Robustness Testing:** Extensive testing with edge cases, boundary values, and potentially problematic inputs.

## Attack Surface: [Predictable Randomness](./attack_surfaces/predictable_randomness.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit predictable pseudo-random number generation (PRNG) in JAX if the seed is not managed securely or is reused inappropriately.
    *   **JAX Contribution:** JAX provides a deterministic PRNG.  The vulnerability arises from *misuse* of this PRNG, not a flaw in the PRNG itself.
    *   **Example:** An attacker discovers a predictable or reused seed in a JAX-based application, allowing them to predict the "random" numbers and compromise a security feature.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Compromised security mechanisms relying on randomness.
        *   Loss of confidentiality or integrity.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Cryptographically Secure Seed Generation:** Use a CSPRNG (from a *separate* cryptographic library, not JAX) to generate the initial seed.
        *   **Secure Seed Storage:** Protect the seed from unauthorized access.  Never hardcode seeds.
        *   **`jax.random.split`:** Use `jax.random.split` to generate independent PRNG keys for different computations and avoid seed reuse.
        *   **Avoid JAX PRNG for Critical Security:** For high-security needs, use a dedicated cryptographic library's PRNG.

## Attack Surface: [Adversarial Gradient Manipulation (Autodiff)](./attack_surfaces/adversarial_gradient_manipulation__autodiff_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers craft inputs that cause JAX's automatic differentiation to produce manipulated gradients, disrupting training or leading to incorrect model updates in machine learning contexts.
    *   **JAX Contribution:** JAX's automatic differentiation is a core feature, and this attack directly targets that functionality.
    *   **Example:** An attacker adds a small, imperceptible perturbation to an input, causing the gradient during backpropagation to be significantly altered, leading to a poisoned model.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Degraded model accuracy
        *   Introduction of biases
        *   Model poisoning
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Gradient Clipping:** Limit the magnitude of gradients during training.
        *   **Robust Optimization:** Use optimization algorithms less susceptible to noisy gradients (e.g., Adam with momentum).
        *   **Adversarial Training:** Train the model on adversarial examples to improve robustness.
        *   **Input Sanitization:** Preprocess inputs to remove or mitigate potential adversarial perturbations.
