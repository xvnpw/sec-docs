## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Code on Server (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_code_on_server__critical_node_.md)

This is the attacker's ultimate goal. Success means the attacker can run any code they choose on the server hosting the JAX application, leading to complete compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Initial Access (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/gain_initial_access__critical_node_.md)

This is a necessary step for the attacker to reach their goal. Without gaining initial access, they cannot proceed with further exploitation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit XLA Compilation Vulnerabilities (Critical Nodes within)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_xla_compilation_vulnerabilities__critical_nodes_within_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Buffer Overflow in XLA Compiler (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/buffer_overflow_in_xla_compiler__critical_node_.md)

By providing specially crafted JAX code, an attacker could trigger a buffer overflow during the XLA compilation process. This allows them to overwrite memory and potentially inject malicious code that gets executed as part of the compiled program.

## Attack Tree Path: [Type Confusion in XLA Compiler (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/type_confusion_in_xla_compiler__critical_node_.md)

An attacker could supply JAX input that causes the XLA compiler to misinterpret data types. This can lead to incorrect memory access or operations, potentially allowing for code execution or data corruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [Integer Overflow in XLA Compiler (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/integer_overflow_in_xla_compiler__critical_node_.md)

Crafted JAX operations could cause integer overflows during the XLA compilation phase. This can lead to incorrect memory allocation sizes or other unexpected behavior that an attacker can exploit to gain control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Deserialization of JAX Objects (HIGH RISK PATH START, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_deserialization_of_jax_objects__high_risk_path_start__critical_node_.md)

If the application serializes JAX objects (e.g., using `pickle`) and later deserializes them, an attacker could inject malicious code into the serialized data. When the application deserializes this data, the injected code would be executed. This is a direct path to code execution if serialization is used.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Call Implementations (HIGH RISK PATH START, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerabilities_in_custom_call_implementations__high_risk_path_start__critical_node_.md)

Applications using JAX can integrate custom C++ or CUDA kernels for performance. If these custom implementations have vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, format string bugs, or other memory safety issues, an attacker can exploit them to execute arbitrary code on the server. This requires the application to be using custom calls.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies of JAX (HIGH RISK PATH START, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies_of_jax__high_risk_path_start__critical_node_.md)

JAX relies on various third-party libraries (e.g., NumPy, SciPy). If these dependencies have known vulnerabilities, an attacker can exploit them through the JAX application's interaction with these libraries. This is a common attack vector as many applications use numerous dependencies, and keeping them all updated can be challenging. The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency.

## Attack Tree Path: [Tracing/Staging Exploitation (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/tracingstaging_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

While marked as very low likelihood overall, if the application inadvertently exposes JAX's internal tracing or staging mechanisms, a sophisticated attacker might be able to inject malicious code or manipulate the intermediate representation of the computation. This could lead to unexpected behavior or even code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Social Engineering/Phishing (HIGH RISK PATH START, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/social_engineeringphishing__high_risk_path_start__critical_node_.md)

An attacker could trick a developer or system administrator into running malicious JAX code or revealing sensitive credentials. This is a common initial access method that bypasses technical security controls. The impact is critical as it can grant the attacker direct access to the system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Code (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/execute_code__critical_node_.md)

This represents the stage where the attacker leverages a previously exploited vulnerability to actually run their malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Code Injection via XLA Compilation (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/code_injection_via_xla_compilation__critical_node_.md)

If an attacker successfully exploits a vulnerability in the XLA compiler, they can inject arbitrary machine code into the compiled program, leading to direct code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Code Injection via JAX Core (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/code_injection_via_jax_core__critical_node_.md)

Exploiting vulnerabilities in JAX's Python code or in custom call implementations can allow for direct execution of arbitrary code within the application's process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Code Execution via Dependency Vulnerability (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/code_execution_via_dependency_vulnerability__critical_node_.md)

Successfully exploiting a vulnerability in a JAX dependency can directly lead to code execution within the application's context.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse of JAX Features (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_of_jax_features__critical_node_.md)

While generally low likelihood, if an attacker can manipulate JIT compilation or tracing in a specific way, they might be able to force the execution of malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Maintain Persistence (Optional, CRITICAL NODES within)](./attack_tree_paths/maintain_persistence__optional__critical_nodes_within_.md)

These steps are taken after gaining initial access and executing code to ensure continued access to the compromised system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Application Code (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/modify_application_code__critical_node_.md)

Injecting malicious code directly into the application's files ensures the attacker's code runs whenever the application is executed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Create Backdoor User (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/create_backdoor_user__critical_node_.md)

Creating a new user account with elevated privileges allows the attacker to log back in later without needing to re-exploit a vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Install Remote Access Tool (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/install_remote_access_tool__critical_node_.md)

Deploying tools like Netcat or SSH provides a persistent remote connection to the compromised server.
