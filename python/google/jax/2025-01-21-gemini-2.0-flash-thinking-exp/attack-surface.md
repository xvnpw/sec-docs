## Attack Surface: [Malicious Code Execution via JAX Compilation](./attack_surfaces/malicious_code_execution_via_jax_compilation.md)

**Attack Surface:** Malicious Code Execution via JAX Compilation

* **Description:** An attacker provides specially crafted Python code that, when processed by JAX's compilation pipeline (tracing and JIT compilation to XLA), exploits vulnerabilities within the compiler itself.
* **How JAX Contributes:** JAX's core functionality involves compiling Python code into optimized XLA code for execution. This compilation process introduces a complex layer where vulnerabilities might exist.
* **Example:**  Crafting Python code that triggers a buffer overflow or an out-of-bounds access within the XLA compiler during the optimization or code generation phase.
* **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the system where the JAX compilation occurs, potentially leading to full system compromise.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Input Sanitization:**  Carefully sanitize and validate any user-provided Python code that will be processed by JAX. Avoid directly executing untrusted code.
    * **Sandboxing Compilation:** If possible, perform JAX compilation in a sandboxed environment with limited privileges to contain potential exploits.
    * **Regularly Update JAX:** Keep JAX updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes in the compilation pipeline.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Custom Operations (CustomCall)](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_custom_operations__customcall_.md)

**Attack Surface:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Custom Operations (CustomCall)

* **Description:**  When using `jax.experimental.jax2c.CustomCall`, vulnerabilities in the user-provided C/C++ (or other language) code of the custom operation can be exploited.
* **How JAX Contributes:** JAX provides a mechanism to integrate external code for performance or access to specific hardware. This integration point introduces the security risks inherent in the external code.
* **Example:** A custom operation implemented in C has a buffer overflow vulnerability. An attacker provides input to the JAX application that, when passed to the custom operation, triggers the overflow, allowing for arbitrary code execution.
* **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) with the privileges of the process running the JAX application.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Secure Coding Practices:**  Adhere to strict secure coding practices when developing custom operations, including memory safety, input validation, and bounds checking.
    * **Code Reviews:**  Conduct thorough code reviews of custom operations to identify potential vulnerabilities.
    * **Static and Dynamic Analysis:** Utilize static and dynamic analysis tools to detect security flaws in custom operation code.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure custom operations run with the minimum necessary privileges.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization of Malicious JAX Artifacts](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_of_malicious_jax_artifacts.md)

**Attack Surface:** Deserialization of Malicious JAX Artifacts

* **Description:**  If an application loads serialized JAX functions or models from untrusted sources, an attacker could craft malicious serialized data that, when deserialized, executes arbitrary code.
* **How JAX Contributes:** JAX allows for the serialization and deserialization of its internal representations (e.g., `jax.save`, `jax.load`). This functionality, if used with untrusted data, can be a vector for attack.
* **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious serialized JAX function that, upon loading, executes a shell command to compromise the system.
* **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) with the privileges of the process loading the JAX artifact.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Only Load from Trusted Sources:**  Only load serialized JAX artifacts from sources that are completely trusted.
    * **Integrity Checks:** Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity of serialized JAX artifacts before loading them (e.g., using cryptographic signatures).
    * **Consider Alternative Serialization Methods:** If possible, explore alternative serialization methods that are less prone to arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities.
