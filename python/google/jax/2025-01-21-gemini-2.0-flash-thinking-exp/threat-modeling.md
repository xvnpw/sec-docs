# Threat Model Analysis for google/jax

## Threat: [Malicious Code Injection via JIT Compilation](./threats/malicious_code_injection_via_jit_compilation.md)

**Description:** An attacker could craft input data or code that, when processed by `jax.jit`, leads to the injection of arbitrary code into the compiled XLA graph. This injected code would then be executed during runtime. The attacker might manipulate input shapes, types, or even provide specially crafted Python code that influences the compilation process.

**Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution on the system running the JAX application. This could lead to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.

**Affected JAX Component:** `jax.jit`, XLA compiler

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid using user-provided code directly within `jax.jit` or in ways that influence the compilation process.
* Sanitize and validate all user inputs that could affect the compilation process (e.g., shapes, data types).
* Run JAX computations in a sandboxed environment with limited privileges.
* Implement strict input validation to prevent unexpected data structures or code from reaching the JIT compilation stage.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion through Malicious Inputs](./threats/resource_exhaustion_through_malicious_inputs.md)

**Description:** An attacker could provide inputs that cause JAX computations to consume excessive memory or processing power. This could involve crafting inputs that lead to very large intermediate tensors, computationally expensive operations, or infinite loops within JAX functions.

**Impact:** Denial of service, application crashes, resource starvation on the server or device running the JAX application.

**Affected JAX Component:** Core JAX operations, memory management, compilation process

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement resource limits (e.g., memory limits, time limits) for JAX computations.
* Validate input shapes and sizes to prevent the creation of excessively large tensors.
* Implement timeouts for JAX functions to prevent infinite loops.
* Monitor resource usage and detect anomalies.
