## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1 Token Theft (High Risk)](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_token_theft__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to a valid authentication token, allowing them to impersonate a legitimate user and control Home Assistant.
*   **Likelihood:** High. Tokens can be stolen through various means, including phishing, malware, network sniffing (if not using HTTPS), or exploiting vulnerabilities in other applications on the same network.
*   **Impact:** High.  Full control over the Home Assistant instance, including all connected devices and data.
*   **Effort:** Medium.  The effort depends on the method used to steal the token.  Phishing might be low effort, while exploiting a network vulnerability could be higher.
*   **Skill Level:** Medium.  Requires some technical knowledge, but readily available tools and techniques can be used.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High.  Detecting token theft can be difficult without proper logging and monitoring.  Unusual activity from a legitimate user account might be a sign.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1 Custom Integration Vulnerabilities (High Risk)](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_custom_integration_vulnerabilities__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in third-party integrations installed by the user.
*   **Likelihood:** High.  Custom integrations are not subject to the same level of scrutiny as official integrations, and many are developed by individuals with varying levels of security expertise.
*   **Impact:** High.  A compromised integration can grant the attacker full control over Home Assistant.
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium.  Finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in custom integrations may be easier than in core components.
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium.  Depends on the complexity of the vulnerability.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** High.  Difficult to detect unless the integration's behavior is obviously malicious.  Requires monitoring of integration activity and potentially code analysis.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1 Code Injection Vulnerabilities (High Risk)](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1_code_injection_vulnerabilities__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The custom integration contains code that allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the Home Assistant server.
*   **Likelihood:** High.  Lack of code review and secure coding practices in custom integrations increases the likelihood of injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** High.  Complete system compromise.
*   **Effort:** Medium.  Requires finding and exploiting the injection point.
*   **Skill Level:** Medium.  Requires understanding of the integration's code and how to craft malicious input.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** High.  Can be difficult to detect without code analysis or intrusion detection systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.2 Supply Chain Vulnerabilities (High Risk)](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_2_supply_chain_vulnerabilities__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The developer of a custom integration is compromised, and malicious code is injected into an update.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High.  This is a growing threat across the software industry.  Developers of custom integrations may not have robust security practices for their own systems.
*   **Impact:** High.  Complete system compromise for all users of the compromised integration.
*   **Effort:** High.  Requires compromising the developer's accounts or infrastructure.
*   **Skill Level:** High.  Requires advanced hacking skills.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Very High.  Extremely difficult to detect without proactive monitoring of integration updates and code integrity checks.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.1 Known Vulnerabilities in Official Integrations (High Risk)](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_1_known_vulnerabilities_in_official_integrations__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities in official integrations that have not been patched by the user.
*   **Likelihood:** High.  Many users do not update their software regularly.
*   **Impact:** High (Variable).  Depends on the specific vulnerability, but could range from data leakage to full system compromise.
*   **Effort:** Low.  Exploits for known vulnerabilities are often publicly available.
*   **Skill Level:** Low.  Script kiddies can often exploit known vulnerabilities using publicly available tools.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.  Intrusion detection systems and vulnerability scanners can detect attempts to exploit known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1 Weak/Default Credentials (High Risk)](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_weakdefault_credentials__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Gaining access to the Home Assistant instance using default or easily guessable passwords.
*   **Likelihood:** High.  Many users fail to change default credentials or use weak passwords.
*   **Impact:** High.  Full control over the Home Assistant instance.
*   **Effort:** Low.  Brute-force attacks or credential stuffing attacks are easy to automate.
*   **Skill Level:** Low.  Requires minimal technical skills.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.  Failed login attempts can be logged, but attackers may use slow brute-force techniques to avoid detection.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2 Exposed Secrets in Configuration (High Risk)](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_exposed_secrets_in_configuration__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information (API keys, passwords) stored in plain text in the `configuration.yaml` file are exposed.
*   **Likelihood:** High.  Users may not be aware of the best practices for storing secrets.  Accidental exposure through misconfigured file sharing or backups is also possible.
*   **Impact:** High.  Leads to compromise of connected services and potentially the Home Assistant instance itself.
*   **Effort:** Low.  If the configuration file is accessible, the secrets are easily obtained.
*   **Skill Level:** Low.  No special skills required.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High.  Requires monitoring file access and potentially implementing data loss prevention (DLP) measures.
