## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Integration Sandboxing (Core-Enforced)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_integration_sandboxing__core-enforced_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement robust isolation between integrations and the core system, *enforced by the core*.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Filesystem Isolation (Core):** The core *must* enforce strict filesystem isolation.  Each integration operates within a dedicated, restricted directory.  The core prevents access outside this directory using technologies like chroot jails, containers (lightweight options like systemd-nspawn), or similar mechanisms.
    2.  **Network Isolation (Core):** The core *must* control network access for integrations.  A whitelist of allowed hosts/ports is enforced by the core, using network namespaces (Linux) or similar OS-level features.  Integrations cannot bypass this.
    3.  **System Call Restriction (Core):** The core *must* limit system calls.  A seccomp profile (Linux) or equivalent is used to define a whitelist of *allowed* system calls for each integration.  This is enforced at the kernel level.
    4.  **Process Isolation (Core):** The core *must* run each integration as a separate process with *limited* privileges.  The core prevents inter-process communication except through defined, secure channels managed by the core.
    5.  **Inter-Integration Communication Control (Core):** The core *must* provide a secure, controlled mechanism (e.g., a message bus with access control) for inter-integration communication.  Direct communication is prohibited.
    6.  **Resource Limits (Core):** The core *must* enforce resource limits (CPU, memory, file descriptors) on integrations to prevent denial-of-service attacks or resource exhaustion.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Integrations (Critical):** Prevents a compromised or malicious integration from gaining full control.
    *   **Vulnerable Integrations (High):** Limits the impact of vulnerabilities; one compromised integration cannot compromise others or the core.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Critical):** Prevents integrations from escalating privileges.
    *   **Data Exfiltration (High):** Limits the ability of a compromised integration to exfiltrate data.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Integrations:** Risk reduction: Very High.
    *   **Vulnerable Integrations:** Risk reduction: High.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduction: Very High.
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Risk reduction: High.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partial. Some process isolation and limited capabilities exist, but not full sandboxing with containers, strict network/filesystem control, or comprehensive seccomp profiles.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Full filesystem isolation (chroot/containers).
    *   Strict network isolation (network namespaces, whitelisting).
    *   Comprehensive system call restriction (seccomp).
    *   Controlled inter-integration communication.
    *   Resource limits (CPU, memory).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure API Authentication and Authorization (Core Logic)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_api_authentication_and_authorization__core_logic_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement strong authentication and authorization within the core API logic.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Support (Core):** The core *must* provide robust support for MFA (TOTP, U2F), making it easy to configure and *strongly* encouraging its use.
    2.  **Rate Limiting (Core):** The core *must* implement rate limiting for login attempts and API requests to prevent brute-force attacks. This is handled within the core API logic.
    3.  **Secure Session Management (Core):** The core *must* use secure session tokens (JWTs or similar) with appropriate expiration, secure flags (HttpOnly, Secure), and robust generation/validation logic.
    4.  **API Key/Token Management (Core):** The core *must* provide a system for generating, managing, and revoking API keys/tokens, with granular permission control.
    5.  **Fine-Grained Authorization (Core):** The core *must* implement a role-based access control (RBAC) system or similar, defining precisely which users/API clients can access which resources/actions. This is enforced within the core API handling.
    6.  **Input Validation and Sanitization (Core):** The core *must* rigorously validate and sanitize *all* data received through the API (headers, parameters, bodies) *before* processing it. This is a core responsibility for all API endpoints.
    7. **HTTPS Enforcement (Core):** The core application *must* refuse any non-HTTPS connections for the API.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (Critical):** Prevents unauthorized API access.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (High):** Mitigates brute-force attempts.
    *   **Session Hijacking (High):** Protects against session hijacking.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Critical):** Prevents unauthorized access to resources.
    *   **Injection Attacks (High):** Prevents injection attacks via the API.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (High):** HTTPS enforcement prevents MitM.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduction: Very High.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Risk reduction: High.
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Risk reduction: High.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduction: Very High.
    *   **Injection Attacks:** Risk reduction: High.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Risk reduction: Very High.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Mostly. HTTPS is used, password policies exist, long-lived access tokens are supported, MFA is available, and some authorization is in place.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   More comprehensive/easily configurable MFA.
    *   More fine-grained authorization (formal RBAC).
    *   Stricter, more consistent input validation/sanitization across *all* API endpoints.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Configuration and Data Storage (Core Handling)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_configuration_and_data_storage__core_handling_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Protect sensitive data stored in configuration files, *managed by the core*.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Encryption at Rest (Core):** The core *must* encrypt sensitive data (passwords, API keys in `secrets.yaml` or similar) *at rest* using a strong algorithm (AES-256).  The core handles the encryption/decryption process.
    2.  **Secure Key Management (Core Integration):** The core *should* integrate with secure key management solutions (environment variables, external services like HashiCorp Vault) to store encryption keys *separately* from the configuration files.  The core provides the mechanisms for this integration.
    3. **Avoid Hardcoded Secrets (Core Development Practice):** Core developers *must* never hardcode secrets.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Breach (Critical):** Protects sensitive data if configuration files are compromised.
    *   **Unauthorized Access (Critical):** Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    *   **Credential Theft (High):** Makes credential theft more difficult.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Breach:** Risk reduction: Very High.
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduction: Very High.
    *   **Credential Theft:** Risk reduction: High.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially. `secrets.yaml` is used, but it's *not* natively encrypted by the core.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Native encryption of `secrets.yaml` (or equivalent) by the core.
    *   Built-in integration with secure key management solutions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Update Mechanism (Core Functionality)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_update_mechanism__core_functionality_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Ensure the integrity and authenticity of updates, *verified by the core*.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Code Signing Verification (Core):** The core *must* verify the digital signature of any update *before* applying it.  This verification logic is within the core update process.
    2.  **Rollback Mechanism (Core):** The core *must* provide a mechanism to revert to a previous version if an update fails or causes issues. This is a core feature.
    3. **Two-Factor Authentication for Release (Core Team Responsibility):** Use 2FA for any accounts that have access to publish updates.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Updates (Critical):** Prevents installation of malicious updates.
    *   **Tampering with Updates (High):** Ensures updates haven't been tampered with.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Updates:** Risk reduction: Very High.
    *   **Tampering with Updates:** Risk reduction: High.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Mostly. Updates are signed and verified. A rollback mechanism likely exists.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Potentially more robust key management (though this is more on the release process side).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Event Handling and Automation Security (Core Logic)](./mitigation_strategies/event_handling_and_automation_security__core_logic_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure the execution of automations and event handling within the core.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Automation Sandboxing (Core):** The core *should* consider sandboxing the execution of automations, similar to integrations, to limit their potential impact. This would involve restricting access to resources and system calls.
    2.  **Automation Validation (Core):** The core *must* implement validation rules to prevent obviously dangerous automations (e.g., those that could unlock doors without authentication or perform other high-risk actions). This validation happens *before* the automation is saved or executed.
    3.  **Audit Logging (Core):** The core *must* log all automation events, including triggers, conditions, and actions, for auditing and debugging purposes. This logging is a core feature.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Automations (Medium):** Limits the damage a malicious automation can cause.
    *   **Accidental Misconfiguration (Medium):** Prevents users from creating automations that could have unintended consequences.
    *   **Security Bypass (High):** Prevents automations from bypassing security controls.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Automations:** Risk reduction: Medium to High.
    *   **Accidental Misconfiguration:** Risk reduction: Medium.
    *   **Security Bypass:** Risk reduction: High.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially. Some validation and logging exist, but full automation sandboxing is not implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Automation sandboxing.
    *   More comprehensive validation rules for automations.
