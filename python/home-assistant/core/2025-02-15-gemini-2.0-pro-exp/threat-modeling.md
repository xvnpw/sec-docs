# Threat Model Analysis for home-assistant/core

## Threat: [Configuration Tampering via File System Access](./threats/configuration_tampering_via_file_system_access.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with access to the file system (e.g., through a vulnerability in the host OS, or physical access) modifies the `configuration.yaml` file or other core configuration files. They could add malicious automations, disable security features, or inject arbitrary code *that is then executed by core components*.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Complete control over Home Assistant's behavior *through core functionality*.
        *   Disabling of core security features (e.g., authentication).
        *   Execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the Home Assistant process *as part of core operations*.
        *   Data exfiltration *facilitated by core components*.
    *   **Core Component Affected:** `homeassistant.config` (Configuration loading and validation), and any core component configured through the modified files (e.g., `homeassistant.core` itself, `homeassistant.components.automation`, etc.).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Implement robust input validation for *all* configuration files, even those considered "internal." Consider using a more secure configuration format (e.g., a database with access controls and integrity checks). Provide mechanisms for detecting configuration tampering (e.g., checksums, digital signatures, or a configuration validation service).  Strive to minimize the attack surface exposed through configuration.
        *   **User:** Run Home Assistant in a containerized environment (e.g., Docker) with *strictly* limited file system access, using a non-root user. Regularly back up configuration files *and verify their integrity*. Implement file integrity monitoring (e.g., AIDE, Tripwire) on the host system, specifically targeting the Home Assistant configuration directory. Restrict access to the host system to the absolute minimum.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Event Bus Overload](./threats/denial_of_service_via_event_bus_overload.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker (potentially internal, through a *core* component malfunction or a carefully crafted, but technically valid, sequence of events) floods the Home Assistant event bus with a large number of events, overwhelming the *core* event handling system and causing it to become unresponsive. This is distinct from an external DoS targeting network services.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Home Assistant *core* becomes unresponsive and unable to process events, control devices, or execute automations.
        *   Loss of monitoring and control capabilities *due to core failure*.
        *   Potential for data loss if events are not persisted *due to core overload*.
    *   **Core Component Affected:** `homeassistant.core.EventBus` (Event bus implementation), and all other core components that rely on the event bus (which is essentially all of them).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Implement robust rate limiting and throttling mechanisms *within* the `EventBus` itself. Provide mechanisms for identifying and isolating sources of excessive events *originating from within the core*. Optimize event handling to minimize resource consumption *in the core event loop*. Consider using asynchronous task queues and worker pools to handle events more efficiently, preventing a single slow component from blocking the entire system.  Implement circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures.
        *   **User:** While users have limited control over core event bus behavior, they should monitor system resource usage and logs for signs of overload.  If a specific, *core-related* pattern consistently causes issues, report it to the Home Assistant developers.

## Threat: [State Tampering via Direct State Machine Manipulation](./threats/state_tampering_via_direct_state_machine_manipulation.md)

* **Description:** An attacker with deep access to the running Home Assistant process (e.g., through a *severe* vulnerability that allows arbitrary code execution *within* the core process, *not* just within an integration) directly modifies the `StateMachine` object, bypassing normal event handling and validation. This is a very low-level attack, requiring significant compromise.
    * **Impact:**
        *   False device states are injected directly into the core, bypassing all validation and security checks.
        *   Inappropriate triggering of automations *due to manipulated state*.
        *   Fundamental disruption of Home Assistant's operation, potentially leading to instability or crashes.
        *   Potential for data corruption within the core state representation.
    * **Core Component Affected:** `homeassistant.core.StateMachine` (State machine implementation).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Implement *extremely* strict access controls to the `StateMachine` object.  Validate *all* state changes, *even those originating from within the core*, using a robust internal validation mechanism. Consider using memory protection techniques (if feasible within the Python environment) to prevent unauthorized modification of the state machine's data structures.  Explore using a more secure, externally managed state store (e.g., a database with strong access controls and auditing) instead of relying solely on in-memory representation.  Regularly conduct security audits of the core code, focusing on memory safety and access control.
        *   **User:** This threat is primarily mitigated by developer actions.  Users should ensure they are running Home Assistant in a secure environment (containerized, minimal privileges) to reduce the likelihood of an attacker gaining the level of access required for this attack.  Keeping the system and all components updated is crucial.

## Threat: [Elevation of Privilege via Core Component Vulnerability](./threats/elevation_of_privilege_via_core_component_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability *within a core Home Assistant component* (e.g., a flaw in the `homeassistant.core` logic, the HTTP server, or the WebSocket API *implementation itself*) to gain elevated privileges *within the context of the Home Assistant process*. This is distinct from exploiting an integration.  The vulnerability would allow bypassing core security checks or executing arbitrary code *as part of the core's operation*.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Complete control over the Home Assistant *core* functionality.
        *   Access to all data managed by the core.
        *   Potential for further exploitation and lateral movement if the Home Assistant process has elevated privileges on the host system.
    *   **Core Component Affected:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, but by definition, it would be a *core* component (e.g., `homeassistant.core`, `homeassistant.components.http`, `homeassistant.components.websocket_api`, `homeassistant.config`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Adhere to strict secure coding practices throughout the *entire* core codebase. Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of *core* components.  Implement robust input validation and sanitization for *all* data handled by core components.  Use memory-safe programming techniques where possible.  Minimize the attack surface by reducing unnecessary features and functionality in core components.  Respond promptly to security reports and release updates.  Consider using a security linter and static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities.
        *   **User:** Keep Home Assistant *core* updated to the latest version. Run Home Assistant in a secure environment (containerized, minimal privileges) to limit the impact of any potential vulnerabilities.
