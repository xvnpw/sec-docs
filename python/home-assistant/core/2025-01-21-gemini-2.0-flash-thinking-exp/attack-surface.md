# Attack Surface Analysis for home-assistant/core

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Integration Loading and Execution](./attack_surfaces/malicious_integration_loading_and_execution.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Malicious Integration Loading and Execution
    *   **Description:** The core's architecture allows for the loading and execution of custom integrations (components, platforms). A malicious or poorly written integration can introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Core Contributes:** The core provides the framework and mechanisms for loading and executing integration code, granting significant privileges to these integrations. It trusts the code within the integration directory.
    *   **Example:** A user installs a custom integration from an untrusted source. This integration contains code that reads sensitive data from the Home Assistant configuration or executes arbitrary commands on the host system.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, denial of service, privilege escalation on the host system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization within the core's integration loading and execution mechanisms.
            *   Enforce stricter security policies for integration code, potentially through sandboxing or permission models.
            *   Provide clear guidelines and security best practices for integration developers.
            *   Develop tools for static analysis and security scanning of integrations.
        *   **Users:**
            *   Only install integrations from trusted sources (official Home Assistant integrations, reputable community developers).
            *   Carefully review the code of custom integrations before installing them.
            *   Monitor system resource usage and network activity for suspicious behavior after installing new integrations.
            *   Utilize Home Assistant's safe mode to disable problematic integrations.

## Attack Surface: [Event Bus Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/event_bus_manipulation.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Event Bus Manipulation
    *   **Description:** The event bus is a central communication mechanism within Home Assistant. If an attacker can inject or manipulate events, they can trigger unintended actions.
    *   **How Core Contributes:** The core provides the API and infrastructure for publishing and subscribing to events. If not properly secured, this can be abused.
    *   **Example:** An attacker finds a way to inject a fake "device_tracker.not_home" event for a user, causing the alarm system to disarm.
    *   **Impact:** Triggering unintended automations, bypassing security measures, manipulating device states, causing confusion or disruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms for publishing events.
            *   Introduce mechanisms to verify the source and integrity of events.
            *   Rate-limit event publishing to prevent flooding attacks.
            *   Provide options for users to restrict event access based on origin or type.
        *   **Users:**
            *   Be cautious about exposing the Home Assistant event bus to untrusted networks or applications.
            *   Review automation triggers and conditions to ensure they are not easily manipulated by external events.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in Automation or Customization](./attack_surfaces/server-side_template_injection__ssti__in_automation_or_customization.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in Automation or Customization
    *   **Description:** Home Assistant uses Jinja2 templating. If user-provided input is directly rendered as a template without proper sanitization, it can lead to SSTI vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Core Contributes:** The core allows users to define templates in automations, scripts, and customizations. If not handled carefully, this can introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A user creates an automation that takes input from a user-controlled sensor and directly renders it in a notification template, allowing an attacker to inject malicious Jinja2 code.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the Home Assistant server, information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for any user-provided data used in template rendering.
            *   Utilize secure template rendering practices and avoid directly rendering untrusted input.
            *   Consider using a sandboxed template environment with limited functionality.
        *   **Users:**
            *   Be cautious when using user-provided data in templates.
            *   Avoid directly copying and pasting templates from untrusted sources.
            *   Understand the risks associated with template rendering and potential security implications.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Handling of External API Interactions by Integrations](./attack_surfaces/insecure_handling_of_external_api_interactions_by_integrations.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Insecure Handling of External API Interactions by Integrations
    *   **Description:** Integrations frequently interact with external APIs. Vulnerabilities can arise from insecure API calls or mishandling of API responses.
    *   **How Core Contributes:** The core provides the environment in which integrations make these API calls. While not directly responsible for the integration's code, the core's architecture enables these interactions.
    *   **Example:** An integration makes an API call to a third-party service without proper TLS verification, making it susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of API keys or sensitive data, unauthorized access to external services, data manipulation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Enforce the use of secure communication protocols (HTTPS) for API interactions.
            *   Implement proper TLS certificate verification.
            *   Sanitize and validate data received from external APIs.
            *   Avoid storing API keys directly in integration code; use secure configuration methods.
        *   **Users:**
            *   Choose integrations that are known to follow secure coding practices.
            *   Monitor network traffic for suspicious API calls.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in the Authentication and Authorization Mechanisms](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_the_authentication_and_authorization_mechanisms.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Vulnerabilities in the Authentication and Authorization Mechanisms
    *   **Description:** Flaws in how Home Assistant authenticates users and authorizes access to resources can allow unauthorized access.
    *   **How Core Contributes:** The core implements the authentication and authorization framework. Vulnerabilities in this framework directly impact security.
    *   **Example:** A bug in the authentication logic allows an attacker to bypass the login process or escalate privileges.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the Home Assistant instance, control over devices, exposure of sensitive data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Follow secure coding practices for authentication and authorization logic.
            *   Regularly audit and penetration test the authentication and authorization mechanisms.
            *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) options.
            *   Enforce strong password policies.
        *   **Users:**
            *   Enable multi-factor authentication.
            *   Use strong and unique passwords for all user accounts.
            *   Keep the Home Assistant Core software up to date to patch known authentication vulnerabilities.
