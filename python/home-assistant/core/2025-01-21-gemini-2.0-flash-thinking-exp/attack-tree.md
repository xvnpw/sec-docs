## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using Home Assistant Core (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_home_assistant_core__critical_node_.md)

This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. Any successful exploitation of the underlying vulnerabilities can lead to this compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Code Vulnerabilities in Core (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_code_vulnerabilities_in_core__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Exploit Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities (e.g., Buffer Overflow, Use-After-Free) (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * Attackers craft specific inputs that overflow memory buffers, overwriting adjacent memory locations. This can be used to inject and execute arbitrary code.
    * Use-After-Free vulnerabilities occur when memory is accessed after it has been freed, potentially leading to code execution if the freed memory is reallocated with attacker-controlled data.
* **Exploit Injection Vulnerabilities (e.g., Command Injection, Jinja2 Template Injection) (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * **Command Injection:** Attackers inject malicious operating system commands into input fields or parameters that are then executed by the application.
    * **Jinja2 Template Injection:** Attackers inject malicious code into Jinja2 templates, which are used for rendering dynamic content. When the template is processed, the injected code is executed.
* **Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * Attackers provide malicious serialized data to the application. If the application doesn't properly sanitize or validate this data before deserializing it, it can lead to arbitrary code execution.
* **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Dependencies (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE):**
    * Home Assistant Core relies on numerous third-party libraries. Attackers can exploit known vulnerabilities in these libraries to compromise the Core. This often involves identifying vulnerable versions and triggering the vulnerable functionality through the Core's usage of the dependency.
