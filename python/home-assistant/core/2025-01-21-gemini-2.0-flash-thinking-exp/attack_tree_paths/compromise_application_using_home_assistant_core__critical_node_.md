    * **Description:**  Tricking an authenticated user into performing unintended actions on the Home Assistant application without their knowledge.
    * **Impact:**  Unauthorized modification of configurations, control of devices, and potentially disabling critical functionalities.
    * **Mitigation:** Implement anti-CSRF tokens, utilize the SameSite cookie attribute, and educate users about the risks of clicking on suspicious links.

* **4.1.4. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**
    * **Description:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to make requests from the Home Assistant server to internal or external resources. This can be used to scan internal networks, access sensitive data, or interact with other services.
    * **Impact:**  Exposure of internal resources, potential for further exploitation of other systems, and data breaches.
    * **Mitigation:**  Sanitize and validate user-provided URLs, restrict outbound network access, and implement network segmentation.

* **4.1.5. Insecure Deserialization:**
    * **Description:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application handles serialized data. Maliciously crafted serialized data can be used to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    * **Impact:**  Remote code execution, allowing the attacker to gain full control of the server.
    * **Mitigation:** Avoid deserializing untrusted data, use secure serialization formats, and implement integrity checks for serialized data.
