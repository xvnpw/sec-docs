# Threat Model Analysis for home-assistant/core

## Threat: [Malicious Integration Code Execution](./threats/malicious_integration_code_execution.md)

**Description:** An attacker develops a malicious custom integration or compromises an existing third-party integration. This integration contains code designed to execute arbitrary commands on the host system running Home Assistant Core. This could be achieved through vulnerabilities in how the integration interacts with the core's API or by exploiting weaknesses in the integration's dependencies.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the host system, including access to all data, control over connected devices, and potential for further attacks on the local network.

**Affected Component:** Integration framework, specifically the component responsible for loading and executing integration code.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict code review processes for core integration APIs and the integration framework.
* Enforce sandboxing or isolation for integration code execution to limit the impact of malicious code.

## Threat: [Integration Data Exfiltration](./threats/integration_data_exfiltration.md)

**Description:** A compromised or malicious integration is designed to collect sensitive data managed by Home Assistant Core (e.g., sensor readings, location data, device states) and transmit it to an external server controlled by the attacker. This could be done through API calls within the integration code.

**Impact:** Loss of sensitive user data, privacy violation, potential for identity theft or other malicious activities based on the exfiltrated data.

**Affected Component:** Integration framework, state machine, event bus (as integrations can listen to events).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement granular permission controls for integrations, allowing users to restrict access to specific data and functionalities.
* Monitor integration network activity for suspicious outbound connections.

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass via Core Vulnerability](./threats/authentication_bypass_via_core_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** A vulnerability exists in the core's authentication mechanism, allowing an attacker to bypass the login process and gain unauthorized access to the Home Assistant interface. This could be due to flaws in password hashing, session management, or other authentication-related code.

**Impact:** Complete unauthorized access to the Home Assistant instance, allowing the attacker to control devices, access sensitive data, and modify configurations.

**Affected Component:** Authentication module, user management system.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust and well-tested authentication mechanisms.
* Regularly perform security audits and penetration testing on the authentication system.

## Threat: [Command Injection through Automation or Scripting](./threats/command_injection_through_automation_or_scripting.md)

**Description:** A vulnerability exists in how Home Assistant Core handles user-provided input within automations or scripts, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands that are then executed on the host system. This could occur if input is not properly sanitized before being passed to shell commands or other system functions.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the host system, leading to complete system compromise.

**Affected Component:** Automation engine, scripting engine (e.g., Python script execution).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all user-provided data used in automations and scripts.
* Avoid direct execution of shell commands whenever possible. Use safer alternatives or libraries.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Malicious Automation](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_malicious_automation.md)

**Description:** An attacker creates a malicious automation that is designed to consume excessive system resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O), leading to a denial-of-service condition for the Home Assistant instance. This could involve creating infinite loops, triggering excessive API calls, or generating large amounts of data.

**Impact:** Home Assistant becomes unresponsive or crashes, disrupting home automation functionality.

**Affected Component:** Automation engine, event bus.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement safeguards to prevent runaway automations, such as limits on execution time or resource consumption.
* Provide tools for users to monitor automation performance and identify problematic automations.

## Threat: [Insecure Storage of Sensitive Data](./threats/insecure_storage_of_sensitive_data.md)

**Description:** Home Assistant Core stores sensitive data (e.g., API keys, passwords, location history) in an insecure manner, making it vulnerable to unauthorized access if the underlying system is compromised. This could involve storing data in plain text or using weak encryption.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials and personal information, potentially leading to further compromise of connected services or devices.

**Affected Component:** Configuration management, data storage mechanisms (e.g., configuration files, database).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Encrypt sensitive data at rest using strong encryption algorithms.
* Avoid storing sensitive data in plain text configuration files. Utilize secure credential storage mechanisms.

## Threat: [Compromised Update Mechanism](./threats/compromised_update_mechanism.md)

**Description:** The mechanism used by Home Assistant Core to download and install updates is compromised, allowing an attacker to distribute malicious updates to users.

**Impact:** Installation of malware or backdoors on user systems, leading to complete system compromise.

**Affected Component:** Update manager, software distribution infrastructure.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong cryptographic signing of updates to ensure authenticity and integrity.
* Secure the update server infrastructure against unauthorized access.
