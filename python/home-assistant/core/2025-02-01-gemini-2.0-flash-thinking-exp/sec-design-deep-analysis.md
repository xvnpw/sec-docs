### 3. Tailored Mitigation Strategies

Based on the identified security implications and the recommended security controls, here are tailored mitigation strategies for Home Assistant Core:

**General Recommendations (Aligned with Recommended Security Controls):**

*   **Implement Automated Security Testing (SAST, DAST) in CI/CD Pipelines:**
    *   **Specific Action:** Integrate SAST tools (e.g., Bandit for Python) into the CI pipeline to automatically scan code for vulnerabilities during pull requests and builds. Implement DAST tools (e.g., OWASP ZAP) to scan the deployed application for web vulnerabilities in CI environments.
    *   **Rationale:** Proactive identification of vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle, reducing the risk of introducing security flaws into releases.
*   **Enhance Input Validation and Sanitization to Prevent Injection Attacks:**
    *   **Specific Action:** Implement robust server-side input validation for all user inputs across Web UI, API, and Device Integration components. Utilize parameterized queries or ORM for database interactions to prevent SQL injection. Sanitize user inputs before rendering in the Web UI to prevent XSS.
    *   **Rationale:** Directly addresses the risk of injection attacks, a major vulnerability category for web applications and APIs.
*   **Implement Rate Limiting and 防禦 Mechanisms Against Brute-Force Attacks:**
    *   **Specific Action:** Implement rate limiting on API endpoints and login pages to prevent brute-force attacks. Consider using CAPTCHA or account lockout mechanisms after multiple failed login attempts. Implement 防禦 mechanisms (e.g., fail2ban) at the deployment level to block malicious IPs.
    *   **Rationale:** Protects against credential stuffing and brute-force attacks targeting user accounts and API access.
*   **Provide Guidance and Tools for Users to Securely Configure Their Deployments:**
    *   **Specific Action:** Develop comprehensive security hardening guides for users, covering topics like OS security, Docker security, network security, and secure configuration of Home Assistant Core. Provide scripts or tools to automate some hardening steps (e.g., setting strong passwords, enabling HTTPS, configuring firewalls).
    *   **Rationale:** Addresses the accepted risk of reliance on user responsibility for secure deployment. Empowers users to improve their security posture.
*   **Establish a Formal Security Incident Response Plan:**
    *   **Specific Action:** Create a documented security incident response plan outlining procedures for handling security vulnerabilities, data breaches, and other security incidents. Define roles and responsibilities, communication channels, and escalation paths.
    *   **Rationale:** Ensures a structured and efficient response to security incidents, minimizing damage and recovery time.
*   **Conduct Regular Penetration Testing or Security Audits:**
