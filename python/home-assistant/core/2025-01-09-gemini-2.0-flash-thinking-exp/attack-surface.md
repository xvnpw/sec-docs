# Attack Surface Analysis for home-assistant/core

## Attack Surface: [Injection Vulnerabilities in Automation Logic](./attack_surfaces/injection_vulnerabilities_in_automation_logic.md)

*   **Description:** When user-provided data or data from untrusted sources is directly used in automation logic without proper sanitization, it can lead to injection attacks.
    *   **How Core Contributes:** The core's templating engine (Jinja2) and service call mechanisms can execute arbitrary code or commands if not used carefully with external data.
    *   **Example:** An automation that uses a user-provided entity name in a service call without validation could allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the service call.
    *   **Impact:** Command execution on the Home Assistant server, potentially leading to full system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Always sanitize and validate user inputs and data from external sources before using them in automation logic.
            *   Use parameterized queries or safe templating practices to prevent injection.
            *   Implement principle of least privilege for automation actions.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Lovelace UI](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_lovelace_ui.md)

*   **Description:** If the core doesn't properly sanitize data displayed in the Lovelace UI, malicious scripts can be injected and executed in a user's browser.
    *   **How Core Contributes:** The core renders data from various sources (entities, integrations) in the frontend. If this rendering doesn't escape potentially malicious content, it creates an XSS vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could craft a malicious entity name or attribute value that, when displayed in Lovelace, executes JavaScript to steal session cookies or perform actions on behalf of the user.
    *   **Impact:** Session hijacking, unauthorized actions on the Home Assistant instance, information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement proper output encoding and sanitization for all data displayed in the Lovelace UI.
            *   Utilize security headers like Content Security Policy (CSP).

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in the Add-on System](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_the_add-on_system.md)

*   **Description:** Add-ons, similar to integrations, extend the functionality of Home Assistant but can introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Core Contributes:** The core manages the installation and execution of add-ons. Vulnerabilities in the add-on management system or the add-on runtime environment can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerable add-on could allow an attacker to gain root access to the underlying operating system.
    *   **Impact:** Full system compromise, data breaches, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement security scanning and review processes for add-ons.
            *   Enforce security best practices for add-on development.
            *   Provide mechanisms for users to report and address vulnerabilities in add-ons.
