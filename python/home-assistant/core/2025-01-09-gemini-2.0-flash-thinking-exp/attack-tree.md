## Attack Tree Path: [*** HIGH-RISK PATH *** Exploit Core Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path__exploit_core_vulnerabilities.md)

* **CRITICAL NODE: Code Execution Vulnerabilities**
    * **Attack Vector: Exploit Template Injection Vulnerabilities**
        * Description: Attackers inject malicious code into Jinja2 templates used in the Lovelace UI or custom integrations. If the application doesn't properly sanitize template inputs, this injected code can be executed on the server.
        * Likelihood: Medium (especially in custom integrations)
        * Impact: Critical (Remote Code Execution, Information Disclosure)
        * Effort: Medium
        * Skill Level: Intermediate
        * Detection Difficulty: Medium
    * **Attack Vector: Exploit Command Injection Vulnerabilities**
        * Description: Attackers supply malicious input to functions within Home Assistant Core or integrations that execute shell commands. If input is not properly sanitized, the attacker's commands will be executed on the server.
        * Likelihood: Medium (more likely in less vetted integrations)
        * Impact: Critical (Remote Code Execution)
        * Effort: Medium
        * Skill Level: Intermediate
        * Detection Difficulty: Medium
    * **CRITICAL NODE: Authentication and Authorization Bypass**
        * **Attack Vector: Exploit Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities**
            * Description: Attackers exploit flaws in Home Assistant's authentication mechanisms (e.g., session management, API key handling) to gain access without providing valid credentials.
            * Likelihood: Low
            * Impact: Critical (Full Access)
            * Effort: Medium
            * Skill Level: Advanced
            * Detection Difficulty: Medium
    * **Attack Vector: Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities**
        * Description: Attackers target known security vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by Home Assistant Core. They identify vulnerable dependencies and leverage existing exploits to compromise the system.
        * Likelihood: Medium (depends on the age and maintenance of dependencies)
        * Impact: Varies (can range from Denial of Service to Remote Code Execution)
        * Effort: Low to Medium (if exploits are readily available)
        * Skill Level: Beginner to Intermediate (depending on the exploit complexity)
        * Detection Difficulty: Medium (requires vulnerability scanning)

## Attack Tree Path: [*** HIGH-RISK PATH *** Exploit Integration Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path__exploit_integration_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Attack Vector: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Custom Integrations**
        * Description: Attackers identify and exploit security flaws within user-created custom integrations. These integrations are often less scrutinized than official ones, making them a more likely target. Vulnerabilities can range from simple input validation issues to more complex code execution flaws.
        * Likelihood: High (due to lack of formal review and varying coding quality)
        * Impact: Varies (depending on the integration's functionality, potentially leading to code execution or device control)
        * Effort: Low to Medium
        * Skill Level: Beginner to Intermediate
        * Detection Difficulty: Medium
    * **Attack Vector: Exploit Insecure Communication with Integrated Services**
        * **Attack Vector: Man-in-the-Middle Attacks**
            * Description: Attackers intercept and potentially manipulate communication between the Home Assistant instance and external services used by integrations. This can lead to data theft or the injection of malicious data.
            * Likelihood: Low to Medium (depends on network security)
            * Impact: Significant (Data Interception, Manipulation)
            * Effort: Medium
            * Skill Level: Intermediate
            * Detection Difficulty: Difficult
        * **CRITICAL NODE: Credential Theft for Integrated Services**
            * Description: Attackers gain access to stored credentials (usernames, passwords, API keys) used by integrations to connect to external services. This allows them to impersonate the Home Assistant instance and control those services.
            * Likelihood: Medium (if stored insecurely)
            * Impact: Significant (Access to External Services)
            * Effort: Low to Medium
            * Skill Level: Beginner to Intermediate
            * Detection Difficulty: Difficult
        * **CRITICAL NODE: API Key/Token Compromise for Integrations**
            * Description: Similar to credential theft, attackers obtain API keys or tokens used by integrations. This grants them unauthorized access to the functionalities and data of the integrated services.
            * Likelihood: Medium (if stored insecurely or transmitted without encryption)
            * Impact: Significant (Access to External Services)
            * Effort: Low to Medium
            * Skill Level: Beginner to Intermediate
            * Detection Difficulty: Difficult

## Attack Tree Path: [*** HIGH-RISK PATH *** Exploit Configuration Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path__exploit_configuration_weaknesses.md)

* **CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Insecurely Stored Credentials**
        * Description: Attackers gain access to sensitive credentials (passwords, API keys, etc.) that are stored in plain text or weakly encrypted within Home Assistant's configuration files (e.g., `configuration.yaml`).
        * Likelihood: Medium (if best practices are not followed)
        * Impact: Significant (Access to External Services, System Compromise)
        * Effort: Low
        * Skill Level: Beginner
        * Detection Difficulty: Difficult (if access to the filesystem is gained)
