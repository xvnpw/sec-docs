# Threat Model Analysis for home-assistant/core

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in State Machine](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_state_machine.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might exploit vulnerabilities in the state machine access controls or API endpoints *within Home Assistant Core* to query and retrieve sensitive data such as location history, device status, or even stored credentials for certain integrations. This could be done through crafted API requests or by exploiting flaws in how the core manages access to the state machine.
    *   **Impact:** Privacy violation, potential for physical security breaches (e.g., knowing when someone is away from home), and unauthorized access to integrated services using leaked credentials.
    *   **Affected Component:** `core.data_entry_flow`, `core.state`, `core.websocket_api`
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust access controls for the state machine API and internal access points.
        *   Regularly audit and review core code that interacts with the state machine for potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider encrypting sensitive data within the state machine at rest.

## Threat: [Insecure Storage of Configuration Data](./threats/insecure_storage_of_configuration_data.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker who gains access to the Home Assistant configuration files (e.g., `configuration.yaml`, secrets files) could extract sensitive information like API keys, passwords for integrations, and network credentials. This could happen through filesystem vulnerabilities *on the system running Home Assistant Core* or compromised user accounts.
    *   **Impact:** Full system compromise, unauthorized access to connected devices and services, and potential for further attacks leveraging exposed credentials.
    *   **Affected Component:** `core.config`, `core.bootstrap`
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure proper file system permissions for configuration files, restricting access to the Home Assistant user.
        *   Implement secure backup practices, encrypting backups and storing them securely.
        *   Utilize Home Assistant's secrets management feature to avoid storing sensitive information directly in configuration files.
        *   Regularly review and rotate API keys and passwords.

## Threat: [API Vulnerabilities Leading to Unauthorized Access](./threats/api_vulnerabilities_leading_to_unauthorized_access.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in Home Assistant's API (e.g., authentication bypass, insufficient authorization checks, injection flaws) *within the core's API implementation* to gain unauthorized access and control of the system. This could be done through crafted API requests.
    *   **Impact:** Remote control of devices, data manipulation, and potential for system disruption.
    *   **Affected Component:** `core.http_api`, `core.websocket_api`
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for the API.
        *   Thoroughly validate all API inputs to prevent injection attacks.
        *   Regularly audit the API codebase for security vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass or Weaknesses](./threats/authentication_bypass_or_weaknesses.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit flaws in Home Assistant's authentication mechanisms *within the core's authentication module* (e.g., weak password hashing, session management vulnerabilities, bypass vulnerabilities) to gain unauthorized access to user accounts.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the Home Assistant instance and control over connected devices.
    *   **Affected Component:** `core.auth`
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use strong password hashing algorithms.
        *   Implement secure session management practices, including proper session invalidation and timeouts.
        *   Enforce strong password policies for users.
        *   Consider implementing multi-factor authentication.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Home Assistant Core Code](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_home_assistant_core_code.md)

*   **Description:** As with any software, Home Assistant Core may contain security vulnerabilities in its codebase (e.g., buffer overflows, injection flaws, logic errors). These vulnerabilities *within the core itself* could be exploited for various malicious purposes.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, and information disclosure.
    *   **Affected Component:** Various modules and functions throughout the core codebase.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow secure coding practices during development.
        *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the core codebase.
        *   Utilize static and dynamic analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Maintain a robust vulnerability management process for reporting and patching vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Home Assistant relies on numerous third-party libraries and dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited *through the Home Assistant Core platform*.
    *   **Impact:** Same as vulnerabilities in the core code, potentially impacting a wider range of functionalities.
    *   **Affected Component:**  The dependency management system and any core module utilizing the vulnerable dependency.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update dependencies to their latest secure versions.
        *   Utilize dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
        *   Pin dependency versions to ensure consistent and secure builds.

## Threat: [Misconfiguration Leading to Security Weaknesses](./threats/misconfiguration_leading_to_security_weaknesses.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrectly configured settings *within Home Assistant Core* by the user (or insecure default configurations within the core) can introduce security vulnerabilities, such as exposed services, weak authentication settings, or overly permissive access controls.
    *   **Impact:** Opens up attack vectors that could have been avoided with proper configuration, potentially leading to full system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** `core.config`, various core component configurations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Provide clear and comprehensive documentation on secure configuration practices.
        *   Implement secure default configurations where possible.
        *   Develop tools or checks within Home Assistant Core to help users identify potential misconfigurations.
        *   Educate users on the importance of secure configuration.

## Threat: [Lack of Timely Updates](./threats/lack_of_timely_updates.md)

*   **Description:** Failing to apply security updates to Home Assistant Core in a timely manner leaves the system vulnerable to known exploits that have been patched in newer versions.
    *   **Impact:** Exploitation of known vulnerabilities that have been publicly disclosed and have available fixes.
    *   **Affected Component:** The entire Home Assistant Core system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
