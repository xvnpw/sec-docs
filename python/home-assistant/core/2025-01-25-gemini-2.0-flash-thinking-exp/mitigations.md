# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for home-assistant/core

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Integration Security Framework & Tools](./mitigation_strategies/implement_integration_security_framework_&_tools.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Secure Integration API Standards:**  Within Home Assistant Core, establish clear and well-documented APIs and frameworks that guide integration developers towards secure coding practices. This includes:
        *   Standardized input validation and sanitization functions within the Core library.
        *   Secure authentication and authorization mechanisms that integrations *must* use.
        *   Secure data storage APIs that enforce encryption or secure storage locations.
        *   Logging frameworks that encourage secure logging practices and prevent logging of sensitive data by default.
    2.  **Develop Static Analysis Tools for Integrations:** Create or integrate static analysis tools within the Home Assistant Core development environment and CI/CD pipeline. These tools should:
        *   Scan integration code for common security vulnerabilities (e.g., injection flaws, insecure API usage).
        *   Enforce adherence to the defined secure integration API standards.
        *   Identify use of deprecated or insecure functions within integrations.
    3.  **Runtime Integration Sandboxing/Isolation:** Explore and implement mechanisms within Home Assistant Core to sandbox or isolate integrations at runtime. This could involve:
        *   Using process isolation or containerization techniques to limit the impact of a compromised integration.
        *   Implementing resource limits for integrations to prevent denial-of-service scenarios.
        *   Restricting inter-integration communication to only authorized and secure channels.
    4.  **Integration Security Review Process:**  Formalize a security review process within the Home Assistant Core contribution workflow for new integrations and updates. This process should:
        *   Involve security-focused code reviews by designated reviewers.
        *   Utilize the static analysis tools developed in step 2.
        *   Require adherence to the secure integration API standards.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerable Integrations (High Severity):** Exploitable vulnerabilities in integrations due to insecure coding practices.
