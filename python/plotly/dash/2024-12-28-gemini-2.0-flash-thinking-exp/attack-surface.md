Here's an updated list of key attack surfaces that directly involve Dash, focusing on high and critical severity elements, using valid markdown formatting and avoiding tables:

**I. Server-Side Code Injection via Callbacks:**

*   **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious code into server-side execution through unsanitized user input processed within Dash callbacks.
*   **How Dash Contributes:** Dash callbacks execute Python code on the server in response to user interactions. If input from Dash components is directly used in database queries, system commands, or other code without proper sanitization or parameterization, it creates an injection vulnerability.
*   **Example:** A text input field in a Dash app is used to filter data in a database. A malicious user enters `; DROP TABLE users;` into the input field. If the callback directly constructs the SQL query using this input without sanitization, it could lead to the deletion of the `users` table.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the server, data breaches, data manipulation, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize all user input received in callbacks before using it in any server-side operations.
    *   **Parameterized Queries:** Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for database interactions to prevent SQL injection.
    *   **Avoid Dynamic Code Execution:** Minimize or avoid the use of `eval()` or similar functions that execute arbitrary code based on user input within callbacks.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the Dash application with minimal necessary permissions.

**II. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Component Properties:**

*   **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious client-side scripts into the application that are executed in the browsers of other users.
*   **How Dash Contributes:** Dash components render HTML based on properties passed to them. If user-controlled data is directly used in component properties without proper sanitization, it can lead to XSS vulnerabilities. This is especially relevant for components that display user-provided text or allow custom HTML.
*   **Example:** A Dash application displays user comments. If a comment containing `<script>alert("XSS");</script>` is stored and then rendered using a Dash component without sanitization, the script will execute in the browsers of users viewing that comment.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, redirection to malicious sites, data theft, defacement of the application.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Output Encoding/Escaping:** Encode or escape user-provided data before rendering it in Dash components. Be mindful of the context where data is being rendered.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, mitigating the impact of injected scripts.
    *   **Sanitize User Input on the Server-Side:** While output encoding is crucial, sanitizing input on the server-side before storing it can provide an additional layer of defense.
