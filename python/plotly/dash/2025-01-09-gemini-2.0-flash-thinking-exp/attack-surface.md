# Attack Surface Analysis for plotly/dash

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side Injection via Dash Core Components](./attack_surfaces/client-side_injection_via_dash_core_components.md)

*   **Description:**  Malicious scripts or HTML injected through the properties of Dash Core Components, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Dash Contributes:** Dash's dynamic updates and rendering of components based on callback outputs can inadvertently render unsanitized user-provided data as executable code in the user's browser.
    *   **Example:** A callback receives user input and directly updates the `children` property of a `dcc.Markdown` component without sanitizing HTML tags present in the input, allowing an attacker to inject `<script>` tags.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Sanitize User Input:**  Thoroughly sanitize any user-provided data before using it to update component properties, especially those that render HTML or Markdown. Libraries like `bleach` can be used for HTML sanitization.
        *   **Use Secure Rendering Practices:** Avoid directly rendering unsanitized HTML. If displaying user-generated content, consider using safer components or escaping HTML entities.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of successful XSS attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Code Injection through Callbacks](./attack_surfaces/server-side_code_injection_through_callbacks.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers can inject and execute arbitrary code on the server by manipulating input that is directly used in server-side code within Dash callbacks.
    *   **How Dash Contributes:** Callbacks connect client-side interactions to server-side Python code. If user input is not properly validated and sanitized before being used in operations like executing shell commands or constructing database queries within a callback, it can lead to code injection.
    *   **Example:** A callback takes user input for a filename and uses it directly in `os.system(f"cat {filename}")` without proper validation, allowing an attacker to inject malicious commands like `"; rm -rf /"` by providing a crafted filename.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the server, data breaches, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Strictly validate and sanitize all user inputs received by callbacks before using them in any server-side operations. Use allow-lists rather than deny-lists for validation.
        *   **Avoid Dynamic Code Execution:** Minimize or avoid using functions like `eval()` or `exec()` with user-provided input.
        *   **Parameterization:** When interacting with databases, use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the Dash application with the minimum necessary privileges.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Callback Abuse](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_callback_abuse.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers can overwhelm the server by triggering computationally expensive or resource-intensive callbacks repeatedly.
    *   **How Dash Contributes:** Dash's callback mechanism allows for frequent communication between the client and server. If callbacks perform heavy computations, access external resources without timeouts, or have inefficient logic, they can be abused to cause a DoS.
    *   **Example:** A callback performs a complex data analysis operation or makes multiple requests to an external API each time a slider is moved. An attacker could rapidly manipulate the slider to overload the server.
    *   **Impact:** Application unavailability, server crashes, resource exhaustion.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on callback execution to restrict the number of requests from a single user or IP address within a given timeframe.
        *   **Optimize Callback Performance:** Ensure callbacks are efficient and avoid unnecessary computations or resource-intensive operations.
        *   **Timeouts:** Implement timeouts for external API calls or long-running processes within callbacks to prevent them from blocking resources indefinitely.
        *   **Queueing Mechanisms:** For tasks that can be deferred, consider using task queues (e.g., Celery) to handle them asynchronously and prevent blocking the main application thread.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Debug Endpoints in Production](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_debug_endpoints_in_production.md)

*   **Description:**  Leaving Dash or Flask in debug mode in a production environment exposes sensitive information and interactive debuggers that attackers can exploit.
    *   **How Dash Contributes:** Dash relies on Flask, and enabling Flask's debug mode (which is often the default during development) exposes debugging tools and detailed error messages that can reveal internal application details and even allow for arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Example:** A Dash application deployed with `app.run(debug=True)` allows attackers to access the Flask debugger, potentially executing arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the server, information disclosure, remote code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Disable Debug Mode in Production:** Ensure that the `debug` parameter in `app.run()` is set to `False` in production deployments.
        *   **Secure Configuration Management:** Use environment variables or secure configuration files to manage deployment settings and ensure debug mode is disabled in production.
