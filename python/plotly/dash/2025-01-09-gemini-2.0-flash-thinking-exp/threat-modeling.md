# Threat Model Analysis for plotly/dash

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Unsanitized Component Properties](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_unsanitized_component_properties.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a Dash application by exploiting a Dash component property that doesn't properly sanitize user-provided or external data. This injected script executes in the victim's browser when they view the affected part of the application. The attacker might steal cookies, session tokens, redirect the user, or perform other malicious actions on behalf of the user. This directly involves how Dash components render content.

**Impact:** Account compromise, data theft, defacement of the application, spreading malware to other users.

**Affected Dash Component:** `dash_html_components` (e.g., `html.Div`, `html.P` with unsanitized `children`), `dash_core_components` (e.g., `dcc.Markdown` with unsanitized input), custom components that render user-provided content.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Sanitize all user-provided data before rendering it in Dash components. Use libraries like `bleach` for HTML sanitization.
* Avoid directly rendering raw HTML from untrusted sources.
* Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.
* Regularly review and update Dash component libraries to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Client-Side Data Tampering Affecting Callbacks](./threats/client-side_data_tampering_affecting_callbacks.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts and modifies the data sent from the client-side to the server-side during a Dash callback. This can be done using browser developer tools or by intercepting network requests. The attacker might manipulate input values that are part of the Dash callback mechanism to bypass security checks or trigger unintended server-side actions. This directly involves how Dash manages client-server communication for interactivity.

**Impact:** Data manipulation, unauthorized access to resources, triggering unintended application behavior, potential for server-side vulnerabilities if backend logic relies solely on client-provided data without validation.

**Affected Dash Component:** `dash.Input`, `dash.State`, any component whose `value` or other properties are used as inputs in Dash callbacks.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Never trust client-side data.** Implement robust server-side validation for all callback inputs.
* Use signed or encrypted data if integrity is critical for client-to-server communication (though this adds complexity).
* Implement authorization checks on the server-side within the Dash callback logic to ensure the user has the necessary permissions for the requested action, regardless of the client-provided data.

## Threat: [Callback Logic Vulnerabilities due to Improper Input Validation](./threats/callback_logic_vulnerabilities_due_to_improper_input_validation.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides malicious input to a Dash callback that is not properly validated on the server-side within the callback function. This can lead to various vulnerabilities, such as unexpected application behavior, errors, or even the execution of arbitrary code on the server if the input is used in unsafe operations. This directly involves the server-side logic within Dash callbacks defined using `@app.callback`.

**Impact:** Server-side errors, denial of service, potential for remote code execution if input is used unsafely, data corruption.

**Affected Dash Component:** The callback functions defined by the developer using the `@app.callback` decorator, specifically the logic within those functions.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement server-side input validation for all `Input` and `State` properties used within Dash callbacks.
* Use type checking and range validation to ensure inputs are within expected boundaries.
* Sanitize input to remove or escape potentially harmful characters before processing it within the callback.
* Avoid constructing dynamic commands or queries based on user input within Dash callbacks without proper sanitization and parameterization.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Dash Component Libraries](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_dash_component_libraries.md)

**Description:** A security vulnerability exists within a specific Dash component library (either the core Dash components provided by `plotly`, or third-party libraries). An attacker can exploit this vulnerability if the application uses the affected component. This directly involves the code within the `plotly/dash` component libraries or other libraries designed to work with Dash.

**Impact:** Depends on the specific vulnerability, but could range from XSS (within the component's rendering logic) to remote code execution (if a backend component has a flaw).

**Affected Dash Component:** Specific components within `dash_core_components`, `dash_html_components`, `dash_table`, or third-party Dash component libraries.

**Risk Severity:** Can be Critical or High depending on the specific vulnerability.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep Dash and all its component libraries updated to the latest versions to benefit from security patches provided by the `plotly` team and other component developers.
* Monitor security advisories for Dash and its dependencies.
* Be cautious when using third-party component libraries and evaluate their security posture before integrating them into your Dash application.
