## Attack Tree Path: [Stored XSS via User-Provided Content in Dash Components](./attack_tree_paths/stored_xss_via_user-provided_content_in_dash_components.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a Dash component that accepts user input and persists this data (e.g., a DataTable, a Markdown component used to display user-generated content, or a custom component). When other users view this content, the malicious script is executed in their browsers.

**Consequences:**
*   **Session Hijacking:** The attacker can steal the session cookies of other users, allowing them to impersonate those users.
*   **Account Takeover:** By stealing session cookies or through other malicious actions, the attacker can gain full control of user accounts.
*   **Data Theft:** The attacker can access and exfiltrate sensitive data displayed within the application.
*   **Malware Distribution:** The attacker can redirect users to malicious websites or inject code to download malware onto their machines.
*   **Defacement:** The attacker can alter the appearance or functionality of the application for other users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Callback Payloads](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_callback_payloads.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Dash applications heavily rely on callbacks to handle user interactions and update the application's state. An attacker can exploit vulnerabilities in how these callbacks are handled on the server-side. This can involve:
*   **Crafting Malicious Callback Payloads:**  The attacker sends specially crafted data in a callback request that, when processed by the server-side Python code, leads to unintended actions. This could involve manipulating the `output` or `state` of other components in a harmful way.
*   **Parameter Tampering:** The attacker modifies the arguments or structure of the callback data sent from the client to bypass security checks or trigger unexpected behavior.

**Consequences:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If the server-side callback logic is not properly secured, an attacker might be able to inject and execute arbitrary Python code on the server hosting the Dash application.
*   **Data Breach:** The attacker could manipulate callbacks to access or modify sensitive data stored on the server or in the application's database.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By manipulating callbacks, an attacker with limited privileges might be able to perform actions that are normally restricted to administrators or other higher-privileged users.
*   **Application Logic Bypass:** The attacker can circumvent intended workflows or security measures by crafting specific callback requests.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Insecure Deserialization in Callback Data (if applicable)](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_insecure_deserialization_in_callback_data__if_applicable_.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the Dash application or custom components deserialize data received in callbacks (e.g., using `pickle` or other deserialization libraries), an attacker could craft a malicious serialized object. When the server deserializes this object, it can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.

**Consequences:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** This is the primary risk associated with insecure deserialization. The attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** Successful RCE can lead to the attacker gaining full control over the server hosting the Dash application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Dash Component Libraries](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_dash_component_libraries.md)

**Attack Vector:** Dash applications often utilize third-party component libraries to extend their functionality. These libraries may contain known security vulnerabilities. If the application uses outdated or vulnerable versions of these libraries, an attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities.

**Consequences:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Vulnerabilities in component libraries can introduce XSS risks.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Some component library vulnerabilities can allow for arbitrary code execution on the server or client-side.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Vulnerabilities might allow an attacker to crash the application or consume excessive resources.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  Vulnerabilities could expose sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Debug Mode Enabled in Production](./attack_tree_paths/debug_mode_enabled_in_production.md)

**Attack Vector:** Running a Dash application in debug mode in a production environment exposes sensitive debugging information and functionalities that should only be used during development.

**Consequences:**
*   **Information Disclosure:**  The debug interface can reveal sensitive configuration details, environment variables, source code snippets, and internal application state.
*   **Code Execution:** In some cases, debug mode might provide functionalities that allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Increased Attack Surface:** Debug mode often disables security checks and exposes endpoints that are not intended for public access, making the application more vulnerable to other attacks.
*   **Exposure of Secrets:** API keys, database credentials, and other secrets might be inadvertently exposed through the debug interface.
