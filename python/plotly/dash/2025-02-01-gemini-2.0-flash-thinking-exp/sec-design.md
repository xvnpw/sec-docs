# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
 - Enable data scientists and analysts to easily build and deploy interactive web applications for data visualization and analysis without extensive web development expertise.
 - Provide a framework that supports multiple programming languages (Python, R, Julia, Javascript) to cater to a broad range of data professionals.
 - Foster a vibrant community and ecosystem around Dash, encouraging contributions and extensions.
 - Offer a flexible and customizable platform that can be adapted to various data analysis and presentation needs.
 - Streamline the process of sharing data insights and analytical results through web-based dashboards.

- Most Important Business Risks:
 - Security vulnerabilities in Dash components or user-developed applications could lead to data breaches or unauthorized access to sensitive information.
 - Lack of scalability could hinder adoption by larger organizations or for applications with high user traffic.
 - Dependence on open-source components introduces supply chain risks and potential vulnerabilities.
 - Complexity in deployment and maintenance could increase operational costs and reduce user adoption.
 - Incompatibility issues between different Dash components or versions could disrupt application functionality and user experience.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
 - security control: Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) - assumed to be in place for Dash development, including code reviews and testing, although specific details are not provided in the repository.
 - security control: Dependency Management - using `requirements.txt` and similar files to manage project dependencies, which allows for tracking and potentially auditing dependencies.
 - security control: Input Validation - Dash framework likely incorporates some level of default input validation to prevent common web vulnerabilities, although the extent and configurability are not explicitly documented in the repository.
 - security control: HTTPS support - Dash applications are typically deployed over HTTPS, ensuring encryption of data in transit.
 - accepted risk: Reliance on user-developed application security - Dash framework provides the building blocks, but the security of the final application heavily depends on the developer's practices and implementation.
 - accepted risk: Open-source nature - vulnerabilities might be publicly disclosed before patches are available, requiring users to be proactive in updating.

- Recommended Security Controls:
 - security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline for Dash framework development to identify and address vulnerabilities early.
 - security control: Conduct regular penetration testing and security audits of the Dash framework and example applications to proactively discover and remediate security weaknesses.
 - security control: Provide comprehensive security documentation and best practices for Dash application developers, covering topics like authentication, authorization, input validation, and secure coding practices.
 - security control: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure and response process for the Dash framework to handle security issues effectively and transparently.
 - security control: Implement dependency scanning and vulnerability monitoring for all third-party libraries used by Dash to mitigate supply chain risks.

- Security Requirements:
 - Authentication:
  - Requirement: Dash applications should support various authentication mechanisms to verify user identities, such as username/password, OAuth 2.0, or SAML.
  - Requirement: Authentication mechanisms should be configurable and adaptable to different organizational security policies.
 - Authorization:
  - Requirement: Dash applications should implement fine-grained authorization controls to manage user access to specific data, features, and functionalities based on roles or permissions.
  - Requirement: Authorization policies should be clearly defined, easily manageable, and auditable.
 - Input Validation:
  - Requirement: Dash framework must provide robust input validation mechanisms to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting) and ensure data integrity.
  - Requirement: Input validation should be applied to all user inputs, including form data, URL parameters, and API requests.
 - Cryptography:
  - Requirement: Dash framework should support the use of cryptography for protecting sensitive data at rest and in transit.
  - Requirement: Secure storage and handling of cryptographic keys and secrets should be ensured.
  - Requirement: Dash applications should encourage and facilitate the use of HTTPS for all communication.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
 - Data Visualization and Reporting: Dash enables users to create interactive dashboards and reports to visualize and understand data, which is crucial for data-driven decision-making.
 - Data Analysis and Exploration: Dash facilitates data exploration and analysis by providing interactive tools and visualizations, supporting critical analytical workflows.
 - Sharing Data Insights: Dash applications are used to share data insights and analytical results with stakeholders, enabling communication and collaboration based on data.

- Data Sensitivity:
 - Data handled by Dash applications can vary widely in sensitivity depending on the use case.
 - Potentially sensitive data types include:
  - Business-critical data: Financial data, sales data, customer data, operational metrics.
  - Personally Identifiable Information (PII): User data, customer details, employee information.
  - Confidential research data: Proprietary algorithms, research findings, intellectual property.
  - Healthcare data: Patient records, medical information (if used in healthcare applications).
 - Sensitivity level depends on the context of the Dash application and the data it processes. Applications handling PII or confidential business data require higher security measures.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
 - What specific authentication and authorization mechanisms are commonly used or recommended for Dash applications?
 - Are there built-in security features within Dash framework to address common web vulnerabilities like XSS and CSRF?
 - What are the best practices for securing Dash applications in different deployment environments (cloud, on-premises)?
 - Are there any official security guidelines or documentation provided by the Dash project?
 - What is the typical data flow and data processing pipeline within a Dash application?

- Assumptions:
 - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to empower data professionals to build and share data insights effectively and securely. Security is a significant concern due to the potential handling of sensitive data.
 - SECURITY POSTURE: While Dash framework likely incorporates some basic security measures, comprehensive security requires proactive implementation of security controls by Dash developers and application developers. Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) is assumed to be a desired practice.
 - DESIGN: Dash applications follow a client-server architecture with Python/R/Julia backend and Javascript frontend. Deployment is flexible and can be adapted to various environments. Build process involves standard CI/CD practices with potential for security scanning integration.
