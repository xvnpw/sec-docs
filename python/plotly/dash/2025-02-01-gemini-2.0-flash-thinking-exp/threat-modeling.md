# Threat Model Analysis for plotly/dash

## Threat: [Unvalidated Callback Inputs leading to Code Injection or Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE)](./threats/unvalidated_callback_inputs_leading_to_code_injection_or_arbitrary_code_execution__ace_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input data sent from the client to a Dash callback function. If the callback function doesn't validate and sanitize this input before using it in server-side operations (e.g., system commands, database queries), the attacker can inject code. This injected code executes on the server, granting the attacker control of the application and potentially the server. For example, injecting shell commands into an input used to construct a system command within a callback.
*   **Impact:** **Critical**. Complete compromise of the server, including data breaches, data manipulation, service disruption, and further attacks on internal networks.
*   **Affected Dash Component:** `dash.callback` decorator and callback functions, specifically input arguments receiving data from client-side components.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation within callback functions, checking data type, format, length, and allowed characters. Utilize input validation and sanitization libraries.
    *   **Parameterized Operations:** Avoid dynamically constructing code or commands based on user input. Use parameterized queries for database interactions and secure libraries for system interactions to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the Dash application with minimal necessary privileges to limit the impact of successful code execution.
    *   **Code Review and Security Testing:** Regularly review callback functions for injection vulnerabilities and conduct penetration testing.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Resource-Intensive Callbacks](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__through_resource-intensive_callbacks.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker repeatedly triggers resource-intensive Dash callbacks or sends crafted inputs causing callbacks to consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory, network). Flooding the server with these requests overloads it, making the application unresponsive to legitimate users and potentially crashing the server. For example, targeting a callback performing complex calculations or accessing external APIs without rate limiting.
*   **Impact:** **High**. Application unavailability for legitimate users, leading to business disruption and reputational damage. Severe cases can cause server crashes and data loss.
*   **Affected Dash Component:** `dash.callback` decorator and callback functions, especially those performing computationally expensive operations or interacting with external resources.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Callback Performance Optimization:** Optimize callback code for efficiency using efficient algorithms, data structures, and caching.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on callbacks to restrict requests from a single user or IP address within a timeframe. Use rate limiting libraries or web server configurations.
    *   **Resource Limits and Monitoring:** Configure server-side resource limits (CPU, memory) for the Dash application. Monitor server resource usage to detect and respond to DoS attacks.
    *   **Input Validation (for complexity):** Validate input sizes and complexity to prevent callbacks from processing excessively large or complex data leading to resource exhaustion.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Unsafe Component Properties](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_unsafe_component_properties.md)

*   **Description:** Developers using `dangerously_allow_html` in Dash components or creating custom components without proper input sanitization when rendering HTML can introduce XSS vulnerabilities. An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into user-provided input. When rendered by the Dash application, this script executes in other users' browsers, potentially stealing credentials, redirecting users, or defacing the application.
*   **Impact:** **High**. XSS vulnerabilities can lead to account compromise, data theft, malware distribution, and website defacement, impacting users and application reputation.
*   **Affected Dash Component:** Dash components using `dangerously_allow_html` or custom components rendering user-provided HTML without sanitization.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid `dangerously_allow_html`:** Minimize or avoid using `dangerously_allow_html`. If HTML rendering is necessary, implement strict sanitization.
    *   **Input Sanitization in Custom Components:** Rigorously sanitize user input in custom components rendering HTML, removing or escaping malicious HTML and JavaScript. Use sanitization libraries like DOMPurify or bleach.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement CSP to mitigate XSS impact by controlling resource sources the browser can load.
    *   **Regular Security Testing:** Conduct regular security testing, including XSS vulnerability scanning.
