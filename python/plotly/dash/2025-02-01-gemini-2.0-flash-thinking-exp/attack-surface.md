# Attack Surface Analysis for plotly/dash

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized User Input in Component Properties](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_unsanitized_user_input_in_component_properties.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages through user-provided data rendered by Dash components, leading to script execution in users' browsers.

    *   **Dash Contribution:** Dash's component-based architecture and dynamic property updates, especially the use of `children` in `html` components and `dcc.Markdown`, directly render content.  If user input is not sanitized before being used as component properties, Dash facilitates the injection point for XSS.  `dangerously_allow_html=True` explicitly exacerbates this.

    *   **Example:** A Dash app uses `dcc.Input` to get user text and displays it in `html.Div` using `children`.  Entering `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>` in the input results in the script executing when the `html.Div` updates.

    *   **Impact:** Account compromise, data theft, website defacement, malware distribution.

    *   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**.

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Sanitization:** Sanitize all user inputs *before* setting them as component properties. Use libraries to escape HTML entities and remove or neutralize JavaScript.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a restrictive CSP header to limit script execution sources, mitigating XSS impact.
        *   **Minimize `dangerously_allow_html=True`:** Avoid using `dangerously_allow_html=True` in `dcc.Markdown` unless absolutely necessary and with extreme input sanitization.
        *   **Output Encoding:** Ensure proper output encoding to prevent browsers from interpreting user data as code.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Command Injection via Unvalidated Callback Inputs](./attack_surfaces/server-side_command_injection_via_unvalidated_callback_inputs.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious operating system commands through user inputs processed by Dash callbacks, leading to arbitrary command execution on the server.

    *   **Dash Contribution:** Dash callbacks are the primary server-side logic execution points. They receive user input from client-side components. If callbacks use this input to construct and execute system commands (e.g., via `os.system`, `subprocess`) without validation, Dash's callback mechanism becomes the direct vector for command injection.

    *   **Example:** A Dash callback takes user input for a filename and uses `os.system(f"grep {user_input} file.txt")`.  An attacker could input `"; cat /etc/passwd #"` to execute `cat /etc/passwd` on the server.

    *   **Impact:** Full server compromise, data breach, denial of service, data manipulation, privilege escalation.

    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**.

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Rigorous Input Validation:**  Validate *all* callback inputs. Use whitelists for allowed characters and patterns.
        *   **Avoid System Commands:**  Minimize or eliminate direct system command execution in callbacks. Use safer alternatives or parameterized execution if necessary.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the Dash application with minimal server privileges to limit command injection impact.
        *   **Input Validation Libraries:** Utilize dedicated input validation libraries for robust protection.

## Attack Surface: [Debug Mode Enabled in Production](./attack_surfaces/debug_mode_enabled_in_production.md)

*   **Description:** Running Dash (or Flask) applications in debug mode in production exposes sensitive information and can create code execution risks.

    *   **Dash Contribution:** Dash applications inherit Flask's debug mode functionality, enabled via `debug=True` in `app.run_server()`.  Dash deployment simplicity can lead to accidentally leaving debug mode on in production.

    *   **Example:** With debug mode enabled, Dash displays detailed stack traces in the browser upon errors, revealing server file paths, code structure, and potentially sensitive configuration details to attackers.

    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, easier exploitation of other vulnerabilities, potential code execution.

    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**.

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Disable Debug Mode:**  **Never** run Dash applications in production with `debug=True`. Ensure `debug=False` or omit the argument for production deployments.
        *   **Proper Error Handling & Logging:** Implement robust error handling and logging to manage errors without exposing sensitive details to users.
        *   **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables to manage configuration, ensuring debug mode is easily disabled in production.
