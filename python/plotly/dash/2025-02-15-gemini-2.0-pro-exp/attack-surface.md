# Attack Surface Analysis for plotly/dash

## Attack Surface: [1. Callback Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/1__callback_manipulation.md)

*Description:* Attackers attempt to trigger Dash callbacks with unexpected inputs, in unintended sequences, or with manipulated component IDs to gain unauthorized access to data, execute malicious code, or cause a denial-of-service. This is the *core* attack vector against Dash applications.
*How Dash Contributes:* Dash's fundamental architecture is built around callbacks, making them the primary interaction point and thus the primary target. The client-server communication model is inherent to Dash's design.
*Example:* An attacker modifies the value of a hidden `dcc.Input` component in the browser's developer tools to bypass front-end validation and send a malicious payload to a callback that interacts with a database.
*Impact:*
    *   Data breaches (reading, modifying, or deleting sensitive data).
    *   Arbitrary code execution on the server.
    *   Denial-of-service.
    *   Application instability.
*Risk Severity:* **Critical**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement rigorous server-side validation of *all* callback inputs, checking data types, ranges, formats, and allowed values.  Do *not* rely on client-side validation.
    *   **`prevent_initial_call=True`:** Use in callbacks where the initial call on page load is unnecessary.
    *   **`Output` vs. `State`:** Carefully choose between `Input` (triggers callback) and `State` (provides data without triggering).
    *   **Callback Graph Review:** Analyze the callback graph (using Dash Dev Tools *in development only*) to identify potential unintended callback chains.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on callbacks, especially resource-intensive ones.
    *   **Authentication/Authorization:** Enforce authentication and authorization *within* callback logic for sensitive operations.
    *   **Server-Side ID Validation:** Validate component IDs received by callbacks on the server.
    *   **Pattern-Matching Callback Caution:** Use pattern-matching callbacks with extreme care; ensure patterns are specific and handle unexpected IDs.

## Attack Surface: [2. Component Vulnerabilities (Dash Core and Custom Components)](./attack_surfaces/2__component_vulnerabilities__dash_core_and_custom_components_.md)

*Description:* Exploitation of vulnerabilities in Dash core components (`dash-core-components`, `dash-html-components`, `dash-table`, etc.) or custom-built Dash components.
*How Dash Contributes:* Dash relies on these components for its UI and functionality. Vulnerabilities in these components, or their dependencies, are directly exploitable within the Dash application context.
*Example:* A known vulnerability in an older version of `dash-table` allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code through a specially crafted table input, leading to XSS.
*Impact:*
    *   Cross-site scripting (XSS) within the component.
    *   Data leakage.
    *   Client-side code execution.
    *   Application compromise.
*Risk Severity:* **High** (can be Critical depending on the specific vulnerability)
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Dependency Management:** Keep Dash and all its dependencies (including those of custom components) up-to-date. Regularly check for security updates.
    *   **Dependency Scanning:** Use Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to identify known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Secure Custom Component Development:** Follow secure coding practices when creating custom Dash components (JavaScript/React). Focus on input validation and output encoding.
    *   **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews of custom components, with a security focus.
    *   **Security Testing:** Perform security testing (penetration testing, fuzzing) on custom components.

## Attack Surface: [3. Dash Dev Tools Exposure](./attack_surfaces/3__dash_dev_tools_exposure.md)

*Description:* Leaving the Dash Dev Tools enabled in a production environment exposes internal application details and provides attackers with valuable information.
*How Dash Contributes:* The Dev Tools are a built-in feature of Dash, designed for debugging, but they are a significant security risk if exposed in production.
*Example:* An attacker accesses the `/ _dash-layout` and `/_dash-dependencies` endpoints exposed by the Dev Tools to understand the application's structure and callback graph.
*Impact:*
    *   Information disclosure (application structure, callback logic, component IDs).
    *   Facilitates other attacks (e.g., callback manipulation).
*Risk Severity:* **Critical**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Disable in Production:** *Always* disable the Dash Dev Tools in production by setting `debug=False` in `app.run_server()`. This is absolutely essential.
    *   **Restrict Access (if needed):** If Dev Tools are required in a non-production environment, restrict access using network-level controls or authentication.

## Attack Surface: [4. Denial of Service (DoS) via Callbacks](./attack_surfaces/4__denial_of_service__dos__via_callbacks.md)

*Description:* Attackers repeatedly trigger computationally expensive callbacks to exhaust server resources (CPU, memory, database connections).
*How Dash Contributes:* Dash's callback mechanism, if not properly protected, can be abused to trigger resource-intensive operations repeatedly. This is a direct consequence of how Dash applications function.
*Example:* An attacker repeatedly sends requests that trigger a callback performing a complex database query or intensive data processing.
*Impact:*
    *   Application unavailability.
    *   Server crashes.
    *   Degraded performance for legitimate users.
*Risk Severity:* **High**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on callbacks.
    *   **Asynchronous Callbacks:** Use asynchronous callbacks (e.g., with Celery) for long-running tasks.
    *   **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor server resource usage.
    *   **Input Validation (again):** Strict input validation can prevent excessively large or complex inputs.
    *   **Caching:** Implement caching for frequently accessed data or computationally expensive operations.
