## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Callback Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_callback_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **1.1 Input Validation Bypass in Callbacks [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** Attackers exploit insufficient input validation in Dash callbacks to inject malicious data.
    *   **1.1.1 Craft Malicious Input to Trigger Unexpected Behavior [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:**  The attacker crafts specific input that, due to a lack of validation or sanitization on the server-side, causes the callback function to execute in an unintended way. This could lead to data leakage, modification of application state, or even arbitrary code execution.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High (Data exfiltration, arbitrary code execution)
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Medium
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **1.1.2 Bypass Client-Side Validation (if relied upon solely) [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **Description:**  The application relies only on client-side JavaScript for input validation.  Attackers can easily bypass this using browser developer tools or by sending modified requests directly to the server.
        *   **Likelihood:** High
        *   **Impact:** High (Same as 1.1.1)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Low
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low (If server-side validation is missing, easily detectable)

*   **1.2 Callback Injection**
    *   **Description:** Attackers attempt to manipulate the callback mechanism itself.
    *   **1.2.1 Manipulate Callback IDs or Structure [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker tries to alter the way callbacks are identified or structured, potentially causing the application to execute arbitrary code or redirect execution flow. This is difficult in Dash but could be possible through complex exploits.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** High (Arbitrary code execution, complete control)
        *   **Effort:** High
        *   **Skill Level:** High
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** High
    *   **1.2.2 Exploit Vulnerabilities in `dash.callback_context` [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:**  If a vulnerability exists in how Dash handles the `callback_context`, an attacker might be able to manipulate it to gain control over callback execution. This would require a specific, likely undiscovered, vulnerability.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** High (Potentially control over callback execution)
        *   **Effort:** Very High
        *   **Skill Level:** Very High
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very High

*   **1.3 State Manipulation**
    *   **Description:** Attackers target the application's state.
    *   **1.3.1 Modify `dcc.Store` Data Directly (if improperly secured) [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:**  If `dcc.Store` is used to store sensitive data without proper access controls or encryption, an attacker could directly modify its contents, leading to data corruption, misinformation, or the ability to influence subsequent callback behavior.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium-High (Data manipulation, potentially leading to further attacks)
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Medium
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

*   **1.4 Denial of Service (DoS) via Callbacks**
    *   **Description:** Attackers overload the application using callbacks.
    *   **1.4.1 Trigger Resource-Intensive Callbacks Repeatedly [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **Description:**  The attacker repeatedly sends requests that trigger computationally expensive callbacks, consuming server resources and making the application unresponsive to legitimate users.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium (Application unavailability)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Low
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Component Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_component_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **2.1 Vulnerable Third-Party Components (e.g., Plotly.js, React) [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** Attackers leverage known vulnerabilities in the libraries Dash depends on.
    *   **2.1.1 Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Underlying Libraries [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:**  The attacker exploits a publicly known vulnerability in a component like Plotly.js or React.  This could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), data exfiltration, or even Remote Code Execution (RCE) in some cases.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High (XSS, data exfiltration, potentially RCE)
        *   **Effort:** Low-Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Low-Medium
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

*   **2.3 Custom Component Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities within custom-built Dash components.
    *   **2.3.1 Introduce XSS or Other Vulnerabilities in Custom Components [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** If developers create custom components without proper security considerations, they might introduce vulnerabilities like XSS, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts into the application.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High (XSS, data exfiltration, potentially RCE)
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Medium
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Server-Side Vulnerabilities (Related to Dash Deployment)](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_server-side_vulnerabilities__related_to_dash_deployment_.md)

*   **3.1 Weak Authentication/Authorization to Dash App [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** Attackers bypass or circumvent authentication.
    *   **3.1.1 Bypass Authentication Mechanisms [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:**  The attacker finds a way to access the Dash application without providing valid credentials, potentially due to weak passwords, flawed authentication logic, or misconfigured access controls.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High (Unauthorized access to the application)
        *   **Effort:** Low-High
        *   **Skill Level:** Low-High
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

*   **3.2 Insecure Configuration of Underlying Web Server (Flask, etc.) [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** Attackers exploit misconfigurations in the web server.
    *   **3.2.1 Exploit Misconfigurations (e.g., exposed debug mode) [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:**  The attacker takes advantage of misconfigurations in the web server (e.g., Flask running in debug mode in production, exposed server files, default credentials). This can lead to information disclosure or even RCE.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** High (Information disclosure, potentially RCE)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Low
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low

    *   **3.3.1 Exploit known vulnerabilities in Flask, Werkzeug, or other dependencies [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker exploits a known vulnerability in a server-side library like Flask or Werkzeug. This could lead to RCE, data exfiltration, or other severe consequences.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High (RCE, data exfiltration)
        *   **Effort:** Low-Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Low-Medium
