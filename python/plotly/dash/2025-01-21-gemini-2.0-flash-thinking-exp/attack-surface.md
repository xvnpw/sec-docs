# Attack Surface Analysis for plotly/dash

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Unsanitized Component Properties](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_unsanitized_component_properties.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
    *   **How Dash Contributes:** Dash components render content based on properties. If user-provided data is directly used in component properties without sanitization, it can lead to XSS.
    *   **Example:** A Dash application displays user-submitted text in a `dcc.Markdown` component. An attacker submits text containing `<script>alert("XSS");</script>`. When another user views this, the script executes in their browser.
    *   **Impact:** Session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, data theft, defacement of the application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Sanitize User Inputs:**  Use libraries like `bleach` in Python to sanitize user-provided data before passing it to component properties.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP header to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of injected scripts.
        *   **Avoid Direct HTML Rendering:**  Prefer using Dash components that handle rendering safely rather than directly injecting HTML.

## Attack Surface: [Callback Input Data Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/callback_input_data_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers modify the data sent from the client to the server in callback requests to trigger unintended behavior.
    *   **How Dash Contributes:** Dash relies on callbacks to handle user interactions. The data sent in these callbacks can be intercepted and modified before reaching the server.
    *   **Example:** A callback updates a database based on a user-selected ID. An attacker intercepts the request and changes the ID to access or modify data they shouldn't.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data modification, privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Server-Side Validation:** Always validate and sanitize data received in callbacks on the server-side. Do not rely solely on client-side validation.
        *   **Use Secure Data Transfer:**  Ensure communication between the client and server is over HTTPS to prevent eavesdropping and tampering.
        *   **Implement Authorization Checks:** Verify that the user has the necessary permissions to perform the action requested in the callback.
        *   **Stateless Callbacks (where applicable):** Design callbacks to be as stateless as possible, reducing the reliance on client-provided state.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Callbacks](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__in_callbacks.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers induce the server to make requests to unintended internal or external resources.
    *   **How Dash Contributes:** If callbacks make external requests based on user-provided input without proper validation, it can lead to SSRF.
    *   **Example:** A callback takes a URL as input to fetch data. An attacker provides an internal IP address (e.g., `http://localhost:6379`) to access internal services.
    *   **Impact:** Access to internal resources, information disclosure, potential for further attacks on internal systems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Strictly validate and sanitize URLs provided by users. Use allowlists of permitted domains or protocols.
        *   **Avoid User-Controlled URLs:** If possible, avoid allowing users to directly specify URLs for server-side requests.
        *   **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate the Dash application server from sensitive internal networks.
        *   **Use a Proxy Server:** Route outgoing requests through a proxy server that can enforce security policies.

## Attack Surface: [Code Injection through Unsanitized Callback Inputs](./attack_surfaces/code_injection_through_unsanitized_callback_inputs.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code that is executed on the server.
    *   **How Dash Contributes:** If callback logic directly executes user-provided input (e.g., using `eval()` or similar constructs), it creates a code injection vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** A callback dynamically constructs and executes a Python command based on user input. An attacker injects malicious code into the input.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the server, data breach, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never Use `eval()` or Similar Constructs on User Input:**  Avoid dynamically executing code based on user-provided data.
        *   **Use Parameterized Queries:** When interacting with databases, use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
        *   **Use Safe Libraries and Functions:**  Utilize libraries and functions designed to handle user input safely.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Deserialization](./attack_surfaces/insecure_deserialization.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the deserialization process to execute arbitrary code.
    *   **How Dash Contributes:** If Dash applications serialize and deserialize complex data structures (e.g., using `dcc.Store` with insecure serialization libraries or custom implementations), it can create a vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** A Dash application uses `pickle` to store session data in `dcc.Store`. An attacker crafts a malicious pickled object that executes code upon deserialization.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, complete server compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid Insecure Serialization Libraries:**  Do not use libraries like `pickle` for untrusted data. Prefer safer alternatives like `json`.
        *   **Sign and Encrypt Serialized Data:**  If serialization is necessary, sign and encrypt the data to prevent tampering and ensure integrity.
        *   **Validate Deserialized Data:**  Thoroughly validate data after deserialization before using it.

## Attack Surface: [Insufficient Rate Limiting on Authentication Endpoints](./attack_surfaces/insufficient_rate_limiting_on_authentication_endpoints.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can attempt brute-force attacks on login forms due to the lack of rate limiting.
    *   **How Dash Contributes:** If the Dash application implements its own authentication without proper rate limiting, it's vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
    *   **Example:** An attacker repeatedly tries different password combinations on the login form.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Implement Rate Limiting:**  Limit the number of login attempts from a single IP address or user account within a specific time frame.
        *   **Account Lockout:**  Temporarily lock user accounts after a certain number of failed login attempts.
        *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Implement MFA to add an extra layer of security to the login process.
