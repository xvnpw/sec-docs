# Threat Model Analysis for plotly/dash

## Threat: [Malicious Callback Input Injection](./threats/malicious_callback_input_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input data sent to a Dash callback function. This could involve sending unexpected data types, excessively long strings, or data containing special characters or code. The attacker aims to cause errors, unexpected behavior, or potentially trigger server-side vulnerabilities if input validation within the **`callback` function** is insufficient.
    *   **Impact:** Application crashes, unexpected behavior, potential for server-side code execution if input is not properly sanitized and handled within the **callback logic**. Data corruption or manipulation if the callback interacts with a database or external system.
    *   **Affected Dash Component:** `callback` decorator, input arguments of callback functions (e.g., `Input`, `State`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation within callback functions.
        *   Use type checking to ensure inputs are of the expected data type.
        *   Sanitize input data to remove or escape potentially harmful characters.
        *   Use regular expressions to validate input formats.
        *   Avoid directly executing user-provided input as code within **callback functions**.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Unsanitized Component Properties](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_unsanitized_component_properties.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious scripts into user-provided data that is then rendered directly into Dash component properties without proper sanitization. When other users view the application, these scripts execute in their browsers, potentially stealing cookies, redirecting them to malicious sites, or performing other actions on their behalf. This directly involves how Dash renders content based on property values.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise, data theft, defacement of the application, spreading malware.
    *   **Affected Dash Component:** Any component that renders user-provided data in its properties (e.g., `dcc.Markdown`, `html.Div` with `children` containing user input). The rendering mechanism of Dash components is the direct attack vector.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always sanitize user-provided data before rendering it into component properties.
        *   Use Dash's built-in sanitization features or dedicated libraries for sanitizing HTML content.
        *   Be particularly cautious with properties that accept HTML strings within Dash components.
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to mitigate XSS attacks in the context of the Dash application.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure through Data Visualization](./threats/information_disclosure_through_data_visualization.md)

*   **Description:** Improperly designed or configured visualizations, generated using Dash components like `dcc.Graph`, might inadvertently reveal sensitive information to unauthorized users. This stems from how data is processed and presented through Dash's visualization capabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive personal information, financial data, or confidential business information. Violation of privacy regulations.
    *   **Affected Dash Component:** Components used for data visualization (e.g., `dcc.Graph`). The underlying data processing logic within **Dash callbacks** that feeds data to these components.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully consider the level of detail presented in visualizations generated by Dash.
        *   Implement data masking or aggregation techniques before passing data to Dash visualization components.
        *   Enforce access controls on visualizations based on user roles and permissions within the Dash application.
        *   Avoid displaying raw, unredacted sensitive data directly in visualizations rendered by Dash.

## Threat: [Server-Side Data Processing Vulnerabilities Affecting Visualizations](./threats/server-side_data_processing_vulnerabilities_affecting_visualizations.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the Python code within **Dash callbacks** that processes data for visualization could be exploited. This could include issues that, while not strictly Dash vulnerabilities, directly impact how data is handled *within* the Dash application's logic to generate visualizations.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data, data manipulation or deletion, potential for server-side code execution within the Dash application's backend.
    *   **Affected Dash Component:** `callback` decorator, any code within callbacks that interacts with databases or external data sources to prepare data for Dash visualization components.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow secure coding practices for Python development within Dash callbacks.
        *   Use parameterized queries or ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) to prevent SQL injection in data processing within Dash applications.
        *   Regularly update dependencies and libraries used within the Dash application's backend to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement robust error handling and input validation in data processing logic within Dash callbacks.
