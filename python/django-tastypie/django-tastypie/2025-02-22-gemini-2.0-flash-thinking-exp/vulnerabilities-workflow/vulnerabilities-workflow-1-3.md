## Vulnerability List for django-tastypie Project

Based on the provided project files, no high or critical vulnerabilities were identified that meet the specified criteria. After thorough analysis of the code related to resource handling, request processing, authentication, authorization, serialization, throttling, and exception handling, no exploitable vulnerabilities introduced by the project itself, exploitable by an external attacker, and ranked as high or critical were found.

The newly added files, including tests for GIS functionalities, slashless URLs, custom users, related resources, profiling, authorization, namespaced APIs, basic functionalities, and content GFK, primarily focus on testing the framework's features and do not introduce new code that would expose high or critical vulnerabilities within the tastypie library itself.

The code continues to exhibit good practices in terms of input sanitization for error messages, JSONP callback validation, and content type handling. Throttling mechanisms are in place, and exception handling appears to be reasonably secure. The examples provided in the tests demonstrate how to use Tastypie's features in various scenarios, but do not reveal any inherent flaws in the framework that could be exploited to achieve high or critical impact vulnerabilities.

It's important to note that this analysis is based on the provided files, which are primarily test cases and examples. While these files are helpful in understanding the framework and its intended usage, they may not cover all aspects of the library's codebase. However, based on the files analyzed and previous assessments, the project continues to appear to be developed with security considerations in mind, utilizing libraries and techniques to mitigate common web security risks.

**No vulnerabilities found in this batch of files.**
