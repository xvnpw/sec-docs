## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Known TensorFlow Vulnerability (CVE)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_known_tensorflow_vulnerability__cve_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This path involves attackers leveraging publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) present in the TensorFlow library.
*   **Steps:**
    *   **Identify Applicable CVE:** Attackers research and identify CVEs that affect the specific version of TensorFlow used by the application. Public databases and security advisories are common sources.
    *   **Develop or Obtain Exploit:** Once a suitable CVE is found, attackers either develop their own exploit code or obtain pre-existing exploits from public resources or underground forums.
    *   **Execute Exploit:** The exploit code is then executed against the application, targeting the vulnerable TensorFlow component. Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution within the application's context.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Supply Chain Attacks on TensorFlow Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_supply_chain_attacks_on_tensorflow_dependencies.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This path focuses on compromising the dependencies that TensorFlow relies on, or the TensorFlow installation itself, to inject malicious code.
*   **Steps:**
    *   **Identify Vulnerable Dependency (Critical Node):** Attackers identify vulnerabilities in one of TensorFlow's many dependencies. This can be done through vulnerability scanning tools or by analyzing the dependency's source code.
    *   **Inject Malicious Code into Dependency:** Once a vulnerability is found, attackers attempt to inject malicious code into the vulnerable dependency. This could involve compromising the dependency's repository, build process, or by creating a malicious package with a similar name (typosquatting).
    *   **Application Uses Compromised Dependency:** If the malicious dependency is successfully installed and used by the application, the injected code will execute within the application's context.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Adversarial Attacks (Input Manipulation)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_adversarial_attacks__input_manipulation_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This path exploits the inherent weaknesses of machine learning models by crafting specific malicious inputs (adversarial examples) that cause the model to produce incorrect or manipulated outputs.
*   **Steps:**
    *   **Craft Adversarial Input:** Attackers utilize their understanding of the model's architecture and training data to craft inputs that are subtly modified to cause misclassification or other desired malicious behavior.
    *   **Feed Adversarial Input to Model:** The crafted adversarial input is then fed to the TensorFlow model within the application.
    *   **Model Produces Incorrect/Malicious Output:** The model, tricked by the adversarial input, produces an incorrect or manipulated output.
    *   **Application Acts Based on Malicious Output:** The application, relying on the model's output, performs actions based on the incorrect or malicious information, leading to compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploiting Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Saved Models](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploiting_deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_saved_models.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This path involves crafting a malicious TensorFlow model that, when loaded by the application, triggers a deserialization vulnerability leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Steps:**
    *   **Embed Malicious Code within the Saved Model Structure:** Attackers with knowledge of TensorFlow's model serialization format embed malicious code within the structure of a saved model.
    *   **Application Loads Malicious Model:** The application, without proper validation or from an untrusted source, loads the crafted malicious model.
    *   **Trigger Deserialization Process (Critical Node):** The process of loading the saved model triggers the deserialization of its components. If the deserialization process is vulnerable, the embedded malicious code is executed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Identify Applicable CVE](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_identify_applicable_cve.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This is the initial and crucial step for attackers aiming to exploit known vulnerabilities. Easy identification of relevant CVEs significantly increases the likelihood of successful exploitation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Identify Vulnerable Dependency](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_identify_vulnerable_dependency.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This is the starting point for supply chain attacks. Successfully identifying a vulnerable dependency is a prerequisite for injecting malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Access and Modify Training Data](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_access_and_modify_training_data.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Gaining access to the training data allows attackers to poison it, subtly influencing the model's behavior after retraining.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Gain Access to Stored Model](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_gain_access_to_stored_model.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Access to the stored trained model enables attackers to directly manipulate its parameters, introducing backdoors or biases.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Identify Potentially Dangerous TensorFlow Operations (e.g., those interacting with the file system or external resources without proper sanitization)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_identify_potentially_dangerous_tensorflow_operations__e_g___those_interacting_with_the_0b80a484.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Recognizing and targeting the use of unsafe TensorFlow operations allows attackers to supply malicious input that triggers unintended actions, such as file system access or remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Trigger Deserialization Process](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_trigger_deserialization_process.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This is the point of execution for malicious code embedded within a saved model. Preventing the deserialization of untrusted models is key to mitigating this risk.
