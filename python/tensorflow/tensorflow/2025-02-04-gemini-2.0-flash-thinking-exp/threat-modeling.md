# Threat Model Analysis for tensorflow/tensorflow

## Threat: [Model Poisoning / Data Poisoning](./threats/model_poisoning__data_poisoning.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Attacker aims to corrupt the training data used for TensorFlow models.
    *   They might compromise data pipelines to inject malicious data, subtly modify existing data, or manipulate data sources before they reach the TensorFlow training process.
    *   The goal is to make the TensorFlow model learn biased or incorrect patterns, affecting its future predictions.
*   **Impact:**
    *   TensorFlow model produces inaccurate or biased predictions.
    *   Degraded model performance and reliability.
    *   Potential for incorrect decisions based on TensorFlow model outputs, leading to real-world consequences.
    *   Reputational damage and loss of user trust in the application and the TensorFlow model.
*   **TensorFlow Component Affected:**
    *   Training Pipeline (Data ingestion, preprocessing stages used with TensorFlow)
    *   TensorFlow Data APIs (e.g., `tf.data` used for training data handling)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization specifically for training data used with TensorFlow.
    *   Establish data integrity checks and monitoring throughout the data pipeline feeding TensorFlow training.

## Threat: [Adversarial Attacks / Evasion Attacks](./threats/adversarial_attacks__evasion_attacks.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Attacker crafts adversarial examples - subtly modified input data designed to fool a trained TensorFlow model during inference.
    *   They manipulate input features in ways that are often imperceptible to humans but cause the TensorFlow model to misclassify or produce incorrect outputs.
    *   This is done by directly manipulating input data sent to the TensorFlow model's inference API.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Circumvention of intended TensorFlow model functionality.
    *   Incorrect decisions based on TensorFlow model output, potentially leading to security breaches or financial losses.

*   **TensorFlow Component Affected:**
    *   Inference Pipeline (Model input processing, prediction stage using TensorFlow)
    *   TensorFlow Model (Specifically the model's architecture and weights within TensorFlow)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement adversarial training techniques within TensorFlow to make models more robust against these attacks.
    *   Use input validation and sanitization to detect and reject potentially adversarial inputs before feeding them to the TensorFlow model.
    *   Employ input preprocessing techniques within TensorFlow to reduce the effectiveness of adversarial perturbations.
    *   Monitor TensorFlow model predictions for anomalies and unexpected outputs.
    *   Consider using ensemble methods or defensive distillation in TensorFlow to improve robustness.
    *   Implement rate limiting on inference requests to mitigate large-scale adversarial attacks targeting the TensorFlow model.

    *   Attackers exploit known or zero-day vulnerabilities directly within the TensorFlow code.
    *   Exploitation could occur through crafted inputs processed by TensorFlow functions or by directly targeting vulnerable TensorFlow components.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote code execution on the server running TensorFlow.
    *   System compromise and unauthorized access due to vulnerabilities in TensorFlow.
    *   Data breaches and data manipulation through exploiting TensorFlow vulnerabilities.

    *   Keep the TensorFlow library updated to the latest stable version with security patches.
    *   Subscribe to TensorFlow security mailing lists and advisories to stay informed about vulnerabilities.
    *   Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities that might affect TensorFlow.
    *   Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent exploitation through crafted inputs processed by TensorFlow.
    *   Run TensorFlow in sandboxed environments or containers to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities in TensorFlow.

    *   TensorFlow relies on third-party libraries (e.g., protobuf, numpy, absl-py) that may have their own security vulnerabilities.
    *   Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in these dependencies that are essential for TensorFlow to function.
    *   Exploitation can occur indirectly through TensorFlow's use of these vulnerable libraries.
*   **Impact:**
    *   System compromise, similar to vulnerabilities in TensorFlow itself, due to issues in its dependencies.
    *   Data breaches, denial of service, and application instability stemming from vulnerable TensorFlow dependencies.
*   **TensorFlow Component Affected:**
    *   TensorFlow Dependencies (e.g., protobuf, numpy, absl-py, etc. used by TensorFlow)
    *   TensorFlow build and runtime environment, relying on these dependencies.
