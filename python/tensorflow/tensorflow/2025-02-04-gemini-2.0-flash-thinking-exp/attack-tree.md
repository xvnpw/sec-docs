## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Malicious Model Injection](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_malicious_model_injection.md)

* **Critical Node: Attack Goal: Compromise TensorFlow Application**
    * **Attack Vector:** This is the overarching goal. The attacker aims to compromise the application using TensorFlow vulnerabilities.
    * **Potential Impact:** Full control over the application, data breaches, denial of service, manipulation of application functionality.

* **Critical Node: Exploit Model Vulnerabilities**
    * **Attack Vector:** The attacker targets weaknesses related to the TensorFlow model itself, rather than the library code or input handling.
    * **Potential Impact:**  Model manipulation, arbitrary code execution (through model loading), data breaches, application malfunction.

* **Critical Node: Malicious Model Injection**
    * **Attack Vector:** The attacker replaces the legitimate TensorFlow model used by the application with a crafted, malicious model.
    * **Potential Impact:**  When the application loads and uses the malicious model, the attacker can control its behavior. This can lead to arbitrary code execution within the application context, data exfiltration, or manipulation of application logic based on the model's output.

* **Critical Node: Compromise Model Source (e.g., Model Repository, Training Pipeline)**
    * **Attack Vector:**  To inject a malicious model, the attacker needs to compromise the source from where the application retrieves its models. This could be:
        * **Supply Chain Attack on Model Repository:** If the application downloads models from a repository (public or private), the attacker compromises the repository to replace legitimate models with malicious ones.
        * **Compromise Training Data/Environment:** If the application trains or fine-tunes models, the attacker compromises the training data or the training environment. By injecting malicious data or manipulating the training process, they can embed malicious code or backdoors into the trained model itself.
    * **Potential Impact:** Successful compromise of the model source allows for the injection of malicious models, leading to the impacts described above for "Malicious Model Injection".

* **Critical Node: Application Loads and Uses Malicious Model**
    * **Attack Vector:**  This is the final step in the Malicious Model Injection path. If the attacker has successfully compromised the model source and bypassed any integrity checks, the application will load and use the malicious model.
    * **Potential Impact:** Once the malicious model is loaded and used, the attacker can achieve their objectives, such as arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, or manipulating application behavior through the model's inference process. The impact is critical as the application is now operating under the attacker's control via the malicious model.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Model Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_model_deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Critical Node: Exploit Model Vulnerabilities** (Already described above)

* **Critical Node: Model Deserialization Vulnerabilities**
    * **Attack Vector:** TensorFlow model loading mechanisms (like `tf.saved_model.load` or `tf.keras.models.load_model`) might contain vulnerabilities that can be exploited during the process of deserializing a model file. A specially crafted malicious model file can trigger these vulnerabilities.
    * **Potential Impact:** Successful exploitation of deserialization vulnerabilities can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server hosting the application. This is because the model loading process, if vulnerable, can be tricked into executing attacker-controlled code when parsing a malicious model file.

* **Critical Node: Identify Vulnerable Model Loading Mechanism (e.g., `tf.saved_model.load`, `tf.keras.models.load_model`)**
    * **Attack Vector:** The attacker first needs to identify *how* the application loads TensorFlow models. This involves analyzing the application code to pinpoint the specific TensorFlow functions used for model loading. Common examples are `tf.saved_model.load` and `tf.keras.models.load_model`.
    * **Potential Impact:**  Identifying the loading mechanism is a prerequisite for crafting a targeted attack. It allows the attacker to focus their vulnerability research and exploit development efforts on the specific loading functions used by the application.

* **Critical Node: Craft Malicious Model to Exploit Deserialization Flaw (e.g., arbitrary code execution during loading)**
    * **Attack Vector:** Once a potentially vulnerable model loading mechanism is identified (or a known CVE exists), the attacker crafts a malicious TensorFlow model file. This model file is designed to exploit a deserialization flaw in the loading process. The malicious payload (e.g., code for arbitrary command execution) is embedded within the model file's structure or metadata in a way that triggers the vulnerability when the application attempts to load it.
    * **Potential Impact:** When the application loads this crafted malicious model, the deserialization vulnerability is triggered, leading to arbitrary code execution. This allows the attacker to gain complete control over the server, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, and denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit TensorFlow Library Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_tensorflow_library_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Critical Node: Attack Goal: Compromise TensorFlow Application** (Already described above)

* **Critical Node: Exploit TensorFlow Library Vulnerabilities**
    * **Attack Vector:** The attacker directly targets vulnerabilities within the TensorFlow library itself. This is distinct from model vulnerabilities or input handling issues.
    * **Potential Impact:** Exploiting TensorFlow library vulnerabilities can lead to a wide range of severe consequences, including arbitrary code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, and other forms of system compromise, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.

* **Critical Node: Known TensorFlow CVE Exploitation**
    * **Attack Vector:** TensorFlow, like any complex software, may have known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs). Attackers can exploit these known vulnerabilities if the application uses a vulnerable version of TensorFlow.
    * **Potential Impact:** Exploiting known CVEs can lead to critical impacts, often including arbitrary code execution, system compromise, and denial of service. The specific impact depends on the nature of the CVE being exploited.

* **Critical Node: Exploit Publicly Available Exploit Code or Develop Custom Exploit**
    * **Attack Vector:** To exploit a known CVE, the attacker needs to:
        * **Exploit Publicly Available Exploit Code:** If a CVE is publicly known and exploit code is readily available (e.g., on exploit databases or security research websites), the attacker can use this existing exploit code to attack the application. This significantly lowers the effort and skill required.
        * **Develop Custom Exploit:** If no public exploit is available, the attacker may need to develop a custom exploit based on the CVE details and vulnerability analysis. This requires more advanced skills and effort but is still feasible if the CVE is well-documented.
    * **Potential Impact:** Successful exploitation of a CVE, whether using a public exploit or a custom one, can lead to critical impacts as described above for "Known TensorFlow CVE Exploitation".

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Critical Node: Exploit TensorFlow Library Vulnerabilities** (Already described above)

* **Critical Node: Dependency Vulnerabilities**
    * **Attack Vector:** TensorFlow relies on various third-party libraries (dependencies) such as protobuf, numpy, absl-py, etc. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be indirectly exploited through the TensorFlow application.
    * **Potential Impact:** Vulnerabilities in dependencies, when exploited through TensorFlow, can also lead to critical impacts, potentially including arbitrary code execution, system compromise, and denial of service. The exact impact depends on the specific dependency vulnerability and how TensorFlow utilizes the vulnerable dependency.

* **Critical Node: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Dependencies through TensorFlow Application**
    * **Attack Vector:** The attacker needs to identify vulnerabilities in TensorFlow's dependencies and then craft an attack that leverages TensorFlow's usage of the vulnerable dependency to trigger the vulnerability. This might involve sending specific input data to the application or triggering certain TensorFlow operations that interact with the vulnerable dependency in a malicious way. The attack is indirect, going through TensorFlow to reach the vulnerable dependency.
    * **Potential Impact:** Successful exploitation of dependency vulnerabilities through TensorFlow can lead to critical impacts, similar to exploiting TensorFlow CVEs directly. This can include arbitrary code execution, system compromise, and denial of service, depending on the nature of the dependency vulnerability and how it is exploited.
