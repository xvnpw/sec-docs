# Threat Model Analysis for tensorflow/tensorflow

## Threat: [Adversarial Example Input](./threats/adversarial_example_input.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a slightly modified input (e.g., an image with imperceptible noise) specifically designed to cause the TensorFlow model to misclassify it or produce an incorrect output. The attacker might use techniques like Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) or Projected Gradient Descent (PGD).
*   **Impact:** Incorrect model predictions, leading to system malfunction, incorrect decisions, or bypass of security mechanisms (e.g., a facial recognition system being fooled). Could also lead to reputational damage.
*   **TensorFlow Component Affected:** Primarily affects the model's inference process (`tf.keras.Model.predict`, `tf.function` decorated inference functions, or lower-level TensorFlow operations used for prediction). The model itself is the target.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the application's context).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Adversarial Training:** Include adversarially generated examples in the training data. Use TensorFlow's adversarial learning libraries (e.g., `tensorflow_privacy`, or external libraries like `cleverhans`, `foolbox`).
    *   **Input Gradient Regularization:** Add a penalty to the loss function that discourages large output changes for small input changes. Implement using TensorFlow's gradient tape (`tf.GradientTape`).
    *   **Defensive Distillation:** Train a second model to mimic the probabilities of the first.
    *   **Input Preprocessing:** Apply transformations like JPEG compression, blurring, or adding random noise. Use TensorFlow's image processing functions (`tf.image`).
    *   **Ensemble Methods:** Combine predictions from multiple models.
    *   **Certified Robustness Techniques:** Explore methods that provide provable guarantees (though computationally expensive).

## Threat: [Model Poisoning (Training Data Tampering)](./threats/model_poisoning__training_data_tampering_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the training data and subtly modifies it (e.g., adding mislabeled examples, injecting noise) to bias the model's behavior. The attacker's goal is to degrade performance on specific inputs or introduce backdoors.
*   **Impact:** Reduced model accuracy, biased predictions, discriminatory outcomes, or the creation of vulnerabilities that can be exploited later. Long-term damage to the system's trustworthiness.
*   **TensorFlow Component Affected:** The training pipeline, including data loading (`tf.data.Dataset`), preprocessing, and the model training loop (`model.fit` or custom training loops using `tf.GradientTape`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the application and the nature of the poisoning).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Data Provenance and Integrity:** Maintain a secure and verifiable record of the training data's origin and modifications. Use checksums or digital signatures.
    *   **Data Sanitization:** Implement rigorous data cleaning and validation. Use TensorFlow's data validation tools if applicable.
    *   **Outlier Detection:** Employ statistical methods to identify and remove anomalous data points.
    *   **Robust Training Algorithms:** Research and potentially use training algorithms that are inherently more resistant to data poisoning.
    *   **Regular Model Audits:** Periodically evaluate the model's performance on a held-out, clean test set.

## Threat: [Code Execution via Unsafe Model Loading (Deserialization)](./threats/code_execution_via_unsafe_model_loading__deserialization_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a malicious TensorFlow model file (e.g., a `SavedModel` or a pickled file) that, when loaded, executes arbitrary code on the system. This exploits vulnerabilities in the deserialization process.
*   **Impact:** Complete system compromise, data theft, installation of malware, denial of service.
*   **TensorFlow Component Affected:** Model loading functions: `tf.saved_model.load`, `tf.keras.models.load_model`, and potentially any custom loading code that uses unsafe deserialization (e.g., `pickle.load` without proper sandboxing).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Load Only from Trusted Sources:** Only load models from trusted and verified sources.
    *   **Use `tf.saved_model.load`:** Preferentially use `tf.saved_model.load` for loading TensorFlow SavedModels.
    *   **Avoid `pickle.load`:** Strongly avoid using `pickle.load` directly with untrusted model files. If necessary, use a secure alternative or a tightly controlled sandboxed environment.
    *   **Input Validation (File Validation):** Before loading, validate the model file's integrity (e.g., checksums) and structure.
    *   **Sandboxing:** Load and execute the model in a sandboxed environment with restricted privileges.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion (DoS) via Malicious Input](./threats/resource_exhaustion__dos__via_malicious_input.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends specially crafted input data that causes the TensorFlow model to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, GPU), leading to a denial-of-service condition. This might involve inputs that trigger very complex or long-running computations.
*   **Impact:** Service unavailability, performance degradation, potential financial losses due to downtime.
*   **TensorFlow Component Affected:** The model's inference process (`tf.keras.Model.predict`, `tf.function` decorated inference functions, or lower-level TensorFlow operations). Specific operations that are computationally expensive are more susceptible.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Size Limits:** Enforce strict limits on the dimensions and size of input tensors.
    *   **Resource Quotas:** Set resource limits (CPU, memory, GPU) for the TensorFlow process.
    *   **Timeouts:** Implement timeouts for model inference. Use TensorFlow's `tf.function` with a defined `input_signature`.
    *   **Input Validation:** Thoroughly validate input data types, ranges, and formats.

## Threat: [TensorFlow Library Vulnerabilities](./threats/tensorflow_library_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitable vulnerabilities within the TensorFlow library itself (e.g., in specific operations, in the graph execution engine, or in supporting libraries) could be used by an attacker to cause denial of service, information disclosure, or potentially even code execution.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, ranging from denial of service to complete system compromise.
*   **TensorFlow Component Affected:** Potentially any part of the TensorFlow library, including core operations (`tf.*`), Keras API (`tf.keras.*`), or lower-level components.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (High to Critical) depending on the specific vulnerability.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep TensorFlow Updated:** Regularly update to the latest stable version of TensorFlow. Subscribe to TensorFlow security announcements.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use vulnerability scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in your TensorFlow installation and its dependencies.
    *   **Use a Minimal TensorFlow Installation:** If possible, use a minimal installation that only includes the components you need.
