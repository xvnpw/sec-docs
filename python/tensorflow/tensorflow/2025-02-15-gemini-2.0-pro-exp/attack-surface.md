# Attack Surface Analysis for tensorflow/tensorflow

## Attack Surface: [Adversarial Examples](./attack_surfaces/adversarial_examples.md)

*   *Description:* Crafted inputs designed to fool a trained model into making incorrect predictions, often imperceptible to humans.
*   *TensorFlow Contribution:* TensorFlow provides the computational framework for building and deploying models that are susceptible. TensorFlow libraries (TF-Agents, Keras) are used to *create* the target models. TensorFlow also provides tools usable by both attackers and defenders to *create* adversarial examples.
*   *Example:* A slightly modified stop sign image classified as a speed limit sign by a self-driving car's vision system (built with TensorFlow).
*   *Impact:* Incorrect model predictions, leading to system malfunction, safety hazards, or incorrect decisions.
*   *Risk Severity:* **Critical** to **High** (application-dependent).
*   *Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Adversarial Training:** Train with adversarial examples.
    *   **Gradient Masking/Obfuscation:** Hinder gradient calculation for attacks.
    *   **Defensive Distillation:** Train a smaller, less susceptible model.
    *   **Certified Robustness Techniques:** Use methods with provable robustness guarantees.
    *   **Regular Robustness Evaluation:** Continuously test resilience using libraries like CleverHans, Foolbox, or ART.

## Attack Surface: [Model Poisoning/Data Poisoning](./attack_surfaces/model_poisoningdata_poisoning.md)

*   *Description:* Manipulating the training data to compromise model behavior during inference.
*   *TensorFlow Contribution:* TensorFlow is used to *train* the models, making the training process a target. Attackers influencing data fed into TensorFlow's training pipeline can poison the model.
*   *Example:* Injecting biased data into a loan application model's training set (used with TensorFlow) to cause unfair denials.
*   *Impact:* Biased/incorrect predictions, unfair outcomes, system malfunction, security vulnerabilities.
*   *Risk Severity:* **High** to **Critical** (application and poisoning dependent).
*   *Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Data Provenance and Integrity:** Strict controls over data collection/storage. Verify data source and integrity.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Use TFDV or other methods to detect unusual patterns in training data.
    *   **Robust Training Algorithms:** Employ algorithms less sensitive to outliers.
    *   **Federated Learning (with Caution):** Vet participants carefully; use robust aggregation methods.

## Attack Surface: [Model Inversion/Extraction](./attack_surfaces/model_inversionextraction.md)

*   *Description:* Attacks to reconstruct training data or the model from outputs or API access.
*   *TensorFlow Contribution:* TensorFlow models can inadvertently leak training data information through predictions. TensorFlow's APIs and model serialization formats are the access means.
*   *Example:* Repeatedly querying a TensorFlow-based facial recognition model to reconstruct training dataset faces.
*   *Impact:* Privacy violations, sensitive data exposure, intellectual property theft.
*   *Risk Severity:* **High**
*   *Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Differential Privacy:** Use TensorFlow Privacy for differential privacy guarantees.
    *   **API Rate Limiting:** Restrict queries to the model's API.
    *   **Access Control:** Implement strict access controls on the model and API.
    *   **Model Distillation:** Create a smaller, less revealing model.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization of Untrusted Models](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_of_untrusted_models.md)

*   *Description:* Loading a TensorFlow model from an untrusted source, leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   *TensorFlow Contribution:* TensorFlow's model loading mechanisms (`tf.saved_model.load`, `tf.keras.models.load_model`) are vulnerable. The serialized model format can contain malicious code.
*   *Example:* Downloading a pre-trained TensorFlow model from an untrusted site and loading it, executing embedded malicious code.
*   *Impact:* Complete system compromise, data theft, denial of service.
*   *Risk Severity:* **Critical**
*   *Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Never Load Untrusted Models:** Only load models from trusted, controlled, or vetted sources.
    *   **Model Verification:** Verify integrity with checksums (e.g., SHA-256) and digital signatures.
    *   **Sandboxing:** Load and execute models in a sandboxed environment.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   *Description:* Exploiting TensorFlow operations to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, GPU), causing DoS.
*   *TensorFlow Contribution:* TensorFlow's computational graph execution and tensor operations are targets. Large models and crafted inputs can trigger exhaustion.
*   *Example:* Sending a request with a huge input tensor to a TensorFlow Serving instance, causing it to crash.
*   *Impact:* Service unavailability, disruption of operations.
*   *Risk Severity:* **High**
*   *Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Resource Limits:** Set limits on CPU, memory, and GPU usage. Use `tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth` for GPU memory.
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate input tensor size/shape before processing. Reject large inputs.
    *   **Timeouts:** Implement timeouts for TensorFlow operations.
    *   **Asynchronous Operations:** Use asynchronous operations for better resource management.

## Attack Surface: [TensorFlow Library Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/tensorflow_library_vulnerabilities.md)

*   *Description:* Exploiting vulnerabilities within the TensorFlow library itself (e.g., buffer overflows).
*   *TensorFlow Contribution:* The vulnerability exists *within* the TensorFlow codebase.
*   *Example:* A crafted input to a TensorFlow operation triggers a buffer overflow, allowing code execution.
*   *Impact:* System compromise, data theft, denial of service.
*   *Risk Severity:* **Critical** to **High** (vulnerability-dependent).
*   *Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Keep TensorFlow Updated:** Regularly update to the latest stable version.
    *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about TensorFlow security advisories.
    *   **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools to scan the TensorFlow library.
    *   **Fuzzing:** Test TensorFlow operations with unexpected inputs.

## Attack Surface: [TensorFlow Serving API Abuse](./attack_surfaces/tensorflow_serving_api_abuse.md)

*    *Description:* If using TensorFlow Serving, attackers could send malformed requests, attempt to overload the server, or exploit vulnerabilities in the serving infrastructure.
*    *TensorFlow Contribution:* TensorFlow Serving provides the infrastructure for exposing models via an API, which becomes a direct attack vector.
*    *Example:* Sending a flood of requests to a TensorFlow Serving endpoint to cause a denial-of-service. Or, sending a specially crafted request that exploits a vulnerability in the serving infrastructure.
*    *Impact:* Service unavailability, data breaches, potential system compromise.
*    *Risk Severity:* **High**
*    *Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to the API.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Validate and sanitize all inputs received through the API.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Limit the number of requests a client can make within a given time period.
    *   **Monitoring:** Monitor API usage for suspicious activity.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep TensorFlow Serving updated to the latest version to patch vulnerabilities.
