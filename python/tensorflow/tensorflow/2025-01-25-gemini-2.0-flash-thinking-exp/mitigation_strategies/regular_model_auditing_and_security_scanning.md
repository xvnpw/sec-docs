The effectiveness depends on the sophistication of auditing processes, the tools used, and the team's expertise.  Manual audits and potentially adversarial robustness testing are crucial complements to static analysis.
*   **TensorFlow Library Vulnerabilities:** **High Reduction**. Regular scanning and patching are highly effective for known library vulnerabilities.

#### 4.4. Currently Implemented vs. Missing Implementation:

*   **Currently Implemented:** Dependency vulnerability scanning and monitoring of TensorFlow security advisories are good starting points. This addresses the TensorFlow library vulnerabilities effectively.
*   **Missing Implementation:** The critical missing piece is **static analysis specifically for TensorFlow models** and **formalized regular security audits of models and related infrastructure**.  This is where the strategy needs significant strengthening to address model vulnerabilities comprehensively.

#### 4.5. Strengths of the Mitigation Strategy:
