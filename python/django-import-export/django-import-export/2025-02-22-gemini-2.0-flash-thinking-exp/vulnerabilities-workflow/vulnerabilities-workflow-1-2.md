- **Vulnerability Name:** Unprotected Data Export Endpoint  
  **Description:**  
  An export endpoint is defined (for example, at “/export/category/”) that relies on Django’s generic ListView along with additional export functionality. This endpoint does not enforce explicit authentication/authorization within the view logic itself. An external attacker who—for example, due to misconfiguration or accidental deployment of test URL patterns—can reach this endpoint may trigger the export of data without credentials.  
  **Impact:**  
  - Unauthorized disclosure of potentially sensitive internal data.  
  - Exposure of export‐able data that should otherwise be protected by access controls.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - In production deployments the export functionality is normally mounted behind the Django admin URL and is protected by authentication.  
  - The vulnerable export endpoints are defined only in auxiliary or test URL configurations rather than in the production URL patterns.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - There is no explicit access control decorator or permission mixin enforced at the view level beyond relying on deployment configuration.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The export endpoint (or similar data export functionality) becomes publicly accessible due to misconfiguration or accidental inclusion in production URL patterns.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In the testing URL configurations (e.g. `/code/tests/urls.py` in previous versions), routes such as `"export/category/"` mapped directly to export views that subclass generic ListView combined with an export mixin lack inline access control checks.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  - As an external attacker, send a GET (or crafted POST) request to an export endpoint (for example, `/export/category/`) on the deployed instance.  
  - Confirm that the response contains exported data (e.g. CSV content) without any authentication challenge, thereby verifying the lack of proper access control.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary File Access via Unsanitized Import File Name Parameter  
  **Description:**  
  The import process (handled via the admin import views) accepts a parameter (typically named `import_file_name`) that is used to build a temporary file path for reading an uploaded file. In earlier tests the parameter was used directly when constructing paths (e.g. with functions such as `os.path.join(tempfile.gettempdir(), self.name)`) without proper path‐validation. Although the production implementation now applies some sanitization, an attacker may still trigger unauthorized file access if misconfigurations or bypasses of form validation occur.  
  **Impact:**  
  - Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive files on the server, including configuration or password files.  
  - The potential for file modification or deletion if write operations are similarly affected.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - In the production configuration, the `ConfirmImportForm` (located in `/code/import_export/forms.py`) defines a `clean_import_file_name()` method that calls `os.path.basename()` on the provided filename. This removes any directory traversal components before the filename is passed to the temporary storage class in the import process.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - Additional strict validation (for example, whitelisting allowed filename patterns or extensions) is missing.  
  - There is no mechanism to disable or remove test endpoints (which may not apply the same sanitization) in production configurations.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The admin import endpoint is misconfigured (or inadvertently exposed to external access) and an attacker is able to bypass or subvert normal form validation.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In `/code/import_export/admin.py` the process_import view retrieves the file name using  
    ```python
    confirm_form.cleaned_data["import_file_name"]
    ```  
    and passes it to the temporary storage class when instantiating it.  
  - In `/code/import_export/forms.py`, the `ConfirmImportForm.clean_import_file_name()` method sanitizes the input by executing:  
    ```python
    def clean_import_file_name(self):
        data = self.cleaned_data["import_file_name"]
        data = os.path.basename(data)
        return data
    ```  
    This limits the file name to its base component; however, if an attacker is able to bypass the form’s validation (for example, by directly posting to the import endpoint), unsanitized file paths may still be injected.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  - Assuming a misconfigured instance in which the import endpoint is publicly accessible, an external attacker crafts and sends an HTTP POST request directly to the import processing endpoint with a parameter value such as:  
    ```
    import_file_name=../../../../etc/passwd
    ```  
  - Verify whether the system either automatically transforms the provided value (via the `os.path.basename()` call) to a safe filename (e.g. “passwd”) or – if bypassing occurs – returns file contents or an error that discloses system file locations.  
  - Confirm that additional restrictions (such as allowed filename patterns) are not present, indicating that further mitigation is needed.
