# Attack Surface Analysis for ultralytics/yolov5

## Attack Surface: [1. Malicious Image/Video Input](./attack_surfaces/1__malicious_imagevideo_input.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in underlying image/video processing libraries (used by YOLOv5) through crafted input files, leading to crashes or code execution.
*   **YOLOv5 Contribution:** YOLOv5 relies on libraries like OpenCV and PIL to decode and process image and video data *before* object detection. Vulnerabilities in these libraries are directly exposed through YOLOv5's input processing pipeline.
*   **Example:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted TIFF image to an application using YOLOv5. This image exploits a heap buffer overflow vulnerability in the TIFF decoding function of OpenCV, triggered during YOLOv5's preprocessing, leading to potential remote code execution on the server.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), Application Crash, Potential Data Breach.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Validate file types and sizes rigorously *before* passing them to YOLOv5. Only accept expected image/video formats.
    *   **Secure Image Processing Libraries:** Consider using hardened or sandboxed image processing libraries if possible.
    *   **Dependency Updates (Crucial):**  Immediately update OpenCV, PIL, and other image/video processing dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities. Regularly monitor security advisories for these libraries.
    *   **Resource Limits:** Implement resource limits (memory, CPU time) for the image/video processing stage to mitigate DoS attempts.

## Attack Surface: [2. Malicious Model Injection/Substitution](./attack_surfaces/2__malicious_model_injectionsubstitution.md)

*   **Description:** Replacing legitimate YOLOv5 model files with malicious ones to compromise the application's functionality or security.
*   **YOLOv5 Contribution:** YOLOv5 loads model weights from files (typically `.pt` files). If the application allows loading models from untrusted sources or lacks integrity checks, malicious models can be injected.
*   **Example:** An attacker with access to the server's filesystem replaces the legitimate `yolov5s.pt` model file with a modified version. This malicious model is designed to subtly alter detection results, causing the application to misclassify objects or leak sensitive information based on manipulated detections. In a more extreme scenario, a vulnerability in the model loading process itself (within PyTorch or related libraries used by YOLOv5) could be exploited by a crafted model file to achieve code execution.
*   **Impact:** Data Manipulation, Information Leakage, Denial of Service, Potential System Compromise (through model loading vulnerabilities).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Model Storage and Access Control:** Store YOLOv5 model files in secure, protected directories with restricted access permissions.
    *   **Model Integrity Verification:** Implement cryptographic integrity checks (e.g., using hashes or digital signatures) to verify the authenticity and integrity of loaded model files before YOLOv5 uses them.
    *   **Trusted Model Sources Only:**  Load YOLOv5 models only from trusted and verified sources. Avoid allowing users or external systems to specify arbitrary model paths.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the application with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact if a malicious model is somehow loaded.

## Attack Surface: [3. Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion during YOLOv5 Processing](./attack_surfaces/3__denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion_during_yolov5_processing.md)

*   **Description:**  Overloading the application by sending inputs that are excessively computationally expensive for YOLOv5 to process, leading to resource exhaustion and service disruption.
*   **YOLOv5 Contribution:** YOLOv5 object detection, especially with high-resolution inputs, complex models, or specific configurations, can be resource-intensive (CPU, GPU, memory).  Attackers can exploit this by sending inputs designed to maximize resource consumption.
*   **Example:** An attacker floods the application with requests to process extremely high-resolution 4K videos using a large YOLOv5 model. This rapidly exhausts the server's GPU and CPU resources, causing legitimate requests to be delayed or denied, effectively creating a Denial of Service.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), Application Unavailability, Performance Degradation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Size and Complexity Limits:** Enforce strict limits on input image/video resolution, duration, and file size. Reject requests exceeding these limits.
    *   **Rate Limiting and Throttling:** Implement rate limiting on API endpoints or input processing mechanisms to restrict the number of requests from a single source within a given timeframe.
    *   **Resource Monitoring and Auto-Scaling:** Continuously monitor server resource utilization (CPU, GPU, memory) and implement auto-scaling to dynamically adjust resources based on demand.
    *   **Asynchronous Processing and Queues:** Use asynchronous task queues to handle YOLOv5 processing in the background, preventing blocking of the main application thread and improving responsiveness under load.
    *   **Optimize YOLOv5 Configuration:**  Carefully choose YOLOv5 model size and inference parameters (e.g., image size, confidence threshold, NMS threshold) to balance accuracy and performance, avoiding unnecessary resource consumption.
