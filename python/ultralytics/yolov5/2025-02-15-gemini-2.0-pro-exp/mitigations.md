# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for ultralytics/yolov5

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Model Loading](./mitigation_strategies/secure_model_loading.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish a Trusted Model Repository:** Create a private, access-controlled repository (e.g., a private Git repository, an internal artifact server) to store approved YOLOv5 model files (`.pt`).
    2.  **Generate Hashes:** For each approved model, calculate a strong cryptographic hash (SHA-256 is recommended). Store these hashes securely, separate from the models themselves (e.g., in a database, a signed configuration file).
    3.  **Implement Hash Verification:** In the application code, *before* calling `torch.load()`, calculate the hash of the model file being loaded. Compare this calculated hash to the stored, trusted hash.  If the hashes *do not* match, *abort* the loading process and raise an exception/log an error.
    4.  **Restrict File System Access:** Ensure the application process has *read-only* access to the model directory.  It should *not* have write access to prevent accidental or malicious modification of the model files.
    5. **Implement Model Selection Validation:** If users can choose from a list of pre-approved models, ensure the application validates the user's selection against a whitelist of allowed model identifiers (e.g., model names or IDs). Do *not* allow users to provide arbitrary file paths.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Model Loading (Pickle/PyTorch Model Poisoning):**  Severity: *Critical*.  An attacker could execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Unauthorized Model Modification:** Severity: *High*. An attacker with file system access could replace a legitimate model with a malicious one.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Model Loading:** Risk reduced from *Critical* to *Low* (assuming proper implementation and no other vulnerabilities). The verification process prevents loading of tampered or unauthorized models.
    *   **Unauthorized Model Modification:** Risk reduced from *High* to *Low*. Read-only access prevents direct modification.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Hash verification implemented in `model_loader.py`.
    *   Read-only file system access configured for the application's Docker container.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Trusted Model Repository is currently a shared network drive; needs to be migrated to a proper artifact server with access controls.
    * Model selection validation is missing. The application currently accepts a file path from the user, which is a major security flaw. This needs to be changed to a selection from a predefined list with server-side validation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Adversarial Input Defense](./mitigation_strategies/adversarial_input_defense.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Input Preprocessing Pipeline:**
        *   **Random Resizing:** Before passing an image to the YOLOv5 model, randomly resize it within a small range (e.g., +/- 10% of the original dimensions).
        *   **Random Cropping:**  Randomly crop a small portion of the image.
        *   **JPEG Compression:** Apply JPEG compression with a quality factor that introduces a small amount of loss (e.g., quality=90).
        *   **Gaussian Blurring:** Apply a slight Gaussian blur with a small kernel size (e.g., 1x1 or 3x3).
    2.  **Adversarial Training (Long-Term):**
        *   Use a library like Foolbox to generate adversarial examples *specifically for the YOLOv5 model architecture*.
        *   Include these YOLOv5-specific adversarial examples in the training dataset, teaching the model to be more robust.
    3. **Monitoring:**
        * Implement logging of YOLOv5 inference confidence scores.
        * Track the distribution of confidence scores over time.
        * Set up alerts for significant deviations from the expected distribution, which could indicate an adversarial attack targeting YOLOv5.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Adversarial Input Attacks (Evasion Attacks):** Severity: *High*.  An attacker could bypass security measures by crafting inputs that fool the YOLOv5 model.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Adversarial Input Attacks:** Risk reduced from *High* to *Medium*.  Preprocessing makes it harder to craft successful adversarial examples, but it's not a perfect defense. Adversarial training further reduces the risk, but requires significant effort. Monitoring helps detect attacks in progress.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   JPEG compression is applied in `image_processing.py`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Random resizing and cropping are not implemented.
    *   Gaussian blurring is not implemented.
    *   Adversarial training *specifically for YOLOv5* is not implemented (requires a dedicated retraining effort).
    *   Monitoring of YOLOv5 confidence scores and anomaly detection is not implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Poisoning Prevention](./mitigation_strategies/data_poisoning_prevention.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Data Source Control:**  Only use training data from trusted sources (e.g., internally collected data, reputable datasets with clear provenance) for retraining YOLOv5.
    2.  **Data Integrity Checks:**  Before using any training data for YOLOv5, calculate cryptographic hashes of the data files (images, labels).  Store these hashes securely.  Periodically re-verify the hashes to detect any unauthorized modifications.
    3.  **Data Sanitization:**
        *   **Manual Review:**  Visually inspect a representative sample of the training data intended for YOLOv5 for mislabeled or suspicious images.
        *   **Outlier Detection:**  Use statistical methods (e.g., clustering, anomaly detection algorithms) to identify potential outliers in the YOLOv5 training dataset that might be poisoned samples.
    4. **Data Provenance:** Maintain detailed records of the origin of all training data used for YOLOv5, including any preprocessing or augmentation steps.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Poisoning Attacks (Training Data Manipulation):** Severity: *High*.  An attacker could significantly degrade YOLOv5's performance or introduce targeted vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Poisoning Attacks:** Risk reduced from *High* to *Medium*.  Data source control and integrity checks prevent the introduction of entirely malicious datasets.  Sanitization reduces the impact of subtle poisoning attempts.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic data integrity checks (file size verification) are in place.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Cryptographic hashing of YOLOv5 training data is not implemented.
    *   Comprehensive data sanitization (manual review, outlier detection) specific to the YOLOv5 training pipeline is not implemented.
    *   Detailed data provenance tracking for YOLOv5 training data is not implemented.
