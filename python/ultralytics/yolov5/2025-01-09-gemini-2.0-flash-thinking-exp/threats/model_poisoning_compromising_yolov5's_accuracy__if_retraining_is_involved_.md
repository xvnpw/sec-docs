  """
  Detects anomalous data points in training data features using Isolation Forest.

  Args:
    training_data_features: A numpy array where each row represents a data point
                             and each column represents a feature.

  Returns:
    A boolean array indicating whether each data point is an anomaly (True) or not (False).

  # Initialize and train the Isolation Forest model
  model = IsolationForest(contamination='auto', random_state=42) # Adjust contamination as needed

  # Predict anomalies
  anomaly_predictions = model.predict(training_data_features)

  # Convert predictions to boolean (1 for outlier, -1 for inlier)
  is_anomaly = anomaly_predictions == -1

  return is_anomaly

# Example usage (assuming you have extracted features from your training data)
# For image data, you might use techniques like:
# - Flattening pixel values
# - Extracting features using a pre-trained CNN (excluding the final classification layer)
# For annotation data, you might use:
# - Bounding box coordinates and sizes
# - Class label distributions

# Sample training data features (replace with your actual feature extraction)
# Let's assume each row represents an image and columns are some extracted features
sample_features = np.random.rand(100, 10)  # 100 data points, 10 features

anomalies = detect_anomalous_data(sample_features)
print("Anomalous data points:", np.where(anomalies)[0])

# Further actions based on detected anomalies:
# - Flag for human review
# - Exclude from training (with caution, as legitimate but rare data might be flagged)
# - Investigate the source of the anomaly
