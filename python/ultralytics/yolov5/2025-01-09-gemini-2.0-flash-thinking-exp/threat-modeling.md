# Threat Model Analysis for ultralytics/yolov5

## Threat: [Malicious Model Substitution](./threats/malicious_model_substitution.md)

**Description:** An attacker replaces the legitimate YOLOv5 model file (e.g., `yolov5s.pt`) with a compromised version. This could be done by exploiting vulnerabilities in the model storage location or during the model update process.

**Impact:** The application will use the malicious model, leading to incorrect object detection, potential misclassification, or even the execution of malicious code embedded within the model if vulnerabilities in the YOLOv5 model loading or inference process exist.

**Affected Component:** Model loading function within YOLOv5's `load` function in `models/common.py` or similar model loading utilities.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement cryptographic hash verification (e.g., SHA-256) of the model file before loading.
* Store the model file in a secure location with restricted access permissions.
* Use secure channels (HTTPS, SSH) for downloading or updating the model.
* Implement integrity checks during the model loading process.

## Threat: [Adversarial Input Manipulation](./threats/adversarial_input_manipulation.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts specific input images or videos (adversarial examples) designed to fool the YOLOv5 model. These inputs might cause misclassification, non-detection of objects, or detection of non-existent objects by exploiting the model's learned patterns.

**Impact:**  Leads to incorrect application behavior based on flawed detection results. This could have serious consequences in safety-critical applications or applications relying on accurate object recognition for decision-making.

**Affected Component:** The `forward` method in YOLOv5's detection models (`models/yolo.py`) and the input preprocessing steps implemented within YOLOv5's `utils/datasets.py`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement input sanitization and pre-processing techniques to normalize input data as expected by YOLOv5.
* Explore using adversarial training techniques to make the specific YOLOv5 model more robust against adversarial examples.
* Consider using multiple object detection algorithms or approaches for cross-validation.
* Implement anomaly detection on the input data to identify potentially malicious inputs before feeding them to YOLOv5.

## Threat: [Maliciously Crafted Input File Exploiting YOLOv5's Image Handling](./threats/maliciously_crafted_input_file_exploiting_yolov5's_image_handling.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted image or video file that exploits vulnerabilities specifically within how YOLOv5 handles image loading and preprocessing, potentially triggering issues in its internal logic or dependencies used in this process.

**Impact:** Can lead to denial of service or unexpected behavior within the YOLOv5 processing pipeline. While full remote code execution might be less direct through YOLOv5 itself, it could destabilize the application or expose other vulnerabilities.

**Affected Component:** Image and video loading and preprocessing functions within `utils/datasets.py` specifically within the context of how YOLOv5 utilizes these functionalities.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep the version of YOLOv5 and its specifically used image processing dependencies updated.
* Implement robust error handling within the input processing stages of YOLOv5 integration.
* Consider input validation specific to the expected image formats and properties used by YOLOv5.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Integrated Inference Engine Affecting YOLOv5](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_integrated_inference_engine_affecting_yolov5.md)

**Description:** YOLOv5 relies on underlying inference engines like PyTorch or ONNX Runtime. If there are vulnerabilities in how YOLOv5 integrates with or utilizes the specific features of these engines, an attacker could exploit them through crafted inputs processed by YOLOv5.

**Impact:**  Remote code execution or denial of service if vulnerabilities exist in the interaction between YOLOv5 and the inference engine.

**Affected Component:** The core inference logic within the chosen backend (PyTorch, ONNX Runtime) as directly called and utilized by YOLOv5 in its `forward` method.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep the inference engine (PyTorch or ONNX Runtime) used by YOLOv5 updated to the latest security patches.
* Follow security best practices recommended by the inference engine developers, especially regarding input handling and model loading, as they relate to YOLOv5's usage.

## Threat: [Model Poisoning Compromising YOLOv5's Accuracy (If Retraining is Involved)](./threats/model_poisoning_compromising_yolov5's_accuracy__if_retraining_is_involved_.md)

**Description:** If the application allows for retraining or fine-tuning of the YOLOv5 model, an attacker could inject malicious or biased data into the training process, specifically targeting the model's performance and accuracy within the YOLOv5 framework.

**Impact:** The retrained YOLOv5 model will be compromised, leading to biased or incorrect object detection results within the application. This could be used to manipulate the application's behavior or cause harm based on faulty detections.

**Affected Component:**  Model training scripts and data loading pipelines within the YOLOv5 repository or custom training scripts that utilize YOLOv5's training functionalities.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict input validation and sanitization for training data used to retrain the YOLOv5 model.
* Implement human review or automated anomaly detection for training data before using it to update the YOLOv5 model.
* Isolate the training environment from the production environment where the trained YOLOv5 model is deployed.
* Implement data provenance tracking for training data used with YOLOv5.
