# Attack Surface Analysis for ultralytics/yolov5

## Attack Surface: [Maliciously Crafted Input Images/Videos](./attack_surfaces/maliciously_crafted_input_imagesvideos.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers provide specially crafted image or video files designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the image processing libraries used by YOLOv5 (e.g., OpenCV, Pillow).
    *   **How YOLOv5 Contributes:** YOLOv5's core functionality involves processing image and video data, making it directly susceptible to vulnerabilities in its image processing pipeline. It relies on these libraries to decode and prepare the input for the model.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a PNG file with a specially crafted header that exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in the version of Pillow used by the application, leading to a crash or remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (application crash), potential Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the severity of the underlying vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation: Verify file formats, sizes, and potentially sanitize image metadata.
        *   Use the latest, patched versions of image processing libraries (OpenCV, Pillow, etc.). Implement automated dependency scanning and update processes.
        *   Consider sandboxing the image processing pipeline to limit the impact of potential exploits.
        *   Implement resource limits to prevent excessive memory or CPU usage during image processing.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised or Maliciously Trained Models](./attack_surfaces/compromised_or_maliciously_trained_models.md)

*   **Description:** If the application allows users to upload or select custom YOLOv5 models, attackers can provide models containing backdoors or designed to produce harmful outputs.
    *   **How YOLOv5 Contributes:** YOLOv5's architecture involves loading and executing model files. If the source or integrity of these models is not verified, malicious models can be used.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a seemingly normal YOLOv5 model that, when loaded, executes malicious code embedded within custom layers or exploits vulnerabilities in the model loading process of the underlying framework (PyTorch).
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (if the model contains malicious code), data manipulation, application malfunction due to incorrect predictions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict model sources to trusted locations.
        *   Implement model integrity checks (e.g., cryptographic signatures) to verify the authenticity and integrity of loaded models.
        *   Scan uploaded models for known malicious patterns or anomalies (though this can be challenging).
        *   Run model loading and inference in a sandboxed environment with limited privileges.
        *   If custom models are allowed, implement a review process before they are made available.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Underlying Framework Vulnerabilities (PyTorch/ONNX Runtime)](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_underlying_framework_vulnerabilities__pytorchonnx_runtime_.md)

*   **Description:**  YOLOv5 relies on underlying deep learning frameworks like PyTorch or ONNX Runtime. Vulnerabilities in these frameworks can be exploited during model loading or inference.
    *   **How YOLOv5 Contributes:**  YOLOv5's execution directly depends on these frameworks. Any vulnerability in the framework becomes a vulnerability in the application using YOLOv5.
    *   **Example:** A known vulnerability in a specific version of PyTorch allows an attacker to craft a specific input that triggers a buffer overflow during tensor manipulation, leading to a crash or RCE.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service, Remote Code Execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the severity of the framework vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the underlying deep learning framework (PyTorch, ONNX Runtime) updated to the latest stable versions with security patches.
        *   Subscribe to security advisories for the chosen framework to be aware of newly discovered vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider using containerization to isolate the application and its dependencies, limiting the impact of potential exploits.
