## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Application via YOLOv5 Exploitation [HIGH RISK START]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__compromise_application_via_yolov5_exploitation__high_risk_start_.md)

*   This is the root goal of the attacker and inherently represents the start of all high-risk paths. Success at this level means the attacker has achieved their objective of compromising the application through vulnerabilities in the YOLOv5 component.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Model Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_model_vulnerabilities.md)

*   This node is critical because compromising the model directly allows the attacker to manipulate the core behavior of the object detection system. This can have far-reaching consequences depending on how the application uses the detection results.

    *   **Inject Malicious Model Weights [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker replaces the legitimate YOLOv5 model weights with a modified version. This malicious model could contain backdoors that trigger specific actions upon certain inputs, or it could be designed to consistently produce false positives or negatives for the attacker's benefit.
        *   **Impact:** Complete control over the model's behavior, potentially leading to data manipulation, unauthorized actions triggered by the application based on manipulated detections, or even complete system compromise if the model has access to sensitive resources.

    *   **Model Poisoning (if model retraining is involved) [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** If the application allows for model retraining based on user-provided data or other sources, an attacker can inject malicious data into the training pipeline. This subtly alters the model's behavior over time, making it more likely to make errors favorable to the attacker or introducing backdoors that are activated by specific, attacker-controlled inputs.
        *   **Impact:** Long-term manipulation of model behavior, which can be very difficult to detect and reverse. This can lead to persistent vulnerabilities and the potential for ongoing exploitation.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Input Processing Weaknesses [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_input_processing_weaknesses__high_risk_.md)

*   This node is critical because it represents a common entry point for attackers. Weaknesses in how the application handles input data processed by YOLOv5 can be directly exploited to gain unauthorized access or cause harm.

    *   **Malicious Image/Video Upload [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Image/Video Parsing Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker uploads specially crafted image or video files designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying image processing libraries used by YOLOv5 (e.g., PIL, OpenCV). These vulnerabilities can include buffer overflows, memory corruption issues, or other flaws that can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code on the server or cause a denial of service.
            *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, allowing the attacker to gain complete control over the server. Denial of service, making the application unavailable to legitimate users.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities__high_risk_.md)

*   This node is critical because YOLOv5 relies on numerous external libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited to compromise the application.

    *   **Vulnerable Libraries [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in the libraries that YOLOv5 depends on (e.g., PyTorch, ONNX Runtime, CUDA drivers). These vulnerabilities can range from remote code execution flaws to privilege escalation issues. Publicly available exploits often exist for known vulnerabilities, making this a relatively accessible attack vector if dependencies are not kept up-to-date.
        *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, allowing the attacker to gain control of the server. Privilege escalation, enabling the attacker to gain higher-level access to the system. Data breaches if the exploited library has access to sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion__high_risk_.md)

*   **High Volume of Requests [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker floods the application with a large number of image or video processing requests. This overwhelms the server's resources (CPU, memory, GPU), making it unable to respond to legitimate requests and effectively causing a denial of service. This type of attack is relatively easy to execute with readily available tools.
        *   **Impact:** Application unavailability, preventing legitimate users from accessing the service. This can lead to business disruption, financial losses, and reputational damage.
