**Security Implications of Key Components**

Here's a breakdown of the security implications for each key component outlined in the security design review:

* **Data Handling Subsystem:**
    * **Data Loading Modules (`data/dataset.py`):**
        * **Threat:**  Maliciously crafted image files could exploit vulnerabilities in image processing libraries (like OpenCV or Pillow) leading to buffer overflows, denial of service, or remote code execution.
        * **Threat:**  Access control vulnerabilities could allow unauthorized access to training data, potentially leaking sensitive information or intellectual property.
        * **Threat:**  Injection attacks could occur if file paths or filenames are constructed from untrusted sources without proper sanitization, potentially leading to arbitrary file read/write.
        * **Mitigation:** Implement robust input validation to check image file formats, sizes, and potentially use checksums to verify integrity. Sanitize file paths and filenames rigorously. Enforce strict access controls on training data directories. Consider using sandboxing or containerization for data loading processes. Regularly update image processing libraries to patch known vulnerabilities.
