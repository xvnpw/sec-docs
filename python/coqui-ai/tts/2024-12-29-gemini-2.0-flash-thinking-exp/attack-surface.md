Here's the updated key attack surface list, focusing only on elements directly involving TTS and with high or critical risk severity:

**Key Attack Surface: Text Injection Attacks**

*   **Description:** Maliciously crafted input text is processed by the TTS engine, leading to unintended behavior or security vulnerabilities.
*   **How TTS Contributes:** TTS engines interpret and process text, and vulnerabilities in this processing can be exploited through specially crafted input.
*   **Example:** A user inputs text containing control characters or escape sequences that cause the TTS engine to execute arbitrary commands on the server or disclose sensitive information from the TTS process.
*   **Impact:**  Potential for remote code execution, information disclosure, denial of service, or bypassing security controls.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Sanitization:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization to remove or escape potentially harmful characters before passing text to the TTS engine.
    *   **Sandboxing:** Run the TTS engine in a sandboxed environment with limited privileges to restrict the impact of a successful exploit.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep the Coqui TTS library and its dependencies updated to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Output Encoding:** Ensure proper encoding of the generated audio output to prevent injection of malicious content into downstream processes.

**Key Attack Surface: Vulnerabilities in the Coqui TTS Library**

*   **Description:** Security flaws exist within the Coqui TTS library itself, which could be exploited by attackers.
*   **How TTS Contributes:**  The application directly uses the Coqui TTS library, inheriting any vulnerabilities present in it.
*   **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in a specific function of the Coqui TTS library. An attacker crafts a specific input that triggers this overflow, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, information disclosure, complete system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates:**  Stay up-to-date with the latest versions of Coqui TTS to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan the application and its dependencies (including Coqui TTS) for known vulnerabilities using automated tools.
    *   **Security Audits:** Conduct periodic security audits of the application's integration with Coqui TTS.
