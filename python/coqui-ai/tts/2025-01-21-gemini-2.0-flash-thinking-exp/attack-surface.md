# Attack Surface Analysis for coqui-ai/tts

## Attack Surface: [Excessive Input Length Leading to Resource Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/excessive_input_length_leading_to_resource_exhaustion.md)

* **Description:**  An attacker provides an extremely long text input to the TTS engine.
    * **How TTS Contributes:** The TTS engine needs to process the entire input, potentially consuming significant CPU, memory, and processing time to generate the corresponding speech. Longer inputs directly translate to more resource usage.
    * **Example:** A user submits a text input containing hundreds of thousands of characters to be converted to speech.
    * **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) - the server becomes unresponsive or crashes due to resource exhaustion, impacting other users or functionalities.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Input Length Validation:** Implement strict limits on the maximum length of text input allowed for TTS conversion.
        * **Rate Limiting:** Limit the number of TTS requests a user or IP address can make within a specific timeframe.
        * **Resource Monitoring and Alerting:** Monitor server resource usage (CPU, memory) and set up alerts to detect and respond to unusual spikes.
        * **Asynchronous Processing:** Process TTS requests asynchronously to avoid blocking the main application thread.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Information via Unintended Speech Generation](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_information_via_unintended_speech_generation.md)

* **Description:** The application inadvertently includes sensitive data in the text that is passed to the TTS engine.
    * **How TTS Contributes:** The TTS engine faithfully converts the provided text to speech, regardless of its content. If sensitive information is present in the text, it will be spoken aloud.
    * **Example:** An application generates a confirmation message for a financial transaction that includes the full account number and passes this message to the TTS engine.
    * **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive personal or financial information, leading to privacy violations, potential fraud, or compliance issues.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Data Sanitization Before TTS:**  Carefully review and sanitize all text before passing it to the TTS engine, removing or masking any sensitive information.
        * **Avoid Including Sensitive Data in TTS Input:** Design the application to avoid including sensitive data in messages intended for speech synthesis. Use generic placeholders or references instead.
        * **Access Control for Audio Output:** Implement appropriate access controls to ensure only authorized users can access the generated audio.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service through Excessive TTS Requests](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service_through_excessive_tts_requests.md)

* **Description:** An attacker floods the application with a large number of TTS requests.
    * **How TTS Contributes:** Generating speech is a computationally intensive task. A high volume of requests can overwhelm the server's resources, specifically the CPU and potentially GPU if utilized by the TTS engine.
    * **Example:** An attacker scripts a bot to repeatedly send TTS requests with varying text inputs to the application's TTS endpoint.
    * **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) - the application becomes unresponsive or crashes, preventing legitimate users from accessing its functionality.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Rate Limiting:** Implement strict rate limits on the number of TTS requests allowed per user or IP address.
        * **Authentication and Authorization:** Require users to authenticate before making TTS requests to track and control usage.
        * **CAPTCHA or Similar Challenges:** Implement CAPTCHA or other challenge-response mechanisms to prevent automated bots from making excessive requests.
        * **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Utilize a WAF to detect and block malicious traffic patterns, including high volumes of requests.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in TTS Library or its Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_tts_library_or_its_dependencies.md)

* **Description:** The Coqui TTS library or its underlying dependencies (e.g., PyTorch, ONNX Runtime, specific audio codecs) contain known security vulnerabilities.
    * **How TTS Contributes:** The application directly relies on the Coqui TTS library and its dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these components can be exploited through the application's use of the TTS functionality.
    * **Example:** A known vulnerability in a specific version of PyTorch used by Coqui TTS allows for arbitrary code execution if a specially crafted input is processed.
    * **Impact:**  Range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, including Remote Code Execution (RCE), information disclosure, or Denial of Service.
    * **Risk Severity:** Can range from Medium to Critical depending on the specific vulnerability.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Regularly Update Dependencies:** Keep the Coqui TTS library and all its dependencies updated to the latest stable versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        * **Dependency Scanning:** Use software composition analysis (SCA) tools to scan the application's dependencies for known vulnerabilities and receive alerts about potential risks.
        * **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about security advisories and vulnerability disclosures related to Coqui TTS and its dependencies.
