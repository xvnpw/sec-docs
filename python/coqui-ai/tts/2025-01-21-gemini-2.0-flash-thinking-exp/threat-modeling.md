# Threat Model Analysis for coqui-ai/tts

## Threat: [Malicious Input Exploitation](./threats/malicious_input_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts specific input text containing escape sequences, format string specifiers, or other malicious payloads that exploit vulnerabilities in the Coqui TTS library's input processing. This could lead to arbitrary code execution within the TTS process or the application hosting it.
*   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the TTS process, potentially leading to control over the server or user's machine. Data breaches, service disruption, and further attacks are possible.
*   **Affected Component:** Coqui TTS input processing module, specifically the functions responsible for parsing and handling text input before synthesis.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization on the application side before passing text to the TTS library.
    *   Ensure the Coqui TTS library is updated to the latest version with known vulnerabilities patched.
    *   Run the TTS process with the least necessary privileges.
    *   Consider sandboxing the TTS process to limit the impact of a successful exploit.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Input](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_input.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides excessively long or complex text inputs designed to overwhelm the Coqui TTS library's processing capabilities. This can lead to high CPU and memory usage, causing denial of service for other users or the entire application.
*   **Impact:** Application slowdown, service unavailability, increased infrastructure costs due to resource consumption.
*   **Affected Component:** Coqui TTS synthesis engine, specifically the modules responsible for text processing and audio generation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement limits on the length and complexity of text inputs allowed by the application.
    *   Implement timeouts for TTS processing requests.
    *   Monitor resource usage of the TTS process and implement alerts for abnormal activity.
    *   Consider using a queueing system to manage TTS requests and prevent overload.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** The Coqui TTS library relies on various third-party libraries and dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited to compromise the TTS library or the application using it. An attacker could leverage known vulnerabilities in these dependencies to gain unauthorized access or execute malicious code.
*   **Impact:**  Similar to malicious input exploitation, this could lead to code execution, data breaches, or service disruption.
*   **Affected Component:**  The specific vulnerable dependency used by Coqui TTS. This could be any of the underlying libraries for audio processing, deep learning frameworks, or other utilities.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly audit and update all dependencies of the Coqui TTS library.
    *   Use dependency management tools to track and manage dependencies and identify known vulnerabilities.
    *   Consider using software composition analysis (SCA) tools to automatically scan for dependency vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Insecure Model Handling](./threats/insecure_model_handling.md)

*   **Description:** If the application allows users to provide or influence the models used by Coqui TTS, a malicious actor could provide a compromised or "poisoned" model. This model could be designed to generate biased, misleading, or even harmful audio outputs, or it could contain embedded malicious code that is executed during model loading or inference.
*   **Impact:** Generation of incorrect or harmful speech, potential execution of malicious code within the TTS process, reputational damage due to biased outputs.
*   **Affected Component:** Coqui TTS model loading and inference modules.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Restrict the source of TTS models to trusted and verified sources.
    *   Implement integrity checks (e.g., checksums, digital signatures) for TTS models before loading them.
    *   Sanitize or validate model files before use.
    *   If user-provided models are allowed, implement a rigorous review and scanning process.
