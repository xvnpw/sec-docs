# Threat Model Analysis for coqui-ai/tts

## Threat: [Model Poisoning (Backdoor Insertion)](./threats/model_poisoning__backdoor_insertion_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains write access to the directory where the TTS model files (e.g., `.pth` files, `config.json`) are stored. They modify the model weights or configuration to introduce a backdoor.  This backdoor could cause the model to generate specific, malicious outputs when triggered by certain input phrases, or subtly degrade the quality of the output for specific users or types of input. The attacker might use social engineering, exploit a vulnerability in the file system permissions, or compromise a developer's machine.
    *   **Impact:** Loss of model integrity, generation of malicious or misleading audio, potential for reputational damage, and compromise of downstream systems relying on the TTS output. The attacker could use this to spread disinformation or manipulate users.
    *   **Affected TTS Component:** Primarily the model checkpoint files (`.pth`), and potentially the `config.json` file which defines model architecture and hyperparameters. Also, any custom vocoder models used.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **File System Permissions:** Implement strict file system permissions, allowing only the TTS process (and no other users) to write to the model directory. Use the principle of least privilege.
        *   **Checksum Verification:** Generate and store cryptographic checksums (e.g., SHA-256) of the model files and `config.json`. Regularly verify these checksums against the stored values to detect any unauthorized modifications.
        *   **Digital Signatures:** Use digital signatures to sign the model files. This provides stronger assurance of authenticity and integrity than checksums alone.
        *   **Version Control:** Store model files in a version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes and facilitate rollback to known-good versions.
        *   **Regular Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the file system and model directory.
        *   **Intrusion Detection:** Implement intrusion detection systems to monitor for unauthorized access to the model files.

## Threat: [Adversarial Input (Evasion Attack)](./threats/adversarial_input__evasion_attack_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts specific text inputs designed to cause the TTS model to produce unintended or malicious outputs. This could involve using homoglyphs (characters that look similar), phonetic manipulations, or exploiting subtle biases in the model. For example, an attacker might try to make the model pronounce a benign word as a malicious one, or insert inaudible commands into the generated audio.
    *   **Impact:** Generation of incorrect, misleading, or offensive audio. Potential for denial of service if the adversarial input causes the model to crash or consume excessive resources. Bypass of content filters.
    *   **Affected TTS Component:** The core TTS model (both acoustic model and vocoder), specifically the text processing and phoneme conversion stages (e.g., `TTS.tts.utils.text.cleaners`, `TTS.tts.utils.text.symbols`), and the neural network layers responsible for generating the audio.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Sanitization:** Implement robust input sanitization to remove or replace potentially malicious characters or sequences. This is a complex and evolving area.
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate the input text against a whitelist of allowed characters, words, or phrases, if feasible. This is more restrictive but more secure.
        *   **Length Limits:** Enforce strict limits on the length of the input text.
        *   **Adversarial Training:** Train the TTS model on a dataset that includes adversarial examples to make it more robust to these types of attacks. This is an advanced technique.
        *   **Output Monitoring (Limited):** While difficult to fully detect subtle adversarial manipulations, monitor the generated audio for unexpected characteristics (e.g., unusual pauses, unexpected phonemes).

## Threat: [Denial of Service (Resource Exhaustion) - *Specifically targeting TTS processing*](./threats/denial_of_service__resource_exhaustion__-_specifically_targeting_tts_processing.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a large number of TTS requests, *specifically crafted to be computationally expensive for the TTS engine*, or requests with excessively long text inputs *designed to exploit weaknesses in the TTS processing pipeline*. This overwhelms the TTS engine's resources (CPU, memory, GPU), making the TTS service unavailable. This differs from a general DoS on the web server; it targets the TTS processing itself.
    *   **Impact:** TTS service becomes unavailable, disrupting applications that rely on it. Potential for financial losses if the TTS service is part of a paid offering.
    *   **Affected TTS Component:** The entire TTS pipeline, including the text processing, acoustic model, vocoder.  Longer or more complex inputs will disproportionately affect the acoustic model and vocoder, which perform the most computationally intensive tasks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Rate Limiting (TTS-Specific):** Implement rate limiting *specifically for TTS processing*, potentially with different limits than general API rate limits.
        *   **Input Length Limits (Strict):** Enforce *very strict* limits on the length of the input text, tailored to the capabilities of the TTS engine.
        *   **Resource Quotas (TTS Process):** Configure resource quotas *specifically for the TTS process* to prevent it from consuming excessive CPU, memory, or GPU resources, even if the overall system has resources available.
        *   **Input Complexity Limits:**  Beyond just length, consider limiting the *complexity* of the input.  For example, limit the number of unique phonemes or the use of unusual characters. This is more advanced and requires careful analysis of the TTS engine's performance characteristics.
        *   **Queueing (with Prioritization):** Implement a queueing system with prioritization, allowing shorter, simpler requests to be processed before longer, more complex ones.
        *   **Monitoring (TTS-Specific Metrics):** Monitor TTS-specific metrics, such as processing time per request, memory usage per request, and queue length, to detect and respond to DoS attacks targeting the TTS engine.
