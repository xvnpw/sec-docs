# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for coqui-ai/tts

## Mitigation Strategy: [1. Input Validation and Sanitization (for TTS Input)](./mitigation_strategies/1__input_validation_and_sanitization__for_tts_input_.md)

**Description:**
    1.  **Define Allowed Characters:** Create a whitelist of allowed characters for the text *passed to the TTS engine*.
    2.  **Character Encoding:** Enforce consistent character encoding (UTF-8) for all TTS inputs.
    3.  **Length Limits:** Set a maximum character limit for text *sent to the TTS engine*.
    4.  **Denylist Implementation:** Create a list of forbidden words, phrases, and patterns (regex) *specifically for TTS input*. This should include names, sensitive terms, and potentially harmful content.
    5.  **Whitelist Implementation (Optional):** If feasible, define pre-approved phrases or templates *for TTS synthesis*.
    6.  **Input Validation Function:** Create a function that performs all checks *before calling the TTS synthesis function*.
    7.  **Integration:** Integrate this validation function *directly before the TTS API call*.
    8.  **Regular Review:** Regularly review and update the denylist/whitelist.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Audio Generation (Deepfakes):** (Severity: High) Directly limits the content that can be synthesized.
    *   **Data Leakage (Inference-time Attacks):** (Severity: Medium) Makes crafting exploitable inputs harder.
    *   **Model Poisoning/Backdooring (Indirectly):** (Severity: Medium) Limits the impact of a poisoned model.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion (Partially):** (Severity: Medium) Length limits help.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Audio Generation:** Significantly reduces risk.
    *   **Data Leakage:** Moderately reduces risk.
    *   **Model Poisoning:** Slightly reduces the impact.
    *   **DoS:** Partially reduces risk.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Example: "Input validation function in `tts_service.py`. Length limit enforced. No denylist.")

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Example: "Denylist needs implementation. Whitelist not feasible. Validation needs to be more thoroughly tested with edge cases.")

## Mitigation Strategy: [2. Watermarking (of TTS Output)](./mitigation_strategies/2__watermarking__of_tts_output_.md)

**Description:**
    1.  **Inaudible Watermarking Research:** Research and select an inaudible watermarking technique suitable for *TTS-generated audio*.
    2.  **Watermark Generation:** Develop a function to generate a unique watermark *for each TTS output*.
    3.  **Watermark Embedding:** Integrate watermark embedding *into the TTS pipeline, after audio generation*.
    4.  **Audible Watermarking (Optional):** Consider adding a short, distinct sound *to the TTS output*.
    5.  **Watermark Detection:** Develop a function to detect and verify the watermark *from audio files*.
    6.  **Testing:** Thoroughly test watermarking (imperceptibility, robustness, quality impact) *on TTS-generated audio*.
    7.  **Regular Review:** Periodically review and update the watermarking technique.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Audio Generation (Deepfakes):** (Severity: High) Enables identification and attribution of synthetic audio.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Audio Generation:** Significantly reduces risk.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Example: "No watermarking implemented.")

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Example: "Entire watermarking system needs implementation. Requires significant research.")

## Mitigation Strategy: [3. Model Verification and Management (TTS Model Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/3__model_verification_and_management__tts_model_specific_.md)

**Description:**
    1.  **Source Verification:** Download pre-trained *TTS models* only from official sources.
    2.  **Checksum Verification:** Verify the *TTS model's* checksum after download.
    3.  **Version Control:** Store *TTS models* in a version control system.
    4.  **Secure Storage:** Store *TTS models* securely with restricted access.
    5.  **Regular Updates:** Update *TTS models* with new releases, prioritizing security updates.
    6.  **Model Scanning (Advanced - Optional):** Explore techniques for scanning *TTS models* for anomalies.
    7.  **Training Data Verification (If Training Custom Models):**
        *   Use a clean and verified dataset *for TTS model training*.
        *   Vet external data sources *for TTS training data*.
        *   Implement data sanitization *for TTS training data*.
        *   Consider data provenance tracking *for TTS training data*.
    8.  **Retraining (If Necessary):** Retrain the *TTS model* from scratch with a verified dataset if poisoning is suspected.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Model Poisoning/Backdooring:** (Severity: High) Reduces the risk of using a compromised *TTS model*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Model Poisoning:** Significantly reduces risk.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Example: "Models downloaded from official source. Checksums verified. Stored in Git.")

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Example: "No model scanning. Need a process for regular model updates.")

## Mitigation Strategy: [4. Output Verification (Human-in-the-Loop for TTS output)](./mitigation_strategies/4__output_verification__human-in-the-loop_for_tts_output_.md)

* **Description:**
    1. **Establish Criteria:** Define clear criteria for when human review is required. This might be based on:
        * Input text length exceeding a threshold.
        * Input text containing keywords from a sensitive list.
        * Specific user roles or request origins.
        * Random sampling of a percentage of requests.
    2. **Review Interface:** Create a user interface (UI) or workflow where designated reviewers can:
        * Listen to the generated audio.
        * View the original input text.
        * Approve or reject the audio.
        * Provide feedback or reasons for rejection.
    3. **Integration with TTS Pipeline:** Modify the TTS pipeline so that, based on the criteria in step 1, the generated audio is:
        * Not immediately returned to the user/requester.
        * Routed to the review interface.
        * Only released to the user/requester after approval.
    4. **Audit Trail:** Maintain a complete audit trail of all review actions, including:
        * Reviewer identity.
        * Timestamp of review.
        * Approval/rejection decision.
        * Any feedback provided.
    5. **Training and Guidelines:** Provide clear training and guidelines to reviewers on:
        * Identifying potentially harmful or inappropriate audio.
        * Recognizing deepfake characteristics.
        * Adhering to the established review criteria.
    6. **Escalation Process:** Define an escalation process for handling ambiguous or high-risk cases.
    7. **Performance Monitoring:** Monitor the performance of the human review process, including:
        * Review time.
        * Rejection rates.
        * Reviewer agreement (if multiple reviewers are used).

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Malicious Audio Generation (Deepfakes):** (Severity: High) - Provides a critical layer of defense against the generation of harmful or misleading audio, especially in high-stakes scenarios.
    * **Model Poisoning/Backdooring (Indirectly):** (Severity: Medium) - Can help detect unexpected or malicious outputs from a compromised model, even if input validation fails.

* **Impact:**
    * **Malicious Audio Generation:** Very significantly reduces risk, especially for high-risk applications.
    * **Model Poisoning:** Moderately reduces the impact of a poisoned model.

* **Currently Implemented:** (Example: "No human-in-the-loop verification implemented.")

* **Missing Implementation:** (Example: "Entire human review process needs to be designed and implemented. Requires UI development and workflow integration.")
