# Attack Surface Analysis for coqui-ai/tts

## Attack Surface: [Model Poisoning/Backdooring](./attack_surfaces/model_poisoningbackdooring.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker replaces a legitimate TTS model with a malicious one, or modifies an existing model to introduce harmful behavior.
*   **TTS Contribution:** The core functionality of Coqui TTS relies on pre-trained or fine-tuned models. These models are the *direct* target.
*   **Example:** An attacker provides a poisoned model that subtly changes the pronunciation of certain words to spread misinformation, or inserts barely audible commands.
*   **Impact:** Loss of data integrity, manipulation of generated speech, potential execution of arbitrary commands (if output is fed to a system that interprets commands), reputational damage.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Trusted Sources:** Download models *only* from the official Coqui repository or a meticulously vetted internal source.
    *   **Checksum Verification:** *Always* verify the SHA-256 checksum of downloaded models against the official checksum. Reject any mismatch.
    *   **Signature Verification:** If Coqui provides signed models, verify the digital signature before loading.
    *   **Regular Audits:** Periodically re-verify the integrity of deployed models.
    *   **Sandboxing (Advanced):** Run the model inference in a highly restricted, isolated environment.

## Attack Surface: [Adversarial Examples (Model Evasion)](./attack_surfaces/adversarial_examples__model_evasion_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts specific input text designed to cause the TTS model to malfunction, produce unexpected output, or consume excessive resources.
*   **TTS Contribution:** The TTS engine's core function is to process text input and generate audio. This input processing is *directly* vulnerable.
*   **Example:** An attacker inputs a string of carefully chosen Unicode characters that cause the model to generate extremely high-frequency sounds or enter an infinite loop.
*   **Impact:** Denial-of-service, unexpected audio output, potential hardware damage (extreme cases), resource exhaustion.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Length Limits:** Enforce strict maximum lengths for input text.
    *   **Character Filtering:** Restrict the allowed character set. Block unusual Unicode characters.
    *   **Input Normalization:** Normalize input text before processing.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Limit the number of TTS requests per user/IP.
    *   **Robustness Training (Advanced):** Train the model with adversarial examples.

## Attack Surface: [Denial-of-Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/denial-of-service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker overwhelms the TTS system with requests, or sends requests designed to consume excessive resources.
*   **TTS Contribution:** TTS processing, especially with deep learning models, is computationally expensive. This makes the *TTS engine itself* a direct target.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends thousands of simultaneous requests or requests with extremely long input texts.
*   **Impact:** Service unavailability, disruption of service for legitimate users.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rate Limiting (Essential):** Implement strict rate limiting per user/IP.
    *   **Input Length Limits (Essential):** Enforce strict limits on input text length.
    *   **Resource Quotas:** Set resource limits (CPU, memory) for the TTS process/container.
    *   **Timeouts:** Implement timeouts for TTS requests.
    *   **Load Balancing:** Distribute requests across multiple servers.
    *   **Asynchronous Processing:** Use asynchronous task queues.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the libraries that Coqui TTS depends on (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow) could be exploited.
*   **TTS Contribution:** Coqui TTS, relies on a complex web of dependencies. These dependencies are a potential source of vulnerabilities *directly* impacting TTS.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability is discovered in a specific version of PyTorch that allows for remote code execution. An attacker exploits this vulnerability to gain control of the server running Coqui TTS.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, system compromise, data breach.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Management:** Use a robust dependency management system.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Prompt Updates:** Keep dependencies up-to-date.
    *   **Dependency Pinning:** Pin dependency versions (balance with security updates).
    *   **Vendor Advisories:** Monitor security advisories from dependency vendors.
