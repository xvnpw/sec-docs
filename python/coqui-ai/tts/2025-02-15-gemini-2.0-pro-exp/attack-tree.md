## Attack Tree Path: [1. Generate Malicious Audio [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1__generate_malicious_audio__hr_.md)

*   **Overall Reasoning:** This branch presents the most immediate and practical threats due to the relative ease of some attacks and the potential for significant impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 SSML Injection [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_ssml_injection__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** If the application allows user-supplied text to be processed without proper sanitization, and that text is used to construct SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language) for Coqui TTS, an attacker could inject malicious SSML tags. This could alter prosody, pronunciation, or insert unintended sounds/pauses.
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a high-risk path because it's relatively easy to exploit if input validation is weak, and the impact can range from annoyance to serious misinformation, depending on the application's context.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends heavily on application input handling.)
    *   **Impact:** Medium (Misinformation, social engineering, annoyance.)
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Low (Basic understanding of SSML)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires auditing input/output logs and careful review.)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Model Poisoning [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_model_poisoning__cn_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker attempts to retrain or fine-tune the Coqui TTS model with malicious data, either before the application developer uses it (supply chain attack) or by directly accessing the training pipeline.
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a critical node because successful model poisoning grants the attacker complete control over *all* TTS output, making it a fundamental compromise.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (Requires significant access or a successful supply chain compromise.)
    *   **Impact:** High (Complete control over TTS output.)
    *   **Effort:** High
    *   **Skill Level:** High (Requires expertise in ML and potentially infrastructure compromise.)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** High (Requires model integrity checks and monitoring of training data.)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3 Input Manipulation (Phoneme/Grapheme Level) [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_input_manipulation__phonemegrapheme_level___hr_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker crafts input text designed to exploit weaknesses in the TTS engine's grapheme-to-phoneme conversion or acoustic model, causing unexpected sounds, mispronunciations, or errors.
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a high-risk path because it's more subtle than SSML injection, making it harder to detect, yet it can still lead to impactful manipulations.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Requires understanding of the specific model's limitations.)
    *   **Impact:** Medium (Subtle misinformation, degradation of service quality.)
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium (Requires knowledge of phonetics and the TTS model.)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** High (Requires careful auditory analysis and comparison.)

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Data Exfiltration via Audio](./attack_tree_paths/2__data_exfiltration_via_audio.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [2.1 Model Poisoning (for Exfiltration) [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_model_poisoning__for_exfiltration___cn_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker trains the model to subtly encode data within the generated audio (steganography) by altering pitch, timing, or other acoustic features imperceptibly to humans but decodable by a separate process.
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a critical node, mirroring the general model poisoning threat, but with the specific goal of data exfiltration. The complexity is very high, but the potential impact is severe.
    *   **Likelihood:** Very Low (Extremely complex.)
    *   **Impact:** High (Could leak sensitive data without detection.)
    *   **Effort:** Very High
    *   **Skill Level:** Very High (Expertise in ML, steganography, signal processing.)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very High (Requires sophisticated audio analysis.)

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Denial of Service (TTS)](./attack_tree_paths/3__denial_of_service__tts_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [3.1 Model Overload [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_model_overload__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker sends a large number of TTS requests or requests with very long text inputs to overwhelm the TTS engine and prevent it from serving legitimate requests.
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a high-risk path because it's relatively easy to attempt and can be effective if the application lacks proper rate limiting and resource management.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on application's resource limits and rate limiting.)
    *   **Impact:** Medium (Service disruption.)
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Low
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Monitoring resource usage can reveal spikes.)

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2 Input Manipulation (for DoS) [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_input_manipulation__for_dos___hr_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker crafts specific input text that is known to cause the TTS engine to consume excessive resources or crash, exploiting bugs in text processing or audio generation.
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a high-risk path if such vulnerabilities exist, as it's a more targeted DoS attack than simple overload.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (Requires finding specific vulnerabilities.)
    *   **Impact:** Medium (Service disruption.)
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium (Requires knowledge of the TTS engine's internals.)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Monitoring for crashes and unusual resource use.)

## Attack Tree Path: [3.4 Configuration Errors [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/3_4_configuration_errors__cn_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker exploits misconfigurations in the deployment of Coqui TTS, such as exposed API endpoints without authentication or overly permissive resource limits.
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a critical node because misconfigurations are a common source of vulnerabilities and can expose the TTS engine to various attacks.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on the quality of the deployment process.)
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High (DoS, data exfiltration, or system compromise.)
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Security audits and configuration reviews.)
