## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Handling](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_handling.md)

**HIGH RISK PATH - Exploit Input Handling:**
    * **CRITICAL NODE - Prompt Injection:** Attackers manipulate the text input provided to the TTS engine to cause unintended behavior.
        * **Inject Malicious Text Commands/Characters:**  Attackers insert special characters, escape sequences, or format specifiers that the TTS engine interprets as commands or that cause errors. This can lead to crashes, unexpected output, or even the execution of arbitrary code in some scenarios (though less likely in typical TTS usage but possible in underlying parsing libraries).
        * **Influence generated audio content maliciously:** Attackers craft prompts to generate misleading, harmful, or offensive speech. This can be used for social engineering, spreading misinformation, or damaging the application's reputation.

    * **CRITICAL NODE - Bypass Input Validation:** Attackers find ways to circumvent the application's input validation mechanisms. This allows them to inject malicious input that would normally be blocked, leading to the exploitation of other vulnerabilities like prompt injection or potentially other underlying system flaws if unfiltered input reaches them.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Model Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_model_vulnerabilities.md)

**HIGH RISK PATH - Exploit Model Vulnerabilities:**
    * **CRITICAL NODE - Leverage Known Model Vulnerabilities:** Attackers exploit publicly disclosed security flaws in the specific TTS models used by the application. These vulnerabilities could allow for remote code execution, information disclosure (e.g., access to model parameters or training data if improperly secured), or denial of service. The impact depends heavily on the nature of the vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies of TTS Library](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies_of_tts_library.md)

**HIGH RISK PATH - Exploit Dependencies of TTS Library:**
    * **CRITICAL NODE - Vulnerabilities in Underlying Libraries (e.g., ONNX Runtime, PyTorch):** The Coqui-AI TTS library relies on other libraries for its functionality. Attackers can exploit known vulnerabilities in these dependencies. This can have a wide range of impacts, including remote code execution, privilege escalation, or data breaches, depending on the specific vulnerability in the affected library.
    * **CRITICAL NODE - Supply Chain Attacks:** Attackers compromise the development or distribution process of the Coqui-AI TTS library or its dependencies. This could involve injecting malicious code into the library's source code, pre-built binaries, or installation packages. If successful, this allows attackers to inject malicious code directly into applications using the compromised library, potentially leading to complete system compromise. Detection of supply chain attacks is often very difficult.
