# Threat Model Analysis for coqui-ai/tts

## Threat: [Malicious Text Injection](./threats/malicious_text_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts input text containing special characters or sequences that exploit vulnerabilities in the TTS engine's text processing or parsing logic. This could involve injecting code, commands, or data that the TTS engine interprets as instructions rather than plain text.

**Impact:**
*   **Code Execution:**  The injected code could be executed on the server hosting the application, allowing the attacker to gain control of the system, access sensitive data, or launch further attacks.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** The malicious input could cause the TTS engine to consume excessive CPU, memory, or disk space, leading to a denial-of-service for legitimate users.

**Affected Component:** Text Processing Module (within `tts` library, specifically the text-to-phoneme conversion or phoneme-to-audio stages).

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the severity of the exploitable vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Input Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize all user-provided text input before passing it to the TTS engine. This includes escaping or removing potentially harmful characters and sequences.
*   **Input Validation:**  Validate the input text against expected patterns and lengths to prevent excessively long or malformed input.
*   **Sandboxing:**  Run the TTS engine in a sandboxed environment with limited privileges to restrict the impact of any successful code injection.
*   **Regular Updates:** Keep the `tts` library updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.

## Threat: [Compromised TTS Model](./threats/compromised_tts_model.md)

**Description:** An attacker replaces the legitimate TTS model used by the application with a compromised or malicious one. This directly involves the model files used by the `tts` library.

**Impact:**
*   **Backdoor Functionality:** The compromised model could contain hidden logic to execute arbitrary code on the server when specific text is processed by the `tts` library.
*   **Data Poisoning/Bias:** The model might be trained on biased or manipulated data, leading to the generation of harmful, discriminatory, or misleading audio content by the `tts` library.
*   **Unexpected Audio Output:** The malicious model could be designed to generate unexpected or inappropriate audio, potentially damaging the application's reputation or misleading users through the `tts` library's output.

**Affected Component:** Model Loading and Inference Modules (within `tts` library, specifically the components responsible for loading and using the `.pth` model files).

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Verify Model Integrity:**  Use checksums or digital signatures to verify the integrity and authenticity of TTS models before loading them into the `tts` library.
*   **Secure Model Storage:**  Store TTS models in secure locations with appropriate access controls to prevent unauthorized modification or replacement.
*   **Trusted Sources:** Only download TTS models from trusted and reputable sources.
*   **Model Scanning:**  If feasible, implement mechanisms to scan models for potential signs of tampering or malicious code (though this can be challenging for complex ML models).

## Threat: [Dependency Chain Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_chain_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** The `tts` library relies on various underlying libraries and dependencies (e.g., ONNX Runtime, specific audio processing libraries). Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited *through* the `tts` library. An attacker might target a known vulnerability in a dependency that is used by `tts`.

**Impact:**
*   **Code Execution:** Exploiting a vulnerability in a dependency used by `tts` could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Denial of Service:** A vulnerability in a dependency used by `tts` could be exploited to crash the application or consume excessive resources by the `tts` library.
*   **Information Disclosure:** A vulnerable dependency used by `tts` might allow an attacker to access sensitive information processed by the `tts` library.

**Affected Component:**  Underlying Libraries and Dependencies (external to the core `tts` library but essential for its functionality).

**Risk Severity:** Medium to High (depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Dependency Management:** Use a dependency management tool to track and manage the versions of all dependencies of the `tts` library.
*   **Regular Updates:** Regularly update the `tts` library and all its dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Use security scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in the project's dependencies, including those used by `tts`.
*   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Implement SCA tools to gain visibility into the project's dependencies and their associated risks, especially for the `tts` library.
