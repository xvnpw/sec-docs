# Attack Surface Analysis for coqui-ai/tts

## Attack Surface: [Compromised or Malicious TTS Models](./attack_surfaces/compromised_or_malicious_tts_models.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides or substitutes a legitimate TTS model with a malicious one.
    *   **How TTS Contributes:** The `tts` library loads and utilizes TTS models to generate speech. If the application allows users to specify model paths or if the model loading process is insecure, malicious models can be introduced.
    *   **Example:** Loading a custom model that contains embedded code designed to execute when the model is loaded or used by the `tts` library.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the server or client running the application, data exfiltration, unauthorized access to resources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only use trusted and verified TTS models.
        *   Implement integrity checks (e.g., checksums, digital signatures) for TTS models before loading them.
        *   Restrict the locations from which models can be loaded.
        *   Enforce strict access control on model files and directories.
        *   Regularly scan model files for malware or suspicious content.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Text Injection](./attack_surfaces/malicious_text_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides crafted text input intended to exploit vulnerabilities in the TTS engine's processing logic.
    *   **How TTS Contributes:** The `tts` library directly processes user-provided text to generate speech. If the underlying engine or the `tts` library itself has parsing vulnerabilities, malicious text can trigger unexpected behavior.
    *   **Example:** Injecting a very long string or text containing specific control characters that cause the TTS engine to crash or consume excessive resources.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), resource exhaustion, potential for code execution if the underlying engine has severe vulnerabilities (less likely but possible).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the text provided to the `tts` library.
        *   Limit the maximum length of the input text.
        *   Consider using a sandboxed environment for the TTS processing if feasible.
        *   Keep the `tts` library and its dependencies updated to patch known vulnerabilities.
