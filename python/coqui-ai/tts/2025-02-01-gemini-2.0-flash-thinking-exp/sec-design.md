# BUSINESS POSTURE

The coqui-ai/tts repository provides a library and tools for Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Democratize access to high-quality Text-to-Speech technology.
  - Enable developers to easily integrate TTS capabilities into their applications.
  - Foster innovation and research in the field of TTS.
  - Provide an open-source alternative to commercial TTS services.

- Business Risks:
  - Misuse of the TTS technology for malicious purposes (e.g., generating deepfakes, impersonation).
  - Data privacy concerns if the library is used to process sensitive user input.
  - Vulnerabilities in the library could be exploited in applications that use it.
  - Lack of commercial support or guarantees for production use.
  - Dependency on community contributions for maintenance and security updates.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Open Source Code - The code is publicly available on GitHub, allowing for community review and scrutiny. Implemented: GitHub Repository.
  - security control: Code Review - Contributions are likely reviewed by maintainers before being merged. Implemented: GitHub Pull Request process (assumed).
  - security control: Version Control - Git is used for version control, providing traceability of changes. Implemented: GitHub Repository.
  - security control: Issue Tracking - GitHub Issues are used for bug reports and feature requests. Implemented: GitHub Issues.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community for security vulnerability discovery and patching.
  - accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in dependencies.
  - accepted risk: No formal security audit process is mentioned.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated vulnerability scanning for dependencies and code.
  - security control: Establish a process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Provide secure deployment guidelines for applications using the TTS library.
  - security control: Consider adding input validation examples and best practices to documentation.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to the TTS library itself, as it's designed to be integrated into other applications which will handle authentication. However, if the project provides API endpoints for demonstration or services, authentication will be required for those.
  - Authorization: Authorization will be managed by the applications integrating the TTS library. The library itself should not enforce authorization. If API endpoints are provided, authorization will be needed to control access to TTS functionalities.
  - Input Validation:  Applications using the TTS library must perform input validation on the text provided for synthesis to prevent injection attacks or unexpected behavior. The library should be robust against malformed input but the responsibility primarily lies with the integrating application.
  - Cryptography: Cryptography might be relevant if the TTS library handles sensitive data (e.g., training data, user input in certain applications). If so, data at rest and in transit should be encrypted. For the library itself, cryptography is less of a direct requirement unless it's dealing with sensitive keys or data internally. Applications using the library might need to encrypt the audio output or input text depending on their security requirements.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Providing Text-to-Speech synthesis functionality to applications and users.
  - Maintaining the integrity and availability of the TTS library and pretrained models.
  - Protecting the reputation and trustworthiness of the Coqui TTS project.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Input Text: Potentially sensitive if users provide personal or confidential information for synthesis. Sensitivity: Medium to High, depending on the application.
  - Generated Audio: Could be sensitive depending on the input text and application context. Sensitivity: Medium to High, depending on the application.
  - Pretrained Models: Represent significant effort and knowledge. If proprietary or custom models are used, they are highly sensitive. Sensitivity: High (for proprietary models), Medium (for publicly available models).
  - Training Data: If custom training data is used, it might contain sensitive information and is crucial for model quality. Sensitivity: High (if private or sensitive data).
  - Source Code: Core intellectual property of the project. Sensitivity: Medium to High.

- Assumptions:
  - The Coqui TTS project is primarily intended to be used as a library integrated into other applications.
  - Security is a concern for the project, but it is currently managed through standard open-source development practices and community contributions.
  - Applications integrating the TTS library are responsible for implementing application-level security controls (authentication, authorization, input validation, etc.).
  - The project aims to provide a high-quality and reliable TTS solution, but does not offer commercial support or guarantees in its current open-source form.
  - The deployment scenario described (cloud environment) is a common use case, but the library can be deployed in various other environments as well.
