# Attack Surface Analysis for coqui-ai/tts

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Model Injection](./attack_surfaces/malicious_model_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Loading and using TTS models from untrusted sources can lead to the execution of malicious code embedded within the model files.
*   **TTS Contribution:** The TTS library directly loads and utilizes model files for voice synthesis. If the application allows specifying model paths, it directly enables the use of malicious models.
*   **Example:** An attacker provides a URL to a seemingly legitimate TTS model repository, but the downloaded model contains code that executes a reverse shell when loaded by the TTS library.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server or client machine running the TTS application, data exfiltration, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Restrict Model Sources:** Only load models from trusted and verified sources. Ideally, bundle models within the application or use a curated, internal repository.
    *   **Model Integrity Checks:** Implement checksum verification (e.g., SHA256) for downloaded models to ensure they haven't been tampered with.
    *   **Secure Model Storage:** Store trusted models in a dedicated, isolated directory with restricted access permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Model File Path Traversal](./attack_surfaces/model_file_path_traversal.md)

*   **Description:** Improper handling of user-provided input related to model file paths can allow attackers to access files outside the intended model directory, potentially leading to loading unintended files as TTS models.
*   **TTS Contribution:** The TTS library requires the path to model files. Vulnerability arises if the application constructs these paths based on user input without proper sanitization, making it susceptible to path traversal when loading models.
*   **Example:** An attacker provides an input like `"../../../../etc/passwd"` as part of a model path. If the application naively uses this input to load a model, it might attempt to load `/etc/passwd` as a model file, potentially causing errors or unexpected behavior, and in some scenarios, information disclosure if the application mishandles file access errors.
*   **Impact:** Information Disclosure (potential reading of error messages revealing file paths or existence), Denial of Service (attempting to load invalid or system files leading to crashes or errors).
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Sanitization:**  Strictly sanitize and validate all user inputs related to file paths. Remove or escape path traversal sequences like `../` and `./`.
    *   **Path Whitelisting:** If possible, use a whitelist approach where only predefined, allowed model names or paths are accepted.
    *   **Secure Path Construction:** Use secure path manipulation functions provided by the operating system or programming language to construct file paths safely, avoiding direct string concatenation of user input.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service_via_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** Processing excessively long or complex text inputs can consume significant server resources (CPU, memory, processing time) by the TTS engine, leading to service disruption or unavailability.
*   **TTS Contribution:** The TTS engine itself is responsible for the resource-intensive process of converting text to speech.  Longer and more complex text inputs directly increase resource consumption by the TTS library.
*   **Example:** An attacker repeatedly sends extremely long text strings (e.g., thousands of words) to the TTS service. This overwhelms the server's CPU and memory, causing the TTS service to become slow or unresponsive, and potentially impacting other application functionalities or leading to a complete service outage.
*   **Impact:** Service disruption, application slowdown, resource exhaustion, potential server crash, denial of service for legitimate users.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Length Limits:** Implement strict limits on the length of text inputs accepted by the TTS service.
    *   **Resource Limits:** Configure resource limits (CPU, memory, processing time) for the TTS process to prevent it from consuming excessive resources.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to restrict the number of TTS requests from a single source within a given time frame.
    *   **Asynchronous Processing:** Use asynchronous task queues to handle TTS processing in the background, preventing blocking of the main application thread and improving responsiveness.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by Coqui TTS can be exploited indirectly through the TTS library, as the TTS library relies on these components for its functionality.
*   **TTS Contribution:** Coqui TTS depends on various Python packages and libraries. Vulnerabilities within these dependencies directly become part of the attack surface of any application using Coqui TTS. Exploiting these dependency vulnerabilities can directly compromise the TTS functionality and the application as a whole.
*   **Example:** A known vulnerability is discovered in a specific version of a dependency used by Coqui TTS (e.g., a library for audio processing or neural network operations). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability if the application is using a vulnerable version of Coqui TTS and its dependencies, potentially leading to remote code execution or other severe impacts.
*   **Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the specific vulnerability, including Remote Code Execution, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, often with high severity due to the core nature of dependencies.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the severity of dependency vulnerabilities)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Coqui TTS and all its dependencies updated to the latest versions. Regularly check for updates and apply them promptly.
    *   **Dependency Scanning:** Use dependency scanning tools to automatically identify known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
    *   **Vulnerability Monitoring:** Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases related to Python packages and the specific dependencies used by Coqui TTS to proactively address newly discovered vulnerabilities.
