### Vulnerability List:

* Vulnerability Name: Unauthenticated Metrics Endpoint Exposure
* Description:
    1. The django-prometheus library exposes a `/metrics` endpoint by default when included in Django project's `urls.py`.
    2. This endpoint is implemented in `django_prometheus.exports.ExportToDjangoView`.
    3. The `ExportToDjangoView` function directly returns Prometheus metrics data without performing any authentication or authorization checks.
    4. An external attacker can access this `/metrics` endpoint without any credentials.
    5. The endpoint exposes sensitive monitoring data about the Django application, including request rates, response times, database query counts, cache usage, and potentially custom application metrics.
* Impact:
    - Information Disclosure: Sensitive internal monitoring data is exposed to unauthorized external attackers. This data can reveal application architecture, performance characteristics, usage patterns, and potential internal errors, which can be valuable for reconnaissance in further attacks.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The project does not implement any authentication or authorization mechanisms for the `/metrics` endpoint.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement authentication and authorization for the `/metrics` endpoint. This can be achieved by:
        - Using Django's built-in authentication and permission framework to restrict access to the `ExportToDjangoView`.
        - Providing configuration options to users to easily integrate their own authentication/authorization mechanisms.
        - Documenting best practices for securing the `/metrics` endpoint, including using firewalls or reverse proxies to restrict access based on IP address or other criteria.
* Preconditions:
    - Django Prometheus is installed in a Django project.
    - `django_prometheus.urls` are included in the project's `urls.py`, typically with the line `path('', include('django_prometheus.urls'))`.
    - The Django application is publicly accessible.
* Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `/code/django_prometheus/urls.py`
        ```python
        from django.urls import path

        from django_prometheus import exports

        urlpatterns = [path("metrics", exports.ExportToDjangoView, name="prometheus-django-metrics")]
        ```
        This code defines a URL pattern that maps the `/metrics` path to the `ExportToDjangoView` function.

    2. File: `/code/django_prometheus/exports.py`
        ```python
        from django.http import HttpResponse
        from prometheus_client import multiprocess, generate_latest, CollectorRegistry
        import os

        def ExportToDjangoView(request):
            """Exports /metrics as a Django view.

            You can use django_prometheus.urls to map /metrics to this view.
            """
            if "PROMETHEUS_MULTIPROC_DIR" in os.environ or "prometheus_multiproc_dir" in os.environ:
                registry = CollectorRegistry()
                multiprocess.MultiProcessCollector(registry)
            else:
                registry = prometheus_client.REGISTRY
            metrics_page = generate_latest(registry)
            return HttpResponse(metrics_page, content_type=prometheus_client.CONTENT_TYPE_LATEST)
        ```
        The `ExportToDjangoView` function directly retrieves metrics from the Prometheus registry and returns them in an `HttpResponse`. There are no checks for user authentication or authorization within this function or in the URL configuration in `urls.py`. This means anyone who can access the URL of the Django application can access the `/metrics` endpoint.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Deploy a Django application using `django-prometheus` with default settings. Ensure that the following lines are present in your project:
        - In `settings.py`, add `'django_prometheus'` to `INSTALLED_APPS` and the Prometheus middleware to `MIDDLEWARE`.
        - In `urls.py`, include `path('', include('django_prometheus.urls'))` to expose the metrics endpoint at `/metrics`.
    2. Start the Django development server or deploy the application to a publicly accessible environment.
    3. As an external attacker, open a web browser or use `curl` to access the `/metrics` endpoint of the deployed application (e.g., `http://your-django-app.example.com/metrics`).
    4. Observe that the `/metrics` endpoint returns a large text output in Prometheus format, containing various metrics about the Django application's performance and operations.
    5. Verify that there is no authentication prompt or any other access control mechanism preventing access to the metrics data. This confirms that the endpoint is publicly accessible without authentication.
