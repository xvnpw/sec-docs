- **Vulnerability: Unprotected Metrics Endpoint Information Disclosure**
  - **Description:**
    The project exposes a metrics endpoint at “/metrics” (configured in `django_prometheus/urls.py` and implemented in `django_prometheus/exports.py`) without any form of authentication or access control. An external attacker can simply send a GET request to this endpoint and retrieve detailed operational metrics such as HTTP request/response counts, response latencies, database query timings, error counts, cache statistics, and other internal performance data. This detailed information can be used to gain insight into the internal workings, performance characteristics, and potential weaknesses of the underlying system.
    - *Triggering Steps:*
      1. Deploy the Django-Prometheus–enabled application so that the “/metrics” endpoint is publicly available.
      2. As an external attacker, send a GET request (for example, using `curl` or a web browser) to `http://<target-host>/metrics`.
      3. Receive a response containing extensive metrics and operational details.
  - **Impact:**
    Disclosure of sensitive operational details may enable attackers to fingerprint the system, identify abnormal error patterns or performance characteristics, and use this intelligence to further compromise the application or its backend components.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The endpoint is simply mapped via a Django view (in `django_prometheus/urls.py` and `ExportToDjangoView` in `django_prometheus/exports.py`) without any access restrictions.
    - There is no built‐in authentication, authorization, or rate limiting.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Implement authentication and/or authorization to limit access to the metrics endpoint.
    - Use network-based restrictions (for example, limiting access to trusted IP addresses or placing the endpoint behind a firewall).
    - Optionally, provide configuration options to disable or secure the endpoint when deployed in production.
  - **Preconditions:**
    - The application is deployed with the “/metrics” endpoint accessible to the public Internet (or to untrusted users) without additional safeguards.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In `django_prometheus/urls.py` the endpoint is defined as:
      ```
      urlpatterns = [path("metrics", exports.ExportToDjangoView, name="prometheus-django-metrics")]
      ```
    - In `django_prometheus/exports.py`, the view function simply collects metrics from Prometheus’s registry and returns them without any authentication checks:
      ```
      def ExportToDjangoView(request):
          if "PROMETHEUS_MULTIPROC_DIR" in os.environ or "prometheus_multiproc_dir" in os.environ:
              registry = prometheus_client.CollectorRegistry()
              multiprocess.MultiProcessCollector(registry)
          else:
              registry = prometheus_client.REGISTRY
          metrics_page = prometheus_client.generate_latest(registry)
          return HttpResponse(metrics_page, content_type=prometheus_client.CONTENT_TYPE_LATEST)
      ```
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. Deploy the Django application in an environment where “/metrics” is reachable by external users.
    2. Use a tool such as curl:
       ```
       curl http://<target-host>/metrics
       ```
    3. Verify that the response contains detailed metrics (including counters, histograms, and gauges) that reveal internal operational details.
    4. Confirm that no authentication or other access controls are applied.
