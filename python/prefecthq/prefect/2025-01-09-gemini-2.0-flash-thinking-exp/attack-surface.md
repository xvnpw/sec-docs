# Attack Surface Analysis for prefecthq/prefect

## Attack Surface: [Prefect API Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/prefect_api_vulnerabilities.md)

- **Description:** Exploitable flaws in the Prefect Server's API endpoints that could allow unauthorized actions or data access.
- **How Prefect Contributes:** Prefect's core functionality relies on its API for managing flows, deployments, work pools, and infrastructure. Vulnerabilities here directly expose control over the orchestration platform.
- **Example:** An attacker could exploit an unauthenticated API endpoint to trigger arbitrary flow runs or modify deployment configurations, leading to unintended consequences.
- **Impact:**  Critical. Potential for complete compromise of the Prefect environment, including data manipulation, unauthorized code execution, and denial of service.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing: Conduct thorough assessments of the Prefect Server API to identify and remediate vulnerabilities.
    - Input Validation and Sanitization: Implement strict input validation on all API endpoints to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection).
    - Authentication and Authorization Hardening: Enforce strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0) and implement granular role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict API access based on the principle of least privilege.
    - Rate Limiting and Throttling: Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks and denial-of-service attempts against the API.
    - Keep Prefect Server Up-to-Date: Regularly update the Prefect Server to the latest version to patch known security vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Prefect Agents](./attack_surfaces/compromised_prefect_agents.md)

- **Description:** An attacker gains control over a Prefect Agent, allowing them to execute arbitrary code within the agent's environment and potentially access connected resources.
- **How Prefect Contributes:** Agents are responsible for executing flow runs. Their compromise allows attackers to manipulate or inject malicious code into the execution environment.
- **Example:** An attacker compromises an agent and uses it to execute a malicious script that exfiltrates data from a database the flow interacts with.
- **Impact:** High. Potential for data breaches, unauthorized access to resources, and disruption of flow execution.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Secure Agent Deployment: Deploy agents in secure environments with restricted access and proper network segmentation.
    - Credential Management for Agents: Securely manage and rotate agent API keys or other authentication credentials. Avoid embedding credentials directly in agent configurations.
    - Regular Agent Updates: Keep agents updated to the latest version to patch known security vulnerabilities.
    - Monitoring and Logging: Implement robust monitoring and logging for agent activity to detect suspicious behavior.
    - Principle of Least Privilege for Agent Permissions: Grant agents only the necessary permissions to execute their assigned tasks.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Flow Code Execution](./attack_surfaces/insecure_flow_code_execution.md)

- **Description:** Vulnerabilities or malicious code within flow definitions can be exploited during execution by Prefect Agents or Workers.
- **How Prefect Contributes:** Prefect orchestrates the execution of user-defined Python code within flows. If this code is not secure, it presents a risk.
- **Example:** A flow definition contains a task that executes arbitrary shell commands based on user-provided input without proper sanitization, leading to command injection.
- **Impact:** High. Potential for arbitrary code execution on the agent/worker, leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Code Review and Security Testing for Flows: Implement thorough code reviews and security testing practices for all flow definitions.
    - Input Validation and Sanitization in Flows:  Ensure all user inputs within flows are properly validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks.
    - Use Secure Libraries and Practices: Encourage developers to use secure coding practices and libraries to avoid common vulnerabilities.
    - Restrict Agent/Worker Permissions: Limit the permissions of the user account under which agents and workers execute flows to minimize the impact of a compromised flow.
    - Consider Isolated Execution Environments: Explore options for isolating flow execution environments (e.g., using containers) to limit the impact of malicious code.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

- **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the third-party libraries and packages that Prefect depends on.
- **How Prefect Contributes:** Prefect relies on numerous open-source libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can indirectly expose Prefect installations to attacks.
- **Example:** A critical vulnerability is discovered in a popular Python library used by Prefect. Attackers could exploit this vulnerability if the Prefect installation hasn't been updated.
- **Impact:** Medium to High (depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability). Potential for various impacts, including remote code execution, denial of service, and information disclosure.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Regular Dependency Scanning: Implement automated tools to scan Prefect's dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
    - Keep Prefect Server and Agents Up-to-Date: Regularly update Prefect Server and Agents to benefit from updates that include patched dependencies.
    - Dependency Pinning: Pin specific versions of dependencies to ensure consistency and avoid unexpected issues from automatic updates. However, ensure a process for regularly reviewing and updating pinned dependencies for security reasons.
    - Software Composition Analysis (SCA): Utilize SCA tools to gain visibility into the software bill of materials (SBOM) and identify potential risks associated with dependencies.
