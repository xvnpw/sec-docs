# Threat Model Analysis for prefecthq/prefect

## Threat: [Compromised Prefect API Key](./threats/compromised_prefect_api_key.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to a valid Prefect API key, potentially through credential stuffing, phishing, or exposure in code. They can then use this key to authenticate against the Prefect Server/Cloud API.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Prefect resources, including the ability to create, modify, and delete deployments, trigger flow runs, and access sensitive metadata. This could lead to data breaches, service disruption, or unauthorized execution of malicious code.
*   **Affected Prefect Component:** Prefect Server/Cloud API Authentication
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong API key management practices, including secure storage and rotation.
    *   Utilize short-lived API keys where possible.
    *   Monitor API key usage for suspicious activity.
    *   Implement IP whitelisting or other network-based access controls for the Prefect API.

## Threat: [Malicious Flow Code Injection](./threats/malicious_flow_code_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with access to create or modify flow definitions injects malicious code within a flow or task. This code could be executed during a flow run.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the Prefect execution environment, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service. The impact depends on the permissions and environment where the flow is executed.
*   **Affected Prefect Component:** Flow and Task Definition, Prefect Agent, Prefect Worker (if applicable)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict access controls for who can create and modify flow definitions.
    *   Employ code review processes for all flow and task code.
    *   Utilize secure coding practices to prevent common injection vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement input validation and sanitization within flows.
    *   Run flows in isolated environments with minimal necessary permissions.

## Threat: [Agent Impersonation/Rogue Agent](./threats/agent_impersonationrogue_agent.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker deploys a rogue Prefect Agent or compromises an existing one. This rogue agent could be used to execute malicious flows or intercept communication with the Prefect Server/Cloud.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized flow execution, potential data exfiltration, disruption of legitimate flow runs, and compromise of the agent's host system.
*   **Affected Prefect Component:** Prefect Agent Registration, Prefect Server/Cloud Agent Communication
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure the agent registration process using strong authentication and authorization.
    *   Implement mutual TLS (mTLS) for secure communication between agents and the Prefect Server/Cloud.
    *   Regularly audit and monitor registered agents.
    *   Implement network segmentation to isolate agent networks.

## Threat: [Exposure of Secrets in Flow Run Logs](./threats/exposure_of_secrets_in_flow_run_logs.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information, such as API keys or database credentials, is inadvertently logged during a flow run. This could occur through careless logging practices within task code.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access to external systems and data breaches.
*   **Affected Prefect Component:** Flow Run Logging, Prefect Server/Cloud
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement secure logging practices, avoiding logging sensitive information.
    *   Utilize Prefect's Secrets backend to manage and access secrets securely, avoiding hardcoding them in flow code.
    *   Configure log levels appropriately to minimize the amount of sensitive data logged.
    *   Implement mechanisms to redact sensitive information from logs.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Prefect UI](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_prefect_ui.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Prefect UI, potentially through weak credentials, brute-force attacks, or session hijacking.
*   **Impact:** Ability to view sensitive information about flows, deployments, and infrastructure. Potential to modify deployments, trigger flow runs, and disrupt Prefect operations depending on the attacker's privileges.
*   **Affected Prefect Component:** Prefect UI Authentication and Authorization
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce strong password policies and multi-factor authentication (MFA) for UI access.
    *   Implement account lockout policies to prevent brute-force attacks.
    *   Ensure secure session management practices to prevent session hijacking.
    *   Regularly update Prefect to patch known UI vulnerabilities.
