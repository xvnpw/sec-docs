## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Workflow Definition/Execution](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_workflow_definitionexecution.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Inject Malicious Code into Flow Definition *** CRITICAL NODE ***
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious code directly into the definition of a Prefect flow. This could be Python code within a task, or even through manipulating the flow's structure to execute unintended commands.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High - Successful injection allows for arbitrary code execution on the Prefect infrastructure or the target application during flow runs. This can lead to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
    *   **Effort:** Medium - Requires access to the source code repository or the Prefect UI/API with sufficient permissions (if weakly controlled).
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate - Requires understanding of Python and Prefect's flow definition mechanisms.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Static analysis of flow definitions might detect some patterns, but dynamic detection can be challenging without proper monitoring.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Task Execution](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_task_execution.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Inject Malicious Code into Task Code *** CRITICAL NODE ***
    *   **Description:** Similar to flow definition injection, but focuses on the code within individual Prefect tasks.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High - Allows for arbitrary code execution within the environment where the task is executed (e.g., Prefect agent, worker). This can lead to compromising the agent/worker host, accessing sensitive data, or pivoting to other systems.
    *   **Effort:** Medium - Requires access to the source code repository or the Prefect UI/API.
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate - Requires understanding of Python and Prefect's task execution model.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Similar to flow definition injection, detection can be challenging.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Prefect Infrastructure](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_prefect_infrastructure.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Compromise Prefect Agents/Workers *** CRITICAL NODE ***
    *   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Prefect agent or worker software, or compromising the underlying operating system/infrastructure where they run.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High - Gaining control over agents/workers allows for arbitrary code execution, access to secrets and data processed by tasks, and potentially lateral movement within the network.
    *   **Effort:** Medium - Depends on the specific vulnerability or misconfiguration.
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate - Requires knowledge of system exploitation and potentially reverse engineering.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Requires robust endpoint security monitoring and anomaly detection.

*   **Attack Vector:** Compromise the Prefect Server *** CRITICAL NODE ***
    *   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Prefect server application itself or the underlying infrastructure (database, message broker).
    *   **Likelihood:** Low
    *   **Impact:** Critical - Complete compromise of the Prefect server grants access to all managed workflows, secrets, and potentially control over all connected agents/workers. This is a highly impactful attack.
    *   **Effort:** High - Typically requires advanced exploitation techniques.
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced - Requires deep understanding of web application vulnerabilities and potentially infrastructure security.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High - Requires sophisticated intrusion detection and anomaly detection systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Secrets Management](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_secrets_management.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Steal Secrets Stored by Prefect *** CRITICAL NODE ***
    *   **Description:** Gaining unauthorized access to Prefect's secrets storage mechanism (e.g., environment variables, secret backend) or exploiting vulnerabilities in how Prefect handles secrets.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High - Accessing secrets exposes sensitive credentials, API keys, and other confidential information used by the application and Prefect, potentially leading to further compromise of other systems.
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium - Depending on the security of the secrets management implementation.
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate - Could range from finding exposed environment variables to exploiting more complex vulnerabilities.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Requires monitoring access to secret stores and detecting unusual secret retrieval patterns.

*   **Attack Vector:** Access Secrets via Compromised Components *** CRITICAL NODE ***
    *   **Description:** Compromising a Prefect agent, worker, or the server to access secrets stored in memory or configuration.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High - Similar to directly stealing secrets, this provides access to sensitive credentials.
    *   **Effort:** Medium - Requires first compromising a Prefect component.
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate - Requires skills to exploit component vulnerabilities.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Relies on detecting the initial component compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit User Access Controls](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_user_access_controls.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Credential Compromise *** CRITICAL NODE ***
    *   **Description:** Obtaining valid Prefect user credentials through phishing, brute-force attacks, or data breaches.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High - Compromised credentials grant unauthorized access to Prefect resources, potentially leading to any of the other attack vectors, including manipulating workflows and accessing secrets.
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium - Depending on the sophistication of the attack (e.g., phishing is relatively low effort).
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate - Phishing requires less technical skill than brute-force attacks.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Requires monitoring for suspicious login attempts and unusual activity.

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploit API Key Vulnerabilities *** CRITICAL NODE ***
    *   **Description:** Obtaining Prefect API keys through insecure storage, accidental exposure, or compromised systems.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High - Compromised API keys allow unauthorized access to Prefect's API, enabling manipulation of workflows and resources, potentially leading to data breaches or service disruption.
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium - Finding exposed API keys can be easy, while compromising systems to obtain them requires more effort.
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate - Depending on how the API key is obtained.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Requires monitoring API usage for unusual patterns and unauthorized key usage.
