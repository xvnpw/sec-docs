#### 1.1.1 Brute-force/Guess Weak Admin Credentials [HIGH-RISK PATH]

**Detailed Description:** This attack vector involves an attacker attempting to gain access to the Prefect Server admin interface by systematically trying different username/password combinations. This is particularly effective if default or weak passwords are used, or if password complexity requirements are not enforced.

**Prerequisites:**

*   **Accessible Prefect Server Admin Interface:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the login page of the Prefect Server UI.
*   **Lack of Account Lockout Mechanisms:**  If the Prefect Server does not implement account lockout after multiple failed login attempts, brute-forcing becomes more feasible.
*   **Weak or Default Credentials:** The existence of accounts with easily guessable passwords (e.g., "admin"/"password", common words, default credentials) significantly increases the likelihood of success.

**Attack Steps:**

1.  **Identify Admin Login Page:** Locate the URL for the Prefect Server admin login page.
2.  **Credential List Generation:**  Compile a list of potential usernames (e.g., "admin", "administrator", default usernames) and passwords (common passwords, default passwords, variations).
3.  **Automated Brute-force Attack:** Utilize automated tools (e.g., Hydra, Medusa, Burp Suite Intruder) to systematically submit login requests with different username/password combinations.
4.  **Credential Guessing:**  Manually or semi-automatically attempt to guess passwords based on common patterns, organization-specific information, or leaked password databases.

**Tools/Techniques:**

*   **Hydra, Medusa, Ncrack:**  Command-line brute-forcing tools.
*   **Burp Suite Intruder, OWASP ZAP:**  Web application security testing tools with brute-forcing capabilities.
*   **Password Lists (e.g., RockYou, SecLists):**  Collections of commonly used passwords.
*   **Credential Stuffing:**  Using leaked credentials from other breaches to attempt login.

**Likelihood:**  **Medium to High**, depending on the security posture of the Prefect deployment.  If default credentials are not changed, password policies are weak, and account lockout is not implemented, the likelihood is high.

**Impact (Specific to Prefect):**

*   **Full Administrative Control:** Successful brute-force grants the attacker complete administrative privileges over the Prefect Server.
*   **Flow Manipulation and Disruption:**  Ability to modify, delete, and control all flows, leading to significant operational disruption.
*   **Data Access and Exfiltration:** Access to sensitive flow run data, logs, and potentially secrets managed within Prefect.
*   **User Account Manipulation:** Creation of new admin accounts, modification or deletion of existing accounts.

**Mitigations (Detailed & Specific):**

*   **Enforce Strong Password Policies:**
    *   **Complexity Requirements:** Mandate passwords with minimum length, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
    *   **Password History:** Prevent password reuse.
    *   **Regular Password Rotation:** Encourage or enforce periodic password changes.
    *   **Utilize Password Managers:** Promote the use of password managers for generating and storing strong, unique passwords.
*   **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
    *   **Enable MFA for all Admin Accounts:**  Require a second factor of authentication (e.g., TOTP, SMS, hardware token) in addition to passwords. This significantly reduces the risk of brute-force attacks.
    *   **Consider MFA for all User Roles:**  Depending on the sensitivity of data and operations, extend MFA to other user roles beyond administrators.
*   **Implement Account Lockout Mechanisms:**
    *   **Threshold-Based Lockout:**  Automatically lock accounts after a defined number of consecutive failed login attempts.
    *   **Temporary Lockout:**  Lock accounts for a specific duration (e.g., 15 minutes, 1 hour) before allowing further login attempts.
    *   **CAPTCHA or Rate Limiting:**  Implement CAPTCHA or rate limiting on the login endpoint to slow down brute-force attempts.
*   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Periodically assess the effectiveness of password policies and authentication mechanisms through security audits and penetration testing.
*   **Monitor Login Attempts:**  Implement logging and monitoring of login attempts, especially failed attempts, to detect and respond to brute-force attacks in progress.

*   **Potential for Lateral Movement:**  Compromised API keys can sometimes be used to gain access to other systems or resources if the keys are reused or grant access to broader infrastructure.

**Mitigations (Detailed & Specific):**

*   **Secure API Key Management Practices:**
    *   **Secrets Management Solutions:**  Utilize dedicated secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) to securely store and manage API keys. Avoid storing keys in plain text in code or configuration files.
    *   **Environment Variables:**  Prefer using environment variables to inject API keys into applications at runtime, rather than hardcoding them.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for API Keys:**  Grant API keys only the necessary permissions required for their intended purpose. Avoid creating overly permissive API keys.
    *   **API Key Rotation:**  Implement regular API key rotation to limit the window of opportunity for compromised keys.
    *   **Key Expiration:**  Set expiration dates for API keys to enforce periodic rotation and reduce the risk of long-term compromise.
*   **Prevent API Key Leakage:**
    *   **Code Repository Scanning (Pre-commit Hooks):**  Implement automated scanning of code repositories (using tools like `git-secrets`, `trufflehog`) to detect and prevent accidental commits of API keys.
