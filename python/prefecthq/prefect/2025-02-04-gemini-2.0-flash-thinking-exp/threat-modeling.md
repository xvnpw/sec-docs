*   **Description:** An attacker could compromise a Prefect Agent instance. This could be achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in the agent's environment, or through social engineering or insider threats targeting the agent's host. Once compromised, the attacker controls the agent process and its capabilities within Prefect.
*   **Impact:** Malicious flow execution under the agent's identity, access to resources and systems the agent has credentials for within Prefect and potentially external systems, data exfiltration from the agent's environment, and potential lateral movement within the infrastructure the agent can reach.
*   **Affected Prefect Component:** Prefect Agent process, Agent communication with Prefect Server, Agent's execution environment within Prefect.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure the environment where Agents are deployed, following security best practices for the underlying infrastructure.
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for Agent communication with the Prefect Server (API keys, tokens, secure agent registration).
    *   Regularly update agent software and dependencies to the latest versions.
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege to the agent's service account within Prefect and the underlying system.
    *   Utilize infrastructure-as-code and configuration management to ensure consistent and secure agent deployments.
    *   Implement monitoring and alerting for agent activity and resource usage within Prefect.

## Threat: [Agent Credential Theft](./threats/agent_credential_theft.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could steal credentials used by the Agent to authenticate to the Prefect Server or access resources managed by Prefect. This could involve accessing agent configuration files, memory, or exploiting vulnerabilities to extract API keys or tokens used for Prefect communication.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the Prefect Server and potentially other Prefect managed resources, allowing the attacker to impersonate the agent, execute malicious flows, access sensitive data managed by Prefect, and potentially disrupt Prefect operations.
*   **Affected Prefect Component:** Agent configuration, Agent runtime environment, Prefect Agent authentication mechanisms.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid storing sensitive credentials directly in agent configurations.
    *   Utilize secure secret management solutions (Prefect Secrets, external secret stores integrated with Prefect) to provide credentials to agents at runtime.
    *   Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit within the agent environment.
    *   Implement proper access control and monitoring of agent environments to detect and prevent unauthorized access.
    *   Regularly rotate agent credentials used for Prefect authentication.

## Threat: [Malicious Flow/Task Code Deployment](./threats/malicious_flowtask_code_deployment.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with sufficient privileges within Prefect to deploy flows (e.g., compromised user account, insider threat) could inject malicious code into flows or tasks. This malicious code could be designed to exploit Prefect functionality to steal data, disrupt workflows, or gain unauthorized access to systems integrated with Prefect.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the Prefect environment during flow runs, data manipulation within Prefect workflows, system compromise of systems integrated with Prefect, denial of service of Prefect workflows, and potential reputational damage.
