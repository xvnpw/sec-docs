# BUSINESS POSTURE

Prefect is an open-source workflow orchestration platform designed to build, observe, and react to data pipelines. Its primary business priority is to provide a reliable, scalable, and user-friendly solution for managing complex workflows, especially in data-intensive applications. The goal is to empower data engineers, data scientists, and DevOps teams to automate and monitor their workflows effectively, reducing operational overhead and improving data pipeline reliability.

Most important business risks that need to be addressed:
- Risk of data pipeline failures impacting business operations due to unreliable workflow orchestration.
- Risk of inefficient resource utilization leading to increased infrastructure costs.
- Risk of lack of visibility into workflow execution, hindering monitoring and troubleshooting.
- Risk of complex workflow management leading to increased development and maintenance time.
- Risk of vendor lock-in if the platform is not sufficiently open and extensible.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Open-source project with community review and contributions. (Implemented: GitHub repository and community forums)
- security control: Code reviews as part of the contribution process. (Implemented: GitHub pull request review process)
- security control: Dependency scanning for known vulnerabilities in open-source dependencies. (Implemented: Likely through standard GitHub Dependabot or similar tools, but needs confirmation)
- security control: Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools usage to manage open source components. (Implemented: Likely, but needs confirmation)
- security control: Standard GitHub security features like branch protection and vulnerability reporting. (Implemented: GitHub repository settings)
- security control: Documentation on security best practices for users. (Implemented: Prefect documentation website)

Accepted risks:
- accepted risk: Reliance on community security contributions and response times for vulnerability patching.
- accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in open-source dependencies that might not be immediately identified and fixed.
- accepted risk: Security of user-deployed infrastructure where Prefect is hosted and workflows are executed.
- accepted risk: Security configurations and practices adopted by individual users of Prefect.

Recommended security controls:
- security control: Implement automated security scanning in CI/CD pipelines, including SAST and DAST tools.
- security control: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure and response process.
- security control: Provide security hardening guides and best practices for deploying and configuring Prefect.
- security control: Conduct regular penetration testing or security audits of the core platform.
- security control: Implement and enforce strong authentication and authorization mechanisms within Prefect.
- security control: Provide features for secure storage and handling of sensitive data and secrets within workflows.

Security requirements:
- Authentication:
    - requirement: Secure authentication mechanisms for accessing the Prefect UI, API, and CLI.
    - requirement: Support for various authentication methods, including local user accounts, SSO (Single Sign-On), and API keys.
    - requirement: Multi-factor authentication (MFA) support for enhanced security.
- Authorization:
    - requirement: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage user permissions and access to resources within Prefect.
    - requirement: Granular authorization policies to control access to workflows, deployments, and other entities.
    - requirement: Audit logging of authorization decisions and access attempts.
- Input Validation:
    - requirement: Robust input validation for all user-provided inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection).
    - requirement: Input sanitization and encoding to mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
    - requirement: Validation of workflow definitions and configurations to prevent malicious or unexpected behavior.
- Cryptography:
    - requirement: Secure storage of sensitive data, such as API keys, credentials, and secrets, using encryption at rest.
    - requirement: Encryption in transit for communication between Prefect components and external systems using TLS/HTTPS.
    - requirement: Support for secure secret management solutions for workflows to access credentials and sensitive information.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes we are trying to protect:
- Reliable execution of data pipelines: Ensuring workflows run as scheduled and complete successfully is crucial for data-driven business operations. Failures can lead to data delays, inaccurate reporting, and business disruptions.
- Data integrity and accuracy: Maintaining the integrity and accuracy of data processed by workflows is essential for making informed business decisions. Data corruption or manipulation can have significant negative impacts.
- System availability and performance: Ensuring Prefect platform and workflows are available and performant is critical for continuous data processing and real-time applications. Downtime or performance degradation can disrupt business operations.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- Workflow definitions: These contain logic and configurations for data pipelines. Sensitivity: Medium. Exposure could lead to intellectual property theft or manipulation of workflows.
- Workflow state and run history: Information about workflow executions, including logs, metrics, and state data. Sensitivity: Medium. Contains operational data and potentially sensitive information about data processing.
- User credentials and API keys: Used for authentication and authorization to Prefect and external systems. Sensitivity: High. Compromise can lead to unauthorized access and control.
- Secrets and sensitive data within workflows: Credentials, API keys, and other sensitive information used by workflows to access data sources and services. Sensitivity: High. Compromise can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access to external systems.
- Monitoring and logging data: Operational data about Prefect platform and workflows. Sensitivity: Low to Medium. Can contain information about system performance and potential security incidents.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What specific SAST, DAST, and SCA tools are currently used or planned to be used in the CI/CD pipeline?
- Is there a formal vulnerability disclosure and response process in place for Prefect?
- Are there specific security hardening guides or best practices documented for deploying Prefect in different environments?
- Are penetration tests or security audits regularly conducted for Prefect?
- What specific authentication and authorization mechanisms are currently supported and planned for Prefect?
- What secret management solutions are recommended or supported for use with Prefect workflows?
- What are the data retention policies for workflow run history and logs?
- What are the specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2) that Prefect needs to adhere to or support?
- What is the risk appetite of the organization using Prefect? (Startup vs. Fortune 500)

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to provide a reliable and scalable workflow orchestration platform for data-intensive applications. Users prioritize ease of use, observability, and automation.
- SECURITY POSTURE: Prefect is currently following basic security best practices for open-source projects. There is room for improvement in implementing more proactive and automated security controls, especially in CI/CD and vulnerability management. Security is a growing concern as adoption increases and users handle more sensitive data.
- DESIGN: The C4 diagrams and descriptions provided are a reasonable representation of the high-level architecture of Prefect. Kubernetes deployment is a common and important deployment scenario for production environments. The build process includes basic security checks, but can be further enhanced with more comprehensive security scanning and supply chain security measures.
