### 5. Threats Mitigated and Impact

**Analysis:**

The proposed RBAC implementation directly addresses the identified threats:

*   **Unauthorized Access to Prefect Resources (Medium to High Severity):** RBAC is highly effective in mitigating this threat by enforcing access control policies. By defining roles and permissions, RBAC ensures that only authorized users with assigned roles can access specific Prefect resources. This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized individuals gaining access to sensitive flows, deployments, and infrastructure components. **Impact: High risk reduction.**

*   **Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity):** RBAC, when properly implemented with the principle of least privilege, effectively limits the risk of privilege escalation. By assigning users only the necessary permissions for their roles, it prevents users from gaining elevated privileges beyond their authorized scope. This reduces the potential for malicious actors or compromised accounts to gain administrative control. **Impact: Medium to High risk reduction.**

*   **Data Breaches (Medium Severity):** By controlling access to sensitive flow data and configurations within Prefect, RBAC contributes to reducing the risk of data breaches. Limiting access to data based on roles ensures that only authorized personnel can view or modify sensitive information. This minimizes the attack surface and reduces the potential for data exfiltration. **Impact: Medium risk reduction.**

**Overall Impact:**

Implementing RBAC in Prefect provides a **Medium to High** overall risk reduction for the identified threats. The effectiveness of RBAC depends heavily on the quality of role definitions, proper configuration, and ongoing maintenance and auditing.

### 6. Currently Implemented vs. Missing Implementation

**Analysis:**

The current partial implementation, with basic user roles in Prefect Cloud but lacking fine-grained RBAC, leaves significant security gaps.

*   **Currently Implemented (Basic User Roles):**  While basic user roles provide some level of access control, they are often too broad and lack the granularity needed to enforce the principle of least privilege effectively. This means users might have access to resources beyond their actual needs, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and privilege escalation.

*   **Missing Implementation (Detailed Role Definitions, Permission Assignments, Regular Review, Auditing):** The absence of detailed role definitions and permission assignments means that access control is not precisely tailored to job functions. The lack of regular RBAC reviews and auditing means that the system is not being proactively monitored for misconfigurations or evolving security needs. This increases the risk of security drift and potential vulnerabilities over time.

**Gap Analysis:**

The key gaps in the current implementation are:

*   **Lack of Fine-Grained Roles:**  Need to define specific roles with granular permissions mapped to Prefect resources.
*   **Missing Permission Mapping:**  Need to map defined roles to specific permissions for each Prefect resource type.
*   **No Regular RBAC Review Process:**  Need to establish a process for periodic review and update of RBAC configurations.
*   **Absence of RBAC Auditing:**  Need to implement RBAC usage auditing to monitor access patterns and detect potential security issues.

Addressing these gaps is crucial to realize the full security benefits of RBAC in Prefect.
