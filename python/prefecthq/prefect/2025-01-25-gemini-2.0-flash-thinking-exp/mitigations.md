## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Prefect Cloud](./mitigation_strategies/implement_role-based_access_control__rbac__in_prefect_cloud.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Prefect Cloud

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Access Prefect Cloud Organization Settings as an administrator.
*   Step 2: Navigate to the "Teams" or "Users" section within Prefect Cloud.
*   Step 3: Define roles within Prefect Cloud teams based on job functions relevant to Prefect operations (e.g., Flow Developer, Flow Operator, Administrator, Read-Only).  Examples of roles could include:
    *   **Flow Developer (Prefect Role):** Can create, edit, and deploy flows within Prefect, but limited infrastructure management.
    *   **Flow Operator (Prefect Role):** Can execute flows, monitor flow runs, and view logs within Prefect, but cannot modify flows or infrastructure definitions.
    *   **Administrator (Prefect Role):** Full access to manage all aspects of Prefect Cloud, including users, teams, flows, and infrastructure within the Prefect platform.
    *   **Read-Only (Prefect Role):** Can view flows, flow runs, and logs within Prefect, but cannot make any changes within the Prefect platform.
*   Step 4: Assign users to appropriate Prefect Cloud teams and roles based on the principle of least privilege within the Prefect platform.
*   Step 5: Regularly review and audit user roles and team memberships within Prefect Cloud to ensure they remain appropriate and up-to-date within the Prefect context.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data and Flows *within Prefect* - Severity: High
*   Accidental or Malicious Modification of Flows or Infrastructure *within Prefect* by Unauthorized Users - Severity: High
*   Privilege Escalation *within Prefect* - Severity: Medium

**Impact:**
*   Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data and Flows *within Prefect*: Risk reduction - High
*   Accidental or Malicious Modification of Flows or Infrastructure *within Prefect*: Risk reduction - High
*   Privilege Escalation *within Prefect*: Risk reduction - Medium

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Prefect Cloud organization has basic teams set up (e.g., "Developers", "Operations") *within Prefect Cloud*.
*   Users are assigned to teams *in Prefect Cloud*, but granular roles *within Prefect Cloud teams* are not yet defined.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Granular role definitions *within Prefect Cloud teams* are needed (e.g., Flow Developer, Flow Operator, Read-Only roles within the "Developers" and "Operations" teams *in Prefect Cloud*).
*   Formal process for reviewing and auditing user roles and team memberships *within Prefect Cloud* is not yet established.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Prefect's Secrets Backend or Integrate with External Secret Managers](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_prefect's_secrets_backend_or_integrate_with_external_secret_managers.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Secrets Management with Prefect's Secrets Backend or External Secret Managers

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Identify all secrets used in Prefect flows and configurations (API keys, database credentials, etc.) that are managed or accessed by Prefect.
*   Step 2: Migrate all hardcoded secrets from flow code and Prefect configuration files to a secure secrets management solution *integrated with Prefect*.
*   Step 3: Choose a secrets backend for Prefect. Options include:
    *   Prefect's built-in secrets backend (for simpler use cases directly within Prefect).
    *   Integration with external secret managers like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault (for enterprise-grade security and centralized secret management *integrated with Prefect*).
*   Step 4: Configure Prefect to access secrets from the chosen backend. Use Prefect's `Secret` object in flows to retrieve secrets dynamically at runtime *through Prefect's API*.
*   Step 5: Implement access control policies within the secret manager to restrict access to secrets based on the principle of least privilege. Only authorized flows and agents *within Prefect* should be able to access specific secrets *through Prefect's secret management*.
*   Step 6: Regularly rotate secrets according to a defined schedule and whenever a potential compromise is suspected, *managing rotation through the chosen secret backend integrated with Prefect*.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Exposure of Secrets in Code Repositories or Configuration Files *related to Prefect flows* - Severity: High
*   Hardcoded Secrets in Prefect Flows Leading to Credential Theft - Severity: High
*   Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Resources due to Stolen Credentials *managed by Prefect* - Severity: High

**Impact:**
*   Exposure of Secrets in Code Repositories or Configuration Files *related to Prefect flows*: Risk reduction - High
*   Hardcoded Secrets in Prefect Flows Leading to Credential Theft: Risk reduction - High
*   Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Resources due to Stolen Credentials *managed by Prefect*: Risk reduction - High

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Prefect's built-in secrets backend is used for storing a few non-critical API keys *within Prefect*.
*   Some less sensitive credentials are still stored as environment variables in agent configurations *outside of Prefect's secret management*.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Migration of all secrets *used in Prefect flows* to a robust external secret manager like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager *integrated with Prefect*.
*   Implementation of granular access control policies for secrets *within Prefect's secret management*.
*   Automated secret rotation policies *integrated with Prefect's secret management* are not in place.
*   Comprehensive inventory of all secrets *used in Prefect flows and intended to be managed by Prefect* is missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure API Keys and Access Tokens for Prefect API](./mitigation_strategies/secure_api_keys_and_access_tokens_for_prefect_api.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Management and Rotation of Prefect API Keys and Access Tokens

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Treat Prefect API keys and access tokens as highly sensitive credentials.
*   Step 2: Store Prefect API keys and access tokens securely using a dedicated secret management solution (as described in Mitigation Strategy 2), *preferably integrated with Prefect*. Avoid storing them in plain text or in code.
*   Step 3: Rotate Prefect API keys and access tokens regularly according to a defined schedule. Prefect Cloud and Server provide mechanisms for key rotation.
*   Step 4: Limit the scope and lifespan of Prefect API keys and access tokens to minimize potential damage if compromised. Use specific scopes when generating tokens to restrict their capabilities to only what's necessary.
*   Step 5: Monitor usage of Prefect API keys and access tokens for suspicious activity.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Compromise of Prefect API Keys/Tokens Leading to Unauthorized Access to Prefect API - Severity: High
*   Account Takeover of Prefect Resources via Stolen API Keys/Tokens - Severity: High
*   Data Breach through Unauthorized API Access - Severity: High

**Impact:**
*   Compromise of Prefect API Keys/Tokens Leading to Unauthorized Access to Prefect API: Risk reduction - High
*   Account Takeover of Prefect Resources via Stolen API Keys/Tokens: Risk reduction - High
*   Data Breach through Unauthorized API Access: Risk reduction - High

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Prefect API keys are used for programmatic access to Prefect Cloud.
*   Basic practices for not hardcoding keys are generally followed.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Formal policy and automated process for regular rotation of Prefect API keys and access tokens.
*   Explicit scoping of API keys/tokens to limit permissions.
*   Active monitoring of Prefect API key/token usage for suspicious activity.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization within Flows](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization_within_flows.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Input Validation and Sanitization in Prefect Flows

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Identify all external inputs to Prefect flows (parameters, data from external systems, user inputs, etc.).
*   Step 2: Implement robust input validation within flow code to ensure that inputs conform to expected formats, types, and ranges. Use Prefect's data validation capabilities or standard Python validation libraries.
*   Step 3: Sanitize inputs to remove or escape potentially harmful characters or code before using them in operations that could be vulnerable to injection attacks (e.g., database queries, shell commands, API calls).
*   Step 4: Log invalid inputs for monitoring and debugging purposes.
*   Step 5: Regularly review and update input validation and sanitization logic as flows evolve and new input sources are added.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Injection Vulnerabilities (SQL Injection, Command Injection, etc.) in Prefect Flows - Severity: High
*   Data Integrity Issues due to Malicious or Unexpected Inputs - Severity: Medium
*   Flow Failures and Instability Caused by Invalid Inputs - Severity: Medium

**Impact:**
*   Injection Vulnerabilities (SQL Injection, Command Injection, etc.) in Prefect Flows: Risk reduction - High
*   Data Integrity Issues due to Malicious or Unexpected Inputs: Risk reduction - Medium
*   Flow Failures and Instability Caused by Invalid Inputs: Risk reduction - Medium

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Basic input validation is performed in some flows, but it's not consistently applied across all flows.
*   Sanitization is not systematically implemented.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Standardized input validation and sanitization library or functions for use across all Prefect flows.
*   Mandatory input validation checks in code review guidelines for flows.
*   Automated testing to verify input validation logic in flows.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege for Flow Execution Environments](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_for_flow_execution_environments.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Apply Principle of Least Privilege to Prefect Flow Execution Environments

**Description:**
*   Step 1: When configuring execution environments for flows (e.g., using agents, Docker containers, Kubernetes jobs), identify the minimum necessary permissions required for each flow to function correctly.
*   Step 2: Grant only these minimal permissions to the execution environment. Avoid granting overly broad permissions or running flows with administrative privileges.
*   Step 3: For agents, configure service accounts or IAM roles with restricted permissions.
*   Step 4: For Docker containers or Kubernetes jobs, define security contexts and resource limits to further restrict capabilities.
*   Step 5: Regularly review and adjust permissions for flow execution environments as flows evolve and requirements change.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Privilege Escalation from Compromised Flow Execution Environment - Severity: High
*   Lateral Movement from Compromised Flow Execution Environment - Severity: High
*   Data Breach due to Overly Permissive Flow Execution Environment - Severity: High

**Impact:**
*   Privilege Escalation from Compromised Flow Execution Environment: Risk reduction - High
*   Lateral Movement from Compromised Flow Execution Environment: Risk reduction - High
*   Data Breach due to Overly Permissive Flow Execution Environment: Risk reduction - High

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Agents are generally run with user-level permissions, not root.
*   Basic resource limits might be in place for some execution environments.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Formal process for defining and enforcing least privilege for flow execution environments.
*   Granular permission management for agents and flow execution environments.
*   Security context definitions for Docker containers and Kubernetes jobs used by Prefect flows.
*   Regular audits of permissions granted to flow execution environments.
