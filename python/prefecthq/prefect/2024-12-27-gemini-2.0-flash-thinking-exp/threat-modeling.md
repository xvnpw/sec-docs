## High and Critical Prefect Threats

| Threat | Description | Impact | Affected Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Rogue Agent/Worker Registration** | An attacker registers a malicious agent or worker with the Prefect Server/Cloud by potentially exploiting a lack of strong authentication or authorization controls. This allows them to execute arbitrary code within the Prefect environment. | Data breaches, unauthorized access to resources, disruption of legitimate workflows by executing malicious tasks. | Prefect Server/Cloud (Agent Registration API, Worker Registration API) | High | Implement Mutual TLS (mTLS) for agent/worker communication, enforce strong agent/worker authorization policies, regularly review registered agents/workers, network segmentation. |
| **Flow Definition Manipulation** | An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Prefect Server/Cloud's database or API (e.g., by exploiting weak credentials or API vulnerabilities) and modifies flow definitions, injecting malicious code or altering execution logic. | Execution of malicious code within the Prefect environment, data corruption, unauthorized access to systems accessed by the modified flow. | Prefect Server/Cloud (Flow Definition Storage, Flow Deployment API) | Critical | Implement strong access control for Prefect Server/Cloud (authentication and authorization), audit logging of flow definition changes, consider immutable flow definitions where possible. |
| **Sensitive Data in Flow Runs/Logs** | Sensitive information (API keys, passwords, database credentials) is inadvertently logged or stored within flow run parameters, results, or logs accessible through the Prefect UI or API due to lack of proper secrets management within Prefect flows. | Exposure of sensitive credentials, potentially leading to further compromise of other systems and data. | Prefect Server/Cloud (Flow Run Storage, Logging System) | High | Utilize Prefect's secrets management features (Blocks), avoid passing secrets directly in flow parameters or logging them, implement log sanitization and redaction within Prefect configurations. |
| **Resource Exhaustion (DoS)** | An attacker triggers a large number of resource-intensive flows or manipulates existing flows to consume excessive resources on the Prefect Server/Cloud or the underlying infrastructure, potentially by exploiting a lack of rate limiting or resource quotas within Prefect's execution management. | Unavailability of the Prefect orchestration service, impacting the application's functionality and potentially the underlying infrastructure. | Prefect Server/Cloud (Flow Run Execution Engine) | High | Implement rate limiting and throttling for flow runs within Prefect configurations, configure resource quotas and limits for agents and workers, implement monitoring and alerting for resource utilization. |
| **Exploiting Server Vulnerabilities** | An attacker exploits a known or zero-day vulnerability in the Prefect Server/Cloud software itself (e.g., through unpatched dependencies or code flaws) to gain elevated privileges and potentially compromise the entire system. | Full control over the Prefect environment, leading to widespread compromise, data breaches, and service disruption. | Prefect Server/Cloud (Core Application, Dependencies) | Critical | Keep Prefect Server/Cloud up-to-date with the latest security patches, security hardening of the server infrastructure, regular vulnerability scanning of the Prefect Server/Cloud infrastructure. |
| **Malicious Code Execution on Agent/Worker** | An attacker compromises a Prefect agent or worker (e.g., through vulnerabilities in the underlying OS or container runtime) and uses it to execute arbitrary code within the execution environment, potentially by manipulating the flow execution process initiated by Prefect. | Data breaches, unauthorized access to resources within the execution environment, potential lateral movement to other systems. | Prefect Agents/Workers (Execution Environment, Flow Execution Process) | High | Secure agent/worker deployment environments, utilize sandboxing and isolation techniques (e.g., containerization) for flow executions managed by Prefect, regularly update agent/worker software and underlying infrastructure. |
| **Data Leakage from Agent/Worker** | Sensitive data processed by a flow running on a compromised Prefect agent or worker is exfiltrated by the attacker, potentially by exploiting vulnerabilities in the agent/worker software or the underlying infrastructure during Prefect-orchestrated tasks. | Exposure of sensitive data processed by the workflows. | Prefect Agents/Workers (Data Processing Environment) | High | Implement data encryption at rest and in transit on agents/workers, secure storage for agent/worker credentials used by Prefect, network segmentation to isolate agent/worker networks. |
| **API Key Compromise** | API keys used to interact with the Prefect Server/Cloud are compromised (e.g., through exposed environment variables, insecure storage, or phishing attacks), allowing an attacker to perform actions on behalf of the legitimate user through the Prefect API. | Unauthorized access to Prefect resources, potential manipulation of workflows and data. | Prefect Server/Cloud (API Authentication) | High | Securely store and manage Prefect API keys (e.g., using environment variables or dedicated secrets management), regularly rotate API keys, restrict API key permissions based on the principle of least privilege. |
