# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for prefecthq/prefect

## Mitigation Strategy: [Leverage Prefect's Built-in Secret Management](./mitigation_strategies/leverage_prefect's_built-in_secret_management.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use `prefect.context.secrets`:**  Within your flow code, access secrets *exclusively* through `prefect.context.secrets`.  This is the core Prefect mechanism for handling sensitive data.  Do *not* use environment variables directly within the flow code, or other methods of accessing secrets.
    2.  **Configure a Supported Secrets Backend:**  Choose a secrets backend supported by Prefect.  Options include:
        *   **Prefect Cloud Secrets:**  If using Prefect Cloud, this is the simplest option. Secrets are stored encrypted within Prefect Cloud.
        *   **Environment Variables:**  Suitable for development and simple deployments, but less secure for production.
        *   **HashiCorp Vault:**  A robust and widely used secrets management solution.
        *   **AWS Secrets Manager / Parameter Store:**  Good options if running on AWS.
        *   **Azure Key Vault:**  Good option if running on Azure.
        *   **GCP Secret Manager:** Good option if running on GCP.
    3.  **Define Secrets in Prefect UI or CLI:**  Use the Prefect UI (if using Prefect Cloud or Server) or the Prefect CLI to define the secrets that your flows will use.  This links the secret name (used in `prefect.context.secrets`) to the actual secret value stored in the backend.
    4. **Do not pass secrets as flow parameters**: Secrets should be accessed via `prefect.context.secrets`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Exposure in Logs/Results (Severity: High):**  Secrets are not stored in plain text in flow code, logs, or results.
    *   **Compromised Agent (Severity: Critical):**  Even if an agent is compromised, the attacker cannot directly access secrets if they are stored in a secure backend (e.g., Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).  The agent only has temporary access to the secret *during* flow execution.
    *   **Accidental Secret Leakage (Severity: Medium):** Reduces the risk of accidentally committing secrets to version control or sharing them insecurely.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Exposure:** Risk reduced significantly (from High to Low).
    *   **Compromised Agent:**  Reduces the impact of a compromise.
    *   **Accidental Leakage:** Risk reduced significantly (from Medium to Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Prefect Secrets are used with environment variables.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Transition to a more secure backend (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Prefect's RBAC (Prefect Cloud/Server)](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_prefect's_rbac__prefect_cloudserver_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable RBAC (if available):**  If using Prefect Cloud or a self-hosted Prefect Server with RBAC features, ensure that RBAC is enabled.
    2.  **Define Roles:**  Create roles that correspond to different levels of access within your Prefect deployment (e.g., "Flow Developer," "Operator," "Admin").
    3.  **Assign Permissions:**  Assign specific permissions to each role.  Permissions control what actions users in that role can perform (e.g., create flows, run flows, view results, manage secrets).  Follow the principle of least privilege.
    4.  **Assign Users to Roles:**  Assign users to the appropriate roles based on their responsibilities.
    5.  **Regular Review:**  Periodically review roles and permissions to ensure they remain aligned with your needs and security policies.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (Severity: High):**  RBAC prevents unauthorized users from accessing or modifying flows, results, or configurations.
    *   **Insider Threat (Severity: Medium):**  Limits the damage that a malicious or compromised user account can do.
    *   **Accidental Misconfiguration (Severity: Medium):**  Reduces the risk of users accidentally making changes that could impact the stability or security of the system.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduced significantly (from High to Low/Medium).
    *   **Insider Threat:** Risk reduced.
    *   **Accidental Misconfiguration:** Risk reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic user accounts exist.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   RBAC is not yet enabled or configured.  All users have the same level of access.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Agent Labels and Flow Run Constraints](./mitigation_strategies/agent_labels_and_flow_run_constraints.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Assign Labels to Agents:**  Use labels to categorize your agents based on their capabilities, environment, or security level (e.g., `environment:production`, `gpu:true`, `security:high`).
    2.  **Specify Run Constraints in Flows:**  When defining your flows, use the `run_config` to specify which agents are allowed to run the flow.  This can be done using label selectors (e.g., `labels=["environment:production"]`).
    3.  **Enforce Constraints:**  Prefect will ensure that flows are only executed by agents that match the specified constraints.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Flow Execution (Severity: High):** Prevents flows from being run on unauthorized or inappropriate agents.  For example, you can prevent a flow that requires access to sensitive data from running on a less secure agent.
    *   **Resource Mismatch (Severity: Medium):**  Ensures that flows are run on agents with the necessary resources (e.g., GPUs, specific software).

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Execution:** Risk reduced significantly.
    *   **Resource Mismatch:** Risk reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Agent labels and flow run constraints are not yet used.  Flows can run on any available agent.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use Prefect's Built-in Result Storage and Persistence Mechanisms](./mitigation_strategies/use_prefect's_built-in_result_storage_and_persistence_mechanisms.md)

* **Description:**
    1. **Choose a Result Backend:** Select a result backend that meets your security and persistence requirements. Prefect supports various backends, including:
        *   Local Filesystem (for development/testing)
        *   Cloud Storage (S3, GCS, Azure Blob Storage) - *Recommended for production*
        *   Prefect Result Locations (using Prefect Cloud or Server)
    2. **Configure Encryption (if applicable):** If using cloud storage, configure encryption at rest and in transit.
    3. **Avoid Custom Result Handling:** Rely on Prefect's built-in mechanisms for storing and retrieving results. Avoid writing custom code to handle results, as this can introduce security vulnerabilities.
    4. **Set Result Persistence Policies:** Configure how long results should be persisted. Consider using short-lived results or implementing a data retention policy.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Exposure (Severity: High):** Secure result storage prevents sensitive data from being exposed if the Prefect Server or agent is compromised.
    *   **Data Loss (Severity: Medium):** Using a reliable result backend ensures that flow results are not lost due to agent failures or other issues.

* **Impact:**
    *   **Data Exposure:** Risk reduced significantly when using secure cloud storage with encryption.
    *   **Data Loss:** Risk reduced.

* **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Using the default local filesystem result storage.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Switch to a secure cloud storage backend (e.g., S3 with encryption).
    *   Configure result persistence policies.
