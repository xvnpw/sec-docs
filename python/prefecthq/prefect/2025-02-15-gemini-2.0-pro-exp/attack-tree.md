## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Prefect Server [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_prefect_server__hr_.md)

This is a high-risk path because compromising the server provides a central point of control and access to all managed flows and potentially sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.a Expose Secrets [HR, CN]](./attack_tree_paths/1_a_expose_secrets__hr__cn_.md)

*   **Description:**  The attacker gains access to secrets used by Prefect flows (API keys, database credentials, etc.). This is a *critical node* because exposed secrets are a gateway to other systems and data.  It's *high-risk* due to the potential for misconfiguration and the high impact.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Insecure Storage:** Secrets hardcoded in flow code, stored in unencrypted environment variables, or placed in version control (e.g., Git repositories).
    *   **Misconfigured Access Controls:**  Insufficiently restrictive permissions on configuration files or secret stores.
    *   **Vulnerability Exploitation:**  Exploiting a vulnerability in the Prefect server or a related component to gain access to files or memory containing secrets.
    *   **Social Engineering:** Tricking a user with access to the secrets into revealing them.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.b Exploit Flow Code Vulnerabilities [HR, CN]](./attack_tree_paths/1_b_exploit_flow_code_vulnerabilities__hr__cn_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker exploits vulnerabilities *within the user-defined flow code* that Prefect executes. This is a *critical node* because it allows for arbitrary code execution within the flow's context. It's *high-risk* due to the prevalence of coding errors and the potential for high impact.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Command Injection:**  The flow code unsafely incorporates user-provided input into system commands, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands.
    *   **SQL Injection:**  Similar to command injection, but targeting SQL queries.  If the flow interacts with a database and doesn't properly sanitize input, the attacker can manipulate queries.
    *   **Insecure Deserialization:**  The flow deserializes untrusted data without proper validation, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Path Traversal:**  The flow uses user-provided input to construct file paths without proper sanitization, allowing the attacker to access files outside of the intended directory.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** If the flow generates HTML output that includes user-provided input without proper escaping, an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript. (Less common in Prefect flows, but possible if interacting with web interfaces).

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Prefect Server Vulnerabilities [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_prefect_server_vulnerabilities__hr_.md)

This is a high-risk path because the server is the central control point.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.a API Endpoint Vulnerabilities [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/2_a_api_endpoint_vulnerabilities__cn_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the Prefect Server's API. This is a critical node because the API controls all aspects of Prefect.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Authentication Bypass:** Circumventing the authentication mechanisms of the API, gaining unauthorized access.
    *   **Input Validation Vulnerabilities [HR]:** Exploiting weaknesses in how the API handles user input. This is high-risk due to the potential for various injection attacks.
        *   **Injection Attacks (SQLi, Command Injection, etc.):** Similar to flow code vulnerabilities, but targeting the API itself.
        *   **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** If the API processes XML input, an attacker might be able to exploit XXE vulnerabilities to access local files or internal systems.
        *   **Improper Error Handling:**  Error messages that reveal sensitive information about the server's configuration or internal workings.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.b Configuration Vulnerabilities [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/2_b_configuration_vulnerabilities__cn_.md)

* **Description:** The attacker leverages misconfigurations in the Prefect Server's setup. This is a critical node because it can expose the server to a wide range of attacks.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Weak Configuration [HR]:** Using default or easily guessable passwords, leaving unnecessary services exposed, or failing to enable security features. This is high-risk due to the commonality of weak configurations.
    *   **Exposed Configuration:** Making configuration files (which might contain sensitive information) publicly accessible.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.c Database Vulnerabilities [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/2_c_database_vulnerabilities__cn_.md)

* **Description:** The attacker targets the database used by the Prefect Server (typically PostgreSQL). This is a *critical node* because the database stores flow definitions, run history, and potentially sensitive metadata.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **SQL Injection (SQLi) [HR]:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in how the Prefect Server interacts with the database to execute arbitrary SQL queries. This is high-risk due to the potential for complete database compromise.
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Gaining direct access to the database due to weak passwords, misconfigured network access controls, or other vulnerabilities.
