### Vulnerability List

#### Vulnerability 1: Open Redirect in Admin Actions
* Description:
    The `ModelAdmin.response_change` and `ModelAdmin.response_add` methods in `unfold/admin.py` redirect to the URL specified in the `next` GET parameter without proper validation. An attacker can craft a malicious URL with a `next` parameter pointing to an external website. When an admin user performs a change or add action and is redirected, they could be redirected to the attacker's site, potentially leading to phishing or other attacks.
    1. Attacker crafts a malicious URL to the admin change/add form with a `next` parameter pointing to an attacker-controlled website (e.g., `https://malicious.example.com`).
    2. Attacker sends this malicious URL to an authenticated admin user or tricks them into accessing it (e.g., via phishing email or social engineering).
    3. Admin user, while logged into the admin panel, clicks on the malicious link and accesses the admin change/add form with the `next` parameter.
    4. Admin user submits the change/add form.
    5. The application, upon successful change/add action, redirects the admin user to the URL specified in the `next` parameter, which is the attacker-controlled website `https://malicious.example.com`.

* Impact:
    High. An attacker can redirect admin users to a malicious website after they perform an action in the admin panel. This can be used for phishing attacks, where the attacker can trick admin users into entering their credentials or other sensitive information on a fake login page or similar, or to perform other malicious actions on behalf of the admin user if the attacker-controlled site is designed to do so.

* Vulnerability Rank: high

* Currently implemented mitigations:
    None. The code directly redirects to the `next` parameter without any validation.

* Missing mitigations:
    Input validation and sanitization for the `next` parameter. The application should validate that the `next` URL is a safe URL, such as a URL on the same domain or a predefined trusted domain list. A safer approach would be to remove the redirection to the `next` parameter altogether if it's not a critical feature, or use Django's `is_safe_url` to validate the target URL.

* Preconditions:
    1. The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL to the Django admin change/add form.
    2. An authenticated admin user needs to be logged into the Django admin panel.
    3. The admin user needs to be tricked into accessing the crafted malicious URL and submitting a change/add form.

* Source code analysis:
    File: `/code/src/unfold/admin.py`
    ```python
        def response_change(self, request: HttpRequest, obj: Model) -> HttpResponse:
            res = super().response_change(request, obj)
            if "next" in request.GET:
                return redirect(request.GET["next"]) # Vulnerability: Open redirect
            return res

        def response_add(
            self, request: HttpRequest, obj: Model, post_url_continue: Optional[str] = None
        ) -> HttpResponse:
            res = super().response_add(request, obj, post_url_continue)
            if "next" in request.GET:
                return redirect(request.GET["next"]) # Vulnerability: Open redirect
            return res
    ```
    The `response_change` and `response_add` methods in `ModelAdmin` class directly use `redirect(request.GET["next"])` without any validation. This allows an attacker to control the redirection target by providing a `next` parameter in the GET request, leading to an open redirect vulnerability.

* Security test case:
    1.  Access the Django admin login page and log in as an administrator.
    2.  Navigate to the change list page of any model (e.g., Users - `/admin/example/user/`).
    3.  Click on the "Add User" button to access the add form (e.g., `/admin/example/user/add/`).
    4.  In the browser's address bar, append the following parameter to the URL: `?next=https://malicious.example.com`. The URL should now look similar to: `/admin/example/user/add/?next=https://malicious.example.com`.
    5.  Fill out the required fields in the "Add user" form (e.g., Username, Password, etc.).
    6.  Click the "Save" button.
    7.  Observe that instead of being redirected to the user change list page or the newly created user's change form, you are redirected to `https://malicious.example.com`.

This test case confirms the open redirect vulnerability.
