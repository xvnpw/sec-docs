# Threat Model Analysis for gradio-app/gradio

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Text Input](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_text_input.md)

*   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Text Input
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a Gradio text input component (e.g., `gr.Textbox`). When another user interacts with this input within the Gradio interface, the injected script executes in their browser. This is due to insufficient sanitization of user-provided text by Gradio.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover of other users interacting with the interface, theft of session tokens or cookies, redirection to malicious sites, or defacement of the Gradio interface for other users.
    *   **Affected Gradio Component:** `gr.Textbox`, potentially other text-based input components like `gr.TextArea`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure Gradio's built-in sanitization features are enabled and functioning correctly for all text-based input components.
        *   Implement robust output encoding on the frontend to prevent the execution of injected scripts.
        *   Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.

## Threat: [Malicious File Upload and Unsafe Processing (Gradio's Role in Entry Point)](./threats/malicious_file_upload_and_unsafe_processing__gradio's_role_in_entry_point_.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious File Upload and Unsafe Processing (Gradio's Role in Entry Point)
    *   **Description:** An attacker uploads a malicious file through a Gradio file upload component (`gr.File`, `gr.Image`, `gr.Audio`). While the primary vulnerability lies in the backend processing, Gradio provides the direct mechanism for this potentially malicious input to reach the server. If Gradio doesn't have adequate safeguards (e.g., file type validation), it facilitates this attack vector.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the server if the backend unsafely processes the file, access to sensitive files or data on the server, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Gradio Component:** `gr.File`, `gr.Image`, `gr.Audio` (any component allowing file uploads).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict file type validation within Gradio's configuration for file upload components.
        *   Ensure the backend processing of uploaded files is done securely (as outlined in the previous full threat list).
        *   Limit the size and number of uploaded files through Gradio's configuration.

## Threat: [Deserialization of Untrusted Data in Complex Inputs (Gradio's Role in Data Transfer)](./threats/deserialization_of_untrusted_data_in_complex_inputs__gradio's_role_in_data_transfer_.md)

*   **Threat:** Deserialization of Untrusted Data in Complex Inputs (Gradio's Role in Data Transfer)
    *   **Description:** Gradio handles complex data types (e.g., images, audio) which might involve serialization/deserialization for transfer between the frontend and backend. If Gradio itself doesn't properly sanitize or validate these serialized objects, or if it uses insecure deserialization methods internally, it could be vulnerable. More commonly, Gradio facilitates the transfer of this data to the backend, where the unsafe deserialization occurs.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the server if Gradio or the backend unsafely deserializes malicious data.
    *   **Affected Gradio Component:** Components handling complex data types like `gr.File`, `gr.Image`, `gr.Audio`, and potentially the internal mechanisms Gradio uses for data serialization/deserialization.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure Gradio uses secure serialization/deserialization methods internally.
        *   Implement validation of complex input data on the backend after it's received from Gradio.
        *   Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources if possible.

## Threat: [Unintended Public Exposure via Sharing Features](./threats/unintended_public_exposure_via_sharing_features.md)

*   **Threat:** Unintended Public Exposure via Sharing Features
    *   **Description:** Developers unintentionally or unknowingly share a Gradio interface publicly using the built-in sharing features (e.g., `share=True`). This is a direct feature of Gradio that, if misused, can expose the application's functionality and potentially sensitive data to the entire internet without any access controls enforced by Gradio itself.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data processed by the application, abuse of application resources by unauthorized individuals, potential exploitation of other vulnerabilities by a wider audience.
    *   **Affected Gradio Component:** The sharing functionality of `gr.Interface` or `app.launch(share=True)`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Exercise extreme caution when using the `share=True` option.
        *   Thoroughly understand the implications of making the interface public.
        *   Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms in the backend Python function to control access, even if the interface is publicly shared via Gradio's feature.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities within Gradio](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_within_gradio.md)

*   **Threat:** Dependency Vulnerabilities within Gradio
    *   **Description:** Gradio relies on various third-party Python packages. If these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, they can be exploited through the Gradio application. This is a direct risk introduced by the dependencies that Gradio incorporates.
    *   **Impact:**  Depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency, but could range from information disclosure and denial of service to remote code execution.
    *   **Affected Gradio Component:** The Gradio library itself and its direct and transitive dependencies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability (can be Critical or High).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Gradio updated to the latest version, as updates often include fixes for dependency vulnerabilities.
        *   Regularly scan Gradio's dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `pip check` or dedicated software composition analysis (SCA) tools.
        *   Consider using a dependency management tool that provides vulnerability alerts.
        *   Pin dependency versions in `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` to ensure consistent and tested versions are used, and carefully review updates before applying them.
