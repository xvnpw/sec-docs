## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Gradio's Input Handling (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_gradio's_input_handling__high-risk_path_.md)

- Code Injection via Input Components (Critical Node):
    - OS Command Injection (Critical Node): An attacker crafts input that, when processed by the Gradio application, leads to the execution of arbitrary operating system commands on the server. This often occurs when user-supplied data is directly used in functions like `subprocess.run` without proper sanitization.
    - Python Code Injection (Critical Node): An attacker provides input that is directly evaluated or executed as Python code by the Gradio application's backend. This is a severe vulnerability, often arising from the use of functions like `eval()` or `exec()` on untrusted input.
- Deserialization Vulnerabilities (if Gradio app uses pickle or similar for input) (High-Risk Path):
    - Provide a Maliciously Crafted Serialized Object to a Gradio Component (Critical Node): If the Gradio application uses insecure deserialization libraries like `pickle` to process user input, an attacker can craft a malicious serialized object. When this object is deserialized, it can execute arbitrary code on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Gradio's Server-Side Logic (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_gradio's_server-side_logic__high-risk_path_.md)

- Abuse of Gradio's Built-in Features:
    - Exploiting Gradio's API Endpoints (Critical Node):
        - Send Malicious Requests to Internal Gradio API Endpoints (if exposed or predictable) (Critical Node): Attackers may attempt to send crafted requests to internal API endpoints of the Gradio application. If these endpoints are not properly secured or their structure is predictable, attackers can trigger unintended actions or gain access to sensitive data.
        - Bypass Authentication/Authorization on Gradio API Endpoints (Critical Node): Attackers may try to circumvent the authentication or authorization mechanisms protecting Gradio's API endpoints. Successful bypass can grant unauthorized access to functionalities and data.
- Exploiting Dependencies of Gradio (High-Risk Path):
    - Target Known Vulnerabilities in Libraries Used by Gradio (e.g., Starlette, Uvicorn) (Critical Node): Gradio relies on various third-party libraries. Attackers can exploit known security vulnerabilities in these dependencies to compromise the Gradio application. This often involves using publicly available exploits.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Gradio's Sharing and Access Control Mechanisms (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_gradio's_sharing_and_access_control_mechanisms__high-risk_path_.md)

- Token Theft or Manipulation (Critical Node):
    - Steal or Guess Authentication Tokens Used by Gradio's Sharing Feature (Critical Node): Attackers might attempt to steal authentication tokens used for Gradio's sharing feature through various means (e.g., network sniffing, cross-site scripting) or try to guess valid tokens if they are not generated securely.
    - Manipulate Tokens to Gain Unauthorized Access (Critical Node): If the structure or signing of authentication tokens is flawed, attackers might be able to manipulate them to gain unauthorized access or elevated privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Gradio's File Handling (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_gradio's_file_handling__high-risk_path_.md)

- Arbitrary File Read (Critical Node):
    - Manipulate Gradio's file handling to read arbitrary files on the server (e.g., through file paths in inputs or outputs) (Critical Node): Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in how the Gradio application handles file paths to access files outside of the intended directories. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, such as configuration files or source code.
- Arbitrary File Write (Potentially leading to Remote Code Execution) (Critical Node):
    - Exploit Gradio's file saving or temporary file creation to write malicious files to the server (Critical Node): Attackers can leverage flaws in the application's file saving mechanisms to write arbitrary files to the server's file system. This is a critical vulnerability because attackers can write executable files (e.g., web shells) and gain remote code execution.
