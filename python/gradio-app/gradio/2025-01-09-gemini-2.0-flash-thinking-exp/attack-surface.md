# Attack Surface Analysis for gradio-app/gradio

## Attack Surface: [Code Injection via Backend Functions](./attack_surfaces/code_injection_via_backend_functions.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code into input fields that gets executed on the server-side by the Python backend function connected to the Gradio interface.
*   **How Gradio Contributes:** Gradio allows developers to connect arbitrary Python functions to UI components. If input from these components is not sanitized and is used in a way that allows code execution (e.g., using `eval()`, `exec()`, or constructing shell commands), it creates a vulnerability.
*   **Example:** A text input field connected to a function that uses `eval(user_input)` to process mathematical expressions. An attacker could input `os.system('rm -rf /')` to execute a dangerous command on the server.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the server, data breach, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never use `eval()` or `exec()` with user-provided input.**
    *   **Sanitize and validate all user input thoroughly.** Use libraries designed for specific input types (e.g., `shlex.quote` for shell commands).
    *   **Employ parameterized queries for database interactions.**
    *   **Principle of least privilege:** Run the Gradio application with minimal necessary permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Output Components](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_output_components.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into input fields that are then displayed in the Gradio output components, executing in other users' browsers.
*   **How Gradio Contributes:** Gradio components can render HTML content. If the backend doesn't properly sanitize data before sending it to these components, malicious scripts can be injected.
*   **Example:** A text-to-HTML Gradio application where an attacker inputs `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`. This script will execute in the browsers of other users viewing this output.
*   **Impact:** Stealing user credentials, session hijacking, defacement of the application, redirecting users to malicious sites.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Sanitize all output rendered by Gradio components.** Use libraries like `bleach` in Python to remove or escape potentially harmful HTML tags and attributes.
    *   **Set the `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP) HTTP header** to control the resources the browser is allowed to load, mitigating the impact of injected scripts.
    *   **Use output components that automatically escape HTML by default** where possible.

## Attack Surface: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Custom Components or API Mode](./attack_surfaces/remote_code_execution__rce__via_custom_components_or_api_mode.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in custom Gradio components or the API endpoints to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **How Gradio Contributes:** Gradio allows developers to create custom components with complex logic and exposes API endpoints for programmatic interaction. If these are not implemented securely, they can be exploited.
*   **Example:** A custom component that processes uploaded files and uses a vulnerable library to parse them, allowing an attacker to upload a malicious file that triggers code execution. Or, an API endpoint that doesn't properly validate input, leading to command injection.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the server, data breach, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Thoroughly review and audit the code of custom components.** Pay close attention to how user input is handled and external libraries are used.
    *   **Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all API endpoints.**
    *   **Follow secure coding practices when developing custom components and API interactions.**
    *   **Keep all dependencies up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.**

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Resource Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__through_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers send a large number of requests or craft specific requests that consume excessive server resources, making the application unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **How Gradio Contributes:** Gradio applications can be vulnerable if the backend functions are computationally expensive or if there are no rate limits on user interactions. Large file uploads or complex processing triggered by user input can be exploited.
*   **Example:** An attacker repeatedly uploading very large files to a Gradio interface, overwhelming the server's storage or processing capacity. Or, sending numerous requests to a computationally intensive model inference function.
*   **Impact:** Application unavailability, service disruption, potential infrastructure costs due to resource usage.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement rate limiting on API endpoints and UI interactions.**
    *   **Set appropriate resource limits (e.g., file size limits, request timeouts).**
    *   **Optimize backend functions for performance.**
    *   **Use asynchronous task queues (like Celery) to handle long-running tasks.**
    *   **Deploy behind a load balancer with DDoS protection.**
