# Threat Model Analysis for gradio-app/gradio

## Threat: [Arbitrary Code Execution](./threats/arbitrary_code_execution.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious code through a Gradio interface element (e.g., a textbox) that is then directly executed by the backend Python code without proper sanitization. This could happen if the Gradio application uses functions like `exec` or `eval` on user-provided input *received through a Gradio component*. The attacker might craft input that, when processed *by the Gradio application's backend*, executes arbitrary Python commands on the server.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the server. The attacker could gain full control of the system, steal sensitive data, install malware, or disrupt services.

**Affected Gradio Component:** Input components (e.g., `Textbox`, `Code`), and the way Gradio passes input to the backend Python functions.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Avoid using `exec` or `eval` on user-provided input received through Gradio components.** If absolutely necessary, use extremely restricted and sandboxed environments.
*   **Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the backend Python code *that processes input from Gradio*.** Use allowlists and type checking to ensure input conforms to expected formats.
*   **Treat all user input *received via Gradio* as untrusted.

## Threat: [Command Injection](./threats/command_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious operating system commands through a Gradio interface element if the backend Python code uses functions like `subprocess.run` or `os.system` with unsanitized user input *received from a Gradio component*. The attacker might craft input that, when passed to these functions, executes arbitrary commands on the server's operating system.

**Impact:**  Significant compromise of the server. The attacker could execute system commands to access files, modify configurations, or even take over the server.

**Affected Gradio Component:** Input components (e.g., `Textbox`, `Dropdown`), and the way Gradio facilitates the transmission of user input to backend functions interacting with the operating system.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Avoid using `subprocess.run` or `os.system` with user-provided input *originating from Gradio components*.** If necessary, carefully sanitize and validate the input.
*   **Use parameterized commands or safer alternatives to execute system commands.**
*   **Run the Gradio application with the least necessary privileges.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion](./threats/resource_exhaustion.md)

**Description:** An attacker could provide specially crafted input through a Gradio interface that causes the backend Python code to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, disk space), leading to a denial of service. For example, uploading extremely large files *through Gradio's file input* or providing input *via a Gradio component* that triggers computationally expensive operations.

**Impact:**  The Gradio application becomes unavailable to legitimate users. The server might become unresponsive or crash.

**Affected Gradio Component:** Input components that handle data uploads or trigger backend processing (e.g., `File`, `Image`, `Textbox`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Implement input size limits and validation *within the Gradio application's backend*.**
*   **Implement rate limiting *on requests to the Gradio application*.**
*   **Use asynchronous processing for long-running tasks *triggered by Gradio interactions* to avoid blocking the main thread.**
*   **Monitor server resource usage and set up alerts.

## Threat: [Path Traversal (File Upload/Download)](./threats/path_traversal__file_uploaddownload_.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate file paths provided through Gradio's file upload or download components to access or modify files outside of the intended directories. For example, using ".." in a filename *submitted through Gradio's file input*.

**Impact:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive files on the server, potential data breaches, or modification of critical system files.

**Affected Gradio Component:** `File` input and output components.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Sanitize and validate all file paths provided by users *through Gradio's file components*.**
*   **Use absolute paths or canonicalize paths to prevent traversal.**
*   **Store uploaded files *received via Gradio* in a secure location with restricted access.**
*   **Avoid directly using user-provided filenames *from Gradio* for storage.

## Threat: [Malicious File Upload](./threats/malicious_file_upload.md)

**Description:** An attacker could upload malicious files (e.g., malware, viruses) through Gradio's file upload component. While Gradio itself doesn't execute these files, the backend Python code or other systems might process them, leading to infection or compromise.

**Impact:**  Introduction of malware into the server environment or connected systems. Potential data breaches, system instability, or further attacks.

**Affected Gradio Component:** `File` input component.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Implement antivirus scanning on files uploaded *through Gradio*.**
*   **Restrict the types of files that can be uploaded *via Gradio*.**
*   **Store uploaded files *received through Gradio* in an isolated and secure location with restricted access.**
*   **Avoid directly executing or processing uploaded files without thorough security checks.

## Threat: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./threats/deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** If the Gradio application uses Python's serialization libraries (like `pickle`) to handle user-provided data *received through a Gradio component* without proper safeguards, an attacker could craft malicious serialized objects that, when deserialized, execute arbitrary code or cause other harm.

**Impact:**  Potential for arbitrary code execution on the server.

**Affected Gradio Component:** Backend Python code handling data serialization and deserialization, interacting with Gradio input/output components.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Avoid using `pickle` or other insecure deserialization methods on untrusted data *received from Gradio*.**
*   **If deserialization is necessary, use safer alternatives like JSON or implement robust integrity checks.
