## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Gradio Interface Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_gradio_interface_vulnerabilities.md)

This path focuses on leveraging weaknesses in how the Gradio interface handles user input and renders output.
    * **Inject Malicious Input via Gradio Components:** **
        * This critical node represents the act of providing crafted input to Gradio components that is then processed by the backend in an insecure manner.
            * **Exploit Text/Number Inputs:** **
                * Attack Vector: Injecting code snippets (e.g., Python code) into text or number input fields that are then interpreted and executed by the backend, often due to the use of functions like `eval` or similar insecure practices.
            * **Exploit File Upload Components:** **
                * Attack Vector: Uploading malicious files (e.g., scripts, executables, web shells) through Gradio's file upload components. These files are then processed or stored by the backend, potentially leading to code execution or system compromise.
    * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Gradio Output:** **
        * This critical node involves injecting malicious scripts into Gradio outputs that are then rendered in another user's browser.
            * Attack Vector:  Providing input that is not properly sanitized by the backend and is subsequently displayed by Gradio in a way that allows the execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, or further malicious actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Gradio Backend Logic and Integration](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_gradio_backend_logic_and_integration.md)

This path targets vulnerabilities in how the Gradio interface interacts with the underlying backend logic and the machine learning model.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS) via Model Overload:** **
        * This critical node involves overwhelming the backend resources by sending inputs that require excessive computation from the machine learning model.
            * Attack Vector: Crafting specific inputs that force the model to perform complex calculations or consume significant memory, leading to a slowdown or crash of the application.
    * **Exploit Code Execution Vulnerabilities in Backend:** **
        * This critical node represents the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the Gradio application.
            * **Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Gradio Input Processing:** **
                * Attack Vector: Injecting code directly into Gradio inputs that, due to insecure backend processing, is executed on the server. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in libraries used by the backend or flaws in how user input is handled.
            * **Command Injection via Gradio Input:** **
                * Attack Vector: Injecting operating system commands into Gradio inputs that are then executed by the backend application. This often occurs when the application uses user-provided input to construct system commands without proper sanitization.
    * **Exploit Data Handling Vulnerabilities:** **
        * This critical node focuses on weaknesses in how the application handles and exposes data through the Gradio interface.
            * **Data Exfiltration via Gradio Outputs:** **
                * Attack Vector: Manipulating inputs to trick the application into revealing sensitive data through the Gradio output. This could involve exploiting flaws in access controls or data filtering mechanisms.
