# Attack Surface Analysis for gradio-app/gradio

## Attack Surface: [1. Input Validation Bypass (Gradio Component Level)](./attack_surfaces/1__input_validation_bypass__gradio_component_level_.md)

*   **Description:**  Circumventing Gradio's built-in or developer-implemented input validation checks on Gradio input components to inject malicious data.
*   **Gradio Contribution:** Gradio provides various input components (Textbox, Image, Audio, etc.). While Gradio *attempts* some basic validation, the primary responsibility for robust validation lies with the developer *within the Gradio application logic*. The ease of use can lead to insufficient validation.
*   **Example:**  An Image component accepts a file.  A developer might only check the file extension (e.g., `.jpg`), but an attacker could upload a PHP file renamed to `.jpg`.  A Textbox might accept excessively long input.
*   **Impact:**  Code execution, data corruption, denial of service, data breaches (depending on the underlying model and application).
*   **Risk Severity:**  Critical to High (context-dependent).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Implement *strict* server-side input validation *within the Gradio `fn`*. Use allowlists. Validate data types, lengths, formats, and ranges. Sanitize input *before* passing it to the model. Use Gradio's built-in validation features (e.g., `Textbox(lines=...)`), but *do not rely solely on them*. For file uploads: validate types robustly (not just extensions), store files outside the web root, and scan for malware.

## Attack Surface: [2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Output (Gradio Rendering)](./attack_surfaces/2__cross-site_scripting__xss__via_output__gradio_rendering_.md)

*   **Description:**  Injecting malicious JavaScript into the Gradio interface through the model's output, which Gradio then renders.
*   **Gradio Contribution:** Gradio is responsible for rendering the model's output. If this output contains unescaped HTML or JavaScript, and Gradio fails to sanitize it, an XSS vulnerability exists. While Gradio *aims* for secure rendering, custom components or direct output manipulation can bypass these.
*   **Example:**  A model generates text that includes a `<script>` tag with malicious JavaScript. If Gradio renders this directly, the script executes.
*   **Impact:**  Theft of cookies, session hijacking, defacement, redirection to malicious sites, keylogging.
*   **Risk Severity:**  High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**  Ensure *all* output is properly escaped. Rely on Gradio's built-in output components (e.g., `Textbox`, `Label`, `HTML`) as they are designed for secure rendering. If handling raw HTML, use a robust HTML sanitization library *before* rendering. Avoid direct DOM manipulation with user data.

## Attack Surface: [3. Unintended Data Exposure via Shared Links (`share=True`)](./attack_surfaces/3__unintended_data_exposure_via_shared_links___share=true__.md)

*   **Description:**  Exposing sensitive data through publicly accessible Gradio shared links.
*   **Gradio Contribution:**  The `share=True` option in Gradio creates a public URL, bypassing local server authentication. This is a *direct* Gradio feature that introduces the risk.
*   **Example:**  Sharing a link to a model that processes PII, unaware that the link is publicly accessible.
*   **Impact:**  Data breaches, privacy violations, compliance issues.
*   **Risk Severity:**  Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**  *Avoid* `share=True` for sensitive data. Use controlled deployment methods (e.g., cloud platforms with access controls). Clearly inform users about the public nature of the link *before* sharing. Consider link revocation mechanisms.
    *   **User:**  Be *extremely* cautious with `share=True` links. Understand they are public. Do not share links to applications handling sensitive data.

## Attack Surface: [4. Malicious File Uploads (Gradio `File` Component)](./attack_surfaces/4__malicious_file_uploads__gradio__file__component_.md)

*   **Description:** Uploading malicious files that can be executed on the server.
*   **Gradio Contribution:** Gradio's `File` component directly enables file uploads, creating this attack vector.
*   **Example:** Uploading a PHP webshell disguised as a JPG image.
*   **Impact:** Server compromise, data breaches, malware distribution.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Validate file types *both* client-side (Gradio's `file_types` parameter) and *strictly* server-side (using a robust file type detection library â€“ *never* rely solely on extensions). Store files *outside* the web root/in separate storage. Scan for malware. Limit file sizes. Rename files to prevent directory traversal.
