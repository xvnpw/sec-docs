## Attack Tree Path: [1. Input Manipulation [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__input_manipulation__high_risk_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This is the primary attack surface. Attackers exploit weaknesses in how the application handles user-provided input.
*   **Unexpected Input to Components:**
    *   **Type Juggling:**
        *   *Description:* Exploiting how the underlying programming language (likely Python) handles type conversions between different data types (e.g., integer to string, string to list).  An attacker might try to send a string when a number is expected, or vice-versa, to cause unexpected behavior or errors.
        *   *Example:* If a Gradio component expects an integer for an image width, sending a very long string or a specially crafted string might cause a crash or reveal internal error messages.
    *   **Fuzzing Components:**
        *   *Description:* Sending random, malformed, or unexpected data to Gradio components to identify vulnerabilities.  This is an automated process using fuzzing tools.
        *   *Example:* A fuzzer might send various combinations of characters, special symbols, and large inputs to a text input component to see if it crashes or reveals sensitive information.
    *   **Large Input (DoS) [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   *Description:* Sending extremely large inputs to overwhelm the application or server, causing a denial-of-service.
        *   *Example:* Uploading a multi-gigabyte file to a file upload component, or sending a very long string to a text input, exceeding server resource limits.
*   **File Upload Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]:**
    *   **Overall Description:** If the application allows file uploads, this is a very high-risk area.
    *   **Path Traversal:**
        *   *Description:* Uploading a file with a manipulated filename that includes directory traversal characters (e.g., `../`). The goal is to write the file to an arbitrary location on the server, outside the intended upload directory.
        *   *Example:* Uploading a file named `../../etc/passwd` to try to overwrite a system file.
    *   **Arbitrary File Write/Read:**
        *   *Description:* Exploiting vulnerabilities in the file handling logic to write or read arbitrary files on the server, even without path traversal. This might involve manipulating file extensions, content types, or other parameters.
        *   *Example:* If the application uses user-provided input to construct the file path without proper sanitization, an attacker might be able to specify any file on the system.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Component Misuse/Abuse](./attack_tree_paths/2__component_misuseabuse.md)

*   **Custom JS/CSS Injection:**
    *   **XSS via Custom JS [CRITICAL]:**
        *   *Description:* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a vulnerability where an attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a web page viewed by other users.  If Gradio's custom JS functionality is used to display user-provided data without proper escaping, an attacker can inject scripts.
        *   *Example:* If a user enters `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` into a text input, and that input is later used in custom JS without sanitization, the script will execute in the browser of any user who views the page.
    *   **CSRF via Custom Events [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   *Description:* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack where a malicious website, email, or program causes a user's web browser to perform an unwanted action on a trusted site when the user is authenticated. If Gradio custom events are not properly authenticated, an attacker can trigger actions on behalf of a logged-in user.
        *   *Example:* An attacker could create a malicious website that, when visited by a logged-in Gradio user, sends a request to the Gradio application to perform a sensitive action (e.g., change settings, delete data) without the user's knowledge.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/3__dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Downstream (App Logic) [CRITICAL] [HIGH RISK]:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities introduced by how Gradio is used in the app:**
        *   *Description:* This is the most critical and high-risk area. It encompasses all the ways a developer might misuse Gradio features, leading to vulnerabilities. This includes all the previously mentioned issues (poor input validation, insecure file handling, XSS, CSRF) *as implemented by the developer*. It's not a specific vulnerability in Gradio itself, but rather vulnerabilities *created* by how Gradio is used.
        *   *Examples:*
            *   Failing to validate input before passing it to a Gradio component.
            *   Using user-provided filenames directly without sanitization.
            *   Reflecting user input in custom JS without escaping.
            *   Not authenticating custom events.
            *   Using shared state without proper synchronization.
            *   Any other insecure coding practice related to the use of Gradio.
