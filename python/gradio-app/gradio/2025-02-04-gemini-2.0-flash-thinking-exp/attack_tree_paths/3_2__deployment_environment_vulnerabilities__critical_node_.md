*   **Attack Scenarios:**
    *   **Kernel Exploits:** An attacker could exploit a known vulnerability in the OS kernel to gain root/administrator privileges on the server. This could allow them to take complete control of the server, including accessing sensitive data, modifying the Gradio application, or launching further attacks.
    *   **Service Exploits:** Vulnerable system services (e.g., SSH, systemd, cron) running with elevated privileges could be exploited to gain unauthorized access or execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker who has gained initial access (e.g., through a web application vulnerability) could exploit OS vulnerabilities to escalate their privileges and gain broader control.
*   **Impact Assessment:** **CRITICAL**.  Successful exploitation can lead to complete system compromise, data breaches, service disruption, and significant reputational damage.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Patching:** Implement a robust patch management process to promptly apply security updates for the operating system and all system services.
    *   **Minimize Attack Surface:** Disable unnecessary services and features on the OS.
