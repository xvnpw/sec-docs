# Attack Surface Analysis for gradio-app/gradio

## Attack Surface: [Unsafe Deserialization of Input Data](./attack_surfaces/unsafe_deserialization_of_input_data.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from improperly handling deserialization of data received from Gradio input components.

**Gradio Contribution:** Gradio components accept various data types, which might be deserialized on the backend. If custom components or integrations are used, or if default deserialization is not handled securely within the Gradio application's backend logic, it can introduce vulnerabilities.

**Example:** A Gradio application uses a custom component that receives serialized Python objects. If the backend directly deserializes this object using `pickle.loads()` without proper validation within the Gradio application's function, an attacker could send a malicious serialized object to execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), data corruption, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid deserializing untrusted data received from Gradio components whenever possible.
* If deserialization is necessary for Gradio inputs, use secure deserialization methods and libraries within the backend function processing Gradio inputs.
* Implement strict input validation *before* deserialization within the Gradio application's backend to ensure data conforms to expected formats and types.
* Use data serialization formats that are less prone to vulnerabilities, like JSON, when possible for data exchange with Gradio components.

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side Input Validation Bypass leading to Backend Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/client-side_input_validation_bypass_leading_to_backend_exploitation.md)

**Description:** Attackers bypassing client-side validation provided by Gradio components and exploiting vulnerabilities in backend input handling within the Gradio application.

**Gradio Contribution:** Gradio provides client-side validation for input components, which can create a false sense of security if developers solely rely on it and neglect robust backend validation in their Gradio application's backend logic.

**Example:** A Gradio text input component has client-side validation to limit input length. An attacker bypasses this check by directly sending a longer string in the HTTP request to the Gradio application. If the backend function connected to Gradio is not prepared to handle inputs exceeding the expected length (e.g., buffer overflows, database injection due to truncation issues), vulnerabilities can be exploited.

**Impact:** Various impacts depending on the backend vulnerability within the Gradio application, including data injection, denial of service, application crashes.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Always implement robust backend validation within the Gradio application's backend functions.** Client-side validation in Gradio is for user experience, not security.
* Validate all inputs received from Gradio components on the server-side, regardless of client-side checks.
* Use server-side validation libraries and frameworks within the Gradio application's backend to ensure proper input sanitization and validation.

## Attack Surface: [Injection Attacks via Input Components](./attack_surfaces/injection_attacks_via_input_components.md)

**Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities by injecting malicious code or commands through Gradio input fields that are not properly sanitized before being processed by the backend functions connected to Gradio.

**Gradio Contribution:** Gradio components are designed to take user input and pass it to backend functions. If developers directly use this input in system commands, code execution contexts, or database queries within their Gradio application's backend without sanitization, injection vulnerabilities are introduced via the Gradio interface.

**Example:** A Gradio application takes user input for a filename and uses it in a shell command to process the file within the backend function. An attacker inputs `; rm -rf /` as the filename through the Gradio input. If not sanitized in the backend function, this could lead to command injection and potentially delete critical system files.

**Impact:** Command Injection, Code Injection, Prompt Injection, SQL Injection, NoSQL Injection, etc., leading to data breaches, system compromise, denial of service, or unauthorized actions, all triggered via Gradio inputs.

**Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the type of injection and impact)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Input Sanitization and Encoding:** Sanitize all user inputs from Gradio components before using them in commands, code, or queries within the backend functions. Use appropriate encoding functions for the target context (e.g., shell escaping, SQL parameterization).
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Avoid running backend processes connected to Gradio with elevated privileges.
* **Use Parameterized Queries or ORM:** For database interactions within Gradio backend functions, use parameterized queries or Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs) to prevent SQL injection.
* **Avoid Dynamic Code Execution (eval, exec):** Minimize or eliminate the use of dynamic code execution functions like `eval()` or `exec()` with user-provided input from Gradio components in the backend.
* **For LLM Applications (Prompt Injection):** Implement prompt engineering techniques, input validation, and output filtering within the Gradio application to mitigate prompt injection risks originating from Gradio text inputs. Consider using techniques like input sanitization, output validation, and rate limiting for Gradio inputs to LLM functions.

## Attack Surface: [File Upload Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/file_upload_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Security risks associated with allowing users to upload files through Gradio's `File` or `Image` components.

**Gradio Contribution:** Gradio provides easy-to-use file upload components, making it straightforward to incorporate file upload functionality into applications, but also directly introducing potential vulnerabilities if file uploads are not handled securely in the Gradio application's backend.

**Example:** A Gradio application allows users to upload images using the `Image` component. Without proper validation in the backend, an attacker uploads a malicious executable disguised as an image file through Gradio. If the server attempts to process this file without proper type checking or stores it in an accessible location after being uploaded via Gradio, it could lead to malware execution or other attacks.

**Impact:** Malware Upload, Path Traversal, Denial of Service, Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), Information Disclosure, all initiated through Gradio file upload features.

**Risk Severity:** High to Medium (depending on the specific vulnerability and impact - High for malware upload and RCE scenarios)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **File Type Validation (Whitelist):** Validate file types uploaded via Gradio components on both client-side and server-side, using a whitelist approach (allow only specific, expected file types).
* **File Size Limits:** Enforce reasonable file size limits for file uploads through Gradio to prevent DoS attacks via large file uploads.
* **Secure File Storage:** Store uploaded files from Gradio components in a secure location outside the web server's document root, with restricted access permissions. Consider using dedicated cloud storage services for files uploaded via Gradio.
* **Filename Sanitization:** Sanitize filenames of files uploaded via Gradio to prevent path traversal attacks. Remove or replace potentially harmful characters.
* **Content Security Scanning:** Implement malware scanning for files uploaded via Gradio components before processing or storing them.
* **Secure File Processing:** If processing uploaded files from Gradio components, use secure libraries and be aware of potential vulnerabilities in those libraries (e.g., SSRF in image processing libraries) when handling Gradio file uploads.
