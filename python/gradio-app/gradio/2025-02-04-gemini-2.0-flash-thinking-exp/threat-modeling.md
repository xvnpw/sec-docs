# Threat Model Analysis for gradio-app/gradio

## Threat: [Unsafe Deserialization of Input Data](./threats/unsafe_deserialization_of_input_data.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides maliciously crafted serialized data as input to the Gradio application. Gradio, or the underlying Python code, deserializes this data without proper validation. This could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server, data corruption, or denial of service. This threat is directly related to how Gradio handles input components and potentially custom components that process complex data.
*   **Impact:** Critical. Full server compromise, data breach, application downtime.
*   **Gradio Component Affected:** Input components that handle complex data types, custom components, backend function input processing, Gradio's data handling mechanisms.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid deserializing data directly from user input if possible within Gradio applications.
    *   If deserialization is necessary, use secure deserialization libraries and methods within the backend code called by Gradio.
    *   Implement strict input validation *before* data is processed by Gradio or the backend function.
    *   Sanitize and validate input data types and formats as they are received by Gradio components.
    *   Regularly audit and update dependencies used by Gradio and the backend to patch deserialization vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Command Injection via User Inputs](./threats/command_injection_via_user_inputs.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts input that, when processed by the Gradio application's backend function, leads to the execution of arbitrary shell commands on the server. This is possible if user input, passed through Gradio components to the backend, is directly incorporated into shell commands without proper sanitization in the backend function. While not a vulnerability *in* Gradio itself, it's a common mistake in Gradio applications due to the ease of passing user input to backend Python code.
*   **Impact:** Critical. Full server compromise, data breach, application downtime.
*   **Gradio Component Affected:** Backend function execution, interaction between Gradio input components and backend code, Gradio's mechanism for passing input data.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Never directly incorporate user-provided input (received from Gradio components) into shell commands in the backend function.
    *   Use parameterized commands or secure libraries like `subprocess` with careful argument handling in the backend.
    *   Sanitize and validate user inputs rigorously in the backend function *after* they are received from Gradio, before using them in any system calls.
    *   Implement principle of least privilege for the application's execution environment where Gradio application runs.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities Exploitation](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits known vulnerabilities in Gradio's dependencies (e.g., Flask, Starlette, Jinja2, etc.). This could be achieved by sending specific requests that target these vulnerabilities within the Gradio application's environment. This is a threat directly impacting Gradio applications because they rely on these dependencies.
*   **Impact:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability). Code execution, information disclosure, denial of service affecting the Gradio application.
*   **Gradio Component Affected:** Gradio core library, underlying web server (Flask/Starlette), templating engine (Jinja2), other dependencies bundled with or required by Gradio.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Gradio and all its dependencies to the latest versions. Gradio updates often include dependency updates.
    *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify and address known vulnerabilities in the Gradio application's dependency tree.
    *   Monitor security advisories specifically for Gradio and its core dependencies.
    *   Implement a robust dependency management process for Gradio applications, ensuring consistent and updated dependencies.

## Threat: [Sensitive Information Disclosure via UI Output](./threats/sensitive_information_disclosure_via_ui_output.md)

*   **Description:** The Gradio application's backend function or error handling logic inadvertently outputs sensitive information (e.g., API keys, internal paths, database credentials, model details) in the user interface (UI) or error messages. An attacker can view this information directly through the Gradio UI. This is a threat within the context of Gradio because the UI is the primary way to interact with the application and view outputs.
*   **Impact:** High. Exposure of sensitive data, potential for further attacks based on disclosed information, reputation damage.
*   **Gradio Component Affected:** Backend function output, error handling within Gradio application, UI rendering by Gradio, Gradio's output components.
*   **Risk Severity:** Medium to High (depending on the sensitivity of disclosed information).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully review backend function outputs and error messages to ensure no sensitive data is exposed through the Gradio UI.
    *   Implement proper error handling within the Gradio application to prevent the display of detailed error messages that might reveal internal information to users through the UI.
    *   Sanitize or redact sensitive information from outputs in the backend function *before* returning them to Gradio for display in the UI.
    *   Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in the application code; use environment variables or secure configuration management external to the Gradio application code itself.

## Threat: [Unintended Public Exposure via Gradio Sharing Links](./threats/unintended_public_exposure_via_gradio_sharing_links.md)

*   **Description:** A developer unintentionally shares a Gradio application containing sensitive data or functionality using Gradio's public sharing feature (`share=True`). This creates a public URL accessible to anyone on the internet, potentially leading to unauthorized access and data breaches. This threat is specific to Gradio's sharing functionality.
*   **Impact:** Medium to High (depending on the sensitivity of exposed data/functionality). Data breach, unauthorized access, privacy violations.
*   **Gradio Component Affected:** Gradio's `share=True` feature, public URL generation by Gradio's sharing service, Gradio's cloud infrastructure for sharing (if used).
*   **Risk Severity:** Medium
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Exercise extreme caution and awareness when using Gradio's `share=True` feature, especially for applications handling sensitive data.
    *   Thoroughly understand the implications and risks of creating public sharing links with Gradio.
    *   Prefer deploying Gradio applications in private networks or using Gradio's authentication features (or external authentication) for sensitive applications instead of relying on public sharing.
    *   Regularly review and revoke any active sharing links generated by Gradio that are no longer needed.
    *   Educate developers specifically about the security risks associated with Gradio's `share=True` feature and when it is appropriate to use.
