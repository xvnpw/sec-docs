## High and Critical Cython Specific Threats

| Threat | Description (Attacker Action & Method) | Impact | Affected Cython Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Malicious Code Injection via Cython Compilation** | An attacker compromises the build environment or exploits a vulnerability in the Cython compiler itself to inject malicious C/C++ code during the compilation process. This could involve modifying the Cython compiler or its dependencies. | Arbitrary code execution on the server/user's machine, data compromise, complete system takeover. | Cython Compiler | Critical | - Secure the build environment (use trusted build servers, implement strict access controls). <br> - Regularly update Cython to the latest stable version. <br> - Implement code signing for compiled extensions. <br> - Use static analysis tools on the Cython compiler codebase (if feasible). <br> - Verify the integrity of the Cython installation. |
| **Compromised Cython Dependencies** | An attacker compromises a dependency used by the Cython project itself, potentially introducing vulnerabilities into the Cython compiler or generated code. | Arbitrary code execution, data compromise, depending on the nature of the compromised dependency. | Cython Compiler Dependencies | High | - Monitor Cython's security advisories and update promptly. <br> - Use dependency scanning tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in Cython's dependencies. <br> - Pin specific versions of Cython and its dependencies in your project's requirements. <br> - Consider using a supply chain security tool to monitor dependencies. |
