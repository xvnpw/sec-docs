## Vulnerability List for Django REST Pandas Project

Based on the provided project files, no high or critical vulnerabilities were identified within the Django REST Pandas project itself that meet the specified criteria for inclusion. The project primarily focuses on data rendering and serialization using well-established libraries like pandas and Django REST Framework. The codebase appears to be well-structured and does not introduce obvious security flaws that would be directly exploitable by an external attacker to achieve high-impact security breaches, excluding denial of service, insecure code patterns in user projects, or missing documentation.

It's important to note that while no vulnerabilities are listed here, secure usage of Django REST Pandas still relies on secure development practices in projects that integrate it. This includes proper data validation, authorization, and protection against common web application vulnerabilities in the broader application context.

**Note:** This analysis is based solely on the provided project files and may not cover all potential security considerations. A more comprehensive security audit would involve deeper code review, dynamic analysis, and consideration of the application's deployment environment and usage scenarios.
