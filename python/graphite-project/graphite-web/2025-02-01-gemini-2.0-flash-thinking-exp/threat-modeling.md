# Threat Model Analysis for graphite-project/graphite-web

## Threat: [Unauthenticated Metric Data Access via Render API](./threats/unauthenticated_metric_data_access_via_render_api.md)

### Description:
If authentication is not properly configured or enforced on the Graphite-web instance, an attacker can directly access the `/render` API endpoint without authentication. This allows them to retrieve metric data stored in Whisper databases by crafting specific render requests. The attacker can enumerate metric paths and retrieve time-series data for any metric accessible to Graphite-web.

### Impact:
**Information Disclosure**. Unauthorized access to sensitive metric data, including performance metrics, application behavior, and business-related data that is being monitored. This can lead to competitive disadvantage, exposure of internal operations, or compliance violations.

### Affected Component:
`webapp/graphite/render/views.py` (Render API endpoint), potentially `webapp/graphite/auth.py` (if authentication is not correctly configured or bypassed).

### Risk Severity:
**High**

### Mitigation Strategies:
- **Enable and enforce authentication** for Graphite-web. Configure an authentication backend (e.g., Django authentication, LDAP, Active Directory) and ensure it is properly integrated with Graphite-web.
- **Implement authorization controls** to restrict access to specific metrics based on user roles or groups. Consider using proxy servers or custom authentication middleware to enforce more granular access control.
- **Regularly review and audit authentication and authorization configurations**.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Complex Render Requests](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_complex_render_requests.md)

### Description:
The Graphite-web render API can be computationally intensive. An attacker can craft malicious render requests with a very large number of metrics, complex functions, long time ranges, or high resolution, designed to consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory, I/O). This leads to performance degradation or service unavailability for legitimate users.

### Impact:
**Service Disruption**. Graphite-web becomes slow or unresponsive, preventing legitimate users from accessing dashboards and metric data. This can severely impact monitoring capabilities and incident response.

### Affected Component:
`webapp/graphite/render/views.py` (Render API endpoint), `webapp/graphite/render/datalib.py` (Rendering engine).

### Risk Severity:
**High**

### Mitigation Strategies:
- **Implement rate limiting** on the `/render` API endpoint to restrict the number of requests from a single IP address or user.
- **Set resource limits** for the Graphite-web process (e.g., CPU and memory limits using containerization or system-level controls).
- **Optimize Graphite-web configuration** for performance, including caching mechanisms.
- **Monitor Graphite-web resource usage** (CPU, memory, I/O) and set up alerts to detect potential DoS attacks.
- **Implement request validation and sanitization** to limit the complexity of allowed render requests.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Debug Endpoints (if enabled in production)](./threats/information_disclosure_via_debug_endpoints__if_enabled_in_production_.md)

### Description:
If debug endpoints are inadvertently enabled in a production Graphite-web environment, they can expose sensitive information. This includes application's internal state, configuration, environment variables, and potentially database connection details. Attackers can access these debug endpoints to gather information for further attacks or directly exploit exposed sensitive data.

### Impact:
**Information Disclosure**. Exposure of sensitive configuration details, internal application state, or potentially credentials. This information can be used to further compromise the Graphite-web instance or related systems, leading to data breaches or unauthorized access.

### Affected Component:
Graphite-web configuration, potentially various modules depending on the specific debug endpoints enabled.

### Risk Severity:
**High**

### Mitigation Strategies:
- **Disable debug endpoints in production environments.** Ensure debug settings are explicitly disabled in the Graphite-web configuration file for production deployments.
- **Restrict access to debug endpoints** even in non-production environments using network firewalls or access control mechanisms.
- **Regularly audit Graphite-web configuration** to ensure debug settings are correctly configured and not inadvertently enabled in production.
