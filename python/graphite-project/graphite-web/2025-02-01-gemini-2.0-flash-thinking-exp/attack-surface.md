# Attack Surface Analysis for graphite-project/graphite-web

## Attack Surface: [1. Django Version Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/1__django_version_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of known security flaws present in the specific version of the Django framework used by Graphite-web.
*   **Graphite-web Contribution:** Graphite-web is built upon Django. Using outdated Django versions directly inherits Django's vulnerabilities, making Graphite-web vulnerable.
*   **Example:** Exploiting a known Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Django 1.8 (if Graphite-web is running on such an old version) to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting Graphite-web.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution, Data Breach, Denial of Service, Complete system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** to **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Django to the latest stable and patched versions.
    *   Monitor Django security advisories and apply security updates promptly.
    *   Implement automated vulnerability scanning to detect outdated Django versions.

## Attack Surface: [2. Django Misconfiguration (Debug Mode in Production)](./attack_surfaces/2__django_misconfiguration__debug_mode_in_production_.md)

*   **Description:** Running Django with `DEBUG = True` in a production environment, exposing sensitive debugging information.
*   **Graphite-web Contribution:** Graphite-web, being a Django application, is susceptible to this misconfiguration if `DEBUG = True` is mistakenly enabled in its `settings.py` or `local_settings.py` for production deployments.
*   **Example:** An attacker accessing debug pages in a production Graphite-web instance, revealing source code, environment variables (potentially including database credentials), and internal server paths, aiding in further exploitation.
*   **Impact:** Information Disclosure, facilitating more targeted attacks, potential credential compromise, and system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure `DEBUG = False` is explicitly set in production configuration files (`settings.py` or `local_settings.py`).
    *   Implement robust logging and monitoring solutions instead of relying on debug mode for production issue diagnosis.
    *   Conduct regular configuration reviews to verify production readiness and security settings.

## Attack Surface: [3. Insecure Django SECRET_KEY](./attack_surfaces/3__insecure_django_secret_key.md)

*   **Description:** Using a weak, default, or publicly known `SECRET_KEY` in Django, compromising cryptographic security mechanisms.
*   **Graphite-web Contribution:** Graphite-web relies on Django's `SECRET_KEY` for critical security functions like cryptographic signing and session management. A weak `SECRET_KEY` directly weakens Graphite-web's security posture.
*   **Example:** An attacker cracking or obtaining a weak `SECRET_KEY` and using it to forge signed cookies, hijack legitimate user sessions, bypass CSRF protection mechanisms, or potentially decrypt sensitive data if encryption relies on this key.
*   **Impact:** Session Hijacking, Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) bypass, potential data manipulation, and unauthorized access to Graphite-web functionalities and data.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Generate a strong, unique, and cryptographically secure `SECRET_KEY` using a cryptographically secure random number generator.
    *   Securely store the `SECRET_KEY` outside of the application codebase, preferably using environment variables or dedicated secrets management systems.
    *   Implement a policy for regular rotation of the `SECRET_KEY` as a proactive security measure.

## Attack Surface: [4. Parameter Injection in API Endpoints (Render API)](./attack_surfaces/4__parameter_injection_in_api_endpoints__render_api_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from insufficient validation and sanitization of user-supplied parameters in Graphite-web's API requests, leading to injection attacks.
*   **Graphite-web Contribution:** Graphite-web's API endpoints, particularly the widely used `/render` API, heavily rely on user-provided parameters (like `target`, `from`, `until`). Lack of proper input validation in Graphite-web's code makes these endpoints susceptible to injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** Injecting malicious code into the `target` parameter of the `/render` API. If Graphite-web's backend processing of this parameter is vulnerable, it could lead to command injection on the server or template injection within the rendering process.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution, Data Breach (access to unauthorized metrics data), Denial of Service, potential manipulation of monitoring data.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** to **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all user-provided parameters in Graphite-web's API endpoints.
    *   Utilize parameterized queries or Django's ORM when interacting with backend data stores (like Whisper or databases) to prevent SQL injection or similar injection types.
    *   Enforce input whitelisting, defining allowed characters and formats for API parameters and rejecting any input that deviates from the defined whitelist.

## Attack Surface: [5. Authentication and Authorization Bypass on API Endpoints](./attack_surfaces/5__authentication_and_authorization_bypass_on_api_endpoints.md)

*   **Description:** Lack of proper or effective authentication and authorization mechanisms on Graphite-web's API endpoints, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionalities.
*   **Graphite-web Contribution:** If Graphite-web's API endpoints are not correctly configured with authentication and authorization, or if there are logical flaws in the implemented access control mechanisms within Graphite-web's code, attackers can bypass these controls.
*   **Example:** Accessing the `/render` API without providing any authentication credentials to retrieve metrics data that should be restricted to authenticated users or users with specific roles or permissions within Graphite-web.
*   **Impact:** Data Breach, Unauthorized access to sensitive metrics data, potential unauthorized manipulation or deletion of monitoring data, and compromise of data confidentiality and integrity.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust authentication mechanisms for all API endpoints that require access control. Consider using strong authentication methods like API keys, OAuth 2.0, or session-based authentication.
    *   Implement fine-grained authorization policies to control access to specific API endpoints and data based on user roles, permissions, or other relevant attributes.
    *   Regularly review and rigorously test authentication and authorization configurations and code within Graphite-web to ensure they are correctly implemented and effective in preventing unauthorized access.
