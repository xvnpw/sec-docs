# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for graphite-project/graphite-web

## Mitigation Strategy: [1. Implement Strict Input Sanitization and Output Encoding for Graph Rendering within Graphite-web](./mitigation_strategies/1__implement_strict_input_sanitization_and_output_encoding_for_graph_rendering_within_graphite-web.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Graphite-web Input Sanitization and Output Encoding for Graph Rendering
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Graphite-web rendering code:** Developers need to audit the Python code within Graphite-web responsible for generating graphs (likely within modules handling graph requests and rendering logic).
    2.  **Identify vulnerable input points:** Pinpoint all locations in the code where user-provided parameters (e.g., from URL parameters, API requests) are used to construct graph queries, rendering commands, or are directly reflected in the output (SVG, HTML).
    3.  **Implement sanitization functions within Graphite-web:** Develop and integrate sanitization functions *within the Graphite-web codebase* to process user inputs *before* they are used in rendering or output generation. This should include:
        *   **Whitelisting within Graphite-web:**  In the Python code, implement checks to ensure input parameters conform to allowed patterns (e.g., metric names, function names). Reject invalid inputs within the application logic.
        *   **Escaping within Graphite-web:**  Use Python's built-in escaping functions or libraries (like `html.escape` or libraries for SVG/XML escaping if applicable) *within the Graphite-web code* to sanitize outputs before rendering.
    4.  **Context-aware output encoding in Graphite-web:** Ensure that output encoding is context-aware. If generating HTML, use HTML encoding. If generating SVG, use appropriate SVG/XML encoding. This encoding should be applied *within the Graphite-web rendering logic*.
    5.  **Unit and integration testing:** Write unit tests to verify sanitization and encoding functions. Perform integration tests to ensure that sanitization is applied correctly throughout the graph rendering process in Graphite-web.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - High Severity:** Prevents XSS vulnerabilities arising from unsanitized user inputs used in graph rendering within Graphite-web.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS - Significantly reduces risk:** By sanitizing inputs and encoding outputs directly within Graphite-web, the application becomes much more resilient to XSS attacks related to graph rendering.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Assume partially implemented. Graphite-web likely has *some* basic input validation, but comprehensive sanitization and context-aware output encoding across all rendering paths might be lacking.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Likely requires a code audit of Graphite-web's rendering modules to identify all input points and ensure consistent and robust sanitization and encoding is implemented *within the application code itself*.  May need development of new sanitization functions and integration into existing rendering workflows.

## Mitigation Strategy: [2. Configure Content Security Policy (CSP) within Graphite-web or Web Server Configuration for Graphite-web](./mitigation_strategies/2__configure_content_security_policy__csp__within_graphite-web_or_web_server_configuration_for_graph_e7291129.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Graphite-web CSP Configuration
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define a strict CSP policy relevant to Graphite-web:** Create a CSP policy tailored to Graphite-web's resource loading requirements.  Focus on restricting script sources, object sources, and other potentially dangerous resource types.  Consider the specific origins Graphite-web needs to load resources from (e.g., 'self' for static assets, specific CDN for fonts if used).
    2.  **Implement CSP header sending:**
        *   **Option 1: Graphite-web application level:** If Graphite-web allows custom header configuration (check application settings or middleware capabilities), configure it to send the CSP header in HTTP responses. This would involve modifying Graphite-web's configuration files or potentially writing custom middleware if supported.
        *   **Option 2: Web server configuration (recommended):** Configure the web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache) that serves Graphite-web to add the CSP header to all responses for Graphite-web's application paths. This is generally the more robust and recommended approach.
    3.  **Test and refine CSP for Graphite-web:** Use browser developer tools and CSP reporting mechanisms to monitor CSP policy violations specifically within the context of Graphite-web. Adjust the policy to allow legitimate Graphite-web resources while maintaining security.
    4.  **Document CSP configuration for Graphite-web:** Clearly document how to configure CSP for Graphite-web, whether at the application level or web server level, for deployment and maintenance.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - High Severity:** Reduces the impact of XSS attacks within Graphite-web by limiting the browser's ability to execute malicious scripts, even if injected.
    *   **Data Injection Attacks - Medium Severity:** Can offer some mitigation against certain data injection attacks within the Graphite-web context.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS - Significantly reduces impact:** CSP provides a strong defense-in-depth layer against XSS in Graphite-web.
    *   **Data Injection Attacks - Moderately reduces impact:** CSP can limit the scope of some data injection attacks within Graphite-web.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Likely **not implemented** by default in standard Graphite-web configurations. CSP implementation requires explicit configuration.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   CSP is likely missing. Needs to be configured either within Graphite-web's application settings (if possible) or, more commonly, at the web server level serving Graphite-web.  Requires creating a suitable CSP policy for Graphite-web and documenting the configuration process.

## Mitigation Strategy: [3. Control and Validate External Data Source Configurations within Graphite-web](./mitigation_strategies/3__control_and_validate_external_data_source_configurations_within_graphite-web.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Graphite-web External Data Source Configuration Control
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Graphite-web features using external data:** Determine which features or plugins within Graphite-web allow fetching data from external sources (e.g., remote Carbon instances, external APIs, databases).
    2.  **Implement whitelisting in Graphite-web configuration:** If Graphite-web's configuration allows defining external data sources, ensure there is a mechanism to whitelist allowed domains, URLs, or source identifiers. Configure this whitelist to only include trusted and necessary external sources.
    3.  **Validate data source configurations in Graphite-web:**  Within Graphite-web's configuration parsing and data fetching logic, implement validation checks to ensure that configured external data sources are within the defined whitelist. Reject configurations pointing to unauthorized sources.
    4.  **Restrict features allowing arbitrary URL access in Graphite-web:** If Graphite-web has features that allow users to specify arbitrary URLs for data fetching, disable these features if not essential. If required, implement strict URL validation and sanitization *within Graphite-web's code* to prevent manipulation.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) - High Severity:** Prevents SSRF attacks originating from Graphite-web by controlling and validating external data source configurations within the application.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **SSRF - Significantly reduces risk:** Whitelisting and validation of external data sources within Graphite-web are crucial for preventing SSRF vulnerabilities in the application.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Likely **partially implemented**. Graphite-web might have configuration options for data sources, but robust whitelisting and validation might be basic or missing.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   May lack comprehensive whitelisting and validation for all features in Graphite-web that interact with external data sources. Requires a review of Graphite-web's configuration and code related to external data and implementation of stricter controls within the application.

## Mitigation Strategy: [4. Change Default Credentials and Harden Default Configurations of Graphite-web](./mitigation_strategies/4__change_default_credentials_and_harden_default_configurations_of_graphite-web.md)

    4.  **Harden insecure default settings in Graphite-web:**  Modify default settings in Graphite-web to enhance security, focusing on:
        *   **Authentication settings:** Ensure strong authentication methods are configured (if configurable within Graphite-web itself).
        *   **Authorization policies:** Review and tighten default authorization policies within Graphite-web to follow the principle of least privilege.
        *   **Debug settings:** Ensure debug mode is disabled by default in production configurations of Graphite-web.
        *   **Session security:** Configure secure session management settings within Graphite-web (e.g., secure cookies, session timeouts).
    5.  **Provide secure default configuration templates:** Create and distribute secure default configuration templates for Graphite-web to guide users towards secure deployments.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access - High Severity:** Prevents unauthorized access to Graphite-web due to the use of default credentials.
    *   **Privilege Escalation - Medium Severity:** Reduces the risk of privilege escalation through exploitation of insecure default configurations in Graphite-web.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access - Significantly reduces risk:** Changing default credentials is a fundamental security step for Graphite-web.
    *   **Privilege Escalation - Moderately reduces risk:** Hardening default configurations within Graphite-web reduces the attack surface and potential for exploitation.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially implemented**. Users are generally expected to set up their own admin users. However, Graphite-web's default configuration files might still contain insecure default settings that need hardening.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   May lack automated enforcement of password changes for default accounts and comprehensive guidance on hardening all relevant default configurations within Graphite-web. Requires better documentation and potentially scripts or tools to assist with secure configuration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [5. Disable Detailed Error Reporting in Production within Graphite-web Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/5__disable_detailed_error_reporting_in_production_within_graphite-web_configuration.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Graphite-web Production Error Reporting Minimization
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Graphite-web error reporting level:**  Modify Graphite-web's configuration settings (e.g., in `local_settings.py` or similar) to control the level of error reporting in production environments. Set it to a minimal level that avoids exposing sensitive technical details.
    2.  **Disable debug mode in Graphite-web:**  Ensure that the debug mode setting in Graphite-web's configuration is explicitly disabled for production deployments.
    3.  **Implement custom error pages in Graphite-web (if feasible):** If Graphite-web allows customization of error pages, create custom error pages that display generic, user-friendly messages instead of detailed technical error information.
    4.  **Configure secure logging in Graphite-web:** Ensure Graphite-web is configured to log detailed errors securely to log files or a centralized logging system for administrator review. Restrict access to these logs through operating system permissions or access control mechanisms.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure - Medium Severity:** Prevents information disclosure through verbose error messages generated by Graphite-web in production.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure - Moderately reduces risk:** Minimizing error reporting in Graphite-web production environments significantly reduces the risk of information leakage.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Likely **partially implemented**. Standard production configurations might reduce verbosity, but explicit configuration to minimize error details and disable debug mode might be required.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   May require explicit configuration steps to fully minimize error reporting and ensure debug mode is disabled in Graphite-web production deployments. Needs clear documentation on how to configure error reporting levels within Graphite-web.

## Mitigation Strategy: [6. Implement Rate Limiting within Graphite-web Application or Middleware](./mitigation_strategies/6__implement_rate_limiting_within_graphite-web_application_or_middleware.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Graphite-web Application-Level Rate Limiting
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify resource-intensive Graphite-web endpoints:** Pinpoint the specific Graphite-web endpoints (URLs, API paths) that are most resource-intensive and susceptible to DoS attacks (e.g., graph rendering endpoints, data query endpoints).
    2.  **Choose a rate limiting approach:**
        *   **Option 1: Graphite-web middleware:** If Graphite-web supports middleware (check its framework documentation), implement rate limiting middleware that can be applied to specific routes or globally.
        *   **Option 2: Application-level rate limiting:**  Modify Graphite-web's Python code to implement rate limiting logic directly within the application, potentially using libraries for rate limiting.
    3.  **Configure rate limiting rules:** Define rate limiting rules based on IP address, user session, or other relevant criteria. Set appropriate limits for the number of requests allowed within a specific time window for the identified resource-intensive endpoints.
    4.  **Test and tune rate limiting:**  Test the rate limiting implementation to ensure it effectively prevents DoS attacks without impacting legitimate users. Tune the rate limits as needed based on performance testing and monitoring.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - High Severity:** Prevents DoS attacks targeting Graphite-web by limiting the rate of requests processed by the application itself.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS - Significantly reduces risk:** Application-level rate limiting in Graphite-web provides a defense against DoS attacks by controlling request volume at the application layer.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Likely **not implemented** by default in standard Graphite-web. Rate limiting usually requires custom implementation or integration of middleware.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Rate limiting is likely missing. Requires development and integration of rate limiting functionality into Graphite-web, either as middleware or directly within the application code.

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Graphite-web Authentication and Authorization Hardening
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Graphite-web authentication mechanisms:** Examine the authentication methods supported by Graphite-web (e.g., username/password, integration with external authentication providers).
    2.  **Enforce strong password policies in Graphite-web:** If Graphite-web manages user accounts internally, enforce strong password complexity requirements and password rotation policies. Configure these policies within Graphite-web's settings if possible.
    3.  **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Graphite-web (if possible):** Explore options for integrating MFA into Graphite-web. This might involve using plugins, extensions, or modifying the application to support MFA.
    4.  **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Graphite-web:**  Ensure that Graphite-web's authorization system is based on RBAC. Define roles with specific permissions related to Graphite-web functionalities (e.g., admin, read-only user, graph editor). Assign users to roles based on their needs. Configure RBAC within Graphite-web's settings or through its user management interface.
    5.  **Enforce least privilege within Graphite-web:** Configure Graphite-web's authorization policies to grant users only the minimum necessary permissions required for their roles.
    6.  **Regularly audit Graphite-web authorization policies:** Periodically review and update Graphite-web's RBAC policies to ensure they remain effective and aligned with security requirements.
