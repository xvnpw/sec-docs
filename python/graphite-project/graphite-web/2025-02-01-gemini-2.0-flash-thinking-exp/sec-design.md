# BUSINESS POSTURE

Graphite-web is a critical component of the Graphite monitoring stack, providing a user interface for visualizing time-series data. The primary business goal is to enable users to monitor system performance, identify trends, and troubleshoot issues effectively. This directly supports business continuity, performance management, and incident response.

Business Priorities:
- Availability: The monitoring system must be consistently available to provide real-time insights.
- Reliability: Data visualization must be accurate and dependable for informed decision-making.
- Performance: The web interface should be responsive and efficient to handle user queries and data rendering.
- Data Integrity: Monitored data must be stored and presented without corruption or loss.

Business Risks:
- Service Disruption: Downtime of Graphite-web can lead to a loss of visibility into system health, potentially delaying incident detection and resolution, impacting business operations.
- Data Breach: Unauthorized access to monitoring data could expose sensitive business information or infrastructure details.
- Data Integrity Issues: Inaccurate or corrupted data can lead to incorrect analysis and flawed decision-making.
- Performance Bottlenecks: Slow or unresponsive interface can hinder user productivity and reduce the effectiveness of monitoring.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: HTTPS encryption for web traffic (standard practice for web applications, assumed but not explicitly stated in the repository).
- security control: Web application framework security features (Django framework provides built-in security features, such as CSRF protection, protection against common web vulnerabilities, described in Django documentation).
- security control: User authentication (Graphite-web supports authentication backends, configurable in settings.py, described in Graphite-web documentation).
- security control: Authorization (Graphite-web implements permission-based access control to dashboards and data, configurable in settings.py, described in Graphite-web documentation).

Accepted Risks:
- accepted risk: Reliance on underlying infrastructure security (Graphite-web depends on the security of the operating system, network, and other infrastructure components it runs on).
- accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies (Graphite-web uses Python packages, which may contain security vulnerabilities).

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect against common web attacks (e.g., OWASP Top 10).
- security control: Regularly perform security vulnerability scanning on dependencies and the application itself (using tools like `pip-audit`, `safety`, SAST/DAST scanners).
- security control: Implement robust logging and monitoring of security-related events (e.g., authentication failures, authorization violations).
- security control: Implement rate limiting to protect against brute-force attacks and denial-of-service attempts.
- security control: Conduct regular penetration testing to identify and remediate security weaknesses.
- security control: Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication:
    - requirement: Securely authenticate users accessing the Graphite-web interface.
    - requirement: Support multiple authentication methods (e.g., local accounts, LDAP, OAuth).
    - requirement: Enforce strong password policies.
    - requirement: Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security (recommended).
- Authorization:
    - requirement: Implement fine-grained authorization to control access to dashboards, graphs, and data.
    - requirement: Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning permissions.
    - requirement: Regularly review and audit user permissions.
- Input Validation:
    - requirement: Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection, XSS).
    - requirement: Sanitize user inputs before displaying them in the UI.
    - requirement: Use parameterized queries or ORM for database interactions to prevent SQL injection.
- Cryptography:
    - requirement: Use HTTPS to encrypt all communication between the client and the server.
    - requirement: Securely store sensitive data, such as user credentials (using password hashing).
    - requirement: Consider encrypting sensitive data at rest if applicable.

## BUILD

    BuildEnv --> ContainerRegistry[/"Container Registry (e.g., Docker Hub)"/]: "Publish Container Image"
    ContainerRegistry --> DeploymentEnv[/"Deployment Environment (Kubernetes)"/]: "Deploy Application"
```

Build Process Description:

1. Developer commits code changes to the Source Code Repository (GitHub).
2. A webhook in the Source Code Repository triggers the CI System (e.g., GitHub Actions).
3. The CI System initiates a build process in a Build Environment.
4. The Build Environment compiles the application, builds container images, and runs automated tests.
5. Security Scanners (SAST, Dependency Check) are integrated into the build pipeline to perform static analysis and dependency vulnerability checks.
6. Security Scan Results are reviewed, and build fails if critical vulnerabilities are found (build break on security policy).
7. Upon successful build and security checks, the CI System publishes the container image to a Container Registry.
8. The Deployment Environment (Kubernetes) pulls the updated container image from the Container Registry and deploys the application.

Build Process Security Controls:

- security control: Secure Source Code Repository (GitHub): Access control, branch protection, audit logging.
- security control: CI/CD Pipeline Security (GitHub Actions): Secure workflow definitions, secret management, access control to CI/CD system.
- security control: Build Environment Security: Hardened build environment, minimal tools installed, isolated build processes.
- security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Automated code analysis to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the source code.
- security control: Dependency Scanning: Automated scanning of project dependencies to identify known vulnerabilities (e.g., using `pip-audit`, `safety`).
- security control: Container Image Scanning: Scanning container images for vulnerabilities before publishing to the registry.
- security control: Secure Container Registry: Access control to the container registry, vulnerability scanning of stored images.
- security control: Code Signing/Image Signing: Signing build artifacts (optional for container images) to ensure integrity and authenticity.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- Real-time monitoring of system and application performance.
- Incident detection and alerting based on performance metrics.
- Capacity planning and performance analysis.
- Business performance monitoring through custom metrics.

Data to Protect:
- Monitoring Data (Time-series metrics):
    - Sensitivity: Medium to High. Metrics data can contain sensitive information about system performance, application behavior, and potentially business-related data. Exposure could reveal business secrets, performance issues, or infrastructure details to unauthorized parties.
- User Credentials:
    - Sensitivity: High. Compromise of user credentials can lead to unauthorized access to the monitoring system and potentially other systems if credentials are reused.
- Dashboard Configurations:
    - Sensitivity: Medium. Dashboard configurations might contain information about monitored systems and business logic.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- What is the expected scale and performance requirements for Graphite-web?
- Are there any specific integrations with other security tools or systems planned?
- What is the process for managing and patching third-party dependencies?

- User authentication and authorization are implemented and configured.
- The underlying infrastructure (Kubernetes, cloud provider) has basic security controls in place.
- The organization has a general understanding of security best practices and is willing to implement recommended security controls.
- The deployment environment is a Kubernetes cluster, which is a common and reasonable assumption for modern applications.
- The build process utilizes a CI/CD system for automation.
