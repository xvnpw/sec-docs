## Attack Tree Path: [Root Goal: Compromise Graphite-web Application [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/root_goal_compromise_graphite-web_application__critical_.md)

This is the ultimate objective. Success means the attacker gains unauthorized access, control, or causes significant disruption to the Graphite-web application and potentially the underlying system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Network-Based Attacks [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/network-based_attacks__high-risk_path_.md)

These attacks are initiated remotely over the network, targeting the Graphite-web application's network services (typically HTTP/HTTPS).
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in network protocols.
        *   Sending malicious network traffic to overwhelm or exploit the application.
        *   Bypassing network security controls to reach the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Publicly Known Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_publicly_known_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

This involves leveraging publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) in Graphite-web or its components.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Utilize Exploit Frameworks (e.g., Metasploit) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** Using pre-built exploit code available in frameworks to automate and simplify the exploitation process.
        *   Manual exploitation using publicly available vulnerability details and proof-of-concept code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Authentication Bypass [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/authentication_bypass__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

Circumventing the authentication mechanisms of Graphite-web to gain unauthorized access without valid credentials.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Exploit Authentication Vulnerabilities (if any exist) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** Exploiting flaws in the authentication logic itself, such as logic errors, race conditions, or insecure implementation of authentication protocols.
        *   **Brute-Force Authentication (if weak password policies) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**  Attempting to guess valid credentials by systematically trying a large number of usernames and passwords. Effective if weak or default passwords are used, or if rate limiting is insufficient.

## Attack Tree Path: [Authorization Bypass [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/authorization_bypass__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

Gaining access to resources or functionalities that the attacker is not authorized to access, even after successful authentication (or bypassing it).
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Exploit Authorization Flaws in Graphite-web API/UI [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the authorization logic, such as flaws in role-based access control, insecure direct object references, or path traversal vulnerabilities leading to unauthorized resource access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos__attacks__high-risk_path_.md)

Making the Graphite-web application unavailable to legitimate users by overwhelming its resources or exploiting application flaws.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Resource Exhaustion [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Consuming excessive resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) to degrade or crash the application.
            *   **Send Large Number of Requests [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Flooding the application with a high volume of requests to overwhelm its processing capacity.

## Attack Tree Path: [Injection Attacks (Focus on Graphite-web specific areas) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/injection_attacks__focus_on_graphite-web_specific_areas___high-risk_path_.md)

Injecting malicious code or commands into the Graphite-web application to manipulate its behavior or gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Path Traversal/Local File Inclusion (LFI) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Exploiting vulnerabilities to read arbitrary files on the server, potentially including sensitive configuration files or source code.
            *   **Read Sensitive Configuration Files/Source Code [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**  Specifically targeting configuration files like `local_settings.py` and `carbon.conf` to extract secrets, credentials, or configuration details.
            *   **Attempt to Access Files like `local_settings.py`, `carbon.conf` (if accessible) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Direct attempts to access these critical files if a path traversal vulnerability is found.
        *   **Command Injection (Less likely in core, but consider plugins/extensions) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** Injecting malicious operating system commands that are executed by the Graphite-web application, potentially leading to full system compromise. This is more likely if Graphite-web uses plugins or extensions that interact with the OS.

## Attack Tree Path: [Dependency-Based Attacks [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/dependency-based_attacks__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

Exploiting vulnerabilities in third-party libraries or packages that Graphite-web depends on.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Dependencies [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** Targeting known vulnerabilities in Python packages used by Graphite-web.
            *   **Utilize Publicly Available Exploits (if available) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** Using publicly available exploits for vulnerable dependencies to compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Configuration-Based Attacks [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/configuration-based_attacks__high-risk_path_.md)

Exploiting insecure configurations of Graphite-web to gain unauthorized access or information.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Misconfiguration Exploitation [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Leveraging various types of misconfigurations.
            *   **Weak Authentication/Authorization Settings [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** Exploiting default or poorly configured authentication and authorization settings, such as weak passwords, permissive access controls, or disabled security features.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Manipulation Attacks (Potentially less direct compromise, but impactful) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/data_manipulation_attacks__potentially_less_direct_compromise__but_impactful___high-risk_path_.md)

Manipulating the metric data or dashboards within Graphite-web to cause data integrity issues, misleading visualizations, or potentially disrupt operations.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Metric Data Injection [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Injecting malicious or false metric data into Graphite-web.
            *   **Inject Malicious Metric Data [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Sending crafted metric data using Graphite protocols (plaintext, pickle) to insert false or misleading information.
            *   **Cause Data Integrity Issues/Misleading Visualizations [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**  The consequence of successful metric data injection, leading to inaccurate dashboards, incorrect alerts, and potentially flawed decision-making based on the metrics.
