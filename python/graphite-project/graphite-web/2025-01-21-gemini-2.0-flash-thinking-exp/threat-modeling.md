# Threat Model Analysis for graphite-project/graphite-web

## Threat: [Metric Query Injection](./threats/metric_query_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious metric query, potentially using functions like `eval` or deeply nested structures, and submits it through the Graphite-Web interface or API. This could be done by directly manipulating URL parameters or API request bodies.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) by overloading the Graphite-Web server or the backend Carbon/Whisper daemons with resource-intensive computations. This can lead to performance degradation or complete unavailability of the monitoring system.

**Affected Component:** Graph Rendering Module, API endpoints accepting metric queries (e.g., `/render`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict input validation and sanitization for metric queries.
* Limit the complexity and resource usage of allowed query functions.
* Consider sandboxing or rate-limiting query execution.
* Monitor resource usage of the Graphite-Web server and backend components to detect suspicious query patterns.

## Threat: [Dashboard Definition Manipulation leading to XSS](./threats/dashboard_definition_manipulation_leading_to_xss.md)

**Description:** An attacker, with access to modify dashboard definitions (either through a compromised account or a vulnerability in the dashboard storage mechanism within Graphite-Web), injects malicious JavaScript or HTML code into the dashboard configuration. When other users view this manipulated dashboard through Graphite-Web, the malicious script executes in their browser.

**Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, or other client-side attacks against users viewing the compromised dashboard.

**Affected Component:** Dashboard Rendering Module, Dashboard Storage mechanism (within Graphite-Web).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement secure storage and access controls for dashboard definitions within Graphite-Web.
* Enforce strict input validation and output encoding when rendering dashboard content.
* Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of XSS.
* Regularly audit dashboard definitions for suspicious content.

## Threat: [Template Injection in Dashboard Rendering](./threats/template_injection_in_dashboard_rendering.md)

**Description:** If Graphite-Web uses a templating engine for dashboard rendering and user-provided input (or data from dashboard definitions) is directly incorporated into templates without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious template code. This code would be executed on the server-side by Graphite-Web during the rendering process.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the Graphite-Web server. The attacker could potentially execute arbitrary commands, gain access to sensitive data, or further compromise the system.

**Affected Component:** Dashboard Rendering Module, Templating Engine (within Graphite-Web).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid direct inclusion of user input or unsanitized data in template rendering within Graphite-Web.
* Use parameterized queries or safe templating practices that automatically escape potentially dangerous characters.
* Regularly update the templating engine used by Graphite-Web to the latest version with security patches.
* Implement strict input validation for any data used in template rendering.

## Threat: [Path Traversal in File Access (if applicable)](./threats/path_traversal_in_file_access__if_applicable_.md)

**Description:** If Graphite-Web allows users or administrators to specify file paths for certain operations (e.g., loading dashboard configurations from files), insufficient input validation within Graphite-Web could allow an attacker to provide malicious paths (e.g., using "../") to access arbitrary files on the server's file system.

**Impact:** Information disclosure by accessing sensitive configuration files, application code, or other system files accessible by the Graphite-Web process. This could potentially lead to further exploitation.

**Affected Component:** File Handling Modules, Configuration Loading mechanisms (within Graphite-Web).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Strictly control and validate file paths provided by users or administrators within Graphite-Web.
* Use whitelisting instead of blacklisting for allowed file paths.
* Ensure the Graphite-Web application runs with the least necessary privileges.

## Threat: [Weak or Default Credentials](./threats/weak_or_default_credentials.md)

**Description:** An attacker attempts to log in to Graphite-Web using default credentials or easily guessable usernames and passwords. This could be for administrative accounts or any user accounts managed by Graphite-Web if strong password policies are not enforced.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to Graphite-Web, allowing the attacker to view sensitive monitoring data, modify dashboards, and potentially disrupt the monitoring system.

**Affected Component:** Authentication Module (within Graphite-Web).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enforce strong password policies for all user accounts managed by Graphite-Web.
* Require users to change default credentials upon initial setup of Graphite-Web.
* Implement account lockout mechanisms after multiple failed login attempts to Graphite-Web.
* Consider multi-factor authentication for enhanced security of Graphite-Web logins.

## Threat: [Insecure Session Management](./threats/insecure_session_management.md)

**Description:** An attacker attempts to hijack a legitimate user's session within Graphite-Web by obtaining their session ID. This could be done through network sniffing (if HTTPS is not enforced for Graphite-Web), cross-site scripting (if present in Graphite-Web), or other means.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to the victim's Graphite-Web account, allowing the attacker to perform actions as that user, including viewing data and modifying configurations.

**Affected Component:** Session Management Module (within Graphite-Web).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enforce the use of HTTPS for Graphite-Web to encrypt session cookies and prevent network sniffing.
* Use strong, randomly generated session IDs within Graphite-Web.
* Set the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags on session cookies used by Graphite-Web.
* Implement session timeouts and regular session invalidation within Graphite-Web.

## Threat: [Authorization Bypass](./threats/authorization_bypass.md)

**Description:** An attacker attempts to access resources or perform actions within Graphite-Web without proper authorization. This could be due to flaws in the authorization logic of Graphite-Web, allowing them to bypass access controls and view or modify data they shouldn't have access to.

**Impact:** Information disclosure by accessing unauthorized metrics or dashboards within Graphite-Web. Unauthorized modification of dashboards or configurations within Graphite-Web.

**Affected Component:** Authorization Module, API endpoints, Dashboard Management Module (within Graphite-Web).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement a robust and well-tested authorization mechanism within Graphite-Web.
* Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning permissions within Graphite-Web.
* Regularly review and audit authorization rules within Graphite-Web.
* Ensure that authorization checks are performed consistently across all relevant components and API endpoints of Graphite-Web.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_configuration_data.md)

**Description:** Configuration files of Graphite-Web containing sensitive information (e.g., database credentials for Graphite-Web's internal data, API keys for external services) are stored in a location accessible to unauthorized users or are not properly protected with appropriate file system permissions.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the Graphite-Web instance and potentially the underlying infrastructure if database credentials or API keys used by Graphite-Web are exposed.

**Affected Component:** Configuration Loading Mechanisms, File System (related to Graphite-Web's configuration).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Securely store configuration files of Graphite-Web with appropriate file system permissions, restricting access to only necessary users and processes.
* Avoid storing sensitive information directly in Graphite-Web's configuration files; consider using environment variables or secrets management solutions.
* Regularly review and audit the security of Graphite-Web's configuration files.
