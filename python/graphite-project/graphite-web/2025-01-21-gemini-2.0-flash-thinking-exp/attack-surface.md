# Attack Surface Analysis for graphite-project/graphite-web

## Attack Surface: [Pickle Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/pickle_deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting the unsafe deserialization of Python objects transmitted via the Pickle protocol.
    *   **How Graphite-Web Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Graphite-Web, by default, accepts metric data via the Pickle protocol on a designated port. This protocol is inherently insecure if not handled carefully.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a specially crafted pickled payload disguised as metric data to the Graphite-Web port. Upon deserialization, this payload executes arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the Graphite-Web server, including the ability to execute arbitrary commands, access sensitive data, and potentially pivot to other systems on the network.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Disable the Pickle receiver: If possible, disable the Pickle receiver entirely and use more secure protocols.
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization:  If Pickle is necessary, implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure only trusted sources can send data.
        *   Network segmentation: Isolate the Graphite-Web instance and the Pickle receiver on a restricted network segment.

## Attack Surface: [Weak or Default Credentials (if authentication is enabled)](./attack_surfaces/weak_or_default_credentials__if_authentication_is_enabled_.md)

*   **Description:** Using easily guessable or default usernames and passwords for Graphite-Web's administrative or user accounts.
    *   **How Graphite-Web Contributes to the Attack Surface:** If authentication is enabled but not properly configured with strong credentials, it becomes a weak point.
    *   **Example:** An attacker attempts to log in using common default credentials (e.g., admin/admin) and gains access to the Graphite-Web interface.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the Graphite-Web interface, allowing attackers to view sensitive data, modify dashboards, and potentially disrupt the monitoring system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong password policies: Require users to create strong, unique passwords.
        *   Disable or change default credentials: Ensure default administrative credentials are changed immediately upon installation.
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA): Add an extra layer of security by requiring a second factor for authentication.
        *   Account lockout policies: Implement account lockout policies to prevent brute-force attacks.
