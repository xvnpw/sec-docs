## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Default Credentials -> Access Sensitive Dashboards/Data](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_default_credentials_-_access_sensitive_dashboardsdata.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to log in to Graphite-Web using commonly known default usernames and passwords that are often not changed after deployment.

**Impact:** Successful login grants access to dashboards and potentially sensitive monitoring data, providing insights into the application's performance and internal state. This information can be used for further reconnaissance or to identify potential weaknesses.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) -> Steal User Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__-_steal_user_credentials.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into Graphite-Web, for example, through dashboard names or graph titles. When other users view these elements, the script executes in their browser, potentially stealing session cookies or other authentication tokens.

**Impact:** Stolen credentials allow the attacker to impersonate legitimate users, gaining access to their authorized resources and potentially performing actions on their behalf.

## Attack Tree Path: [Template Injection -> Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./attack_tree_paths/template_injection_-_achieve_remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

**Attack Vector:** If Graphite-Web uses a templating engine and user-supplied input is directly embedded into templates without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious code that is executed on the server.

**Impact:** Successful template injection can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server hosting Graphite-Web, granting the attacker full control over the system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Path Traversal -> Access Sensitive Configuration Files](./attack_tree_paths/path_traversal_-_access_sensitive_configuration_files.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in how Graphite-Web handles file paths, potentially by manipulating input parameters to access files outside of the intended directories.

**Impact:** Successful path traversal can allow attackers to read sensitive configuration files containing credentials, API keys, or other confidential information about the application and its infrastructure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Dependencies -> Execute Arbitrary Code](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_dependencies_-_execute_arbitrary_code.md)

**Attack Vector:** Graphite-Web relies on various third-party libraries. Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in these dependencies to execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Impact:** Successful exploitation of dependency vulnerabilities can lead to remote code execution, granting the attacker full control over the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Default Settings -> Exploit Default Passwords/Configurations -> Gain Administrative Access](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_default_settings_-_exploit_default_passwordsconfigurations_-_gain_administrative_access.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers leverage the fact that default usernames and passwords or insecure default configurations are often left unchanged after deployment.

**Impact:** Gaining administrative access provides the attacker with full control over the Graphite-Web instance, allowing them to modify configurations, access all data, and potentially pivot to other systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exposed Sensitive Information -> Access API Keys or Credentials -> Compromise Integrated Systems](./attack_tree_paths/exposed_sensitive_information_-_access_api_keys_or_credentials_-_compromise_integrated_systems.md)

**Attack Vector:** Misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in Graphite-Web expose sensitive information such as API keys or credentials used to connect to other systems.

**Impact:** Attackers can use these exposed credentials to gain unauthorized access to other integrated systems, potentially leading to a wider compromise beyond just the application using Graphite-Web.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Default Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_default_credentials.md)

Represents a common and easily exploitable weakness if default credentials are not changed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Steal User Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/steal_user_credentials.md)

A key objective for attackers to gain unauthorized access to the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Template Injection](./attack_tree_paths/template_injection.md)

A vulnerability that can directly lead to the highly critical Remote Code Execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

The most critical impact, allowing full control of the server hosting Graphite-Web.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Sensitive Configuration Files](./attack_tree_paths/access_sensitive_configuration_files.md)

Exposes critical secrets that can be used for further attacks and system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_dependencies.md)

A significant attack vector in modern applications due to the reliance on third-party libraries.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Code](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_code.md)

The direct consequence of successful Remote Code Execution exploitation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Default Settings](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_default_settings.md)

A common misconfiguration that serves as an easy entry point for attackers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Default Passwords/Configurations](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_default_passwordsconfigurations.md)

The action of leveraging insecure defaults to gain unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Administrative Access](./attack_tree_paths/gain_administrative_access.md)

Grants the attacker full control over the Graphite-Web instance.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access API Keys or Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/access_api_keys_or_credentials.md)

Enables the attacker to compromise other connected systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Integrated Systems](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_integrated_systems.md)

Represents a significant breach that extends beyond the immediate application using Graphite-Web.
