    2.  **Restrict File System Permissions:**  Set file system permissions on `graphite-web`'s installation directory, configuration files, log files, and data directories so that only the dedicated `graphite-web` user account has the necessary read and write access. Restrict access for other users and groups.
    3.  **Limit Network Access (from Graphite-web processes):** If possible, use operating system-level firewalls or network namespaces to restrict the network access capabilities of the `graphite-web` processes. Limit outbound connections to only necessary services.
    4.  **Resource Limits (Optional):** Consider using operating system resource limits (e.g., `ulimit` on Linux) to restrict the resources (CPU, memory, file descriptors) that `graphite-web` processes can consume. This can help limit the impact of a potential compromise or DoS situation.
    5.  **Regularly Review User and Group Permissions:** Periodically review the user account and file system permissions associated with `graphite-web` to ensure they still adhere to the principle of least privilege.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **System-Wide Compromise after Graphite-web Exploitation (High Severity):** If `graphite-web` is compromised, running it with least privilege limits the attacker's ability to escalate privileges and gain control over the entire server or access sensitive data outside of `graphite-web`'s intended scope.
    *   **Lateral Movement (Medium Severity):** Restricting the privileges of `graphite-web` processes can hinder lateral movement to other systems or services in the network if `graphite-web` is compromised.
