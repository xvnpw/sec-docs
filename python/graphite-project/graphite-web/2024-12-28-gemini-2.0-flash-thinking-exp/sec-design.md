This document provides an enhanced design overview of the Graphite-Web project, specifically tailored for subsequent threat modeling activities. It builds upon the previous version by providing more detailed descriptions of the system's architecture, key components, data flows, and interactions, with a stronger focus on security implications. This document aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the system's structure and functionality to facilitate the identification of potential security vulnerabilities and threat vectors. The information is based on the publicly available source code repository: [https://github.com/graphite-project/graphite-web](https://github.com/graphite-project/graphite-web).

## 2. Goals and Objectives

The primary goal of this document is to provide a clear, concise, and enhanced description of the Graphite-Web system architecture specifically for threat modeling purposes. The objectives include:

*   Clearly identifying and describing the major components of the Graphite-Web application and their security boundaries.
*   Detailing the interactions and data flow between these components, highlighting potential points of vulnerability.
*   Emphasizing key technologies and dependencies with a focus on their security implications.
*   Providing a robust foundation for identifying potential threat vectors, attack surfaces, and vulnerabilities.

## 3. System Overview

Graphite-Web is a web application that provides a user interface for visualizing time-series data collected and stored by the Graphite backend (primarily Carbon and Whisper). It allows users to create graphs, dashboards, and manage their data. Understanding the boundaries between Graphite-Web and its dependencies is crucial for effective threat modeling.

```

*   **External User:** Interacts with the system through a web browser, typically over HTTPS.
*   **Web Server:**  Acts as the entry point for user requests. It handles TLS termination, static content serving, and reverse proxies requests to the Graphite-Web application. Security configurations here are critical.
*   **Graphite-Web Application:** The core of the web interface, built using the Django framework. It's responsible for application logic, user authentication, authorization, graph rendering, dashboard management, and API endpoints. This is a primary focus for threat modeling.
*   **Graphite Backend:** Consists of Carbon (the data ingestion service) and Whisper (the time-series database). Graphite-Web queries this backend for data visualization. While external to Graphite-Web, interactions need consideration.
*   **Database:** Stores application-specific data such as user accounts, dashboards, and saved graph configurations. Securing access to this database is paramount.

## 4. Detailed Design

This section provides a more granular view of the key components within the Graphite-Web application, highlighting their responsibilities and potential security considerations.

### 4.1. Components

*   **Web Interface (Frontend):**
    *   Implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, often relying on frameworks and libraries.
    *   Responsibilities include rendering the user interface, handling user interactions, and making asynchronous requests to the backend.
    *   Security Considerations: Vulnerable to XSS attacks if not properly coded. Client-side logic can be manipulated. Ensure proper input sanitization on the backend for data displayed here.

*   **Django Application (Backend):**
    *   The core application logic, handling routing, authentication, authorization, and data processing.
    *   Responsibilities include:
        *   Receiving and processing user requests.
        *   Authenticating and authorizing users.
        *   Interacting with the rendering engine.
        *   Managing dashboards and user preferences.
        *   Providing API endpoints.
        *   Interacting with the database.
        *   Querying the Graphite Backend.
    *   Security Considerations:  Susceptible to various web application vulnerabilities like SQL injection (if database interactions are not properly handled), authentication bypass, authorization flaws, and insecure session management.

*   **Rendering Engine:**
    *   Responsible for generating graph images based on user-defined parameters and data retrieved from the Graphite backend.
    *   Responsibilities include:
        *   Interpreting user graph requests.
        *   Fetching data from the Graphite backend.
        *   Applying rendering logic to create graph images (e.g., using libraries like Pillow).
    *   Security Considerations: Potential for resource exhaustion if rendering requests are not properly controlled. Vulnerabilities in rendering libraries could be exploited. Input validation of rendering parameters is crucial.

*   **Dashboard Management Module:**
    *   Allows users to create, edit, and organize dashboards.
    *   Responsibilities include:
        *   Storing and retrieving dashboard configurations from the database.
        *   Managing user access to dashboards.
    *   Security Considerations:  Authorization flaws could allow unauthorized access or modification of dashboards. Stored dashboard configurations might contain sensitive information.

*   **User Management Module:**
    *   Handles user accounts, authentication, and authorization.
    *   Responsibilities include:
        *   User registration and login.
        *   Password management (hashing, storage).
        *   Role-based access control (if implemented).
    *   Security Considerations: Critical for overall security. Vulnerabilities here can lead to unauthorized access to the entire system. Secure password hashing and protection against brute-force attacks are essential.

*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   Provide programmatic access to Graphite-Web functionality.
    *   Responsibilities include:
        *   Allowing external systems to retrieve data, render graphs, and manage dashboards.
        *   Providing data in various formats (e.g., JSON).
    *   Security Considerations: Require robust authentication and authorization mechanisms. Vulnerable to API abuse, data injection, and exposure of sensitive information if not properly secured. Rate limiting is important to prevent DoS.

### 4.2. Data Flow

The typical data flow for rendering a graph with a focus on security touchpoints:

1. **User Request (Authenticated):** An authenticated user interacts with the web interface, initiating a request to render a graph. Authentication status is a key security factor.
2. **Browser Request (HTTPS):** The browser sends an HTTPS request to the web server. HTTPS ensures confidentiality and integrity of the communication.
3. **Web Server Forwarding (Validated):** The web server validates the request (e.g., checks for basic anomalies) and forwards it to the Graphite-Web application.
4. **Django Routing and Authorization:** The Django application routes the request to the appropriate view and verifies the user's authorization to access the requested data and functionality.
5. **Data Query Construction (Sanitized):** The application constructs a query for the Graphite backend. Crucially, user-provided parameters must be sanitized to prevent injection attacks.
6. **Data Retrieval (Internal Network):** The application sends the query to the Graphite backend, ideally over a secure internal network.
7. **Data Processing (Securely Handled):** The Graphite-Web application processes the retrieved data. Ensure sensitive data is handled securely and not exposed unnecessarily.
8. **Rendering (Controlled Resources):** The rendering engine generates the graph image. Resource limits should be in place to prevent DoS.
9. **Response Generation (Secure Headers):** The Django application generates an HTTP response containing the graph image, including appropriate security headers (e.g., Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options).
10. **Web Server Delivery (HTTPS):** The web server sends the HTTPS response back to the user's browser.
11. **Browser Rendering (Sandboxed):** The browser renders the graph within its security sandbox.
