Here's an updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving Graphite-Web, focusing on high and critical severity risks:

*   **Attack Surface:** Graphite Query Language (GraphiteQL) Injection
    *   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code or commands within GraphiteQL queries to extract sensitive information, cause denial-of-service, or potentially execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **How Graphite-Web Contributes:** Graphite-Web provides the interface (web UI and API) for users to submit GraphiteQL queries. If these queries are not properly sanitized and validated, they can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** A malicious query like `target=seriesByTag('name=*;secret=...')` could be used to attempt to retrieve metrics with a sensitive tag. A more complex query could potentially overload the rendering engine.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, denial-of-service, potential for remote code execution if vulnerabilities exist in the query parsing or execution logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user-provided input used in GraphiteQL queries, both in the web UI and API endpoints.
        *   **Parameterized Queries (if applicable):** While not a traditional database, explore if mechanisms exist to parameterize query components to prevent injection.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Run Graphite-Web with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of a successful attack.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the query parsing and execution logic.

*   **Attack Surface:** Unauthenticated Access to Sensitive API Endpoints
    *   **Description:**  Critical API endpoints that should require authentication are accessible without proper authorization, allowing attackers to retrieve sensitive data or perform unauthorized actions.
    *   **How Graphite-Web Contributes:** Graphite-Web exposes various API endpoints for data retrieval, rendering, and management. If authentication and authorization are not correctly implemented or enforced on these endpoints, they become vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could potentially access the `/render` API endpoint without authentication to retrieve metric data or graph images.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to system information, potential for manipulation of monitoring data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enforce Authentication:** Ensure all sensitive API endpoints require proper authentication (e.g., using API keys, session cookies, or other authentication mechanisms).
        *   **Authorization Checks:** Implement robust authorization checks to ensure authenticated users only have access to the resources they are permitted to access.
        *   **Review Default Configurations:**  Carefully review default configurations to ensure authentication is enabled and properly configured for all sensitive endpoints.

*   **Attack Surface:** Use of Default Credentials
    *   **Description:**  The application is deployed with default usernames and passwords that are publicly known, allowing attackers to easily gain administrative access.
    *   **How Graphite-Web Contributes:** Graphite-Web might have default administrative accounts or credentials that are not changed during initial setup.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could attempt to log in with common default credentials like "admin:admin" or similar.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Graphite-Web instance, including access to all monitoring data and potential control over the server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mandatory Password Change:** Force users to change default credentials upon initial login or deployment.
        *   **Secure Credential Management:**  Implement secure practices for storing and managing user credentials.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Periodically check for the presence of default or weak credentials.

*   **Attack Surface:** Path Traversal Vulnerabilities in File Handling
    *   **Description:** Attackers exploit flaws in how Graphite-Web handles file paths to access files and directories outside of the intended webroot.
    *   **How Graphite-Web Contributes:**  If Graphite-Web has functionalities that involve accessing or serving files based on user input (e.g., loading custom dashboards, accessing static assets), vulnerabilities in path handling can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could craft a request like `/render/?_=%252E%252E%252F%252E%252E%252Fetc%252Fpasswd#39;` to attempt to access the system's password file.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive configuration files, source code, or other system files.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure File Handling:**  Avoid directly using user-provided input in file paths. Use canonicalization and validation to ensure paths are within the expected boundaries.
        *   **Chroot Environments:**  Run Graphite-Web in a chroot environment to restrict its access to the file system.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the web server user running Graphite-Web has minimal necessary file system permissions.
