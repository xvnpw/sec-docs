    end
    subgraph "Graphite-Web Application"
        WEB("Web Interface (Django)")
        APP("Graphite-Web Application Logic")
    end

    WEB -- "Internal API Calls" --> APP
    APP -- "Backend Queries" --> CARBON
    APP -- "Data Retrieval" --> WHISPER
    APP -- "Database Access" --> DB
    CARBON -- "Data Writes" --> WHISPER
```

**Components:**

*   **User:** An individual or automated system interacting with the Graphite-Web interface via a web browser or API calls.
*   **Web Interface (Django):** The front-end component, built using the Django web framework, responsible for:
    *   Presenting the user interface.
    *   Handling user authentication and session management.
    *   Receiving and validating user input.
    *   Making asynchronous requests to the Application Logic.
    *   Rendering visualizations based on data received.
*   **Graphite-Web Application Logic:** The core Python application that:
    *   Receives and processes requests from the Web Interface.
    *   Enforces authentication and authorization policies.
    *   Parses user queries and translates them into backend requests.
    *   Queries Carbon for metric metadata (e.g., available metrics, tags).
    *   Queries Whisper for time-series data.
    *   Formats and prepares data for rendering by the Web Interface.
    *   Manages dashboard definitions and user preferences (if a database is used).
*   **Carbon (Data Ingestion):** A separate suite of services responsible for receiving, processing, and storing time-series data. Graphite-Web interacts with Carbon primarily for metadata retrieval and, in some configurations, for querying cached data.
*   **Whisper (Data Storage):** The time-series database component where metric data is persistently stored in a fixed-size database format. Graphite-Web queries Whisper to retrieve the raw data necessary for graph generation.
*   **Database (Optional - for User Management/Configuration):** A relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) used to store:
    *   User accounts and associated credentials.
    *   User roles and permissions.
    *   Dashboard definitions and sharing configurations.
    *   Other persistent settings for Graphite-Web.

## 5. Data Flow

The typical data flow for displaying a graph in Graphite-Web, highlighting security considerations, is as follows:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph "User"
        U("User")
    end
    subgraph "Graphite-Web"
        WEB("Web Interface")
        APP("Application Logic")
    end
    subgraph "Graphite Backend"
        CARBON("Carbon")
        WHISPER("Whisper")
    end

    U -- "1. Authenticated HTTPS Graph Request" --> WEB
    WEB -- "2. Validated API Request" --> APP
    APP -- "3. Authorized Metadata Query" --> CARBON
    APP -- "4. Authorized Data Retrieval Request" --> WHISPER
    WHISPER -- "5. Returns Requested Time-Series Data" --> APP
    APP -- "6. Formats Data, Sanitizes Output" --> WEB
    WEB -- "7. Renders Graph in User's Browser" --> U
```

**Detailed Steps with Security Focus:**

1. **Authenticated HTTPS Graph Request:** The user, after successful authentication, sends a request for a graph over HTTPS. This ensures confidentiality and integrity of the request.
2. **Validated API Request:** The Web Interface validates the request format and parameters before forwarding it to the Application Logic. This helps prevent malformed requests.
3. **Authorized Metadata Query:** The Application Logic, after verifying the user's authorization to access the requested metrics, queries Carbon for metadata. Access control policies are enforced here.
4. **Authorized Data Retrieval Request:** The Application Logic, again verifying authorization, requests the actual time-series data from Whisper.
5. **Returns Requested Time-Series Data:** Whisper retrieves the data and returns it to the Application Logic. Access to Whisper files should be restricted at the operating system level.
6. **Formats Data, Sanitizes Output:** The Application Logic formats the retrieved data and sanitizes it to prevent potential XSS vulnerabilities before sending it to the Web Interface.
7. **Renders Graph in User's Browser:** The Web Interface renders the graph using JavaScript. Client-side security measures (e.g., Content Security Policy) can further mitigate XSS risks.

## 6. Deployment Architecture

Graphite-Web can be deployed in various configurations, each with its own security implications:

*   **Single Server Deployment:** All components reside on a single server.
    *   **Security Considerations:** Increased attack surface on a single host. Compromise of the server grants access to all components. Proper firewalling and OS-level security are crucial.
*   **Distributed Deployment:** Components are deployed on separate servers.
    *   **Security Considerations:** Requires secure communication channels between components. Network segmentation and firewalls are essential. Authentication and authorization between services need to be robust.
*   **Cloud-Based Deployment:** Leveraging cloud services like AWS, Azure, or GCP.
    *   **Security Considerations:** Relies on the security of the cloud provider's infrastructure. Proper configuration of cloud security services (e.g., security groups, IAM roles) is critical.
*   **Containerized Deployment (Docker, Kubernetes):** Components are packaged in containers and orchestrated.
    *   **Security Considerations:** Container image security and vulnerability scanning are important. Secure configuration of the container orchestration platform is crucial. Network policies can control inter-container communication.

## 7. Key Technologies

*   **Charting Libraries:** Flot, Rickshaw, Chart.js, etc.
*   **Database (Optional):** PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite (requires secure configuration)

## 8. Security Considerations (Expanded)

This section expands on the initial security considerations, providing more specific examples:

*   **Authentication and Authorization:**
    *   **Threats:** Brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, session hijacking, authorization bypass.
    *   **Mitigations:** Strong password policies, multi-factor authentication (if supported), secure session management (HTTPS, secure cookies), role-based access control, regular security audits.
*   **Input Validation:**
    *   **Threats:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection (if database is used), Graphite function injection.
    *   **Mitigations:** Server-side input validation and sanitization, parameterized queries for database interactions, escaping output before rendering in the web interface, using a Content Security Policy (CSP).
*   **Session Management:**
    *   **Threats:** Session fixation, session hijacking.
    *   **Mitigations:** Using HTTPS, setting secure and HttpOnly flags on session cookies, regenerating session IDs after login, implementing session timeouts.
*   **Data Security (Whisper):**
    *   **Threats:** Unauthorized access to metric data, data tampering.
    *   **Mitigations:** Restricting file system permissions on Whisper data directories, encryption at rest (if supported by the underlying infrastructure), regular backups.
*   **Communication Security:**
    *   **Threats:** Man-in-the-middle attacks, eavesdropping.
    *   **Mitigations:** Enforcing HTTPS for all communication with the web interface, considering TLS for inter-component communication within the Graphite suite.
*   **Dependency Management:**
    *   **Threats:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
    *   **Mitigations:** Regularly updating dependencies, using vulnerability scanning tools.
*   **Access Control to Backend Components (Carbon, Whisper):**
    *   **Threats:** Unauthorized data injection, data modification, data deletion.
    *   **Mitigations:** Firewall rules to restrict access to Carbon and Whisper ports, authentication and authorization for inter-component communication (if available).
*   **Configuration Management:**
    *   **Threats:** Exposure of sensitive configuration details (e.g., database credentials).
    *   **Mitigations:** Storing configuration files securely, using environment variables or dedicated secret management tools for sensitive information.
