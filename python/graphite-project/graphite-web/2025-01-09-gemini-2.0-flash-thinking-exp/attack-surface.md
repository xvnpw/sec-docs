# Attack Surface Analysis for graphite-project/graphite-web

## Attack Surface: [Metric Name Injection](./attack_surfaces/metric_name_injection.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious code or special characters into metric names, potentially leading to command injection, data manipulation, or denial of service.

**Graphite-Web Contribution:** Graphite-Web directly uses user-provided metric names in queries to the backend (Whisper). Lack of proper sanitization allows malicious strings to be passed through.

**Example:**  A user crafts a URL like `/render?target=my.metric%3B$(rm%20-rf%20/tmp/*)` where the metric name includes a command to delete files.

**Impact:**  Potentially critical, leading to remote command execution on the Graphite-Web server or the underlying data store.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all user-provided metric names.
*   Use allow-lists for allowed characters in metric names rather than block-lists.
*   Avoid directly executing user-provided metric names as commands.

## Attack Surface: [Function Parameter Injection](./attack_surfaces/function_parameter_injection.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious code or unexpected values into the parameters of Graphite functions within queries.

**Graphite-Web Contribution:** Graphite-Web's query language allows users to specify functions with parameters. If these parameters are not properly validated, attackers can manipulate backend behavior.

**Example:** A crafted query like `/render?target=alias(scaleToSeconds(my.metric,${malicious_code}),'My%20Metric')` could inject code into the `alias` function's name.

**Impact:**  Can range from medium (unexpected data manipulation) to high (potential for code injection depending on the function and backend processing).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all function parameters.
*   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements where applicable in backend processing.
*   Carefully review and restrict the use of functions that accept arbitrary string inputs.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Annotations](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_annotations.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into annotations, which are then executed in the browsers of other users viewing those annotations.

**Graphite-Web Contribution:** Graphite-Web allows users to create and display annotations. If the annotation content is not properly sanitized before rendering, it becomes vulnerable to XSS.

**Example:** An attacker creates an annotation with the content `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`. When another user views the graph with this annotation, the script executes in their browser.

**Impact:** Medium to high, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the Graphite-Web interface for other users.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement proper output encoding (escaping) of annotation content before rendering it in the browser.
*   Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Communication with Carbon](./attack_surfaces/insecure_communication_with_carbon.md)

**Description:** If the communication channel between Graphite-Web and Carbon (the metric data receiver) is not secured, attackers could potentially inject or intercept metric data.

**Graphite-Web Contribution:** Graphite-Web relies on communication with Carbon to retrieve metric data. If this communication is over unencrypted channels, it's vulnerable.

**Example:** An attacker on the same network could potentially intercept metric data being sent from Carbon to Graphite-Web if no encryption is used.

**Impact:** High, potentially leading to data manipulation or unauthorized access to sensitive metric data.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure that communication between Graphite-Web and Carbon is encrypted using TLS/SSL.
*   Implement authentication mechanisms to verify the identity of both Graphite-Web and Carbon.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Information through Configuration Files](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_information_through_configuration_files.md)

**Description:**  Configuration files containing sensitive information like database credentials or API keys are exposed due to misconfiguration.

**Graphite-Web Contribution:** Graphite-Web stores configuration details in files. If these files are improperly secured or accessible via the webserver, attackers can retrieve them.

**Example:**  A misconfigured web server allows direct access to `local_settings.py` containing database passwords.

**Impact:** Critical, leading to full compromise of the Graphite infrastructure and potentially other connected systems.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Store sensitive configuration information securely, preferably using environment variables or dedicated secrets management solutions.
*   Ensure that configuration files are not directly accessible through the web server by configuring appropriate access controls.
*   Regularly review and update security configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Rendering Libraries](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_rendering_libraries.md)

**Description:** Security vulnerabilities in the libraries used by Graphite-Web for rendering graphs could be exploited.

**Graphite-Web Contribution:** Graphite-Web utilizes libraries to generate visual representations of data. If these libraries have known vulnerabilities, Graphite-Web inherits those risks.

**Example:** A vulnerability in a charting library could allow an attacker to craft a specific request that triggers a buffer overflow, potentially leading to remote code execution.

**Impact:** High to critical, potentially leading to denial of service or remote code execution on the Graphite-Web server.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep all rendering libraries and dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
*   Regularly monitor security advisories for vulnerabilities in the used libraries.
*   Consider using sandboxing or other isolation techniques for the rendering process.
