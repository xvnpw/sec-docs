# Threat Model Analysis for graphite-project/graphite-web

## Threat: [Graphite Query Language Injection](./threats/graphite_query_language_injection.md)

**Description:**
*   An attacker crafts malicious Graphite query language expressions (e.g., within URL parameters or API requests).
*   Graphite-Web fails to properly sanitize or validate these expressions.
*   The malicious query is then processed, potentially leading to unintended data retrieval or manipulation.

**Impact:**
*   Unauthorized access to sensitive metric data.
*   Potential for denial of service by crafting resource-intensive queries.
*   In some cases, could potentially be leveraged to exploit vulnerabilities in the backend data store (Carbon).

**Affected Component:**
*   `webapp/graphite/render/views.py` (functions handling rendering requests).
*   `webapp/graphite/finders/functions.py` (functions parsing and executing query language).
*   API endpoints that accept Graphite query parameters.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all user-supplied data used in Graphite query construction.
*   Consider using a query parser that enforces a strict syntax and prevents the execution of potentially harmful constructs.
*   Apply the principle of least privilege to data access, ensuring users can only query metrics they are authorized to view.

## Threat: [Excessive Data Retrieval Leading to Resource Exhaustion](./threats/excessive_data_retrieval_leading_to_resource_exhaustion.md)

**Description:**
*   An attacker crafts queries that request extremely large datasets or time ranges.
*   Graphite-Web attempts to process and render this data, leading to high CPU and memory usage.
*   This can overload the Graphite-Web server and potentially the backend Carbon servers.

**Impact:**
*   Denial of service for legitimate users.
*   Slow response times for all users.
*   Potential for server crashes.

**Affected Component:**
*   `webapp/graphite/render/views.py` (functions handling rendering requests).
*   Code responsible for fetching data from Carbon.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement limits on the amount of data that can be retrieved in a single query (e.g., maximum time range, maximum number of data points).
*   Implement query timeouts to prevent long-running queries from consuming resources indefinitely.
*   Consider using caching mechanisms to reduce the load on the backend.
*   Monitor resource usage and implement alerting for unusual activity.

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass or Weaknesses](./threats/authentication_bypass_or_weaknesses.md)

**Description:**
*   Vulnerabilities in Graphite-Web's authentication mechanisms (if enabled) allow attackers to bypass authentication or exploit weaknesses in the implementation.
*   This could include default credentials, insecure session management, or flaws in authentication logic.

**Impact:**
*   Unauthorized access to Graphite-Web's interface and data.
*   Ability to view sensitive metrics and potentially modify configurations (if allowed).

**Affected Component:**
*   Authentication middleware or modules (e.g., `webapp/graphite/account/views.py` if user accounts are enabled).
*   Session management components.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enforce strong password policies if user accounts are enabled.
*   Implement secure session management practices (e.g., using secure and HttpOnly cookies).
*   Regularly review and audit the authentication code for vulnerabilities.
*   Consider using established and well-vetted authentication libraries.
*   Disable default accounts or change default credentials immediately upon deployment.

## Threat: [Authorization Bypass](./threats/authorization_bypass.md)

**Description:**
*   Vulnerabilities in Graphite-Web's authorization logic allow users to access data or perform actions they are not permitted to.
*   This could occur if authorization checks are missing or incorrectly implemented.

**Impact:**
*   Unauthorized access to sensitive metric data.
*   Potential for unauthorized modification of configurations or other actions.

**Affected Component:**
*   Authorization middleware or modules.
*   View functions and API endpoints that should enforce access controls.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement a robust authorization model based on the principle of least privilege.
*   Ensure that authorization checks are performed consistently across all relevant parts of the application.
*   Regularly review and audit the authorization logic.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_configuration_data.md)

**Description:**
*   Configuration files containing sensitive information (e.g., database credentials, API keys) are unintentionally exposed.
*   This could occur due to misconfigured web server settings or vulnerabilities in file handling *within Graphite-Web's serving mechanism*.

**Impact:**
*   Compromise of backend systems if database credentials are exposed.
*   Unauthorized access to external services if API keys are leaked.

**Affected Component:**
*   Web server configuration *as it relates to serving Graphite-Web's files*.
*   File serving mechanisms *within Graphite-Web*.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Store sensitive configuration data securely (e.g., using environment variables or dedicated secrets management tools).
*   Ensure that configuration files are not publicly accessible through the web server *configuration serving Graphite-Web*.
*   Regularly review web server configurations.
