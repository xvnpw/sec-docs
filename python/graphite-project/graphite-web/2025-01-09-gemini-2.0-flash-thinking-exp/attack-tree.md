## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Exploiting Data Handling Vulnerabilities (XSS)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_exploiting_data_handling_vulnerabilities__xss_.md)

**Description:** This path focuses on injecting malicious data into Graphite metrics that is then rendered by Graphite-Web without proper sanitization, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **Critical Node within Path:**
    *   **[CRITICAL] Exploit Insecure Data Sanitization in Graphite-Web Rendering:**
        *   Goal: Execute arbitrary code in the browser of users viewing the malicious data.
        *   Attack: Craft metric names or values containing malicious JavaScript or HTML.
        *   Insight: Graphite-Web might not adequately sanitize data before rendering it in charts or dashboards.
        *   Mitigation: Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding in Graphite-Web's rendering logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Exploiting API Authentication/Authorization](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_exploiting_api_authenticationauthorization.md)

**Description:** This path targets weaknesses in the authentication and authorization mechanisms of the Graphite-Web API, allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access.
*   **Critical Node within Path:**
    *   **[CRITICAL] Exploit Missing or Weak Authentication on API Endpoints:**
        *   Goal: Access sensitive API endpoints without proper credentials.
        *   Attack: Identify and access API endpoints that lack authentication or use weak, easily bypassable authentication methods.
        *   Insight: Not all API endpoints might be adequately protected.
        *   Mitigation: Enforce strong authentication and authorization on all API endpoints. Follow the principle of least privilege.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 3: Exploiting Configuration and Deployment Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3_exploiting_configuration_and_deployment_weaknesses.md)

**Description:** This path involves exploiting vulnerabilities in how Graphite-Web is configured and deployed, potentially exposing sensitive information or allowing unauthorized access.
*   **Critical Nodes within Path:**
    *   **[CRITICAL] Access Sensitive Configuration Files:**
        *   Goal: Obtain access to Graphite-Web's configuration files containing sensitive information like database credentials or secret keys.
        *   Attack: Exploit path traversal vulnerabilities or misconfigured web server settings to access configuration files.
        *   Insight: Improper file permissions or web server configuration can expose sensitive files.
        *   Mitigation: Ensure proper file permissions on configuration files and restrict web server access to only necessary files. Avoid storing sensitive information in plaintext in configuration files (use environment variables or secrets management).
    *   **[CRITICAL] Exploit Default or Weak Credentials:**
        *   Goal: Gain administrative access using default or easily guessable credentials.
        *   Attack: Attempt to log in with default credentials or common passwords.
        *   Insight: Users might fail to change default credentials.
        *   Mitigation: Enforce strong password policies and require users to change default credentials upon initial setup.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 4: Leveraging Vulnerable Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_4_leveraging_vulnerable_dependencies.md)

**Description:** This path focuses on exploiting known security vulnerabilities in the third-party Python libraries that Graphite-Web relies on.
*   **Critical Node within Path:**
    *   **[CRITICAL] Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Python Libraries:**
        *   Goal: Execute arbitrary code or cause denial of service by exploiting vulnerabilities in the Python libraries used by Graphite-Web.
        *   Attack: Identify and exploit known vulnerabilities in dependencies like Django, Twisted, or other used libraries.
        *   Insight: Outdated or vulnerable dependencies can introduce security risks.
        *   Mitigation: Regularly update all dependencies to their latest stable versions. Implement dependency scanning and vulnerability management practices.
